ICE ISN'T SO THIN FOR DUCKS

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It took the Anaheim Mighty Ducks two years to
get back to the Stanley Cup playoffs and now, after only three
games, they are one loss away from elimination.
</P>
<P>
   But the the Ducks weren't looking for any sympathy at Disney Ice
on Monday even though they head into tonight's Game 4 trailing the
Detroit Red Wings 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not frustrated,'' forward Paul Kariya said. ``There is no
sense getting down. There are a lot worse things going on in the
world then losing a hockey game. You have to keep things in
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, tragedies such as those in Kosovo and at Columbine High
School have a way of putting even the playoffs in their proper
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching the Columbine High School thing for five
days now,'' said Guy Hebert. ``It (hockey) is our job, but at the
end of the day I went home and kissed my wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of bad things happening in the world. I may
have had a bad day, but I'm fine and my family is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks are in a seemingly impossible hole _ the New York
Islanders were the last team to rally from a 3-0 series deficit, in
the second round of the 1975 playoffs against Pittsburgh _ but
Hebert insists he's having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you before the season that I was going to play every
day, go home and come back the next day with a smile on my face,''
he said. ``I see no reason to change that now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the playoffs) are what you play for and that's why I'm
still excited to play tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks would love to make at least one more trip to Detroit
(for Game 5 on Thursday), especially since it would mean that they
snapped the Red Wings' playoff winning streak against them at seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it tough on Detroit,'' Ducks coach Craig
Hartsburg said. ``We can't be down, we want to show some pride and
make it as hard as we can. There are only two things we can control
_ our attitude and work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   The longer the Ducks hang around, the more valuable playoff
experience they gain, to say nothing of some confidence heading
into next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would give us a sense of accomplishment,'' Kariya said.
``That we've gotten better and learned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a great season to this point and we want to try and
finish it off right,'' Hebert said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Grimson grounded: The Ducks will be without Stu Grimson, who
was suspended for one game by the NHL for his cross-check on Kris
Draper on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Salei to try: Ruslan Salei said he hopes to play despite a
right- shoulder injury that limited him to less than six minutes on
the ice Sunday. The young defenseman said he has something to
prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to come back and prove to myself and the coach that I
can play better than the first two games,'' he said. ``I want to
come back and play the way I did the whole season.''

<P>
   CICERO, Ill. _ This is the place that welcomed Al Capone, along
with his bootlegging, betting parlors and bordellos, after Chicago
gave him the boot.
</P>
<P>
   It is the place where federal investigators have had their hands
full, looking into accusations of sweetheart deals, misuse of
municipal money and police corruption.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the place where the husband of the town president
pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges and acknowledged being
a bookmaker for the mob.
</P>
<P>
   Now, without an ounce of irony, Cicero has an idea for tackling
organized crime of a different sort. This working-class town of
70,000 just southwest of Chicago is drafting an ordinance that
would evict all gang members _ and punish them if they returned,
even to visit their families.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the first gang-eviction law in the country, and if,
as expected, it is passed by the town board on April 27, it might
be only a matter of time before it faces a legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds you of the Wild West,'' said Jay Miller, executive
director of the Chicago chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union. ``It's like a bumper sticker: Gang-Free City. It sounds
wonderful. But where do they go? Are they going to send them all to
New York?''
</P>
<P>
   While Cicero's proposal is severe, it is just the latest in a
spate of anti-gang ordinances cropping up nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, Los Angeles, San Jose and other California
communities have made it illegal for people identified as gang
members to congregate on certain streets. In some cases, they are
barred from whistling, making gang hand signals or carrying
bottles, baseball bats or flashlights in these areas.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is considering a similar approach. And Chicago
instituted an anti-loitering law authorizing arrests of suspected
gang members who defy police orders to leave a street.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the San Jose law and is reviewing
the Chicago law, which resulted in tens of thousands of arrests in
the three years before it was declared unconstitutional by an
Illinois court in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero officials say they have a list of 600 ``known gang
members,'' including some minors, who would have 60 days to get out
of town. Officials say some on the list have been convicted of
violent assaults and weapons charges, while others are simply
``self-admitted gang members,'' having told the police under
questioning that they belonged to a gang. Those on the list, which
has not been made public, are not serving jail sentences, officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero officials say their gang problem has increased in recent
years. The town said gangs were responsible for a drive-by shooting
in 1995 in which a young girl was killed, and another in 1996. Last
year, there were 64 shootings and 15 homicides, Bernard Harrison,
the deputy police superintendent, said. This year, there have been
24 shootings and 2 homicides. Harrison said all of the shootings
and most of the homicides had been gang-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ACLU says gang members have rights,'' said the town
president, Betty Loren-Maltese. ``How about our civil rights? That
we cannot live in a peaceful community.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent driving tour of the town, she pointed out gang
houses and graffiti and told stories about gang members: the one
whose legs were broken when he was run over by a rival, the day one
gang dynamited another gang's house (``Unfortunately, nobody got
hurt,'' she said), and the gang member who was shot in the
testicles. Pointing out her own bungalow, she said a gang member
lives on her street, a teen-ager who, among other things, threw a
cherry bomb at her car and tried to set roofs on fire with
fireworks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say Cicero's proposal is in questionable
constitutional territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a problem of punishing people for their status as a
gang member,'' said Mark Tushnet, a constitutional law professor at
Georgetown University. ``You can punish people for what they do,
but you can't punish people for what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, if Cicero banished people who had completed
criminal sentences, it could be accused of punishing people twice
for the same crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cities would love to be able to say, `We don't want child
molesters released back in our community,''' said Erwin
Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor at the University of
Southern California. ``But they can't. And what if every city
adopted that? Does that mean they wouldn't be allowed to go every
place?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loren-Maltese, a blunt-spoken Republican, said that was not
her problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry if they go to Berwyn or Oak Park or Chicago,''
said Ms. Loren-Maltese, who has been president since 1993 and once
proposed making gang members wear pink aprons and clean up
graffiti, an idea that went nowhere. ``My concern is to protect the
people of Cicero.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The people of Cicero would seem to approve, overwhelmingly
voting for a nonbinding referendum on the gang-free proposal this
month.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of Cicero's Hispanic population, which has
mushroomed in the last two decades and transformed an enclave with
no Hispanic residents into a town that is about half Hispanic, fear
the ordinance might single out Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   While many Hispanic residents apparently voted for the
referendum, Hispanic leaders say those results are deceptive.
Dolores Ponce de Leon, a community organizer for a group called the
Interfaith Leadership Project, said the ballot question was so
broad that many people had interpreted it as saying, `` `Vote yes
if you are against the gangs.' Well, who's going to vote against
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Now that they better understand the proposal _ and that about
three-quarters of the gang list is Hispanic names _ some Latinos
are worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an injustice to the Latino families,'' said Delia
Barajas, an Interfaith Leadership Project member with six children,
including two teen-agers. ``We would like something done with the
gangs, but we want more prevention, intervention. ''
</P>
<P>
   Latinos have been irked by other policies of Ms. Loren-Maltese's
administration, including efforts to force a bank with many
Mexican-American customers to take down a Mexican flag. They
complain that she is not committed to hiring Hispanic police
officers and say she supported a police practice of reporting
suspected illegal immigrants to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loren-Maltese says her policies are not discriminatory,
points to Hispanic employees she appointed to town jobs and says
her critics are simply political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, accusations of discrimination are a thorn for Cicero,
once such a symbol of racism that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. called it the Selma of the North.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero has also drawn the attention of federal investigators,
with allegations including irregularities in towing practices and
unorthodox payments to municipal contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loren-Maltese denies allegations of government corruption.
She has made accusations of police misconduct, and has purged
nearly a third of the police force.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loren-Maltese said the gang ordinance might give suspected
gang members a banishment hearing and the right to appeal. If those
evicted came back to town, they would be fined, charged and have
their vehicles confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how a 10-square-mile town with roughly 135 police officers
would enforce such a law, Ms. Loren-Maltese said she might consider
gating neighborhoods and establishing police checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Given that her late husband, Frank Maltese, pleaded guilty to
conspiracy charges in 1991, Ms. Loren-Maltese has been asked
whether the ordinance would apply to people in organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get involved in drive-by shootings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said it would certainly apply to minors, even if their
families stayed in Cicero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of call it tough love, and a parent's got to make that
choice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the driving tour, Ms. Loren-Maltese and Harrison pointed out
buildings they said were hangouts of some of Cicero's 16 active
gangs, including the Latin Kings, the Sin City Boys, the Latin
Angels and the Two Six Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loren-Maltese has tried other tactics, like fining landlords
$500 a day for failing to evict gang tenants. She said the town
planned to file a suit against gangs, seeking reimbursement for
cleaning five-pointed stars, crowns and other gang graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said he believed word of the ordinance had caused three
gang members to leave town.
</P>
<P>
   But a man who identified himself as Pablo, 24, a member of the
Maniac Latin Disciples, scoffed at the idea that gangs could be
banished.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're never going to get rid of gangs,'' said Pablo, perched
on the stoop of his house across from an elementary school. ``They
don't have that much power.''

KNICKS WIN A BIG ONE OVER CHARLOTTE, 91-84 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ All of the adversity the Knicks have weathered
this season may have served as a primer for this playoff push.
After all of the ultimatums and roster unrest they have faced,
little seems to disturb a rhythm that has developed at just the
right time.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were just unflappable enough in a game that may end
up having as much impact on their playoff fate as any other this
season. Needing to create separation and tuck a potential
tie-breaker under their belts, the Knicks carried on without
Patrick Ewing and had just enough cushion to hold off the Charlotte
Hornets, 91-84, Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   They did it with 19 points from Latrell Sprewell _ who hit a
game-sealing bank shot with 47 seconds left _ and seven blocked
shots from Marcus Camby as part of a defensive effort that held the
Hornets' Elden Campbell to just 3-for-14 shooting and 8 points. The
Knicks are 24-21, and their third straight victory put them solidly
in eighth place, a half-game out of seventh, and left them a game
and a half over the ninth-place Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   But the finish did not come without some drama. The Knicks, who
held a 16-point lead with 5 minutes 40 seconds left in the game,
came unglued once Camby went to the bench to rest with 3:50
remaining. Without Camby, the Hornets' David Wesley drove the lane
uninterrupted. After three turnovers by the Knicks, Wesley capped a
17-4 run that left the Hornets within 3, at 84-81, with 1:05 left.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell returned by driving the baseline and banking a jumper
over Bobby Phills, who led the Hornets with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   The suspense over how the Knicks would react after their
dramatic 20-point comeback victory in Miami on Sunday ended in the
first two minutes of the game. Instead of rolling out of bed with a
hangover, they came out as energetic as neon and simply turned the
tables on what the Hornets did to them in this same building on
April 7.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the Knicks' most humiliating moments of the season,
the Hornets took a 29-12 lead in the first quarter in that game and
the night was quickly over for the Knicks. This time, a more
desperate Knicks team came out with crisp ball movement, lively
defense from Patrick Ewing's replacement, Chris Dudley, and led
30-16 after the first quarter and 43-30 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   They knew better than to feel good about their edge. Just last
week, at Madison Square Garden, the Knicks held an 18-point
third-quarter lead against the Hornets, which crumbled to 1 before
Ewing's game-deciding runner with 24.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to protect their halftime lead, the Knicks came out and
maintained the same edginess to their game in the third quarter.
Each time the Hornets threatened to get into this game with a
3-pointer, the Knicks leaned on someone new. In the first quarter,
it was Allan Houston, in the second it was Sprewell, and in the
third, it was Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   After missing his first eight shots, Johnson hit his next three
to sustain the Knicks' double-digit lead in the third quarter.
Meanwhile, Dudley, Kurt Thomas and Camby took turns keeping
Campbell to just 8 points through three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Much more unpredictable without Ewing, the Knicks moved the ball
swiftly and unselfishly until they found the open man in the first
quarter. Charlie Ward sprung open off screens for three 3-pointers,
while the unlikeliest source of points, Dudley, bounded around for
tip-ins and an out-of-character reverse layup for 7 first-half
points.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Coleman effectively took Dudley to the perimeter and
launched a series of jumpers to help pull the Hornets within 8
points in the first three minutes of the second quarter. But the
Knicks, using their defense to pressure the Hornets into 13
first-half turnovers, bounced back on the frenetic shooting of
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   At times, his frantic shooting _ which left him six for 11 in 17
minutes off the bench _ seemed out of step with the selfless nature
of the Knicks. But when Sprewell continued to knock down his
contortionist's shots, no one could have been happier than the
Knicks when his 12 first-half points filled the void left once
Houston got into early foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks knew how fragile cushions could be. And that's
why they played this game like everything could fall apart if they
lost. They knew the weight of this game on the playoff standing and
the pressure they'd be under if they fell out of the final spot
with just five games remaining.

BILL WOULD CURB ONLINE WEAPONS SALES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an aide sitting at a computer clicked through Web sites
showing automatic handguns, assault rifles and other weapons for
sale on the Internet, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York on Monday
urged Congress to enact a law to further regulate the on-line gun
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a Democrat, introduced the bill, the Internet Gun
Trafficking Act of 1999, in March and received little attention.
But on Monday, he said the high school shooting in Littleton,
Colo., had given urgency to the bill, and he hoped it would win
swift support.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication that two students responsible for the
Colorado shooting purchased their guns on-line, but Schumer said he
believed that the Internet offered children the easiest means for
circumventing state and federal gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two glaring loopholes that allow kids and criminals
to get guns,'' Schumer said, ``and those are gun shows and the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts say such shows in states with lax gun laws are of
greater concern for guns being bought and sold outside the law.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's measure would require Web sites dedicated to gun sales
to be maintained by a federally licensed firearms dealer. The sites
would have to be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, and would prohibit the sites from encouraging private
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law was denounced on Monday by gun dealers who said
that nearly all of Schumer's concerns were addressed by existing
laws. Richard Feinberg, a licensed dealer in Norton, Mass., who
operates We Are Guns, one of the Web sites discussed by Schumer on
Monday, said he was required to follow all state and federal laws
for sales by computer and in person.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, interstate gun sales, whether conducted through the
Internet or not, are regulated by the Brady gun control law and
other federal regulations, and intrastate sales are governed by
state and local laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laws are already in place,'' Feinberg said, adding that
the lack of consistent laws nationwide was a more important
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is not really an easy source for guns,'' Feinberg
said. ``The easiest source is a lax state, a state without strict
gun laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see no difference between a gun sold on-line and a gun
sold through a newspaper or magazine advertisement or by mail-order
catalogue. ``It's hard for me to understand why the Internet would
make in essence an illegal transaction easier or harder to do,''
said Eric J. Johnson, the director of the Forum for Electronic
Commerce at the Wharton School of Business, at the University of
Pennsylvania.

BRYANT HAS ROUGH DAY AT OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Kobe Bryant's jumpshot was ailing, his left thigh
throbbing from a week-old injury and his ears nearly chewed through
from a fourth-quarter lecture by his coach.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a painful night for the 20-year-old
star-in-training.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant missed his first 11 field-goal attempts against the
Rockets and was scoreless until hitting a 15-foot jumper with 2:14
left in the third quarter. He finished with nine points _ his
lowest output in the last 24 games _ on 3-of-14 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, he and coach Kurt Rambis exchanged heated
words during a timeout late in the fourth quarter, the game already
far out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis was upset that Bryant strayed from the defensive plan
against Charles Barkley in the low post. Bryant tried to explain
his decision, but that only irritated the coach more. ``Don't do
it,'' Rambis shot back several times, then finally threw up his
hands: ``Fine, you're right. Do whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis wouldn't comment afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I had a feel for the game, as far as how we were gonna
play Charles,'' Bryant told reporters, explaining that Houston was
anticipating the double team and exploiting it. ``(Scottie) Pippen
had a back-door play set up, so I waited.''
</P>
<P>
   And drew Rambis' ire.
</P>
<P>
   As for his horrific shooting, Bryant had no explanation.
However, his thigh, deeply bruised in a collision with Golden
State's Felton Spencer last week, is heavily taped and aching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt,'' he said. ``But I've
played plenty of games like that. It doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   So the shooting line?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just missing (shots),'' he said. ``Just throwing up brick
after brick _ I was building projects out there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ What's the point?: Rambis continues to reserve a final
decision on who will start at point guard in the playoffs, but he
has conceded that rookie Tyronn Lue _ despite some exciting
performances _ will play only a bit role in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher, the current starter, and Derek Harper, the primary
backup, will continue in their present roles, though Harper might
return to the starting lineup. Lue will be ``a speciality guy,''
Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure at some point in time, he's gonna be a very good
guard in this league, but he still has a lot to learn,'' he said.
``You feel a lot more comfortable (with veterans).''

NO MATTER WHAT, GLAUS CAN'T WIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Troy Glaus for AL Rookie of the Year? Not
going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Glaus' hot start, he won't become the Anaheim Angels'
second Rookie of the Year because he played too much last season.
Glaus had 165 at-bats in 1998, exceeding the 130 at-bat limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured that would come up at some point,'' Glaus, 22, said
of his nonrookie status. ``You don't play the game for rewards, and
I don't either. I play the game to win games. Having too many
at-bats to be eligible doesn't even bother me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be acknowledged for your accomplishments, but I
would give up that for a championship in a heartbeat. I'd rather be
known as a champion than a Rookie of the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Monday's game, Glaus ranked among the league leaders
in five categories, including first in doubles (12) and extra-base
hits (15).
</P>
<P>
   The only Angels Rookie of the Year was Tim Salmon in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mo at DH: Mo Vaughn started at designated hitter for the
fourth game since being removed from the disabled list April 22.
Angels manager Terry Collins said there is no timetable to get
Vaughn back to first base because there is no reason to put any
extra strain on his sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who thinks you can put anybody at first base, you're
kidding yourself,'' Collins said. ``There's a lot to do over there.
What about stopping and starting, bunt plays, going over to the
tarp in foul territory to catch a popup? Outside of the catcher,
they handle the ball more than anybody on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Monday's game, Vaughn was hitting .273 (3 for 11)
since returning from the DL.
</P>
<P>
   __ Big stretch: The Angels began a homestand Monday night that
actually is going to be longer than three games. Their first two
homestands consisted of one three-game series each.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Angels get a chance to get comfortable at home, playing
eight games _ four against the Blue Jays and four against the White
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting to see how we react to that,'' Collins
said. ``You're comfortable here. You're used to the field so you
see the ball better. And most of the time you have people rooting
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Also: Salmon stands a good chance at being named the A.L.
Player of the Month for April. Going into Monday's game, he was
tied for seventh in the league in batting average (.373), tied for
third in homers (6) and second in RBIs (20). He also ranked among
the league's top 10 in seven other offensive categories. . . . Jeff
Huson started in place of Andy Sheets at shortstop Monday, and Todd
Green got the start in left field. . . . The Angels' magic number
this year so far is 4. When they score 4 or more runs, they're 7-3.
When they score 3 or fewer, they're 0-8.

REPORT SHOWS MOST CHILD ASTHMA PATIENTS DON'T MANAGE THEIR ILLNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whether they awake gasping or simply too out of
breath to play, more than eight in 10 children surveyed suffer from
insufficient treatment for asthma, a report released Monday says.
</P>
<P>
   The study focusing on the Valley children is of special interest
in Los Angeles, which Asthma in America deemed the nation's asthma
capital because the illness sends more children to emergency rooms
here than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view it as a major problem,'' said Johanna Goldberg, vice
president for programs at the American Lung Association, Los
Angeles County, where about 336,000 children have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with a lot of children,'' she said, ``and the
key to asthma is ongoing management.''
</P>
<P>
   Such management is lacking among low-income children, according
to the study, which found 84 percent of the asthmatic children
surveyed often felt the effects of their condition _ either waking
up coughing twice in a month, feeling other symptoms twice in a
week or being unable to do some activity because of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more that needs to be done for these patients,''
said researcher Eileen Yamada, a doctor with the state Health
Services Department. She and her team of researchers presented
their study Monday at the Lung Association's annual conference in
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure the patients are adequately educated to
control their asthma,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The children in the study aren't getting treated as often as
they need to control their asthma, Yamada said, because of a range
of factors including lack of education and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people do have other priorities and other problems in
their life,'' Yamada said. ``These other issues need to be
addressed, also. I wish there were one thing we could pin down to
change everything.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, a child may have an inhaler at home to dispense
medication when he needs it, but his family may not be able to
afford the $40 to buy an extra for school, Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a problem during the school day, it's an
emergency,'' she said. Instead of needing only the inhaler, the
child may need paramedics and a trip to the hospital after an
attack hits.
</P>
<P>
   To help avert such incidents, the American Lung Association
offers several in-school programs to help asthmatic children in
particular understand and take responsibility for their condition.
</P>
<P>
   Free programs for school staff, parents and students in grades
3-5 teach about the disease and how to manage it. In addition, the
students are told the disease isn't contagious, so they shouldn't
shun asthmatic classmates, and are taught what they should do in an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The key, though, is teaching the kids with asthma how to manage
their condition _ being aware of symptoms, knowing when they
shouldn't exert themselves, why they take their medication and what
the illness does to them. They're also shown how staying on top of
their condition and medication can keep at bay the wheezing,
coughing and shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
   Yamada's study surveyed 87 children age 3 to 12 from July 1997
to June 1998. The researchers picked children who had made at least
one emergency-room trip because of asthma in the previous year, and
who had a smoker in their house.
</P>
<P>
   The disease affects 14.6 million people in the country, and is
the primary cause of school absences for chronic conditions, as
opposed to temporary ailments, such as colds, Goldberg said. More
than 5,600 people die from the disease every year, and one-third of
asthma patients are younger than 18, the Lung Association says.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldberg noted, ``kids whose asthma is well-managed can do
pretty much what any kid can do.''

HURRICANES BEAT BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
 HKN-BRUINS-HURRICANES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Uh oh.
</P>
<P>
   No one thought it was going to be an easy series. No one thought
it was going to be a short series. No one thought it was going to
be a one-sided series. It's not time to panic, but Bruins have to
be concerned about their situation. It's not grave but it sure
isn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Kovalenko was credited with the go-ahead goal at 2:54 of
the third period Monday night and the Bruins wound up falling, 3-2,
to the Carolina Hurricanes in Game 3 of this Eastern Conference
quarterfinal. The Hurricanes have won two in a row and lead the
best-of-seven series, two games to one.
</P>
<P>
   Boston continues to struggle at home in the postseason. Since
1994, the Bruins are 2-12 at home in the playoffs and have lost
four straight.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding goal wasn't spectacular by any means. Fluky is a
much better description. Robert Kron, behind the net, threw the
puck out and it appeared to bank off goalie Byron Dafoe into the
cage. The play was reviewed because Kovalenko was in the crease,
but the puck was in there and under Dafoe before Kovalenko even
went in. It didn't appear that Kovalenko was even a factor in the
goal, though Bruins defenseman Darren Van Impe, who drilled
Kovalenko and sent him down on all fours, said the puck might have
gone off Kovalenko's skate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was coming out in front of the net,'' said Van Impe. ``I
just got my stick into him and he fell. (Kron) must have passed the
puck out and it hit him and went in the net. That's all I saw. The
puck was in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of nonfactors, on the Bruins' side of things Dmitri
Khristich continues to be invisible. Pat Burns used him for only
nine shifts (7 minutes 21 seconds of ice time through 40 minutes)
and only 2:16 over three shifts in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to be better, there's no two ways about that,'' said
Burns. ``He has to elevate his game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins dug themselves a hole early, falling behind just over
a minute into the game. Jeff O'Neill fired a shot from in tight
that Dafoe saved. But Gary Roberts was there for the rebound, and
his shot went off the goalie and into the net at 1:05. It was the
fastest playoff goal in Carolina/Hartford franchise history,
beating by one second Dean Evason's score for the Whalers against
Quebec in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:48, the Bruins finally broke through, at even strength, on
Sergei Samsonov's second playoff goal. Landon Wilson drove
defenseman Dave Karpa into the boards with a thunderous check,
opening room for Joe Thornton, along the right boards, to find
Samsonov skating down the left circle. He fired the puck past
Arturs Irbe to pull the Bruins even, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, the Bruins took the lead on the power play. They
had been 0 for 5 on the man advantage heading into the game and
went 0-2 in the first period despite moving the puck well.
</P>
<P>
   It was Anson Carter who finally cashed in, at 13:07. Ray Bourque
dished the puck across to the left point for Jason Allison, who
blasted a one-timer. Carter, who had been battling for position in
front of the net with defenseman Steve Chiasson, tipped it past
Irbe.
</P>
<P>
   That advantage lasted just over two minutes, as the Hurricanes
responded with a power-play goal of their own after Boston was
caught with too many men on the ice. Keith Primeau, who was a
favorite target of the FleetCenter faithful, spun in the right
circle and his shot went to Ray Sheppard in the left. Sheppard was
wide open with all kinds of time and snapped the shot past Dafoe at
15:20. That was the one that seemed to take the wind out of the
Bruins' sails.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard, who has played on six NHL teams, has been ferocious
against the Bruins in the playoffs. In eight games, he has 11
points, seven of them goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bad as this is, we have to regroup,'' said Dafoe. ``The
guys in here aren't down on each other and they shouldn't be.
Unfortunately we didn't get a win tonight but we have to come back
and definitely get 2 points Wednesday and go down and take one out
of there.''

KANSAS GETS TOUGH ON METHAMPHETAMINE MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 DAWN BORMANN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ The Kansas Bureau of Investigation has a message
for those who persist in making methamphetamine:
</P>
<P>
   You will be found. Your cooking laboratories will be seized.
</P>
<P>
   The proof, agents believe, is in the numbers. Already this year,
193 meth labs have been busted, more than in all of last year. And
with agents raiding two to three laboratories a day, the KBI
expects to reach the 500 mark before December.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics stagger agents who remember a meager four
seizures in 1994 and seven in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible accomplishment,'' said KBI Director Larry
Welch. ``It's been the KBI's top investigative priority for the
last three consecutive years, and I have no doubt it will continue
to be the top priority for the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   The surge is explained by the wildfire spread of methamphetamine
in rural areas, as well as intensified law enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In Topeka, legislators are discussing ways to tighten Kansas
laws. A bill could bring Kansas' laws closer to those in Missouri,
which levies more serious sanctions for makers of illicit drugs. A
Missouri manufacturer could get a life sentence for making more
than a pound of meth, while a first-time Kansas violator could
spend less than four years in prison, under current law.
</P>
<P>
   Welch said it is difficult to say whether the Missouri law has
driven meth cooks into Kansas. But agents expect to hear that
argument when the Legislature returns to work on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the drug spreads through the state, Welch said, agents are
struggling to keep up with the burden meth is placing on the
state's laboratory investigation resources.
</P>
<P>
   The KBI has investigation laboratories in Topeka and Great Bend,
and this year added a lab in Pittsburg to respond to meth's rapid
growth in southeast Kansas. That's a hot spot because it is easy
for meth cooks to get chemicals in Oklahoma, agents believe.
</P>
<P>
   And if Welch and others have their way, another investigation
laboratory will be added at Kansas City Kansas Community College.
Kansas lawmakers are considering the proposal, in which the agency
would use two college chemistry labs. Updating the labs would cost
about $964,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also this year, the KBI added a third mobile lab that allows
agents and chemists to do preliminary processing in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Meth is inexpensive to make, using a recipe of cold medicine and
other easily obtained ingredients. Agents have found meth labs _
most of them booby-trapped _ hidden in suitcases, a coffin and in
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, federal investigators searched a laboratory
at an Overland Park, Kan., apartment complex. Another lab was
discovered last week by a maid cleaning a Lenexa hotel room. After
a short course from local investigators, hotel supervisors knew
what to look for.
</P>
<P>
   KBI Senior Agent Bruce Coffman said he would train anyone who
would listen about the dangers of meth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's just teaching awareness so responders will have
the sense to back out the door and call for help,'' he said. ``It's
as nasty as you're going to get in the drug market.''

ALL-AMERICA ATHLETE, KANSAS CITY CIVIC LEADER RAY EVANS DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 KENT PULLIAM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ... the best back on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that season KU tumbled to Texas Christian in Fort Worth,
Texas, and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram praised Evans with this
headline: ``TCU 41, Evans 6.
</P>
<P>
   Sports columnist Grantland Rice once wrote: ``Evans is as
brilliant as anyone. All the Kansan can do is run, pass, kick,
block and tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans was all-conference in football in 1942, '46 and '47. He
was all-conference in basketball in 1942-43.
</P>
<P>
   Evans was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1964.
He also was selected to the Helms Basketball Foundation Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always talk about the fact that he was an All-American
in two sports _ and that was truly amazing,'' said Bob Frederick,
KU athletic director. ``But the time I was around him, he was an
all-world gentleman. He was so gracious and so kind and
overwhelming in his concern for other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember very well the night we hung his jersey in Allen
Fieldhouse. I know he was moved by that. But in his typical
fashion, he was very humble, very modest, almost embarrassed about
it _ but proud for his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, a first-round draft choice of the Chicago Bears in 1943,
turned down offers to join the Bears and San Francisco 49ers after
the war when he returned to Kansas. He signed with the Pittsburgh
Steelers on April 27, 1948. He played one season in the NFL and
then turned down a contract offer the second year to return to
full-time work at the City National Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm serious when I say I'm not crazy about playing pro
football,'' Evans said when he left the NFL. ``I wanted to finish
my eligibility at KU. A lot of people thought I was crazy to do it.
I didn't want to let our team down. I never want to be known as an
athletic bum because I'm not. The thing I want most is a job in
Kansas City where I can earn a living and settle down.''
</P>
<P>
   After one year in the NFL, Evans returned to Kansas City and
became active in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was active in a broad range of things,'' said Donald Hall,
chairman of Hallmark Cards Inc. ``He is one of the finest gentlemen
you will ever meet, a kind, gentle soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillingham, who also has served as president of the board of the
American Royal, called Evans ``a great asset in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Commerce Bancshares Chairman James Kemper Jr. said he
was never a big sports fan, but he can remember a game at the
University of Missouri where Evans almost single-handedly beat the
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always a man of great integrity,'' Kemper said. ``He
was a presence in Kansas City all during his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his involvement in Kansas City, Evans served on the
National Council of Youth Fitness, was past president of the
University of Kansas National Alumni Association, was a trustee of
the Dwight D. Eisenhower Foundation and served for 12 years on the
Kansas State Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, born Sept. 8, 1922, on Strawberry Hill, in Kansas City,
Kan., was the youngest of six children of Czechoslovakian
immigrants. The family name was Ivanco.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by Edith Marie Darby Evans, his wife of 50 years;
daughter Julia Evans Fromm and her husband, David Fromm; daughter
Rita Evans Stark and her husband, Benjamin Stark; son Ray Darby
Evans and his wife, Sarah Evans; all of the Kansas City area,
daughter Lisa Evans Tuchtan and her husband, Ken Tuchtan of
Bethesda, Md.; eight grandchildren; and a sister, Helen Carr of
Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be 1:30 p.m. Wednesday at St. Agnes
Church, Fairway; private burial in Highland Park Cemetery, Kansas
City, Kan. Visitation will be 6:30-8:30 p.m. Tuesday at the church.
</P>
<P>
   The family requests no flowers and suggests memorial
contributions to the University of Kansas Endowment Association,
c//o The Williams Fund, P.O. Box 928, Lawrence, KS 66044-0928; the
Heart Institute Foundation of St. Luke's Hospital, P.O. Box 11900,

 FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS, RESULT
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, what's with these guys? They're home, right? Home is not
only where the heart is. It's also supposed to be where the W's
are.
</P>
<P>
   For someone else, maybe, but not the Boston Bruins. They have
now played six home playoff games since moving from the cozy Garden
to the sterile Fleet, and they are 1-5. What home ice advantage?
Since they can't bring back the Garden, maybe they should play Game
4 in Matthews Arena. Or Ristuccia, up there in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, unlike the Celtics, they're having a postseason, so
we should at least be grateful for that.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of gratitude, weren't those boos we heard as the
Bruins skated off the ice at the conclusion of Monday night's 3-2
loss to the Carolina Hurricanes? Boos? Hey, people. It wasn't as if
your team stunk up the joint. They got beat on a cheap goal.
They're down, 2-1, in a seven-game series. What kind of support is
that?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bad yet,'' reassured Ray Bourque. ``If we lose the
next one, that's gonna be bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't heard, this is the Eastern Conference, where
1 can lose to 8, 2 can lose to 7, and so on down the line. In this
case, 6 is losing to 3, except that most people thought the real
seeding should have been the other way around. Typical arrogant
Original Six talk, eh?
</P>
<P>
   So what if it was? It won't make any dfference if, starting
Wednesday night, the Bruins don't win a home game.
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure that Pat Burns doesn't think this home/road
business has anything to do with anything. Here, there, or
anywhere, the Hurricanes are gonna do what they're gonna do, which
means they will forecheck and forecheck, and, when they can't think
of anything else to do, they will forecheck some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no secret,'' said the Boston mentor. ``That's what
they do all the time. They're a good forechecking team. There's no
two ways about that. Plus, they got a break. A couple of breaks,
actually.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the first and third Carolina goals, neither
of which had much to do with artful stickhandling or shooting. The
first, a mere minute and five seconds into the game, was credited
to Gary Roberts. Let's just say that Jeff O'Neill made the play and
that the hand of fate somehow managed to direct it off Roberts and
past a somewhat startled Byron Dafoe. A thing of beauty? Uh, no. A
thing? Yup.
</P>
<P>
   As for the game-winner, which was credited to Andrei Kovalenko,
there is not much to say other than to hope that somehow or other
things even out in the long run. Kovalenko still hasn't touched it.
The puck was accidentally Dafoed in, even as Kovalenko came
crashing into the goalkeeper. For a fleeting moment, Burns &AMP; Co.
hoped for a reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was (i.e. Kovalenko in the crease),'' said Burns,
``but when I looked at it on TV, it wasn't. The puck was already
in. It was another break. The puck bounced off Byron's glove and
went into the net. That's a break we'd like to get. But you have to
make your breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   You do, indeed, and so it's somewhat sad to report that in at
least two very prominent instances the Bruins did exactly that, and
yet still managed to lose. Both Boston goals came as either the
direct or indirect result of tremendous prolonged pressure exerted
on the Hurricanes. Sergei Samsonov tied the game at 1-1 after
taking a superb right-to-left centering feed from Joe Thornton not
long after the expiration of a first-period power play that itself
was due to hard work and diligence on the part of the Bruins that
caused Curtis Leschyshyn to be sent off for obstruction. More
fierce pressure led to a second-period Keith Primeau tripping
penalty. Anson Carter made him pay by redirecting a Jason Allison
blast past Arturs Irbe to give the Bruins a 2-1 lead at 13:07.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, was the end of the Boston scoring. They were
unable to convert any of their good scoring opportunities in the
final 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as if Irbe had to, as they say in this game, stand on
his head. He was good, not great, but clearly good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have to do anything too spectacular,'' acknowledged
Carolina coach Paul Maurice, ``but he did make some real nice
decisions with the puck. He helped out in our back end.''
</P>
<P>
   We didn't hear anything out of Burns we didn't expect to hear.
As he said, there are no secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to bury our chances,'' he declared. ``If we don't,
then we start looking at all the things we're doing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Except that . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing a whole lot wrong,'' he continued. ``We just
have to bury our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins really aren't doing too much wrong, where does
that leave the Hurricanes?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played a very solid road game,'' said Maurice,
who looks young enough to be proofed at Disney World. ``We've got
to be real pleased with this win.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice is of the opinion that no one should be surprised at
anything that goes on in this, or any other, Eastern Conference
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great parity,'' he said. ``There are no good matchups
for anyone. Four teams are going to go away in a bad mood. Four
general managers can say to their coach after he loses, `Your team
is as good as the other team.' We're up, 2-1, but Boston could be
up, 2-1, or even 3-0. Your stomach is always swirling.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't believe I got this far without even mentioning the
second Carolina goal, a power-play job. The penalty was for _
you'll love this _ too many men on the ice. Rob DiMaio thought
Carter was coming off the ice, and, oh, it's just too painful to
ponder.
</P>
<P>
   So is all this going to happen again? Two goofy goals. Too many
men on the ice. That stuff has to be out of their system. Don't you
like the Bruins' chances in, you know, a normal game?
</P>
<P>
   They can't keep losing at home, can they? You heard the captain.
Cut them just a little slack. If they lose Wednesday night, you
have number 77's permission to boo. One more chance, OK?

ALL-AMERICA ATHLETE, KANSAS CITY CIVIC LEADER RAY EVANS DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 KENT PULLIAM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ Ray Evans, one of the most celebrated
athletes in Kansas City history and a longtime civic leader, died
at his home Saturday night. Evans, a two-sport All-America at the
University of Kansas, was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Evans had suffered heart problems in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a damn good citizen, that's for sure,'' said Jay B.
Dillingham, a former president of the American Royal.
</P>
<P>
   Evans gained his greatest fame at KU, where he was the school's
first-ever All-America player in football in 1947 and a two-time
All-America basketball player in 1942 and '43.
</P>
<P>
   He also was an active civic leader in the Kansas City area long
after his on-field exploits. He was president of the Traders
National Bank until he retired in 1975, was a former chairman of
the board of the American Royal and a former vice president and
director of the Kansas City Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   He also remained active in sports _ though on the civic side. He
was instrumental in helping bring the Chiefs to Kansas City and
served as president of the Chiefs Club. He was a member of the
Royal Lancers since its inception in 1967 and was a part-owner of
the former Kansas City Kings NBA franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray was one of those rare individuals who comes along once in
a century,'' said Otto Schnellbacher, a basketball and football
teammate of Evans at KU. ``Not only was he a great athlete, he was
a great person with it. Ray was an achiever. He was the type of
player who always made the great play at the time it was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things got tough, he was somehow right there on the front
row to make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Fambrough, former KU football coach, also was Evans'
teammate. The two met during World War II when they were stationed
together in the Army Air Forces. Evans' college career was
interrupted by the war. He played athletics at KU in the early
'40s, then returned for the 1946 and '47 football seasons,
finishing up his basketball eligibility in the spring of 1948.
Evans recruited Fambrough to come to KU.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the hardest things I ever had to do was leave the
University of Texas,'' Fambrough said Sunday. ``But I wanted to
play my football days with Ray. I remember having the feeling that
any time he was on the field I felt like we could beat anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who also had led Wyandotte High School to the state
football championship in 1940, had turned down offers from several
major-league baseball clubs to attend KU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard it said a thousand times about individuals
leading with their actions rather than their words,'' Fambrough
said. ``Whoever said that the first time had Ray Evans in mind. I
have always said that here at the University of Kansas there were
two categories of athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was for Ray Evans. The other was for anybody else. Nobody
else was even close when you consider him as an athlete, a person,
a friend and someone you could count on.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents felt the same way. In 1942, when the Iowa Navy
Pre-Flight team was beating Kansas 61-0, coach Bernie Bierman said:
``Kansas was swamped and outclassed, but that Ray Evans was the
best back on the field.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Cuttino Mobley could not help himself. Scottie Pippen would rather
the precocious point guard make everything else he did Monday a
habit. But not this.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For one night, however, when a painful three-game losing streak
had been extinguished and a likely first-round playoff opponent
whipped, Mobley celebrated by planting a wet one on top of Pippen's
head. And just this once, Pippen said he had to let it go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind,'' Pippen said, ``as long as he plays like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that sort of night for the Rockets, with a lot of love in
the room after a start-to-finish 102-80 rout of the Los Angeles
Lakers at Compaq Center. In ending their longest skid of the year,
the Rockets recorded their second-largest victory of the season and
dealt the Lakers their second-biggest loss.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley set the tone, Pippen turned it up, and Charles Barkley
brought it home, the Lakers never challenging less than two weeks
before they will likely meet the Rockets in the first round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But more than whom they beat, the Rockets were cheered by how
they beat them, solving each of the problems they said had caused
their fall in consecutive losses to the Mavericks, Clippers and
Suns.
</P>
<P>
   They played outstanding, aggressive defense against the league's
second-most prolific scoring and most accurate shooting team. They
ran their break expertly and shut down the Lakers' bench. They even
controlled the boards more completely, save the obligatory rout of
Vancouver, than they had against anybody else this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think today's game showed how good we can be,'' Pippen
said. ``I still feel we're a championship-caliber team. We just
have to come out, play hard and lay it all on the line every night.
If we do that continuously, after a while it becomes routine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets would love for such a night to become routine. But
under the circumstances, it clearly was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our biggest game, our most meaningful game of the
year,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said, having taken his 350th
career win but thinking of bigger concerns. ``Considering the
situation we're in, we came up big.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' renewed swagger might have been most clear when
Barkley tossed a length-of-the-court pass to Pippen, then raised
his arms Joe Montana style as Pippen dunked.
</P>
<P>
   And the transformation might have been most obvious when Barkley
backed in Robert Horry for 60 feet before scoring, then extended a
hand thigh-high to the Lakers' bench, indicating the ceiling on
their place in the Western Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   The win left the Rockets (28-17) 1{ games ahead of the Lakers
(27-19) and two up in the loss column. The Rockets have five games
left, the Lakers four.
</P>
<P>
   Though Barkley maintained there was no message sent, especially
considering the Lakers still hold two wins against the Rockets this
season and neither has won on the other's court, he knew what the
win meant in the playoff chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was two teams that have been struggling,'' Barkley said.
``We outplayed them tonight. We had to win tonight to keep the
two-game lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concentration is on trying to keep home court (in the first
round of the playoffs), and we'll go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious sign of the Rockets' rejuvenation was their
sudden enthusiasm for defense from the outset. Determined to apply
defensive pressure and intensity sorely lacking in the past week,
the Rockets all but choked the life out of LA. The Lakers have been
struggling every bit as much as the Rockets, but if there is one
thing they can do, it's score.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockets' defense attacking swiftly and confidently,
though, the Lakers made just seven of 26 (26.9 percent)
first-quarter shots. Mobley, having begun the defensive effort with
two quick steals, had 12 points in the quarter as the Rockets
rushed to a 28-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to set the tone defensively,'' Mobley said. ``I
always try to set the tone defensively, but I wanted to be
aggressive offensively, too.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Pippen began to take over. He had 12 points and four
steals in the second quarter and finished with 26 points, his third
consecutive 20-point game. Until Sunday, he had not had consecutive
20-point games all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being more aggressive offensively, and teams have to honor
my outside shot,'' Pippen said. ``When I shoot like I did tonight,
it makes the rest of my game much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   It made the night easier for the Rockets, who led by 23 points
one Michael Dickerson jumper into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   They have made a habit of blowing such leads. But Barkley, who
finished with 20 points, 16 rebounds and six assists, grew
increasingly dominant, too strong inside for Horry and too quick
for J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us out there (in Los Angeles) and were dancing and
high-fiving,'' Mobley said. ``I was mad about that. I was ready to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us confidence. We know we can beat them. We can see
their weaknesses and go from there.''

SILENT `ANGEL' EXTENDS A SECRET HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not your typical business card. But then again, it's not
your ordinary business.
</P>
<P>
   The card says ``Silent Angels'' above a drawing of a cherub's
face and a fax number.
</P>
<P>
   There is no name and no telephone number. That's the way the
founding ``Angel'' likes it. The faxes come to her with requests
for help _ clothing, shelter, jobs. And without fanfare she
responds, sometimes with assistance from others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Batman,'' she said. ``I like to stay behind the
mask. I don't want people to know who I am. That's not important as
long as people are getting the help.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, this Belton, Mo., woman has quietly worked
behind the scenes, helping hundreds, perhaps thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't smoke, I don't drink,'' she said. ``This is my
addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   She works two part-time jobs, one at UPS and one at The Kansas
City Star, to support the work she does, spending about 80 percent
of her earnings on her volunteer efforts.
</P>
<P>
   A co-worker at UPS learned about her work, and the Angel
recently received the Jim Casey Community Service Award. She was
selected from among 300,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Angel was so surprised that she assumed she was being fired
when a supervisor asked her to gather her belongings and come to
the office.
</P>
<P>
   The Angel is a mother of four children and grandmother of eight,
and she can't explain why she spends about 30 hours a week working
at shelters, soup kitchens and wherever else she's needed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's because of the way she was raised. Even as a
teen-ager, she would help relatives deliver produce and meat to
shelters and the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 years ago, when her oldest child was in preschool, she
dressed up as the Easter bunny.
</P>
<P>
   That tradition grew, and she now spends months making baskets
with volunteers and weeks delivering them to child-care centers,
nursing homes and individual children.
</P>
<P>
   While she volunteers at a soup kitchen every Saturday, much of
her time is spent responding to the faxes. Her garage and those of
friends are packed with donations of toys, clothing and furniture,
which she distributes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't call it a handout, I call it a hand up,'' she said.
``They need the help, and I just give it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her most recent endeavors is the Children of the Arts.
The idea is to provide free music and art lessons for youngsters
who would otherwise not be able to afford them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for kids who can't afford to do anything,'' she said.
``If we can get them involved, they'll have something to look
forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Her dream is to open an all-purpose community center where
someone could go for food, clothing or job training.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really no big deal,'' she says about her volunteer
work. ``It all fits in.''

TOLERANCE IN SCHOOLS WOULD BE A LIFESAVER

<TEXT>
<P>
   ]You knew it wouldn't be long before a few school districts
banned black trench coats, and within days of the killings at
Columbine High some American teen-agers risked suspension for their
choice of outerwear.
</P>
<P>
   We are human. We respond irrationally at times such as these. We
act, even if those actions are as pointless as outlawing an item of
clothing worn by the killers in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of tragedies such as last Tuesday's massacre,
we scramble to understand causes, assess blame and take corrective
action.
</P>
<P>
   We want a quick fix _ a simple formula to end this rash of
school violence that's seemingly as unstoppable and unpredictable
as lightning strikes in a thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   What causes two teen-agers to kill and maim their classmates by
the dozen?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the culture? Should we blame it all on the video games and
the movies and the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Others say it's America's fascination with guns _ too many
firearms too easily obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Others lay it all on mom and dad. It must be the fault of
parental permissiveness in our culture of affluence, we're told by
people who have no clue about how those boys were raised.
</P>
<P>
   We'll never know what combination of society's ills spawned this
evil. Yet we must look for ways to keep such horrors from happening
again.
</P>
<P>
   Strict gun control? Some of us have been advocating that since
Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated in
1968, and no doubt we'll still be saying it in another 30 years, to
little effect.
</P>
<P>
   More school security? Sounds good to some, but metal detectors
would not have prevented the attack in Littleton, and the security
cameras did nothing but provide evidence for after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   As for arming teachers and filling the schools with police, we
have to ask whether that's the kind of society we want to live in.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing seems clear: We need to put a stop to the anger
that propelled Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris into murder and
suicide. A stop to the anger that motivated the school killings in
Jonesboro, Ark., Pearl, Miss., West Paducah, Ky., and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   That means going one step beyond the many fine
conflict-resolution programs developed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do parents, teachers, ministers and friends need to
keep a close eye out for the warning signs of troubled youth, but
we need to teach our kids to be tolerant of each other's
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Not just tolerance of racial and ethnic diversity, but tolerance
of those who simply look or act differently. We need tolerance
across the many cliques that exist in every high school.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold and Harris weren't always bad kids, but it's been said
they turned angry because jocks and others considered them outcasts
and losers for the way they dressed and acted.
</P>
<P>
   Not in any way to excuse their crimes, but how might things have
changed had their classmates reached out to them instead of
treating them like freaks for wearing the black clothes and makeup?
How many other tragedies might be averted if our children learned
to accept each other, rather than mock those at the bottom of the
social pecking order?
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Costello sang a song some years ago that seems applicable.
It was called ``(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love And
Understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing's funny about it, man. Without it, there's only grief.

TYPICALLY UPSETTING DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
 HKN-DUPONT COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surprised, aren't you? Once again, the playoffs aren't going the
way Black-and-Gold Country expected. The Bruins were supposed to be
able to handle the Hurricanes and move on fairly handily to Round 2
of the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Well, take ``supposed'' and stick it in, oh, how about that
steam plant down in Hartford? Yeah, that's it, Hartford. Who knows
better than those folks in the Nutmeg State _ once home of the
Whalers _ that rarely do things go according to the book, according
to form, play out the way they are supposed to play out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, here in the 1999 Stanley Cup playoffs, the unexpected
has become the expected in the Eastern Conference. As of this
morning, three of the four series favorites _ Devils, Senators, and
Bruins _ are on the wrong side of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, the top seed in the East, were supposed to breeze by
the once-mighty Penguins. When Pittsburgh superstar Jaromir Jagr
moved to the injured list (groin pull) in Game 1, leaving him out
of Games 2 and 3, Las Vegas opened a betting line on whether
bankruptcy court would call for liquidation of the financially
strapped franchise before the Penguins could lose their fourth
game.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? Even without Jagr, the most talented player in
today's game, Pittsburgh won Games 2 and 3. The Devils' offense hit
a vapor lock. And, lo and behold, Alexei Kovalev showed up looking
like the world-class player he was projected to be in the '92
Olympics. Maybe the Penguins won't win the series, but they already
have two more wins than they were supposed to . . .
</P>
<P>
   And the Senators. Yikes.
</P>
<P>
   They led the conference for much of the second half, but
softened up some in the final two weeks, allowing the Devils to
capture the East. With that hitch already in their swing, they took
on the Sabres, only to find Dominik Hasek programmed with his full
Czech Republic-gold-medal program. Translation: Forget about it,
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senators lose Tuesday night, it's over in four. A sweep.
They've got speed, youth, depth, and a neat attack that is based on
the quick transition out of a trap defense. Big deal. They've got a
neat story line: a small-market Canadian squad with a rabid fan
base. So much for neat stories. In 60 ticks of the clock tonight,
they could be the best thing that's happened to Buffalo since the
invention of galoshes and rock salt.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Bruins, they finally were moving on up in the world
with the late-season coming together of two pretty decent offensive
line combinations, and they were supposed to beat up on the 'Canes
as if they were their Forever .500 forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone out there remember just what those line combinatons were?
</P>
<P>
   Jason Allison was in the middle of one. Jumbo Joe Thornton
played the No. 2 pivot. Three games into this series, which
Carolina now leads, 2-1, the Bruins can't roll so much as one line
over the boards that can play through the 'Canes defense and
commanding presence once over the offensive blue line.
</P>
<P>
   In times like these, coach Pat Burns usually turns to his
reliable checking line of Rob DiMaio, Tim Taylor, and P.J.
Axelsson. But those aren't the go-to guys who made the late-season
run so exciting. Where in the world are Steve Heinze, Anson Carter,
Sergei Samsonov, and Dmitri Khristich? By the end of Game 3, Burns
clearly had given up on Khristich, who has had one shot on goal in
the series.
</P>
<P>
   Given Khristich's performance _ a real stretch of the word _
Burns has every reason to dress Cameron Mann in his place Wednesday
night for Game 4. No one knows for sure, but word had it at the
Vault Tuesday night that the Hood photographer shot Monday night's
game and Khristich's face will be seen on the side of milk cartons
later this week.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, Flutie Flakes were the rage. Here we've got a case
of a Khristich Kidnapping. He's a free agent as of July 1 and it
will take at least $2 million a year to bring him back next season.
The bigger trick would be to find something that would bring him
back in time for Wednesday night's faceoff.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that is going according to the book in the East
right now is the Toronto-Philadelphia series. After dropping the
opener, the favored Maple Leafs have won two straight, including a
2-1 triumph Monday night. The Flyers don't have Eric Lindros
(recovering from a collapsed lung) and Mark Recchi is struggling
with symptoms of a migraine headache (after two concussions in 23
days). The Leafs entered as the favorites and they're living up to
the billing.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the Hub, where the Stanley Cup has been absent some
27 years, nothing is as it was supposed to be. The best little
hockey team in North Carolina is a lot better than a lot of people
expected _ maybe even better than the 'Canes themselves imagined _
and the Bruins look like they don't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   What do you suppose they're going to do about that?

GARDEN CITY SCHOOLS MEET CHALLENGE OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star

<P>
   GARDEN CITY, Kan. _ Javier's intense brown eyes dart between his
kindergarten teacher and a piece of paper where he has written
``HOLE'' in large letters.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Walker pronounces a letter and draws it on an easel, and
Javier and his classmates repeat the sound. It may look like a
simple English lesson, but to tiny Javier it's a foreign language.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks earlier, the 5-year-old had arrived from Mexico to
live with his mother in Garden City. He speaks only Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In most Kansas school districts, Javier would be a special case,
but not in this southwest Kansas town of 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many speak only Spanish in your house?'' Walker asks her
class at Victor Ornelas Elementary School, and 12 of her 14 pupils
raise their hands.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the families in the Garden City school
district speak a language other than English at home.
</P>
<P>
   From Spanish to Vietnamese to Lao, a visitor at a Garden City
playground could hear as many as 11 languages. In five years, the
number of students who speak little or no English has risen from
550 to 1,600, or about 20 percent of the district's enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   With the diversity of its student body, the Garden City School
District looks more like Southern California than western Kansas,
said Linda Trujillo, who leads the district's bilingual effort.
</P>
<P>
   More than five years ago, the school district decided to tackle
the challenge of educating its diverse student population using an
approach known as English as a Second Language, or ESL. Three of
the district's 12 elementary schools employ the program, and an
expansion into other schools is planned for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Under this approach, children at first are taught to read and
write and do other schoolwork in a language they understand. At the
same time, they begin to learn English, which eventually becomes
the primary language.
</P>
<P>
   The ESL approach is used from kindergarten through third grade.
At each grade level, English lessons are woven into the curriculum
as a supplement to the student's native language.
</P>
<P>
   In third grade, pupils begin the transition to English.
</P>
<P>
   In fourth grade, English becomes the primary language. The
student, according to the theory, should make the transition
easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at 17 to 18 years' worth of studies,'' Trujillo
said. ``They said this is the way it should function if you do it
right. We followed the recipe precisely, and when it came time to
switch, the kids did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the fourth year for the students who began in the
new program as kindergartners.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, fourth-graders in the ESL classes scored as
high on assessment tests as classes made up of students who spoke
only English.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of Hispanic and Asian immigrants into Garden City
began with the construction and expansion of two beef-packing
plants in the mid-1980s. With a low unemployment rate in the area,
these plants regularly recruit workers in Mexico and other Central
American countries.
</P>
<P>
   With them come children needing an education.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Kreicker, a bilingual education program consultant with the
Kansas Board of Education, said the only districts ``where true
bilingual education is taking place'' are in Wichita and Garden
City.
</P>
<P>
   In Garden City, the learning and teaching challenge for local
educators was staggering, said Milt Pippenger, the district's
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   The district became a revolving door for students. Turnover
rates in some Garden City schools reached 100 percent. Academic
expectations were low as teachers and administrators struggled to
teach English to immigrant students.
</P>
<P>
   Within nine years, the district had five superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   Students were learning English, but content was being
sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of kids who could speak English fluently, but
they were dropping out of school because they couldn't read or
write,'' said Trujillo, the district's director of supplemental
programs.
</P>
<P>
   There had to be a better way.
</P>
<P>
   Enter English as a Second Language.
</P>
<P>
   At Alta Brown Elementary, Principal Leticia Porter said student
appetites for learning have increased dramatically. She said a few
pupils have read every book in the school library.
</P>
<P>
   Book checkouts have soared from about 100 to 500 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Parent involvement has skyrocketed while the student turnover
rate has plunged. When their children are doing well in schools,
parents are not as quick to move somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want very much for their children not to have to work as
hard as they have,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   The school also is teaching English to the parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman was so desperate to learn English she borrowed a
baby from another family so she could take the classes,'' Porter
said.
</P>
<P>
   The district also has taken steps to address another problem _
middle school students who arrive with little or no English skills.
</P>
<P>
   They wind up in Gayla Myers' ``intake'' class. Each new arrival
is evaluated, and a program is designed to prepare the student to
enter regular classes. That may take an entire semester if the
student arrives without any formal education.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take a student who already is literate in his own
language and teach him English pretty easily,'' Trujillo said.
``For students who are not literate in any language, you not only
have to teach him English but literacy skills as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo said the teachers try to do as much as they can for
these older students and then move them into a beginning-level ESL
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the nonliterate student, we know that unless something
extraordinary happens, they probably won't graduate from high
school,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring enough bilingual teachers to meet the district's needs is
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, college scholarships are given to six Garden City
High School graduates who agree to obtain an education degree and
return to teach in Garden City schools for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grow our own,'' Trujillo said. ``We're always looking for
people.''

`SNOWBALL' OPENS DISNEY TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A feud between two Disney executives got so
bitter in the early 1990s that one cooked up a confidential
document, called ``Project Snowball,'' to keep the other from
receiving his bonus, a lawyer claimed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   So began the trial of a legal dispute started by former studio
chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, who sued for more than $250 million,
claiming a spat with Disney CEO Michael Eisner helped keep him from
a profit-sharing payoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence will show it's the personal animus of one man,''
Michael Eisner, that kept Katzenberg from his money, plaintiff's
lawyer Bert Fields said during opening statements.
</P>
<P>
   He backed the charge by unveiling deal memos, personal notes and
a document called ``Project Snowball,'' which he claims Eisner and
a handful of executives ``cooked up'' in 1991 to keep Katzenberg
from the money he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Disney General Counsel Louis Meisinger fired back in the
afternoon, suggesting that Fields' entire argument should have a
disclaimer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you just heard was fiction,'' Meisinger told private
judge Paul Breckenridge.
</P>
<P>
   Meisinger said ``Operation Snowball'' was a nickname coined by a
Disney accountant, who was keeping track of Katzenberg's contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing sinister about the company having a project
to calculate a very complicated bonus,'' Meisinger said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the trial, Breckenridge will decide how much
Disney owes Katzenberg, who spent 1984 to 1994 at the studio,
churning out hits like ``The Lion King'' while profits soared.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg is seeking a 2 percent bonus from profits for Disney
productions during his tenure plus future profits from them. Disney
claims he forfeited those profits when he left.
</P>
<P>
   Disney and Katzenberg settled some of their differences in 1997,
and agreed to let a private judge sort out the rest at trial.
Katzenberg and Eisner are scheduled to testify.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Jose Lima went on a national sports talk show this spring and
boldly predicted he would win 20 games.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three down, 17 to go.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem a little far-fetched, considering that only two
years ago Lima was struggling as a reliever and close to a demotion
to the minor leagues. But after Monday night's 5-2 victory over the
Arizona Diamondbacks at the Astrodome, who can argue with him?
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to win 20 games. Be careful. I can win some more,''
said Lima, who allowed two runs in eight-plus innings. ``I'm not
trying to act like I'm all that, but I know I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima (3-1) struck out four and walked two, reducing his ERA to
3.33 and coming within three outs of his fourth career complete
game. He retired 11 of 13 batters to begin the game and on several
occasions worked out of jams to keep the Diamondbacks under
control.
</P>
<P>
   With a run in and a man on in the ninth, Billy Wagner replaced
Lima and struck out the final three batters for his sixth save. The
second of those victims was Kelly Stinnett, whose line drive off
Wagner's head provided one of 1998's scariest moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight I expected nothing less than a win,'' said Lima, who
won a career-high 16 games last season in his first full-time
chance as a starter. ``When I go out there, I feel like I can win
every game. That's the kind of confidence I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona righthander Todd Stottlemyre wasn't as fortunate.
Stottlemyre, one of the big acquisitions in the Diamondbacks'
offseason spending spree, lost for the first time in five starts.
</P>
<P>
   After holding the Astros hitless through 3 innings, Stottlemyre
became his own enemy with three of his season-high five walks
during the Astros' two-run fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre (2-1) allowed five runs _ three earned _ and six
hits in six innings. He walked five and had four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Derek Bell reached on an error by shortstop Tony
Batista, stole second base and scored on Jeff Bagwell's single to
center. Stottlemyre struck out Ken Caminiti but followed with
consecutive walks to Carl Everett, Richard Hidalgo and Tony
Eusebio, the last with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, who went 2-for-4 with two RBIs, drove in a run with a
double in the fifth, and Hidalgo added a two-run single three
batters later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some nights you have to tip your hat. I got outpitched,''
Stottlemyre said.
</P>
<P>
   Lima worked out of a sticky situation in the fourth when the
Diamondbacks loaded the bases with two outs. Former Astro Luis
Gonzalez, who extended his hitting streak to 12 games, and Travis
Lee singled, and Batista walked.
</P>
<P>
   Lima got out of the inning when Stinnett popped to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks scored once in the sixth and threatened to get
more.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams singled with one out, and Gonzalez drove in a run
with a double to right-center. Lima coaxed the next two batters
into groundouts to minimize the damage and help the Astros maintain
a four-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker credited Lima's success to staying ahead in the count
and changing speeds on his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't throw fastballs over the plate for them to
hit,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona entered the game hitting .275, fourth-best in the
National League. The D-Backs outhit the Astros 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Lima said his game plan centered on limiting the damage by Jay
Bell and Williams. Bell has seven home runs, and Williams was
coming off a 5-for-9 weekend series with San Diego in which he
homered twice.
</P>
<P>
   The two went 1-for-8 Monday off Lima.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to stay away from Matt Williams and Jay Bell,'' Lima
said. ``I respect all of their hitters, but those two have been
swinging the bat real well. I let (catcher) Tony Eusebio call the
game for me. I hardly shook him off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks got their second run off Lima in the ninth,
when Gonzalez walked and scored on a double to right-center by Lee.
Then Wagner entered and put a blazing end to the night's activity.
</P>
<P>
   The victory enabled the Astros to pull even at 5-5 at the Dome,
and Dierker said the victory was even more satisfying coming
against a Diamondbacks club that had won six of its previous seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to be a championship team, we are going to
have to establish ourselves as a team that's hard to beat in our
own ballpark,'' Dierker said. ``We haven't done that yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Diamondbacks are as good a test as any of the
teams we've played yet.''

COMMISSION STAFF SEES FLAWS IN PROPOSED MERGER OF WESTERN
RESOURCES, KCP&AMP;L 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A merger of Western Resources Inc. and Kansas
City Power &AMP; Light Co. would be against the public's interest,
unless substantial changes are made in the proposal, the staff of
the Missouri Public Service Commission has concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The staff, which disclosed its views in testimony filed Monday
at the commission's headquarters in Jefferson City, said its
concerns ranged from the lack of benefits for consumers to the
amount of market power wielded by the two utilities if they merged.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the information supplied by the two utilities to
Missouri regulators was often insufficient in providing necessary
details about how the merged company would operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an inadequate filing,'' said Terry Featherstone, a
regulatory auditor for the Public Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The staff's views will be considered by the commission, which
will hold formal hearings on the proposed merger in July. The
commissioners are not obligated to accept the views of their staff.
</P>
<P>
   But the Missouri regulatory staff, the Missouri Office of Public
Counsel, the staff of the Kansas Corporation Commission and that
state's Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board have all conveyed the
view that the merger is seriously flawed for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A KCP&AMP;L spokeswoman said she had no comment on the Missouri
staff's testimony. Carl Koupal Jr., an executive vice president
with Western Resources, said he was limited in what he could say
because he had reviewed only a brief summary of the Missouri
staff's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   But Western still firmly thinks the merger is in the best
interests of employees, ratepayers and shareholders, Koupal said.
He also reiterated that the merger agreement couldn't survive
serious financial tinkering by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger will occur only if any conditions are consistent
with what is sound from a financial standpoint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Western Resources and KCP&AMP;L agreed to merge in February 1997 in
a transaction valued at $2.2 billion. If the deal is completed,
Western's utilities, KGE and KPL, will join KCP&AMP;L in a new company
called Westar. It would serve 1 million electric customers.
</P>
<P>
   But substantial concessions are being recommended by the staff
of the Missouri Public Service Commission. As now configured, they
conclude, the merger would give little or no rate relief to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The two utilities estimate that the merger will save $950
million over 10 years, a figure that the Missouri staffers think is
inflated. But whatever the savings, it's far from certain that
consumers would see any of the money, said Mark Oligschlaeger, one
of the commission's auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Under the utilities' proposal, they would keep revenue equal to
a 13.5 percent return on equity. Anything over that would be split
with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Oligschlaeger said the formula would allow the merged company to
keep all or nearly all the cost savings. The staff is recommending
that the formula be scrapped and that, if approved, the merged
company submit to traditional utility rate regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers and the utility should split any savings resulting
from the merger, the staff recommended. In addition, the testimony
said, none of the $885 million premium paid by Western for KCP&AMP;L
should be collected from Missouri consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Koupal said that consumers should benefit and that Western had a
record of saving money for consumers. One example is the
acquisition of KGE in the early '90s, when a rate increase that had
been expected was avoided.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's staff also expressed concerns about the power
of the merged company to control the market for electricity in the
area. Those concerns should be dealt with by the commission, the
staff said, perhaps by making the merged company divest some of its
generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
   On some issues the commission staffers said they did not get
enough information to reach conclusions. One concern was that
Western Resources, the holding company for Westar, would be in
Kansas, and assurances need to be made that Missouri regulators
will have access to that company's records.
</P>
<P>
   Various corporate and operational details about how the merged
company would operate were not provided. Steve Dottheim, a chief
deputy and legal counsel for the commission, said companies in past
mergers had submitted more requested information than Western and
KCP&AMP;L.
</P>
<P>
   On another issue, the Missouri staff said any merger benefits
should not be used to create rate parity for Missouri and Kansas
customers. KGE customers pay higher residential rates than KPL or
KCP&AMP;L customers, and they have argued that the disparity should end
if the companies merge.

DOCTORS LOOK TOWARD JOINING UNIONS FOR BARGANING POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ While grinding through a 34-hour shift at the
University of Kansas Medical Center, resident radiologist Peter
Peer dreams of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   He dreams of the day when he will complete his five years of
postgraduate resident training and go to work in a private
practice, perhaps in a small town.
</P>
<P>
   But Peer nurtures another dream, one that challenges medical
traditions: carrying a union card. He thinks a union can help him
get better working conditions, such as shorter hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're one step above indentured servants,'' Peer said. ``I
would like to have some bargaining power.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone. More doctors _ whether employed or in private
practice _ are looking to unionization as a means to gain clout.
</P>
<P>
   The move coincides with a growing feeling among doctors
nationwide that their power to make decisions and their ability to
relate to patients have been eroded by cost-conscious managed-care
companies and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that 35,000 to 45,000 of the nation's 680,000
doctors are union members. According to the March 15 issue of
American Medical News, 10 unions are competing for the allegiance
of physicians who are employed by hospitals, HMOs or other
entities.
</P>
<P>
   The publication says the new National Doctors Alliance of the
Service Employees International Union leads the field with 15,000
practicing physicians and residents. It has promised to spend at
least $1 million a year to recruit more salaried doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The next-largest group, the Union of American Physicians and
Dentists, has about 5,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is visible in Kansas City, where the American
Federation of Government Employees recently won an election to
represent doctors and other health-care professionals at Veterans
Hospital. Also, the Federation of Physicians and Dentists, based in
Tallahassee, Fla., says it has met with some Kansas City area
orthopedic surgeons in private practice.
</P>
<P>
   Pending before the National Labor Relations Board are several
cases involving the organizing rights of doctors. A bill in the
U.S. House of Representatives filed by Rep. Tom Campbell, a
California Republican, would allow private-practice doctors and
other private health-care professionals to collectively bargain
with health insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Unions give doctors ``the kind of voice necessary to speak out
for themselves and their patients,'' said Mark Levy, executive
director of the National Doctors Alliance in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Levy's viewpoint resonates with doctors such as Mark Davidner, a
Kansas City area oncologist. ``I think we should have been
unionized years ago,'' Davidner said. ``We're seeing a systematic
discreditation of medicine in this country by insurance companies
and by government. Physicians can no longer make decisions about
how patients should be cared for.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, flinch at the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not certain a union would make a lot of sense,'' said
Brent Steward, a chief surgery resident at KU Medical Center. ``It
would seem that a union would make an `us and them' out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trustees of the American Medical Association recently decided
against forming a doctors union, saying their members needed more
time to consider the proposal. The trustees said they wanted to
have the issue brought before the association's House of Delegates
in June before deciding.  &LR; brk:A different era  &LR; tx:Most health-care
industry observers agree that unionized doctors are a far cry from
the idyllic images of yesteryear, when doctors were looked upon as
saintly father figures. Who could have imagined Marcus Welby down
at the union hall, rallying with his fellow workers against the
abuses of greedy bosses?
</P>
<P>
   But our current health-care system is a far cry from the one
that spawned the Marcus Welby myth. Managed-care companies scrap
over market share and scramble to control rising medical costs,
even as some of their chief executives are paid millions. The
government is tightening the purse strings of Medicare and
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Cost cutting puts pressure on doctors and hospitals to provide
care for less money. At the same time, many doctors say they are
losing control over patient-care decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason it (unionization) has shown up on the radar screens
of doctors is the drastic change in the way the business of health
care is conducted,'' said John Wisner, a psychiatrist at Veterans
Hospital, who is taking a wait-and-see attitude about the union
there. ``All are increasingly aware of changes in which physicians
make decisions, are remunerated and relate to their patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers would benefit if unions helped doctors ``take back a
little extra power,'' said Peter DeSimone, executive director of
the Missouri Association for Social Welfare, a nonprofit citizen
advocacy group in Jefferson City.
</P>
<P>
   That extra power would enable doctors to ``use their best
judgment and not have to beg insurance company bureaucrats and
government bureaucrats to be able to do what they think is right
for the patient,'' DeSimone said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about doctors' losing their independence long have been
expressed by Richard Hellman, a Kansas City area endocrinologist
and president-elect of the Metropolitan Medical Society of Greater
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But Hellman has mixed feelings about doctors taking up the union
label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope they would be unnecessary,'' Hellman said. ``In
situations where physicians are self-employed, I would like to see
different kinds of bargaining groups. I would like to see legal
rights extended to allow physicians to bargain collectively on
non-economic issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellman said unions were more appropriate for salaried doctors,
including physicians in resident training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there have been situations where the physicians were
exploited in residencies, and the unions have helped in that
respect,'' Hellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Peer, the resident radiologist at KU Medical Center, agrees.
 &LR; brk:`Afraid to doze off'  &LR; tx:On a typical day, Peer works from 7
a.m. to 5 p.m. But every six days, he goes in for a shift that
lasts from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. the next day, a total of 34 hours. He
might get a couple of hours of sleep during that time or none at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your adrenalin is pumping and you're constantly waiting for
that beeper to go off,'' Peer said. ``You're afraid to doze off.''
</P>
<P>
   When he finally gets home, he's usually too pumped to go to
sleep. The situation makes him angry.
</P>
<P>
   Peer, who receives a stipend from the state, said residents in
surgery and ob-gyn programs had it even tougher in that they work
even longer without a break. And he said the problem was not unique
to KU Medical Center, but extends across the spectrum of medical
training institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see the point to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a point to it, said Glendon Cox, professor of
radiology and associate dean for graduate medical education at KU.
</P>
<P>
   Once they have completed their training, doctors in certain
specialties still face situations in which they must work more than
24 hours at a stretch, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can deny that medicine is a very stressful
profession,'' Cox said. ``The stresses that occur during residency
prepare you for the stresses you will experience as a practicing
physician.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Cox said, residents are still in training and in a
sense are still students, even though they have medical degrees and
are paid. He said a union agreement would make it difficult to
dismiss a resident who didn't perform up to standards.
</P>
<P>
   Unionization poses the possibility of strikes in situations in
which laws do not prohibit them. But even some doctors who
sympathize with unions blanch at the thought of walking a picket
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're professionals and we have an obligation to our
patients,'' Peer said. ``We wouldn't want to do anything to
jeopardize patient care.''

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WE already knew Randy Johnson spent the offseason working on his
fielding.
</P>
<P>
   Or have you forgotten how Johnson sat in his desert palace last
winter entertaining huge free-agent offers like they were
candy-hops off a fungo?
</P>
<P>
   But we learned something else about Johnson on Monday night,
when he straight-faced the minicams and notepads with a big
announcement that he had decided after all to pitch against his
former team in this four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, we would realize only later, was simply working on his
wicked curveball. It was all a ruse.
</P>
<P>
   He told a gaggle of reporters before Monday night's series
opener that Astros skipper Larry Dierker had ``inspired'' him to
pitch in this four-game set. He said his decision had been prompted
by Dierker's comments about how the Astros might find consistent
emotion and passion by facing their former teammate.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all just made-for-TV jocularity, much like Johnson's
Mark McGwire-inspired home-run swing in the Nike commercials.
</P>
<P>
   It was all just the Big Unit suddenly becoming the Big
Diamondback Who Speaks With Forked Tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy after my own heart,'' Dierker said of Johnson's pre-game
caper.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did Johnson walk away from the cameras than he began
to giggle. No sooner was Arizona manager Buck Showalter approached
with news of Johnson's announcement than Showalter shook his head
and squelched the idea with a resounding, ``Uh, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the game went on and Johnson sat in the dugout, like he
will in all four games this week. The Astros won it 5-2 in much the
same fashion they did so many games a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   And a good time was had by all.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, folks: Exactly what will it take for the Astros
to begin stringing together performances such as Monday's? What
will it take for this season of high hopes and great expectations
to begin taking shape the way last season did at this exact point?
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it's really been just a little of this and a little of
that for us,'' Dierker said. ``We haven't really been good. And we
haven't really been bad. We haven't really established a whole
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Monday's game can only be called the latest flowing Astros
performance in a season that has had almost as many disappointing
ebbs.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Jose Lima was tough and sharp. He got out of a
bases-loaded jam in the fourth, moving his pitches here and there
like they were doing the merengue. He fought off a tough start to
the sixth with terrific pitches against the D-Backs' Travis Lee and
Tony Batista.
</P>
<P>
   He ultimately missed his first complete game of the year by
three outs after giving up a walk and a run-scoring double to begin
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner sprinted in and looked better than ever, striking
out the side to earn his sixth save of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell continued his torrid 1999 with a 2-for-4
performance that included a double and two RBIs. Craig Biggio
doubled and scored. Derek Bell scored a pair of runs.
</P>
<P>
   It was flowing and impressive. But was it the start of something
big? The Astros must begin providing that answer soon, and the
schedule might indicate that this is their best opportunity yet.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Monday's game, the Astros possessed the exact record
they did after 17 games in 1998 _ 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Astros followed that start with 10 wins in their
next 12 games, taking over first place in the 12th game of that
stretch and never relinquishing it again.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Johnson arrived in August and the Astros went on to
102 wins.
</P>
<P>
   And a good time was had by all.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's win, the Astros follow with three more against
the well-stocked Diamondbacks and then a potentially significant
stretch. If the Astros can win this series, the next four series
are against the Florida Marlins, New York Mets, Montreal Expos and
Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are legitimate East Division contenders, but the
remaining three opponents are a combined 19-34.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Dierker doesn't take any wins for granted. But
reminded of the upcoming stretch, he added, ``You might look at the
schedule and say, `There's a place where we can win a few if we're
playing well.' The key is, you have to play well.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is: Was Monday's opener against the
Diamondbacks the start of something big or just a ruse like the one
Johnson pulled before the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on both sides of the fence this year,'' Biggio
said. ``It seems like every time we've been about to get something
going, we haven't played well, or there's been a rainout. But it's
a long season.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure. This is the time of year when it's still easy to laugh and
kid. But the Astros can use a nice run of wins, and now might be a
good time to start.

GRAVES OFFERS UP NEW TRANSPORTATION PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ In hopes of breaking a stalemate that has blocked
approval of a comprehensive transportation plan, Gov. Bill Graves
on Monday presented a new proposal and asked legislative leaders to
test support for it.
</P>
<P>
   His latest suggestion carries a 4-cent-a-gallon gasoline and
diesel fuel tax increase but no change in vehicle registration
fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a tax increase is not part of a plan, I don't think there
will be a plan this session,'' the governor said at a news
conference that followed two meetings with about 20 lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel taxes would be phased in. A 2-cent increase would come
July 1, followed by a 1-cent increase on July 1, 2001, and 1 cent
on July 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 12 percent of state sales tax collections eventually would
be shifted to the plan, which would provide $2.2 billion in
transportation funding over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The latest proposal would fund the major projects offered in
Graves' original proposal, including reconstructing U.S. 169 south
of Spring Hill, adding lanes to Interstate 435 in Overland Park and
rehabilitating Interstate 635 through Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   After a flurry of criticism in recent weeks about the governor
sitting on the sidelines while his pet issue was being discussed,
the action puts Graves at the forefront of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers return to Topeka Wednesday for a wrap-up session. With
a wide array of issues still pending, the session threatens to
stretch well into next week.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders of both parties were asked to take the
governor's plan to their caucuses to gauge support for it. They
also were asked to determine what changes their members might
support.
</P>
<P>
   Graves made it clear he isn't prepared for an extended battle
over a transportation plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the four caucuses don't report back by midweek or so that
there is continuing strong support for this plan or for some
permutation of a plan, I don't think we should allow the session to
get bogged down on the transportation issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without support for his plan or for some other compromise, he
said, ``My recommendation is probably going to be we quit beating
each other around the head and shoulders over transportation and
focus our attention on JJA (Juvenile Justice Authority) and foster
care, children's issues and the budget generally and higher
education and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic Lifelines, the statewide transportation lobbying
organization, will try to focus attention on the issue today with
six news conferences around the state, including one in Overland
Park.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, it will sponsor a rally of transportation
supporters at the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the session, the House approved a pay-as-you-go
transportation plan that tapped the state treasury for support
without increasing taxes or issuing bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate responded with a plan that increased the motor fuel
tax and car and truck registration fees and authorized nearly $1
billion worth of bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Each house rejected the other's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Graves' first plan, which was financed by a large bond issue and
no tax increases, drew almost no support in either house.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's new plan was designed to thread its way between
the House and Senate approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Initially it appeared that the governor's proposal would attract
more support in the Senate than in the House.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-member panel of House and Senate negotiators is working on
the issue and is scheduled to meet on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Ballou, an Olathe Republican who is one of the House
negotiators, said he couldn't support the governor's plan because
of the tax increase and the authority to issue $995 million in
20-year bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he would vote to send the proposal to the House
floor for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Like the governor, Ballou said he sees no need for extended
debate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think by Thursday night or Friday if we don't have
something, it's all over with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Robin Jennison, a Healy Republican, said House
Republicans still don't like the idea of a gas tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what the Democrats do,'' he said. ``I can't get
63 votes on this plan (from Republicans).''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the governor's actions may help the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he called everyone in ought to break things
loose,'' Jennison said.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Jim Garner, a Coffeyville Democrat, said
his members are split on transportation. ``I can't tell which way
the wind is blowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Dick Bond, an Overland Park Republican, said
Graves' plan could be the basis for an agreement, ``and I'm
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's chief negotiator, Sen. Audrey Langworthy, a Prairie
Village Republican, said the governor's plan ``goes a long way
toward breaking a stalemate. He's just kind of showing the way for
a compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the governor's support of a tax increase for roads and
bridges could provide some political cover for lawmakers who have
dodged tax increases in the past.

LOW EXPECTATIONS AWAIT DISNEY RESULTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Sluggish performance in broadcast and home video
operations are expected to lead to a sharp decline in The Walt
Disney Co.'s quarterly earnings this week.
</P>
<P>
   Profits for the entertainment giant's second quarter ended March
31 are expected to come in at 13 cents a share, according to First
Call's survey of 19 brokers. That represents a decline of 31
percent from earnings of $384 million, or 19 cents a share, in the
1998 period.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney has not disclosed when it will release
results, but analysts believe the report could come as early as
today. Analysts believe most of the decline will come in the
creative content segment, which includes films, TV programming and
home video, with cash flow expected to decline about 30 percent
from the $389 million in the year-earlier quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Video received a boost last year from the ``The Little
Mermaid,'' while this year's period will include costs of pulling
3.4 million copies of ``The Rescuers'' because of a prankster
inserting nude photos on two frames.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasting segment, which includes ABC and ESPN, will see
cash flow fall between 10 percent and 15 percent from $374 million
in the year-ago period. ABC has been a drag on earnings since being
acquired in 1996 due to lagging ratings brought on partly by viewer
migration to cable.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research Partners said Wall
Street has grown accustomed to sluggishness in Disney's
broadcasting. ``It's a very competitive business for generating a
reasonable return on capital,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Theme parks and resorts, the strongest segment in recent
quarters, is expected to increase cash flow by 10 percent from last
year's $375 million. ``Theme parks are what Disney is good at,''
Skislock said. ``They've managed to differentiate the Florida
complex by opening Animal Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney stock, which hit a record $42.375 last May, closed up
43.75 cents at $34.9375 on Monday. The issue, a component of the
Dow Jones industrial average, has trailed other media conglomerates
such as Time Warner and Viacom in recent months, Skislock noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations have really been tempered on Disney so
there's a lot of room for an upside surprise if they beat
estimates,'' he added.

LAKERS SLIDE CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It turns out that little ditch the Lakers fell into a
few weeks back isn't just a shallow divot. It's a deep, dark,
bottomless pit. And they're plunging rapidly, dragged down by two
awesome forces _ gravity and their own negative momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have fallen so far they can't even compete for one
quarter with a team that, until Monday, was arguably as disjointed
and disastrous as they are. Instead, the Houston Rockets, inept in
recent losses to the Clippers and Mavericks, looked like world
champions in a 102-80 victory that was never in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Worse for the Lakers, they will almost certainly return to
Compaq Center in less than two weeks for the first round of the
Western Conference playoffs. The Rockets' victory pushed them 1{
games ahead of the Lakers for the fourth and final home-court slot.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers lost for the third straight time, their sixth defeat
in eight games. Afterward, it was all blank stares and profanity.
But no one had much of an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much to say,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ``We just
have to play better team ball, a little bit better defense and just
get out of this little so-called funk.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other thoughts, but O'Neal held them back, too
frustrated to give his typical ``we just have to play smart''
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of saying the same (bleeping bleep),'' he said,
looking at the floor.
</P>
<P>
   How did he feel? ``Like a (bleeping) bum. Like a bum.''
</P>
<P>
   In all corners of the locker room, the sentiment was the same.
The Lakers are burning with anger, directed at themselves and at no
one in particular. For some reason, the NBA's star-studded glamour
team has a losing record in April, with five straight losses to
playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's a little upset, everybody's a little (ticked) off,
and we have a right to be,'' Kobe Bryant said. ``We're getting our
butt kicked every day.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more, those losses are secured in the first quarter.
The Rockets quickly exploited the Lakers' new Achilles' heel _ the
fast break _ converting turnovers and defensive rebounds into easy
transition baskets for a 28-14 lead heading into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   By early in the second quarter the deficit had bulged to 20
points, but by late in the half the Lakers had cut it to 11. They
never got closer than that, though, and by halftime the Rockets had
already scored 18 fast-break points for a 51-38 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen (26 points) ran unchecked at both ends of the
floor _ grabbing five of his six steals in the half and hitting
four 3-pointers. Charles Barkley (20 points) and Hakeem Olajuwon
(14) rounded out the three-pronged execution.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' Big Three was no match. O'Neal's 19 points matched
his lowest output of the season, his worst total in two months.
Same for Bryant, who missed his first 11 shots and scored just nine
points. Glen Rice scored 16 but was torched by Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a better shooting night from Bryant would have helped. But
in the end, the Lakers' still-dysfunctional defense would have
doomed them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``No defense. Just no passion to play the game,'' Derek Harper
said. ``Just no fire to come out and play a team that we're gonna
face in the playoffs probably. How do I explain it? It's very, very
difficult to explain. . . . How do we get it? You tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they do, it has to happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't keep saying, well (bleep), we're gonna wait until we
get to the playoffs. That's bull,'' Rice said. ``You keep saying
were gonna go out and play hard and hope we turn it around in the
playoffs. We gotta turn that (bleep) around now. We need to go into
the playoffs with some type of positive momentum. Going out and
having ourselves in the hole, down 20 points, that's not right.
You're not doing the team any justice, you're not doing yourself as
an individual any justice. It's just not right. It's a (messed) up
experience.''

WHO WILL FILL VOID AS OUR HEROES RETIRE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Off they go, into the sunset, parting like it's 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A year that will live in infamy. Not for who won, but for who
left.
</P>
<P>
   There goes Michael Jordan, the best basketball player the world
has ever known, the fiercest competitor in the history of sports.
</P>
<P>
   There goes Wayne Gretzky, the elegant king of puck, the maestro
who opened America's eyes to the game of hockey.
</P>
<P>
   And there goes John Elway, poster boy for durability and
resiliency and courage.
</P>
<P>
   Three men who collectively embody every trait worth championing
in athletics. Three faces for a modern-era Mount Rushmore of
sports. And it may be a while before the monument is complete.
</P>
<P>
   As our heroes disappear, we are reminded that nothing moves
faster than time, how minutes are soon memories, and how not even
the fantasy world of sports is exempt. But in this year of closure,
the sense of loss seems profound, outweighing the inclination to
celebrate another farewell speech.
</P>
<P>
   In a previous era, there were always successors, a natural
continuum that couldn't be denied. But sports has become
complicated and messy, and so, too, have its athletes.
</P>
<P>
   They have the advantages of physical evolution and technological
advancements. One example is the wonderful career of Bobby Orr,
which was cut short due to knee injuries in the 1970s. Today, he
would've been in and out of the hospital and back in the lineup
within a week. But the mind-set has changed for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   No secret that athletes have become increasingly self-centered,
detached, overly concerned with getting paid. But you can't blame
them for following the path set before them, and every sport is
guilty of irreparable sin: marketing greatness before it is
reached, anointing and packaging heroes that don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the athletic culture is now focused on microwave
celebrities, undercooked athletes who arrive before they achieve.
And, really, what incentive is there to chase greatness when the
label is pre-packaged, diluted, oversold, handed out prematurely
and with reckless disregard?
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has already deemed Shaquille O'Neal one of its top 50
players of all time, a child who has been swept four times in the
postseason. In the midst of Gretzky's goodbye laps in Madison
Square Garden, the NHL couldn't wait to describe his handshake with
Jaromir Jagr as a symbolic passing of the torch. And in Maryland,
there is much commotion over a high school senior named Tamir
Goodman. He is deeply religious. He wears a yarmulke on the court.
He observes the Jewish Sabbath, and will never play basketball from
sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday. He will arrive at the
University of Maryland with ungodly pressure, already nicknamed
``Jewish Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   So who can rise above the muck and transcend their sport in the
next 20 years?
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rolen? Paul Kariya? Alex Rodriguez? Jake Plummer? Jason
Kidd? Randy Moss?
</P>
<P>
   Your guess is as good as mine.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Jordan retired, he couldn't hide his disdain for how
the values have changed. The league hasn't exactly perished, but in
the last three months, we have learned what Allen Iverson wants on
his tombstone: Misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?
</P>
<P>
   When Gretzky retired, the stories were endless. Like the time he
skated up ice on a rush, passed a referee and, without looking up,
calmly told the official that the opposing team had six skaters on
the ice. The referee quickly did a head count, and sure enough,
Gretzky was right. But more than anything, over the course of 20
magical years, Gretzky remained untouched by scandal or a negative
word from anyone. Like Jordan, he understood the traits that lead
to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   And now Elway. Once, he was laughable, the Charlie Brown of
football. Once, Terry Bradshaw called him a baby on national
television, challenging him to finally produce in a Super Bowl.
Elway responded by throwing his first pass into the ground, walking
off the field a 45-point loser.
</P>
<P>
   But he persisted, won two Super Bowls and leaves at the
pinnacle. He never had a Jerry Rice, a Bill Walsh or a system ahead
of its time. He took more hits than any quarterback in history, yet
missed only 15 starts in 16 years. He did more by himself than Joe
Montana ever could. For everything he endured, he became a man, the
best quarterback in history.
</P>
<P>
   For everything he conquered _ the stigma, the humiliation, the
jokes _ he walks away a genuine hero.
</P>
<P>
   And in the on-deck circle, Cal Ripken Jr. Certainly not in the
same stratosphere, an athlete whose fame is more longevity than
accomplishment. But nonetheless, he embodies the work ethic of
yesteryear and the sturdy professionalism of another era.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they're leaving us. And leaving behind a few vacant
thrones. &QL;

BOEING TRUMPETS INTENT TO CUT COSTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Boeing Co. executives promised Monday an attack on
costs to improve profitability and shareholder value at the
aerospace giant in the face of daunting challenges and competition.
</P>
<P>
   Philip M. Condit, the Seattle-based company's chairman and chief
executive officer, pledged to shareholders at Boeing's annual
meeting that the new management team knows what is broken at Boeing
and has the experience to fix it. The company, he told an audience
of about 500 at the Airport Westin Hotel, is ready for a rebound
following several years of downbeat performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has experience from the turnarounds at Ford and
Unisys, the restoration of stability at Sunstrand and GM to the
merger of the Burlington and Santa Fe (railroads),'' he said.
``These are leaders who are good at what they do, who anticipate
and act, not react. With passion and speed, we are attacking
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit's comments were long on cheerleading and short on
specifics, especially at local company facilities like Rocketdyne's
rocket engine plant in Canoga Park and the former McDonnell Douglas
jet assembly and repair operation in Long Beach. He indicated that
Long Beach's future may be focused on fixing what's already been
built.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just at the front edge of really understanding how big a
role we can have in repair and overhaul,'' Condit said in response
to a question about the sprawling former Douglas plant. ``This is
an opportunity for the future. We've got to spend some time to
understand just what the program is and how big we can grow the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   While Condit was painting a bright picture of the future, an
indication of just what bruising competition Boeing faces from
other industry players landed with a $4billion thud as European
consortium Airbus Industrie announced it would build the A318 after
receiving orders for 109 planes. The A318 short-haul airliner will
compete with the Boeing 737 and 717 models, the latter formerly
known as the MD-95 and the only McDonnell passenger jet Boeing
retained after buying that company.
</P>
<P>
   Condit was unruffled when he addressed the issue in a news
conference after the meeting. ``No single individual order makes or
breaks a program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Condit noted that carriers like Delta, American and Continental
will get all their planes from Boeing. ``That's one reason why I
don't spend very much time worrying about orders. I look at
deliveries,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus' plane is larger and more expensive than the 717. The
A318 costs $35.8million vs. $31.5million for the 717.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the 717 continues production may be decided by Deborah
C. Hopkins, the company's new senior vice president and chief
financial officer, who joined Boeing in December after holding a
similar position at General Motors Europe.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that three key measures indicate the company is now on
the right course with margins, cash and the stock price all up in
the first quarter. During the period, in which Boeing reported net
income of $469million, or 50 cents a share, operating margins
jumped from less than 1percent to 3.9percent in the commercial
division.
</P>
<P>
   But that might be hard to sustain for the rest of the year, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's new management has already identified which programs
and product lines create superior value, marginal value or no value
at all. Manufacturing operations _ military, commercial and space _
will be measured the same way, she said. The focus will be on
reducing costs and streamlining operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way we're going to run Boeing. There is a new
emphasis on performance throughout the entire company,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During the annual meeting, which Boeing plans to rotate among
its key operational centers, shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a
proposal to adopt basic human rights criteria for the company's
business operations in the People's Republic of China. Condit said
there is vast potential in that market and favors China becoming a
member of the World Trade Organization.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like Clark Kent whipping off the glasses and
loosening the knot in his tie, the Los Angeles Clippers have been
on the prowl for justice.
</P>
<P>
   It's the NBA way. But on Monday night, they showed the San
Antonio Spurs all the truth they'll ever need.
</P>
<P>
   After winning 25 of their 29 games, the Spurs (32-12) rolled
into the Sports Arena, built a 33-point lead, watched a motley
platoon of Clips knock it down to six in the fourth quarter, then
held on to win 94-88 in front of 8,260.
</P>
<P>
   It was San Antonio's seventh consecutive victory and corrupted a
Clippers winning streak that had peaked at two.
</P>
<P>
   But the home team, up to its ears in grit lately, rallied behind
Eric Piatkowski (27 points) and a few irregulars from the Clippers'
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Before the excitement, the Clips (9-36), who had won six of
their last 11 games, jumped out to a 7-0 deficit and acted like
they'd never look forward. They did squint for a bit, achieving a
20-20 deadlock at the 3:09 mark in round one when Piatkowski nailed
a 3-point push off a fast-break feed from Troy Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, who was liberated from the CBA several weeks ago, was
making his first NBA start because of the bum ankle of point guard
Sherman Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Douglas might have contributed to the Clippers'
33-percent field-goal disaster in the opening half, but the Spurs'
defense should absorb most of the guilt.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, let's look up at San Antonio's Twin Towers,
7-foot-1 David Robinson and 7-0 Tim Duncan. Robinson, by the way,
was making his last appearance at the Sports Arena, where he scored
71 points in a victory over the Clippers on April 24, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers countered with their Split-Level Condos, 6-8
Maurice Taylor and 7-0 rookie Michael Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   While Robinson didn't exactly intimidate Olowokandi (10 points,
seven rebounds in the first half), Duncan, who turned 23 on Sunday,
was quite the obstruction for Taylor. Carrying a 26-point-per-game
average over the last five games, Taylor missed nine of his 11
shots in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs ended the half when Duncan _ their
MVP-on-training-wheels _ tipped a 50-foot pass to Antonio Daniels,
who was fouled but converted the layup and free throw to make it
62-37 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter was just as ugly at the beginning, with the
Spurs' lead reaching 33 at 77-44. But with rookie Brian Skinner _
whose wife, Rebecca, gave birth to Avery Ann Alexes Skinner early
in the day _ providing a nasty presence inside, the Clippers did
manage a 16-0 run.

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The Suns did more than win a game here Monday
night. And their 99-85 drubbing of the Utah Jazz represents more
than just a nice road victory over the team with the NBA's best
record.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns also may have shed a label.
</P>
<P>
   Never regarded as one of the NBA's tougher, more physical team,
the Suns showed at the Delta Center they're willing to bang with
the best.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing without power forward Tom Gugliotta, the Suns
did more than match Utah's physical style. They beat the Jazz up at
their own game.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns whipped the Jazz on the boards, they gummed up Utah's
offense by fighting through picks and jamming cutters, and on the
offensive end they took the ball strong to the basket, outscoring
Utah, 36-24, in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rex Chapman torched them from afar, hitting three of four
three-point shots and nine of 16 shots overall, leading the Suns to
their third straight win with 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had that soft label for a long time,'' said Suns guard
Jason Kidd, who was so exhausted by effects of a cold that he
almost vomited late in the third quarter. ``We're going to get rid
of that `Valley of the Sun soft' label.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took their best shot and kept going after them. I think
everybody talks about Utah being physical, and we're not known for
it. But we're changing that. When we're the instigators, like we
were tonight, we win a lot of ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the physical tone to be set.
</P>
<P>
   Bad blood existed before the game. Last time the Suns visited
Utah, Phoenix lost center Luc Longley for seven games because of a
hypertextended left knee. Longley accused Utah's Karl Malone of
intentionally going after the knee.
</P>
<P>
   They picked up their discussion early, exchanging words after
Longley was called for an offensive foul for ramming into Malone.
Then with just over a minute to go in the first quarter, Longley's
backup and buddy, Joe Kleine, took a hard elbow from Malone as
Malone put up a shot near the basket.
</P>
<P>
   No foul was called on either Malone or Kleine, but Kleine's face
was a bloody mess. He stalked down court, caught up with Malone,
yelled at him and gave him a shove, steaking Malone's jersey with
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Kleine was called for a technical, and Malone had to leave the
floor to change his jersey. Kleine probably wished he had gotten
off so easily. He was taken to Lakeview Hospital in nearby
Bountiful, where Dr. Richard Kjar,
</P>
<P>
   a plastic surgeon, used 30 stitches to repair Kleine's lower
lip. He also was to be checked for a broken nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go into it,'' Longley said of his encounter
with Malone. ``I've said my piece. I will say this is my favorite
place in the world to get a win. I don't want to continue that
rubbish talk.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of Malone's elbow to Kleine's chops?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was fairly typical,'' Longley said. ``We just
heard Joe is having plastic surgery, getting his face repaired.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he didn't know what happened to Kleine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to the basket and he stuck his nose in there,''
Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Suns Coach Danny Ainge refused to comment on the incident,
saying he didn't see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe needed plastic surgery anyway,'' Ainge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad they didn't call the foul on Joe for hitting
Karl in the elbow with his face,'' Chapman added. ``I loved what
Joe did.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident seemed to inspire the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's part of the family,'' Kidd said. ``He thought it was a
cheap shot, so we all feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it was Malone and the Jazz who backed off. After
scoring 10 first-quarter points, Malone would get only 11 more. The
Jazz, who shot 71 percent in that first quarter, shot 35.6 percent
the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They trapped us and did a lot of things to take us out of our
offense,'' Utah Coach Jerry Sloan said. ``We never could get
anything going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns used a 19-4 burst in the final six minutes of the third
quarter to take control. Kidd scored 10 of his 19 points in the run
and was doubled over as the period ended.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:53 to play, Chapman popped open and hit a 22-foot jumper.
Ainge yelled from the bench, ``Ballgame!''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Utah was through. &QL;

ERSTAD HOMER WINS FOR ANGELS

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mo Vaughn hit, Chuck Finley pitched, but the
rest of the Angels could do little Monday night _ until the 11th
inning, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad hit a leadoff homer off Nerio Rodriguez to give the
Angels a 4-3 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays before 17,324 at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Troy Percival got the victory for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Through nine innings, the Angels were 2 for 12 with runners in
scoring position _ both hits belonging to Vaughn and worth two RBI.
The Angels' other run scored on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Finley gave up three runs and five hits in 62/3 innings, his
best outing of the year, but did not figure in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The first few innings were similar to the just-concluded road
trip for the Angels _ plenty of scoring opportunities that were
wasted.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, the Angels had runners on first and third
with one out. On a 3-2 pitch, Tim Salmon hit the ball up the
middle. But because Randy Velarde broke from first on the pitch,
second baseman Pat Kelly was at the bag to field the ball, step on
second and throw to first for the inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, the Angels had runners on first and second with
two out when Troy Glaus grounded a single to right field. The
problem for the Angels was that the player on second was Vaughn,
who _ on a tender left ankle _ was held up by third-base coach
Larry Bowa.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Greene then struck out with the bases loaded to end the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels finally broke through on Vaughn's two-out single to
left field in the fifth, making manager Terry Collins look like a
prophet.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Collins talked about Vaughn as a hitter: ``One
thing that impressed me in spring training was I don't know how
many times he hit the ball to left field with two outs to drive in
a run.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, who went from first to third on Vaughn's single, scored
on a wild pitch later in the inning to give the Angels a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Finley rolled along. He set down the Blue Jays in
order the first three innings. Through six, Finley allowed only one
Blue Jays baserunner to reach second base. He struck out the side
in the third and did not walk anybody. He even got a Jim
Edmonds-like catch from center fielder Garret Anderson, who robbed
Mike Matheny of extra bases with a running catch while crashing
into the fence.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley got his first taste of trouble in the seventh. He
began the inning by hitting Carlos Delgado with a pitch, then
walked Tony Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   After pitching coach Dick Pole paid a visit to the mound, Finley
struck out Alex Gonzalez for the first out of the inning. But
Anthony Sanders, who got his first career major-league hit earlier
in the game, lined a 3-2 pitch into the left-field corner for a
two-run double to tie the game at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek replaced Finley but gave up an RBI single to
Shannon Stewart and the Blue Jays had a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, though, wouldn't allow Finley to get the loss, his RBI
double in the bottom of the seventh scoring Velarde from first to
tie the game at 3. Vaughn, who hobbled to second, was replaced by
pinch runner Tim Unroe.

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ After the first wave of television cameras and
microphones began to pull away, Louie DeBrusk thought he'd finally
be able to stop holding that towel around his waist and get to
scoot into the shower.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't happen for at least another 45 minutes. There was a
second wave of interviews, then a third and a fourth. It was the
longest post-game chat session of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In another corner, right wing Stephen Leach held court for a few
minutes here, a few minutes there, and then for quite a few more
after he shaved and showered.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the locker room door, center Brian Noonan was
stopped and grilled by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   And while all this was going on, after the Coyotes managed to
stave off a torrid rally Sunday by the St. Louis Blues in Game 3 of
their Western Conference quarterfinal series, the team's general
manager, Bobby Smith, was cornered by another media mob asking him
questions about all three of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan, Leach and DeBrusk. Three role players and reserves. A
trio of veterans who spent most of the regular season in different
minor league cities, playing in relative obscurity. A Tom, Dick and
Harry who quietly slip out of the locker room unnoticed after
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all Stanley Cup playoff heroes tonight,'' Smith
said, beaming after the three players helped the Coyotes to a 5-4
victory and a 2-1 series lead over the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 is today at 4:30 p.m. in the Kiel Center, and if the
Coyotes can get another performance from their growing band of
unsung upstarts, they can put St. Louis on the brink of elimination
with Game 5 scheduled for Friday at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that. Three players dumped and forgotten by other NHL
teams, relocating in the right place at the right time, and giving
this franchise a shot in the arm to do something it hasn't done in
12 years _ win a first-round playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   All, for the most part, because they're getting a chance to play
because of injuries to Jeremy Roenick, Juha Ylonen and Greg Adams,
who might be back tonight after missing Games 2 and 3 because of a
pulled groin.
</P>
<P>
   But they say that's how it happens sometimes in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, absolutely,'' said St. Louis defenseman Al MacInnis, who
just completed his 18th season in the league. ``You need all four
lines trying to contribute. It's not always the (Pavol) Demitras
and the (Keith) Tkachuks. It's guys chipping in from all over, and
that's how you're successful and that's what you need to win in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need guys chipping in like those guys did for them, and we
need guys from our third and fourth lines chipping in as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach, 33, signed as a free agent in January three months after
being released by the Ottawa Senators, got the Coyotes running in
Game 3 here on Sunday. He set up Dallas Drake with a perfect drop
pass, which Drake buried for the first of four goals that would
chase goalie Grant Fuhr by the start of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played great, hasn't he?'' Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld
said. ``Unbelievable. High energy, he's finishing his checks, he's
been very responsible in the defensive zone, and he's created some
good offensive opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goal he set up for Dally was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   So was the first of two scores Noonan set up for DeBrusk that
gave the Coyotes a 4-0 lead. Noonan slid the puck right where
DeBrusk needed it, and the tough guy who hadn't scored a goal since
1997 _ and just six since 1994 _ ripped a slap shot that went
between Fuhr's legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got caught moving out on that one,'' Fuhr said.
</P>
<P>
   When Noonan fed DeBrusk a second time for a long, bouncing shot
he fired from near the red line, Fuhr was speechless. So was
DeBrusk, 28, who joined the Coyotes last summer from Tampa Bay as a
virtual throw-in player when Phoenix traded away center Craig
Janney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm always surprised when it goes in the net, you know
what I mean?'' DeBrusk said. ``I think I'm the first one to say,
`Is it really in?' It takes me a second to kind of register, `Yeah,
it's in the net. I scored a goal.' I'm not a big scorer, obviously.
If you look at my stats, they don't lie.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBrusk had zero points in 15 games with the Coyotes amid 13
call-ups, demotions and reassignments.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto with Noonan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get a chance to contribute,'' Noonan said.
``Obviously, you don't like to see anybody get injured. But when
somebody does get hurt, it's chance for someone like myself to get
to play. It's nice to be out there again. I haven't been in the
playoffs the past couple years, and it's nice to be a part of it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same for Leach. When Smith brought him to Phoenix, he
told Leach there were no guarantees, that he might have to spend
the rest of the year down on the farm. But Leach has played as well
as anyone in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a chance to play, you have to play hard,'' he
said. ``But it's a long series. You just have to stay focused. All
of us.''

 By FRAN BLINEBURY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BASED on the way the two contestants had been stumbling down the
stretch run of the NBA's add-hot-water-and-eat Cup O' Season, this
was a case of the lame beating the infirm. Or the see-no-evil
monkey getting the better of the speak-no-evil monkey.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rockets-Lakers in a national cable encounter on the (We'll Soon
Be) History Channel. The producers could have simulated the game by
shoving a piano and a safe off the roof of a 10-story building to
see which would hit the ground first and break into more pieces.
</P>
<P>
   For the scientific record, it would be a tie. Newton's law. For
the basketball record, it was the Lakers who had to be swept up off
the floor with a broom after getting shattered into so many tiny
bits. Which can happen when one team plays like a bear and the
other barely plays. Naismith's law.
</P>
<P>
   So put the jumper cables on the bandwagon and get ready to
string those championship banners from the street lights again.
</P>
<P>
   There was Cuttino Mobley setting the tone for the evening by
stealing a pass from Shaquille O'Neal and hustling to the other end
to convert a three-point play. Then Mobley came right back to pick
the pocket of Derek Fisher and go all the way in for a fast-break
dunk.
</P>
<P>
   There were the Rockets running all night long like they were
being chased by hounds from hell. Scottie Pippen active, alive,
jumping and sparking all over the court like a live wire to get in
the passing lanes with those long arms, reaching in with those
quick hands to disrupt so much of what the Lakers were trying.
Pippen getting his own offense started by taking _ and making _
3-pointers on his way to a 26-point night.
</P>
<P>
   There was Charles Barkley acting like a bowling ball smashing
into a set of tenpins, controlling the boards, dominating on the
inside, bending and then folding Robert Horry more than a piece of
origami. Chuck took Horry down on the blocks and spun by him. He
pulled up right in Horry's face and double-pumped in a banker from
20 feet. He even grinned at a one-on-one challenge against the
mountainous Shaq and then drilled a step-back jumper.
</P>
<P>
   There were the Rockets playing defense like they were a bunch of
kids who had just unwrapped their newest birthday toy. They
displayed energy and enthusiasm and the kind of intensity that made
them look like the halftime entertainment _ Destiny's Child.
</P>
<P>
   But it will matter only if they can do it again the next time
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't come out focused for this one,'' said coach Rudy
Tomjanovich, ``then we don't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely.
</P>
<P>
   This had all the trappings, every bell and whistle you could ask
for. A game against a high-profile (though underachieving) team
with the Rockets feeling mad and a bit embarrassed at what had
preceded it. Namely three straight losses to the Mavericks,
Clippers and Suns that would barely have registered on a heart
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   This was Shaq, Kobe Bryant and the rest of NBC's team coming
into the Laptop trying to sort out their own problems with a likely
playoff matchup between the teams looming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not big on sending messages,'' Rudy T said. ``We just
needed a win.''
</P>
<P>
   So they applied a tourniquet and stopped the femoral artery from
spurting like a fire hose. Now the question remains how to keep
burning the fire that allowed the Rockets to smoke LA on fast-break
points 26-4 and win the battle of the boards 42-36.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Rockets the way we have seen them on several
occasions this year, most recently against Portland on April 15.
They are quite capable. They are very dangerous. In fact, if the
fight for the NBA championship were just one game, it would be
unwise to pick against them. As this night proved.
</P>
<P>
   But it matters only if they carry the momentum out of this one
through the last five games on the regular-season schedule. Only if
they don't feel like they got the puzzle figured out and keep on
striving.
</P>
<P>
   The precocious Kobe will not miss his first 10 shots in every
playoff game, and Glen Rice won't shoot just 2-for-5 on treys
throughout the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very big game for us,'' said Hakeem Olajuwon. ``But
it wasn't the last game. Just like if we'd lost, it wouldn't have
been the end of the season, winning doesn't mean we are done moving
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``A championship team continues to grow and build upon a
foundation. We have thought we had the foundation other times this
year, then we slacked off. Not purposefully. Still, it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   For an evening, they were every X and each O drawn perfectly.
They were the lab experiment that came off flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   But the mighty Mavs come back to town Thursday, then Utah on
Friday. This matters only if it wasn't a one-night show.
</P>

FANS CAN HEAR, NOT SEE, KENTUCKY DERBY ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the events that lend themselves to dynamic streaming
video presentation, the Kentucky Derby has to be one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   It's a two-minute race, perfect for online viewing. And with
cameras all over Churchill Downs, the technology is in place.
</P>
<P>
   But expect audio only for the 125th Run for the Roses on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Schmitt, senior vice president of communications at
Churchill Downs, said ABC TV's broadcast rights prohibit the use of
a cybercast on the track's official site (www.kentuckyderby.com).
</P>
<P>
   And that's a shame, said Schmitt, who also believes that a
cybercast of the race would make for good online video.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think so,'' he said. ``Someday we'll be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Derby site will have to settle for an audio
description of the race, available through Dallas-based
Broadcast.com. Last year, the site attracted 10,000 listeners,
Schmitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works out great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Audio is only one of the attractions at the track's 5-year-old
site. Schmitt said the site's traffic has doubled in the past year
because of better design, more updates of Derby contenders and
stakes races and the introduction of a historical section. Schmitt
also said he hopes that the site will have a Java-powered tote
board with live odds.
</P>
<P>
   Other features include a daily poll, tips for Derby parties, a
horse racing primer, a tutorial available for downloading on how to
read a racing program, workout information and a link to the Derby
auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who come to our site in the past have demonstrated they
want updated information about the horses, some historical
information, and they want to experience the beauty and splendor of
the Derby, and even how to put on a Derby party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DERBY SITES: More about the Derby can be found at the Daily
Racing Form's site (www.drf2000.com) and Blood-Horse Interactive
(www.bloodhorse.com).
</P>
<P>
   At drf2000.com, users can access statistics, future book odds
and commentary. Blood-Horse Interactive is devoted to breeding and
blood lines.

<P>
   BEST LIVING BALLPLAYER: Now that Joe DiMaggio has passed on, CBS
SportsLine has decided that the title of ``Greatest Living
Ballplayer'' is up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than let sportswriters wax on about this, CBS SportsLine
is letting readers decide with a Historical Matchup Tournament.
Fans can vote for eight seeded position players in a bracket format
(No. 1 vs. No. 8, No. 2 vs. No. 7, and so on).
</P>
<P>
   The players are Ted Williams, Willie Mays, Stan Musial, Hank
Aaron, Ken Griffey Jr., Mike Schmidt, Frank Robinson and Joe
Morgan.

ERSTAD BLOW WINS FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Finally, someone other than Mo Vaughn got a
hit when it mattered for the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad hit the first pitch thrown by Toronto Blue Jays
reliever Nerio Rodriguez over the right-field fence in the bottom
of the 11th inning to give the Angels a 4-3 victory Monday night
before 17,324 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Through 10 innings, the Angels' offense consisted of an RBI
single by Vaughn, an RBI double by Vaughn and a run that scored on
a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But Erstad's homer _ his second of the season _ left no doubt,
easily clearing the fence in right at an estimated at 400 feet. It
was the first game-winning homer by an Angel at Edison Field since
April 23, 1997, when Jim Edmonds homered in the 10th inning against
the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival (1-1), who pitched a scoreless 11th inning, got
the victory over Rodriguez (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Erstad said he hopes his home run was worth more than just one
victory, that it is an indication that things will turn around for
a team that entered Monday's game 1-6 in one-run games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any win's big, but we've been playing poorly without intensity
or heart,'' he said. ``After getting a win like this, in a tough
game, it's a good sign we're headed in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight the whole team came out with intensity, which is
something we've been lacking. We've got to go out every night and
play like this. It's something we haven't had this year.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't appear to have it early, however. The first few
innings were similar to the just-concluded road trip for the Angels
_ plenty of scoring opportunities that were wasted.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, the Angels had runners on first and third
with one out and didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, the Angels had runners on first and second with
two out when Troy Glaus grounded a single to right field. The
problem for the Angels was that the player on second was Vaughn,
who _ on a tender left ankle _ was held up by third-base coach
Larry Bowa. Todd Greene then struck out with the bases loaded to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hitting is going to come along,'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said. ``The guys are working hard, hitting early (in
batting practice), looking at tape. That's one thing we can do _
swing the bats.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels finally broke through in the fifth on a two-out
single to left field by Vaughn. Erstad, who went from first to
third on Vaughn's single, scored on a wild pitch later in the
inning to give the Angels a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Angels starter Chuck Finley rolled along. He set down
the Blue Jays in order in the first three innings. Through six,
Finley allowed only one Blue Jays baserunner to reach second base.
He struck out the side in the third and did not walk anybody. He
even got an Edmonds-like catch from center fielder Garret Anderson,
who robbed Mike Matheny of extra bases with a running catch while
crashing into the fence.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley got his first taste of trouble in the seventh. He
began the inning by hitting Carlos Delgado with a pitch, then
walked Tony Fernandez. One out later, Anthony Sanders lined a
two-run double to left to tie the game at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek replaced Finley and gave up an RBI single to
Shannon Stewart as the Blue Jays took a 3-2 lead. Finley's line was
his best of the season _ 62/3 innings, three runs, five hits, seven
strikeouts, two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn tied it with his RBI double in the seventh, setting the
stage for Erstad to win it. A sign of things to come?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' Erstad said. ``We've been pretty flat lately. We
haven't been playing very well, myself included.''

TWINS BEAT RED SOX

 BBA-RED SOX-TWINS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ One bad pitch is all it takes to ruin Tim
Wakefield's day. The Red Sox knuckleballer threw a dandy Monday
night, and a Minnesota Twins rookie made him pay.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect offering _ a high knuckler _ took wing with the
bases loaded in the fourth inning. Center fielder Torii Hunter's
grand slam sent the Twins on their way to a 6-2 victory at the
Metrodome, ending Minnesota's four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was Hunter's third of the season and first major
league grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made one mistake,'' said Wakefield, who gave up all six
Minnesota runs on five hits over 5 1/3 innings. ``And it cost me a
ballgame. I threw some good pitches, but the one that didn't come
out right got hit. It just happened to be a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wakefield, the loss was his third in a row after a
season-opening victory.
</P>
<P>
   Though he did himself in by giving up the slam, Wakefield didn't
get much help from his teammates. The Red Sox had eight hits
against Brad Radke in six innings, but could get only one run
against the Twins starter. Boston took a 1-0 lead in the first
inning on a single by Jose Offerman and a double by John Valentin.
They didn't score again until the ninth, when Reggie Jefferson hit
a homer off reliever Mike Trombley. It was Jefferson's first homer
since June 26, and his first ever in the Metrodome. Boston left 12
runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit the ball good,'' said manager Jimy Williams. ``And
we're going in the right direction in that we're hitting the ball
hard and we made some hard outs. Radke pitched good when he had to
and changed speeds. He can pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also was impressed by his own starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Wakefield was pretty good,'' said the manager. ``He
came back and struck out two guys in that (fourth) inning. But the
ball he threw to Hunter was up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter followed the advice of his manager, Tom Kelly, in
swinging at the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``T.K. keeps telling us about an old saying about
knuckleballs,'' said the rookie. ``He told everybody, `If it's
high, let it fly. If it's low, let it go.' This one was up, so I
swung.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield left in the sixth _ with two runners aboard, for whom
he was responsible. Ron Coomer led off with a single, and after a
one-out walk to Terry Steinbach, Wakefield was replaced by Tim
Harikkala. The reliever retired Chad Allen but proceeded to give up
run-scoring singles to Hunter and Denny Hocking.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield did not consider the night a total loss, saying he
threw longer and better than in his last two outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked with (pitching coach) Joe Kerrigan on my mechanics,
and I was solid tonight,'' said Wakefield. ``I was getting a better
turn. Obviously, the ball was moving quite a bit. Jason (Varitek)
had a lot of trouble behind the plate.'' The Sox catcher had two
passed balls.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of hope for the Red Sox came in the form of a
fifth-inning single by Trot Nixon, who started his first game in a
week and ended an 0-for-24 streak.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon tried out a new batting stance in which his hands are down
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried it for the first time today and I feel very
comfortable,'' he said. ``I just eliminate all the movement I had
before. That's probably where the problems were.''

MOEHLER PROVES A PAIN TO MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After a fairly relaxed weekend in Florida, the
Mariners returned to face the Detroit Tigers at the Kingdome Monday
night. They should have gone straight to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   They had this Moehler that was bugging them _ Detroit's Brian
Moehler.
</P>
<P>
   For seven innings, the home club couldn't bite down on anything
hard against the thickly built right-hander from North Carolina and
went on to lose 7-0 to open an eight-game homestand before a crowd
of 25,465.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler outdid the Mariners' new $15 million man, Jamie Moyer,
who was making his first appearance since agreeing to a rich
two-year contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers pitcher was much cheaper and better, scattering seven
harmless singles over his seven innings of duty. He was so
efficient, he threw just 87 pitches, 55 for strikes, and didn't
walk anyone. No one even reached third base on him.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Moehler (3-2) didn't do was go the distance. He
was fine with that. The Mariners certainly weren't sorry to see him
sit down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe with a seven-run lead, there's no point in throwing
another 40 pitches,'' the pitcher said. ``I could have finished.
I'll save it for my next start.''
</P>
<P>
   Moehler changed speeds. He hit spots. He even balked several
times _ and got away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the fourth inning, the Mariners accused Moehler of
balking during his windup. They said he separated his arms while
toeing the rubber and looking for the catcher's sign, a baseball
no-no.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey was the first to complain. Mariner manager Lou
Piniella was next. Detroit manager Larry Parrish walked out on the
field three times to chat with the umps before everything
apparently was settled to everyone's satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they weren't going to call it a balk, we were going to keep
letting Moehler do it,'' Parrish said, explaining that his starter
was trying to keep from tipping his pitches as he had in pervious
outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said technically I was balking,'' Moehler said. ``They
were right.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Huskey: ``He owes us at least four bases. I'm not a
base-stealer, but it was throwing me off when he got set.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners needed more than four more bases to make it a game
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 235-pound Moehler was in trouble only twice, and
they were mild disturbances. He got out of both with relative ease.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, Moehler put two runners on base for the
first time, with two outs. He quickly snuffed that threat by making
David Segui pop out to third baseman Dean Palmer, who circled and
made the catch on the top of the pitcher's mound.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling Mariner frustration, Segui flung his black bat away
with such disgust it bounced all the way to the backstop,
ricocheting off the padded wall.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, the Mariners had runners on first and second
with one out, but Moehler got out of it with a pair of lazy
groundballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing bothers him too much,'' Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was changing speeds,'' said Huskey, who got three of the
Mariners' seven hits off Moehler. ``That's a couple of our
pitchers' game. Move the ball up and down. He was on tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer (1-3) was not. Seattle's highest-paid pitcher ever gave up
solo home runs by Juan Encarnacion and Karim Garcia among the five
runs he permitted. He left after seven innings, responsible for 11
of Detroit's season-high 15 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't particularly sharp,'' Piniella said of his starter.
``I've seen him pitch better.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the long ball, Moyer also gave up runs on an Encarnacion
single in the second inning, Bobby Higginson's run-scoring single
in the fifth and Garcia's RBI single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Moyer beat Moehler twice in head-to-head matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly, the Mariners now have just one victory in 10
starts this season by their top two pitchers, Moyer and Jeff
Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   From this tepid effort, there was one encouraging play by a
Seattle guy. Right fielder Jay Buhner, showing no sign of offseason
elbow surgery, threw out his first runner of the season, Dean
Palmer, who was trying to score from second base in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, it was just a temporary filling.

CONSERVATION GROUP HAS SURPRISING BEEF WITH MEAT INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By GLEN MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ Environmentally speaking, the worst thing you
can do for the planet is drive your sport utility vehicle to the
local steak house for a prime sirloin.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That, at least, is the contention of the Union of Concerned
Scientists, an environmental advocacy group that has just completed
a new analysis of the ecological costs of various activities and
products.
</P>
<P>
   It perhaps comes as no startling revelation that automobiles are
at the top of the organization's list of environmentally damaging
products. But what is a surprise is that meat comes in at number
two.
</P>
<P>
   The industrial production of beef, poultry and pork pollutes
waterways and air, fouls the land and gobbles up valuable
resources, said Warren Leon, deputy director of the Massachusetts
environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   But other supposedly damaging products _ such as plastic grocery
bags or polyester clothing _ are relatively benign, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To compile the list, the Union of Concerned Scientists compared
consumer spending patterns with their effect on four broad
environmental problems _ global warming, air and water pollution
and the alteration of natural habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Leon, who co-authored a book based on the study titled ``The
Consumer's Guide to Effective Environmental Choices,'' said
researchers divided ``everything people buy and use'' into 50
categories. ``What we found is that the most harmful activities or
products fall into seven of the 50 categories we studied,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leon, who is on a national tour to promote the book, talked
about the findings at a meeting of San Francisco's Commonwealth
Club Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacture and use of cars and light trucks were at the top
of the list. ``That was about what we expected,'' Leon said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, cars account for 3.7 tons of greenhouse gas emissions
per household each year. And they are responsible for a quarter of
all common air pollutants, such as particulates and ozone, and 45
percent of airborne toxins, such as benzene and formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   But Leon said researchers were surprised when meat production
showed up second only to vehicles in terms of environmental
destruction. ``We knew meat production would have some kind of
impact, but we didn't expect it to be so significant.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of water pollution, said Leon, beef is 17 times more
damaging than all that goes into making pasta. This is because of
water pollution from manure, as well as the amount of electrical
energy, fuel, fertilizer and pesticides needed to raise cattle
fodder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contamination to the nation's waterways from manure
run-off is extremely serious,'' he said. ``Twenty tons of livestock
manure are produced for every household in the country. We have
strict laws governing the disposal of human waste, but the
regulations are lax, or often nonexistent, for animal waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Beef production is also 20 times more damaging to wildlife
habitat than pasta production, said Leon, because it uses far more
land.
</P>
<P>
   Poultry is somewhat easier on the environment than beef or pork,
Leon said. ``Chickens are able to convert feed to meat more
efficiently than cattle or hogs, so they ultimately contribute less
pollution per pound of meat produced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   George Gough, the vice president of government relations for the
California Cattlemen's Association, said cattle can have a negative
effect on water quality if they are not properly managed, but he
said the state's ranchers are committed to sound practices.
</P>
<P>
   He also said not all animal husbandry is the same in its
environmental effect. ``Huge commercial hog farms are more likely
to have a serious impact than range cattle,'' Gough said.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables, fruits and grains are third on the group's list
because their cultivation usually entails large quantities of
pesticides, herbicides, artificial fertilizers and irrigation
water.
</P>
<P>
   The other worst offenders are: home heating, air conditioning
and water heating; household appliances and lighting; home
construction; and household water and sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Some products that have long been assumed to be environmental
bugbears _ such as plastic grocery bags _ came away with a
relatively clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paper or plastic _ it doesn't make any difference,'' Leon
said. ``Each accounts for about the same amount of resources
expenditure, and the typical household uses only a few pounds a
year. Compared to 150 gallons of gas per car or 20 tons of manure
per household, that's nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor should consumers fret about choosing between cotton and
polyester, fashion considerations aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both have their downsides,'' Leon said. ``So does wool _ sheep
exert an impact on the land, and wool clothes are usually
dry-cleaned, which involves toxic chemicals. (But) compared to
other categories, clothes aren't that serious of a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is an environmentally minded consumer to do? The
environmental damage caused by essential products, such as food,
cannot be eliminated, Leon said, but they can be substantially
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food will always remain a resource-intensive industry, but we
can ease the burden on the environment by buying organic produce
and eating less meat,'' he said. ``It doesn't have to be an all or
nothing proposition. You don't have to turn vegetarian _ just
cutting back a hamburger or two a week can really help.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should also think of the environment when buying a
car, Leon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to get a tiny subcompact,'' he said. ``We found
that for any given size and type of vehicle, there is a 20 to 50
percent difference in fuel efficiency, depending on the make. You
just have to shop around.''
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer products represent a net gain for the environment,
Leon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microwave ovens consume far less electricity than standard
ranges, and new refrigerators are three times more energy efficient
than models from 25 years ago,'' he said. ``People should buy them
with clear consciences.''

   1. MILOSEVIC'S CLOSEST ENEMY by BLAINE HARDEN From The New York
Times Magazine The Balkans region desperately needs a hero, and
Montenegro's President Djukanovic is perhaps the one leader whom
the West can rally around. Yet NATO bombs have changed all that.
They have belied Djukanovic's promise to voters that a turn to the
West would produce peace and wealth. Instead, the bombs have
emboldened his enemies, possibly tipping the balance in the wicked
game of chicken he is playing with the Serbian dictator Slobodan
Milosevic.
---------------------------------------------------------------- 2.
``A MILITARY ALLIANCE, AND MORE'' by Tony Blair, an Op-Ed from the
New York Times In commemoration of NATO's 50th anniversary
celebration, the British prime minister writes that there is every
reason for the current action in Kosovo inasmuch as the group
should be a moral federation, not just a military alliance.
----------------------------------------------------------------3.
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER EVGUENI PRIMAKOV by
MAREK HALTER - text in French only
----------------------------------------------------------------4.
CARVILLE WORKS THE TEL AVIV WAR ROOM by ADAM NAGOURNEY From The New
York Times Magazine
</P>
<P>
   James Carville and Arthur Finkelstein are two of the most famous
- and different - American political consultants in international
demand today. Both of them are top operatives in the May 17 Israeli
elections - Carville representing Ehud Barak, the main opponent to
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is, in turn, a client of
Finkelstein. (And yes, Mary Matalin is for Netanyahu.)
----------------------------------------------------------------5.
REPORTING LIVE, FROM A WAR ZONE By PETER GODWIN From The New York
Times Magazine ``The backstage truth is that no matter how
tenderhearted reporters may be at the outset, any capacity for
empathy is all but drowned by the sheer flow of suffering during
wartime. Most war reporters must cultivate a controlled
schizophrenia to survive. We develop a sang froid, a mordant humor
and a studied machismo, much the same way that cops and ER doctors
do.''
----------------------------------------------------------------6.
CHILE WAITS FOR THE PINOCHET VERDICT By Tomas Eloy Martinez 70% of
the Chileans do not feel any compassion toward the ex-dictator, 10
% are indifferent, and another 20% want him to return untouched to
London. It is difficult to discern if those who defend Pinochet do
so because they believe in justice or because they are looking out
for their own interest.
----------------------------------------------------------------7.
DURING TRAGEDIES, THE TV REPORTER IS NOT A LOVING FRIEND by Janna
Malamud Smith - an Op-Ed from the New York Times The author, a
clinical social worker, writes on how television has taken up the
longstanding role of confessor in our culture and wonders whether
this will have any longterm psychological effects on the children
of Littleton, Colorado.
----------------------------------------------------------------8.
``WE ARE GETTING CLOSER TO OUR GOAL'' From Der Spiegel - An
in-depth interview with German Defence Minister Rudolf Scharping on
the moral justification of the war, the aims of NATO and Yugoslavia
without Slobodan Milosevic.
----------------------------------------------------------------9.
LOST FOR WORDS by Julie Clayton From New Scientist Reading is a
nightmare for millions of children. Dyslexia seems to be caused by
a breakdown in the way sensory nerves develop in the fetal brain.
Can a controversial new theory explain why? Could the mother's
immune system be to blame?

 SOUNDS SHADY, BUT DESIGNER SUNGLASSES ON NET A REAL DEAL
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BOSTON _ If we told you we could get you a pair of designer
sunglasses at 30 percent off retail, you'd probably say, ``What's
the catch?''
</P>
<P>
   The catch is you have to buy them over the Internet, as we did a
couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know this doesn't sound so bad, given that companies
these days are selling everything from books to mortgages over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But most manufacturers of high-priced sunglasses warn customers
to stay away from Internet sales. They view Internet retailers as
the cyber equivalent of the street-corner hustler hawking
merchandise of dubious origin and quality out of a suitcase. They
scorn the dozens of Web sites selling big names like Serengeti,
Ray-Ban, Revo, Vuarnet, and Maui Jim at steep discounts.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site, Bausch &AMP; Lomb, the maker of Ray-Bans, says it
prohibits the sales of its sunglasses over the Internet. The
company warns consumers that they may end up with counterfeits or
defective merchandise if they buy from anyone other than an
authorized retailer, which in the Boston area is the chain of
Sunglass Hut stores. Other manufacturers refuse to honor warranties
if their product is purchased over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But as we found out, not all designer shades on the Internet are
fakes. We also learned that Bausch &AMP; Lomb, at least, had no idea
how much cyberspace peddling of its products was going on, even
among groups with links to its authorized dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, we bought two pairs of Ray-Ban Predator 9
sunglasses (model number W2967) from two randomly selected Web
sites _ apairofshades.com and shadesrus.com. We paid $71.95 and
$69.95, respectively, for sunglasses that would have cost more than
$100 each at Sunglass Hut.
</P>
<P>
   The sunglasses looked like the real thing, but just to be sure
we sent them off to Bausch &AMP; Lomb, and the Rochester, N.Y., firm
confirmed their authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got lucky,'' said Barbara Kelley, vice president of
communications at Bausch &AMP; Lomb, after her staff examined them.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley still insisted Internet retailers shouldn't be trusted
because they are either acquiring their Ray-Bans through improper
channels or selling fakes or discontinued styles. She said the
company may investigate, but it's a time-consuming process to trace
counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
   The two cyber-retailers we bought our sunglasses from said they
sell only the real thing. They say Bausch &AMP; Lomb and other
manufacturers have mounted a campaign against Internet sales to
protect their hefty profit margins and maintain the snob appeal of
their products.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Piazza Jr., who runs apairofshades.com out of Warwick,
N.Y., said he is authorized by Bausch &AMP; Lomb to sell Ray-Bans, even
though the corporation insists that all of its authorized vendors
must sign statements agreeing not to sell over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, 36, said his Web site is getting 15,000 hits and ringing
up about 400 sales a month. A licensed optician, Piazza offers a
30-day money-back guarantee and also sells Wanger watches, Tasco
binoculars, and Swiss Army knives.
</P>
<P>
   Phong Ly and John Passarelle, who started running their
shadesrus.com Web site out of Bergenfield, N.J., last month, say
they buy their Ray-Ban sunglasses from an authorized Ray-Ban
distributor. They know Bausch &AMP; Lomb frowns on what they do, but
they say the business looks promising.
</P>
<P>
   How can you tell an authentic pair of Ray-Bans? Before sending
them, we noticed some distinctive tiny ``BL'' markings on the lens,
as well as codes along the temple or sidepieces of the frame.
Kelley refused to give details, saying she doesn't want to help any
potential counterfeiters.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after verifying the authenticity of our shades,
Kelley called to tell us that they ``just recently'' decided to
allow Sunglass Hut to use its Web site to sell Ray-Ban shades. No
longer scorning e-commerce purchases of Ray-Bans, she said the
company is exploring the possibility of allowing other authorized
dealers to peddle Ray-Bans on the Internet.
</P>

TIME MAY BE AT HAND TO FIX YOUR EYES SURGICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Laser eye surgery has become so effective and widely accepted
for correcting vision problems that more than 1 million Americans
are expected to have the procedure done this year and next. But
it's no surprise that many people still get squeamish hearing the
words ``eye,'' ``laser'' and ``cut'' in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the US Food and Drug Administration approved
what may be an attractive new option for some mildly nearsighted
people leery of having part of their eye burned off: tiny plastic
rings that are inserted on the edges of the cornea to flatten it
and sharpen up the patient's view of distant things.
</P>
<P>
   European and Canadian doctors have been implanting the Intacs
rings for up to three years already. The main selling point is
that, unlike laser surgery, the procedure can be undone if patients
are unhappy with their new vision.
</P>
<P>
   However, many national eye specialists are skeptical the
implants will ever become more than a narrowly used alternative to
laser surgery. They cite several reasons: The rings cost as much or
more (roughly $2,000 per eye), installation hurts more, and for the
foreseeable future they will fix only a small range of mild
nearsightedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantages are few, and I bet in Boston it's going to be
something that really doesn't take off,'' said Carmen A. Puliafito,
director of the New England Eye Center in Boston and chairman of
the Tufts Medical School ophthalmology department, who performed
Massachusetts' first laser eye surgery in December 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dimitri T. Azar, a top surgeon at the Massachusetts Eye and
Ear Infirmary who has been to Paris to learn the procedure, said,
``Our plan is to start very carefully and not jump into it, because
there could be some hidden surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   At least for the first several months, Azar said, the infirmary
will require patients choosing rings to go to an operating room
with an anesthesiologist assisting, because of the pain of one
motion where the eye is simultaneously pulled and turned. The laser
eye surgeries can be done in a room set up like a dentist's office
with a reclining chair.
</P>
<P>
   The potential market for any of the operations is immense.
According to American Academy of Ophthalmology estimates, a quarter
of all Americans are nearsighted and another 22 percent are
farsighted. Nearly 150 million people, the academy says, wear some
kind of eyewear, including non-prescription reading glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, an estimated 500,000 Americans have paid for laser
surgery _ which virtually no health plan covers _ to reduce or
eliminate the need for contact lenses or eyeglasses. Currently, the
two most frequently performed visual correction surgeries are
called Lasik, which stands for laser-assisted in-situ
keratomileusis, and PRK, for photorefractive keratectomy.
</P>
<P>
   People have trouble seeing either near or far because their eyes
have less than the optimal curvature to focus images on the retina,
the membrane at the back of the eye that receives visual images.
Both Lasik and PRK slightly reshape the surface of the eye, making
it either flatter to improve distance vision or more steeply
pitched to improve near vision.
</P>
<P>
   In PRK procedures, lasers guided by computer calculations shear
off very thin layers of tissue _ a fraction of the thickness of a
piece of paper usually _ from parts of the cornea surface to
produce a shape that yields clearer vision.
</P>
<P>
   Lasik has been dubbed ``flap and zap'' because it involves a
surgeon using an automated cutting device like a carpenter's plane
to slice an ultrathin flap from the surface of the eye, which is
peeled back to allow a laser to vaporize tissue underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The flap is then replaced and patients heal much faster than
with PRK, in perhaps two days instead of a week. Also, immediately
after leaving the operating chair patients see better instead of
having to wait up to 20 days to know how their vision has been
improved, which is the case with PRK.
</P>
<P>
   Neither technique is foolproof, however. Flap complications
occur in about 1 to 2 percent of Lasik cases, but usually can be
surgically fixed. A comparably small percentage of people
undergoing both types of operations complain about blurry vision,
halos, glare, problems seeing at night or are simply disappointed
the procedure didn't yield the improvement they hoped for,
according to several US studies.
</P>
<P>
   Lasik is considered best suited to people with high to severe
nearsightedness or farsightedness. It has boomed to more than 80
percent of all eye surgeries since it was introduced in 1996,
according to Irving J. Arons, managing director of Spectrum
Consulting in Peabody, Mass., a leading authority on the
eye-surgery market.
</P>
<P>
   KeraVision, the Fremont, Calif., company that produces the new
Intacs implants, apparently sees a market among people who dislike
the idea of making a permanent, irreversible change in their eyes
or fear complications, which are rare.
</P>
<P>
   The rings, made of a polymer used for decades in cataract
surgery, are inserted about 1/3 of an inch from the center of the
eye through two small incisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best selling point seems to be the fact that they are
removable, there's a second chance and all your marbles aren't in
one basket,'' said Dr. Richard L. Abbott, codirector of corneal and
refractive surgery at the University of California at San Francisco
Medical Center, who was a principal investigator in Intacs trials
at 11 teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   However, Abbott said that he sees the rings as only ``a niche
product. The idea is that this technology would be expanded'' for
use on more myopics as well as people with hyperopia
(farsightedness) and astigmatism. However, studies are only
beginning overseas on adapting the rings to these uses and it could
be years before they can be more broadly used in the US, Abbott
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting technology, but its use right now is limited,''
said Dr. Ernest Kornmehl, medical director of the Center for Laser
Vision Correction in Brookline, Mass., who is on the faculties of
the Harvard, Tufts and University of Massachusetts medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   In people with especially large pupils that dilate widely at
night, the rings may obstruct vision on the periphery. About 1 in
10 people in early trials complained about seeing halos or glare
after getting the corneal rings, but that figure should drop as
surgeons master the procedure.

 UNDATED: ... the procedure.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New England Eye Center's Puliafito is especially skeptical
about Intacs, saying: ``Is it better than laser? No. Is it easier
for the surgeon to do? No. Is it easier for the patients? No...I
think it's a very clever device, but it addresses a problem that
doesn't exist,'' Puliafito said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, as KeraVision began investing a reported $100
million in developing Intacs, there will still widespread doubts
about whether laser surgery would prove workable and a market would
develop for a reversible procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still haven't seen anyone who wants theirs reversed,'' said
Puliafito, who said at his center, 30 laser eye surgeries are
performed a week.
</P>
<P>
   One reason rings may be slow to catch on is that there is no
shortage of medical centers licensed to do the laser work.
Consumers in eastern Massachusetts, for instance, can choose from
among a half-dozen, and the Department of Public Health estimates
another 12 or 13 Bay State hospitals and facilities are licensed to
perform the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Azar, the Eye and Ear Infirmary's associate chief of
ophthalmology and director of several surgery services, is also an
associate professor at the University of Paris medical center. He
has been to Paris to learn how to insert the rings _ European
authorities approved their use in 1996 _ and says he thinks the
results ``are beautiful,'' but comparable to what lasers can do.
</P>
<P>
   But Azar notes that one drawback is that the rings come in three
fixed sizes, while lasers can be minutely modified, like the
difference between wearing a tailored shirt or one that comes only
in small, medium or large.
</P>
<P>
   Lasik began as a procedure used only on severe cases of
nearsightedness, but as surgeons have learned to improve the
technique, it is being used on progressively milder cases as an
alternative to PRK because people heal faster and see better sooner
with Lasik.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Azar said, the only reason for choosing PRK over
Lasik is if you have a tissue condition in the eye that makes
slicing a flap dangerous or if you need less than about 2.5 to 3.5
diopters of vision correction, depending on the threshold a
particular surgeon has set for doing PRK instead of Lasik.
</P>
<P>
   Direct comparisons between diopters and the more commonly
understood 20/20 system of describing poor vision are difficult.
But roughly speaking, someone with 20/40 vision (the minimum to get
a driver's license) needs 0.75 to 1.25 diopters of correction to
get to 20/20, Azar said. Two diopters corresponds to 20/100, and
three diopters 20/400.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Azar said, he performed Lasik only on people
needing more than 6 diopters of correction. Now he routinely does
it on cases of people who need only 2.5 diopters, and it is likely
the ``flap and zap'' procedure will supplant even more use of PRK.
</P>
<P>
   The corneal rings, in contrast, have been approved only for
correcting 1 to 3.5 diopters of vision in myopic people, and not
yet to fix farsightedness or astigmatism.
</P>
<P>
   In the US, the practice of surgically changing the eye to
correct vision dates back to the late 1970s when a pair of American
doctors travelled to the then-Soviet Union to learn about a
procedure called radial keratotomy, in which incisions are made in
radial patterns around the cornea to flatten it.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, RK procedures, counted as one for each
eye, peaked at about 300,000 in 1994 and 1995, but have since
dwindled as lasers have promised more precise, less painful, easier
healing correction, according to Arons, the consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Every year since 1996, the number of laser eye surgeries has
roughly doubled, according to Arons' figures. He projects 850,000
eyes will be operated on this year _ overwhelmingly Lasik, and
overwhelmingly two eyes per person _ and another 1.2 million in
2000. Arons does not see rings taking more than 3 to 5 percent of
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Sumers, a private-practice ophthalmologist in Ridgewood,
N.J., who is a spokesperson for the ophthamology academy, said it
is important for people considering any eye surgery to keep in mind
that ``it doesn't make your vision better than what you have with
contacts or glasses. It's basically just a procedure for
convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   One drawback to all surgeries, including rings, is that people
have to choose whether they want to see well near or far.
</P>
<P>
   Because people's ability to change focus with their eyes
declines with age, if you are older than 40 and get laser surgery
to improve your distance vision, you almost certainly will have to
get reading glasses, even if you do not use them now, Sumers said.
Or if you choose the surgery to make it easier to read a book or
work at the computer, you are likely to need glasses for driving or
night vision.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, at about $4,000 out-of-pocket per pair of eyes, the
cost of laser work or rings easily cover decades or a lifetime
worth of contact lenses or eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston area, regular eyeglass lenses run an average $75
plus the cost of frames, which are generally about $100 but can
cost much more. Bifocals lenses are about $110, Azar said.
</P>
<P>
   For two eyes, regular contacts run from about $140 for a
high-quality permanent or six-month pair up to $600 for contacts
you throw out every day, not counting the cost of cleaning
solutions, according to Dr. Sheri Morneault, director of the Eye
and Ear Infirmary's contact lens service.
</P>
<P>
   Another option rolled out this month is a disposable bifocal
contact lens made by Johnson &AMP; Johnson. About 1 percent of the 33
million contacts sold in the last year were bifocals, and no one
with the marketing might of J &AMP; J has entered the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Acuvue lenses have five concentric rings that alternately
correct near or far vision. No one can control where a lens sits on
the eye, but the brain selects the appropriate focus. The contacts
cost about $350 to $500 per year for two eyes.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone with reservations about any of the surgical
approaches, ``The safest choice is still to get a good pair of
glasses,'' Sumers said. One unchallenged upside of glasses and
contact lenses is that they can be readjusted every year, Sumers
said, while repeated surgery on the eye is both costly and
potentially risky.

 &HT;    Motley cast seeks House seat
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ When for- mer U.S. Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.)
resigned amid scandal the same day President Clinton was impeached,
folks from every walk of life rushed to fill his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nine candidates in the special election to be held
Saturday: A wizard, a virgin, and a Monica.
</P>
<P>
   The wizard is David Duke, a former state representative, a
former presidential candidate, and a former Ku Klux Klan leader.
The virgin is Patrick Landry, a 33-year-old, unmarried electrician
who makes his sex life, or the lack thereof, public to distance
himself from the recent sex scandals in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Monica, but not that Monica. It's Dr. Monica
Monica, an ophthalmalogist, and her name is not a campaign trick to
cash in on the fame of Clinton's former intern paramour, Monica
Lewinsky. Her father, says this Monica, loved her so much, he named
her twice.
</P>
<P>
   Among the seven Republicans and two Democrats running in this
suburban New Orleans district, former governor and U.S. Rep. Dave
Treen is leading in most polls. He is selling himself as the only
candidate who can pick up where Livingston left off. Treen served 7
1/2 years on Capitol Hill in the 1970s, and he says his previous
stint in Washington will prevent him from being a powerless
freshman when he's elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hit the ground running,'' Treen said. ``I have
relationships with the chairmen of committees that will keep our
programs going.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument is a convincing one for many voters who became used
to having a senior lawmaker working for them. Livingston served for
21 years and was chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He
almost became speaker of the House, but he resigned in December
after Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt said he was about to
publish accounts of Livingston's extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   D. Bruce Smith, who works at the Lockheed Martin technology
center here, a pet project of Livingston's that receives federal
money, said he is leaning toward Treen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost so much, losing Livingston,'' he said. ``Treen is
the closest way to inject immediate experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Another leading candidate, Republican state Rep. David Vitter,
counters that Treen is too old to cultivate a long career like
Livingston's. Treen is 70. Vitter is 37. Moreover, Congress has
changed a lot during Treen's 20-year absence, so he may not know
the ropes as well as he thinks he does, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Vitter also distinguishes himself from Monica, who he says won't
be able to develop any seniority because she has signed a pledge
limiting her stay in Washington to six years, or three terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to think about electing a new, young person who can
build experience,'' Vitter said. If no one gets more than 50
percent of the votes Saturday, the two top vote-getters will face
off in a runoff May 29. With Treen in first place _ at least for
now _ the race for second place has grown increasingly bitter, said
John Maginnis, publisher of the Louisiana Political Fax Weekly.
Vitter and Monica have run ads attacking each other.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure, Maginnis said: This is the Republicans' race
to lose. Only two of the nine candidates are Democrats _ state Rep.
Bill Strain and perennial candidate Darryl Ward. Strain has a small
chance of getting into a runoff with Treen if voters become
disgusted with the Monica-Vitter battle.
</P>
<P>
   But in the unlikely scenario that Duke, whose poll numbers have
been running in the single digits, gets into a runoff with a
Democrat, many Republicans have said they would vote for the
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The other Republicans running are minor-league baseball team
owner Rob Couhig and retired orthopedic surgeon S.J. LoCoco. The
field is wide and confusing for many voters who see a lot of
similarities among the candidates. The district covers the
conservative, mostly white, suburban and rural areas of Orleans,
Jefferson, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa and Washington parishes, as well
as an affluent section of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Dupuy is typical of a lot of voters here: He can't decide.
An attorney from Jefferson Parish, he has a Rob Couhig sign in his
yard because ``he's the kind of guy who does business on a
handshake.'' He thinks Vitter is the brightest of the candidates
but too conservative, and he likes Monica because she is a ``mom
and wife and not a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know who I am not going to vote for _ David Duke,'' Dupuy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the candidate who has gotten the most national
attention is Duke, a self-described ``white civil rights
activist.''Anne Rochell Konigsmark writes for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

 &HT;    Duke sounds familiar themes in Congress run
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMMOND, La. _ The crowd at the Holiday Inn off the interstate
numbered around 100. They were all ages, dressed in blue jeans,
boots and ``gimme'' caps. A few had Confederate flags on lapel pins
or hats.
</P>
<P>
   And every single one clapped and cheered when David Duke entered
the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``People either love me or hate me,'' said Duke, the former Ku
Klux Klansman who is making his sixth run for public office, this
time trying to replace U.S. Rep. Bob Livingston in Louisiana's
First Congressional District. ``It's really nice to be in a room
full of people that love me.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke, 48, looks a little older than he did when he made national
headlines running for governor and then president. His hair is
greying, the mustache is gone, but his surgically-altered face is
still camera-ready. And although he keeps saying he regrets being
in the Klan, his rhetoric still rings of racial bias.
</P>
<P>
   At his rally at the Holiday Inn, Duke said, ``It's not evil,
it's not wrong and it's not hateful for people to want to associate
with their own kind.'' His audience applauded and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   At public appearances, he peddles ``My Awakening,'' his 717-page
book that talks of an Aryan revolution. He calls blacks less
intelligent and criminally inclined, and attacks Jews as having
taken over the govern- ment.
</P>
<P>
   Other things have changed, however.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, when Duke ran against former Gov. Edwin Edwards,
Louisianans, especially blacks, stood in lines, sometimes for
hours, to register to vote against Duke, even if that meant voting
for Edwards, whose alleged corruption was legendary. A favorite
bumper sticker from the race was ``Vote for the crook. It's
important.'' Duke lost the race, but he won 55 percent of the white
vote.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Duke's poll numbers have been in the single digits,
and there are many strong Republicans running against him in the
nine-candidate race. Residents and politicians who don't like Duke
are angry with the national media for paying attention to a minor
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little angry with NBC-TV for giving him publicity,''
said Tony Currera, a Republican from Duke's district, speaking of
Duke's appearance on ``Meet the Press.'' ``The national news is
giving him a forum for his hatred, as if this is what the people of
Louisiana are like. And he's not even a contender.''
</P>
<P>
   But Duke is confident he will at least make it into a runoff
with one of his Republican opponents, noting that in past races,
more people voted for him than the polls predicted. And his
supporters remain passionate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like everything he says,'' said Brian Kelly, a 45-year-old
electrician. ``I've been denied three jobs that went to black
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thinks Duke is a racist, Kelly said, ``Absolutely
not. That's a misconception.'' Duke contends that his ideas are not
on the fringe, but very mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the first major candidate to talk about getting rid of
affirmative action, about workfare instead of welfare, about a flat
tax,'' he said. ``Those are all Republican ideas now.''Anne Rochell

   But the nonprofit agency plans to take a bold step out from the
shadows next spring when it breaks ground for a new shelter whose
location will be publicized deliberately to the community.
</P>
<P>
   The new secure facility in Xenia will have a sign out front and
its address listed in the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, locations of shelters have traditionally
been kept confidential and the vast majority still are, mainly to
keep shelter victims safe from batterers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have depended on that anonymity for security,'' said
Cindy Minton, executive director of the Greene County Domestic
Violence Project. ``But there is a beginning of a movement across
the country to kind of take the step to say, `No, it's time that
this problem be recognized by the community and the community take
ownership of the problem.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the Domestic Violence Project started the public phase
of a capital campaign to raise $1.5 million for the new two-story
shelter that will accommodate 20 women and children, but have the
ability to expand to 25 with bunk beds.
</P>
<P>
   Minton said the agency has received more than $771,000 in
pledges _ more than half of its goal _ from corporate and
charitable foundations and others during a ``quiet phase'' of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.7-acre property was purchased by the Community Improvement
Corp. for $275,000 in February and last month turned over to the
agency at no cost. It is currently the site of Xenia Grace Chapel.
The agency plans to renovate the chapel for administrative offices,
educational and counseling areas. An existing annex will become a
police substation and the new shelter will be built behind the
chapel.
</P>
<P>
   By disclosing the new location, agency workers hope to reach
more victims, increase public awareness about domestic violence and
raise more money for their programs, Minton said.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Smith, executive director of Denver-based National
Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said advocates for years have
been asking themselves: Are we assisting battered women by hiding
them? Can we provide safety if we're not confidential?
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually believe local communities need to make that
decision. The local community and service provider have a better
idea of whether they have police support, community support and
safety mechanisms in case something happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they are the best judges of whether it is a good
idea to move to a non-confidential location or not. The bottom line
is, if a batterer is obsessed enough and he wants to find that
location, he'll find it whether it's confidential or not,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Janine Poppa, director of shelter services for the YWCA of
Dayton, which operates a domestic violence shelter in a
confidential location in Montgomery County, said she believes
revealing a shelter location puts victims and shelter workers at
too much risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the advantage of disclosing the location is.
I can tell you a million disadvantages,'' said Poppa, whose shelter
housed 278 women and 314 children last year. It is not uncommon for
the YWCA and Artemis Center for Alternatives to Domestic Violence
to receive threats from batterers in jail, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Minton said the new facility will be built with safety in mind.
``When we move into a public site, we plan to build the site with
security so it will be open so a victim can drive up to the front
door, but will also be secured so that particularly at night, it
almost shuts down to a little kind of fort,'' she said. National
and state domestic violence officials believe a proposed police
substation at the site may be the first of its kind and could serve
as a model for others.
</P>
<P>
   Xenia police Chief Eric Prindle said a police sergeant whose job
focuses on domestic violence complaints will work out of the
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sends the message we are supporting domestic violence
efforts and also are there to protect them . . .,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Minton said the agency began studying the issue two years ago
because the existing shelter inside a 100-year-old home was being
outgrown. They visited a couple of other disclosed sites in Ohio
and Kentucky before reaching the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The new shelter, scheduled to open in late 2000 or early 2001,
will have five bedrooms, an apartment accessible to someone with
disabilities, a kitchen, dining room, lounge area, children's play
area, counseling offices and an area for those operating the
24-hour crisis hotline.
</P>
<P>
   The existing shelter, which serves 150-200 people a year, can
house 17 women and children and is often at capacity. It is not
handicap-accessible and its kitchen and bathroom facilities are
inadequate for that number of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're just busting at the seams,'' Minton said,
adding that renovations and additions are not options in the
historic home.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Carlson-Riehm, executive director for Columbus-based
Action Ohio Coalition for Battered Women, said she is aware of two
other disclosed locations in the state: in Newark, where the
shelter is across from the busy post office, and in Fostoria, where
a sign is posted outside the First Step Family Violence
Intervention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cheatham, licensed social worker and residential program
manager at the 10-year-old Fostoria facility, said: ``We find a lot
of security in community awareness. The police are very aware of
our location, the townspeople are very aware. We have never had a
major incident on these premises. We tried something different and
it worked well.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheatham, whose clients' information is kept confidential, said
the shelter still exercises ``utmost security,'' but ``abusers are
very wary to come near here because of the public awareness of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argue that if victims are aware of and see the
facility, they may be more inclined to seek help. Opponents argue
that if a shelter is made public, victims will be less likely to go
there out of fear of being located.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a worker leaving her shift at a disclosed Crown Point,
Ind., women's shelter was raped outside by the husband of a woman
who was taking refuge in the shelter with her children .
</P>
<P>
   Four million women are victims of domestic violence in the
United States each year and 1,500-2,000 women die in such incidents
every year, Smith said. In Greene County, Minton said, four people
died as a result of domestic violence last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go into a public site we have to be prepared for the
worst-case scenario,'' she said, ``but from a day-to-day
standpoint, the majority of domestic violence is not killing.''

 &HT;    You can tell a lot about a person from the way he drives
 &HT;    By Leigh Allan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ I came, I saw, I figured it out. Feel free to
thank me later.
</P>
<P>
   Before moving here, I'd read the paper for several months,
including an editorial page column on bad local driving and the
dozens of reader responses to it, most of the verbal road rage
type. Scary stuff.
</P>
<P>
   My experience is that wherever you are at the moment has the
worst drivers in the world. Except for you, of course. Whenever you
move, the new place is worse. Except for you.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I've had trouble spotting the definitive Dayton
driving dumb-dumb, perhaps because I got my first license in Ohio
and the driving oddities you grew up with are the ones you're
comfortable with through life, like it works with music. I haven't
had that problem elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, where I lived the past 18 years, turn signals are
surgically removed at the border. You could drive weeks in Kentucky
without seeing a blinking light that's not promoting a Bingo game.
</P>
<P>
   When I read remarks suggesting drivers around here are bad on
turn signal use, I scoff. The smart money says 90 percent of the
offenders are ex-Kentuckians who still shout ``How 'bout dem
Cats!'' at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, I lived in Indiana, home of the Indiana Turn, aka the
Hoosier Head-on. That's a left where the driver cuts into the
oncoming lane first, then jags to the right.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell an experienced Hoosier driver because he not only
suddenly appears headed right at you, but also glares you down,
obviously enraged that you have the audacity to be where you're
supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers in a lot of Southern states will tell you the dominant
Ohio trait is meandering in the left lane of multi-lane highways,
even when the right is empty, an offense deemed dire by a West
Virginia legislator this month. This observation is probably
skewed, though, because of the preponderance of Florida-bound
Ohioans who can refer to John Glenn as ``that young
whippersnapper.''
</P>
<P>
   So I checked with the experts. Montgomery County (Ohio) Sheriff
Gary Haines said he gets the most complaints about drivers who are
not only using cell phones, but munching or glugging something from
their other hand.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Highway Patrol Sgt. Mike Marchek instantly said the biggest
problem on local interstates is tailgating. Marchek said on other
roads the fault of choice is running red lights, there being an
apparent local belief the first 10 seconds of red don't count.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with new knowledge, I engaged in in-depth study from both
roadways and sidelines. I noted all the mentioned misdemeanors,
plus a whole slew of ``right on red after roll'' adherents, but no
single sin stood out.
</P>
<P>
   Thus I was in despair while awaiting a bus in Centerville one
morning last week, but I was rescued. Along came a line of 15
tailgating vehicles in the left lane, with nothing to their right,
with two-thirds of the drivers eating breakfast and three of them
on the phone, the last seven or eight zipping through a bright red
light.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's something to be proud of. Other states may dominate
on any single offense, but, by golly, we're the ones who have put
it all together.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make a man quietly proud to be a Buckeye again.

 &HT;    Parents need to know when to stop pretending
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Parents should quit pretending all's
well.
</P>
<P>
   It is the witching moment at our house, the homework hour, and I
am watching my 8-year-old. He is using both head and hands to blast
through the intimidating columns of double-digit numbers. And while
his arithmetic is correct _ we are blessed with a math-happy child
_ some of the details are all wrong. His writing is sloppy. His
name's not on his paper. All his threes are backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' I say in my best I'm-your-mother tone. ``Pay attention
to the little stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to the details.
</P>
<P>
   I know how he feels, though. The details in life can be so
unpleasant. Overdue bills, a marriage that's turned distant,
problems at work. It's so much easier, isn't it, to glaze over all
that bad stuff and move right on to the fun.
</P>
<P>
   It's so much easier to pretend.
</P>
<P>
   Around our house, we call this The Macaroni Syndrome, a wistful
look back to the fabled days of Leave it to Beaver and Father Knows
Best. Those families never had big problems. Good golly, no! And if
they did, maybe something awful like the Beav didn't take out the
trash, then the TV mom would just put on her apron with the
bright-red bing cherries printed all over it and she'd make a big
casserole of macaroni. Macaroni is swell, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Why, just this week I macaronied my way through my day after a
certain math-crazy second-grader sat at the breakfast table looking
all forlorn. ``What's wrong?'' I asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go to school today,'' he said. ``I feel lonely
there.''
</P>
<P>
   And while my heart dropped and my mind whirled, while I went to
work and sat there and worried my head off, he went to school that
day without my having gotten to the bottom of things. I still don't
know why he said that. He's fine, I've told myself all week.
Macaroni!
</P>
<P>
   But at some point we do have to face things. That's why we're
the grownups and they're the kids. At some point we do have to
balance the checkbook and attend to the marriage and console the
confused child.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's hard to pay attention with so much tugging at us
_ at least that's our excuse, right? _ it's our job to stand vigil
over our family's lives.
</P>
<P>
   It's our job to know when to quit pretending.
</P>
<P>
   The pretending's all over out there in Littleton, Colo. Those
parents, the two mothers, the two fathers, are locked away with
their grief, reliving every little warning. Reliving every little
detail of the two lives that are now gone.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, our problems won't lead to the kind of carnage
we saw at Columbine High School last week. For most of us, our
lives can be understood once we slow down _ stop even _ to focus on
all the little warnings.
</P>
<P>
   And as I sit here and stare and think about the unattended
details of my life _ the warnings, if you will _ my mind can't help
but wander to theirs. To the two young men who dressed in black and
saluted Hitler. Two young men with so much hate, so much confusion,
so much in need of help, they bombarded the people around them with
the bizarre details of their disjointed lives. Day after day after
day. Still, no one listened. They were too busy putting on their
aprons to make the macaroni.

 &HT;    Build a core of investments ...
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Younger readers frequently ask whether they ought to fiddle with
their investments, now that the stock market is so high and so
wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   Sell stocks? Stop putting new money into the market? Buy only
the most conservative stocks?
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no simple, concrete and achievable answer
for everybody. But there is a general concept that will lead a lot
of neophyte investors to their own answers: core investments.
</P>
<P>
   These are the inexpensive, more or less predictable selections
you are prepared to buy today and to leave alone for many, many
tomorrows. You buy them to achieve a specific goal and refuse to
touch them for any other reason.
</P>
<P>
   Think about core investments as your anchor. Once you have
dropped that anchor, you can quit worrying about it, no matter
where the stock market goes today or might go tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people get wrapped up in very short-term things,
like which stocks are hot and whether the market is overvalued,''
observed Mark W. Riepe, the chief of Schwab's Center for Investment
Research. ``By building a core of investments that are consistent
with your long-term objectives, you make sure these short-term,
opportunistic distractions don't make you swerve too much from your
long-term path.''
</P>
<P>
   Developing a core can be relatively simple. If you are doing it
yourself, it's a process of analyzing your goals and what they will
cost, the amount of time you have to save and invest, and how much
risk you're willing to take to get to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   The first two steps are pencil-and-paper exercises. Assessing
your tolerance for risk is a spongier process. If you have years or
decades to save, you will get better returns with stocks or stock
mutual funds. But if the volatility of the market makes you
anxious, you probably need to search out alternatives or
compromises.
</P>
<P>
   You can get some help figuring out your needs- vs.-nerve
quotient from some of the commercial financial planning software
packages. You can get a rough idea by filling out worksheets on the
Internet. Fidelity Investments has a good one at
www.401k.com/cgi-bin
</P>
<P>
   /invprof.exe. You can get similar programs, either electronic or
in booklet form, from other brokerages and mutual fund families.
</P>
<P>
   The other alternative is to hire a professional, such as a
certified financial planner, to help you get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe an adviser is the best place to start,'' said Jan
Holman, a vice president of American Express Financial Advisors in
Minneapolis. ``That doesn't necessarily mean you will use an
adviser throughout your whole investing life. But as a place to
begin and to get some one-on-one training, you're paying a pretty
low price when you use an adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   An adviser _ assuming he or she acts as a coach rather than a
salesperson _ can be particularly helpful with the problem at hand:
avoiding panicky decisions if the market gets too high _ or too low
_ for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you'll need to pick the individual investments that
will become your core. You will need to diversify your portfolio,
which suggests mutual funds for many investors.
</P>
<P>
   Within the mutual fund world, it's a good idea to minimize both
upfront sales fees and annual operating expenses. That suggests
index funds, which usually have very low costs.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of index funds: You can be sure they won't
switch around, chasing hot stocks or market trends.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off, of course, is that an index fund will go down
just like the index it tracks. You are assuming that over a period
of years, stocks will continue to appreciate faster than other
investments, just as they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't find a 20-year period when stocks have lost money,''
said Riepe. ``There are some 20-year periods when they haven't been
all that great, but they are at least positive.''

 &HT;    A world of dreams lives alongside one filled with death's
finality
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Off on yet another dawn patrol, the intrepid
World War 1 flying ace is alone, high above the fields of France.
The strap of a worn flying helmet flaps jauntily under his ear as a
long white scarf trails in the prop wash. Man and machine throb as
one.
</P>
<P>
   Resolutely, the intrepid aviator's flinty eye scans the sinister
skies, straining for a glimpse of a gaudily painted Albatros, the
flying machine that strikes terror into the hearts of valiant young
men. He spots it. His gut churns. Just above him at 11 o'clock, the
dreaded Red Baron is on the prowl.
</P>
<P>
   Snoopy, Charlie Brown's delusional dog, is deep in yet another
food-induced reverie where single-handed he patrols the skies of
France in his never-ending quest to out-shoot and out-fly the
legendary German ace, Manfred Von Richtofen. Invariably, his fancy
flying work and daring agility pay off. Snoopy saves the day. The
free world can sleep securely for another night.
</P>
<P>
   World War 2 was in full swing during my fantasy years. I was
weaned on John Wayne movies where for a couple of hours each week,
good and evil were clearly defined for me by Hollywood. The enemy
was evil. In the Pacific he wore an inscrutable sneer as he shot
down our family loving, clean-cut American boys. Over Europe, the
enemy was taller, and though he died just as often, he did it with
a minimum of fuss. And there wasn't much blood.
</P>
<P>
   Dying was tidy in the days of black and white movies and I, like
millions of other kids, bought into the notion that death was a
temporary transition. A hit, a spin, a gasp, and the pilot was
history. Of course, a couple of months later in a different movie,
the same actor would be digging a trench on Corregidor or paving a
runway on Saipan. My young, homegrown version of mortality was a
whole lot skewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're off again!'' my geography teacher, Miss Fecser would
bellow when she'd catch me focused out the window and on the little
airport a couple of blocks away from our fifth-grade classroom. I
meant to pay attention, but I really didn't give a fat rat's
backside about Iowa's average annual rainfall. The only thing that
interested me was airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   More than penny candy or Lana Turner coloring books, I wanted to
fly. Every one of my youthful fantasies centered around me in a
cockpit. I flew bombers, fighters, anything with wings. In fact,
that's the way most of my childish daydreams began.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, everybody's up today,'' my commanding officer (who most
often bore a striking resemblance to Alan Ladd and was invariably
madly in love with me) would order as he came through the door of
the pilots' ready room. ``We need every man, and Elizabeth, for
this mission. The enemy will soon be arriving over the playground
of Memphis Elementary and it's up to you to save the kids.'' We'd
all salute.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ladd never kissed me goodbye or anything, because then I
wouldn't have been just another one of the boys. But he did look
worried as I adjusted my parachute and headed for the ramp to kick
some tires and crank up my Mustang. Sometimes I flew a P-38, but
the twin boom kind of wrecked the silhouette for me.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely did I survive a mission, but I would be profoundly
mourned by Alan Ladd, my fellow pilots, and all of the kids at
Memphis Elementary. My youthful naivete assured immortality. I knew
I'd be back to fly another day.
</P>
<P>
   Snoopy's just a beagle and I was just a kid. Lucky for a lot of
folks that we had no access to airplanes _ in my case at least
until I was old enough to know that dying is forever and once my 15
minutes is up, I'm gone. For good.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad guns aren't as tough to come by as airplanes.

 &HT;    Say goodbye to your old face
 &HT;    By Sonja Isger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Sure, right now Rhoda's face is just a
shade on the green side of jaundiced. Her right jawline rather
bruised.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, two days ago the high school physics teacher from New
York couldn't even chew a bagel. Under her matted swish of brown
hair lurk staples _ ``dozens of them'' _ that give her the heebee
jeebies.
</P>
<P>
   But Rhoda, 55, happily volunteered for this. She even had a
party to send her off.
</P>
<P>
   It was a goodbye-to-your-old-face party.
</P>
<P>
   She's now on day five of recovery in a doctor's office in
Stuart, Fla. And in her mind, she's already planning the next
party, a ``new face'' party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and my friends, we're all in our 50s. Everyone decided we
were all going to make appointments, but nobody believed how fast I
moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda wasn't the only one moving. Last year, 61,692 people
across the country decided to fight sagging chin lines and pooching
jowls by going under the surgeon's knife for a facelift.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, doctors have come up with dozens of new ways
to touch up your looks. They can zap wrinkles with lasers or peel
away mottled skin with chemicals. They can suck fat out of chins,
or deposit it in lips.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to seriously overhauling one's visage, the
facelift is still the mainstay. The tools and techniques have
improved. The cost has dropped from the range of a new Bentley to
somewhere closer to Suzuki. And, if done right, the results are a
vast improvement over the old actress-in-a-wind-tunnel look.
</P>
<P>
   Still, facelifts are not walk-in procedures. Cosmetic, yes. But
surgery all the same.
</P>
<P>
   So before Rhoda's friends start clearing their calendars, they
should heed the advice of those who have been there _ and the
doctors who've done that thousands of times.
</P>
<P>
   First, this isn't for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda's surgeon, Dr. Robert Cooper, guesses he turns down about
half the people who show up in his office.
</P>
<P>
   For some, their health is the problem. They have diabetes or
heart problems or their blood pressure is out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   If your body is already working overtime with medical problems,
a good doctor won't operate _ it would merely add more stress.
</P>
<P>
   Others come to the office thinking a facelift will solve
emotional problems. It won't. That's when a doctor has to become a
psychologist of sorts. ``For example, you don't want to work on
somebody who's here to save a bum marriage,'' Cooper says. ``Say
the woman has a big chubby neck, the kind I could really work with.
It may be absolutely great surgery, but if the marriage goes down
the dumper she won't be happy with the results of the surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   A facelift isn't a good pick-me-up after a personal crisis
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who's just been widowed from their soul mate of many
years _ this is a patient set up for post-op depression,'' Cooper
says.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper describes the ideal patient:
</P>
<P>
   ``This person says, `I have all this lust for life, I have
energy, I have opinions and I look at my driver's license and say,
Who the heck is this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   A person's age is not a factor. Though facelift candidates in
their 20s are extremely unusual, the clientele is getting younger,
according to national statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who want a facelift are in their 50s and 60s. But
doctors are seeing some first-timers who have waited until they're
almost 90 to step up.
</P>
<P>
   Don't go with the first doctor you find or the cheapest estimate
you get. Rhoda asked her friends and acquaintances. A business
woman in Boca Raton went with the surgeon who'd worked on her mom.
Helen Bransford, a New Yorker who wrote a book on the subject,
asked her doctors who they would recommend.
</P>
<P>
   All are good ways to find a reliable doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Next, they checked the doctors' credentials. They found out
where the operation would be performed and, if it wasn't a
hospital, they checked the facility's credentials too. (see box for
details)
</P>
<P>
   Then they visited those doctors and discussed their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors will show you pictures of their work. If that's the
case, keep in mind that you'll probably see their best examples.
Ask them how many facelifts they have done. Listen for whether they
offer alternatives _ you may think you need a facelift, when what
you really need is an eyebrow lift or work on your eyelids.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means is a facelift the be-all and end-all,'' Cooper
said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't make plans for a week, maybe more. We're talking serious
snipping, sucking and sewing _ hours on an operating table. Make
sure you have somebody to nurse you through the recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughts of a lengthy recovery are exactly what prompted Rhoda
to go with Cooper. Cooper's office-space is somewhat unique to the
business. In his Water's Edge facility, Cooper maintains an
accredited operating room and a 10-bed recovery wing.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery wing has private rooms with televisions, parlor
with satellite TV, a 24-hour nursing staff to check on you and a
chef to prepare a group breakfast, lunch and dinner. Some clients
even go for a Penthouse suite which comes with the same amenities
but more privacy. Cooper charges additional for each night's stay _
somewhere between $100 and $150 a night.
</P>
<P>
   On day 5, as the aroma from cabbage-stuffed chicken and
mustard-basted sweet potatoes rises from her dinner plate, Rhoda is
pleased with her decision.
</P>
<P>
   The set-up is convenient and helpful. But it's NOT mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   What is necessary is a post-op plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``A face lift is not something where you have three days down
time and then you're driving the carpool and popping into the
office,'' Bransford said. ``Clear your calendar _ certainly for two
weeks because the first week you're healing from surgery and then
you need to get your bearings again.''
</P>
<P>
   Most facelift patients can head home a day after surgery _
especially if they have spouses or close friends who can play nurse
for the next couple days. Bransford advocates hiring a nurse for
the first 24-hours _ at least. By her estimation, no pal or spouse,
no matter how close or dependable, should be called into this kind
of rigorous service.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Cooper's patients opt to spend the first couple days
with his facility's nurses for just that reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't need a licensed nurse, you need a responsible
adult,'' said Cooper's risk manager, nurse Allison Wolfberg.
</P>
<P>
   The tasks aren't difficult:
</P>
<P>
   Cocktail-straw-sized tubes drain surgical incisions into small
containers which must be emptied every few hours.
</P>
<P>
   If you have your lids done at the same time, someone must apply
medication to them regularly.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll need cold compresses on your face to reduce swelling.
A compress can be made of ice or packs of saline sold in stores.
But the most frequently used compress comes straight from the
fridge: frozen peas.
</P>
<P>
   The compress is key to making sure a lot of expensive work
doesn't go south, so it's important to keep it fresh. And most say
that means changing it every 15 to 20 minutes _ throughout the day
and night.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't really painful, just uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The patient on Cooper's table has been there two hours. In that
time, he lifted her eyebrows, making a cut in her forehead and a
notch in her skull to reattach the skin. He has trimmed a sliver of
skin and removed a sliver of fat from her upper and lower lids.
He's sliced her face open down the jaw line in front of her ears,
then behind them into the hairline. He's also cut under her chin.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper uses a liposuction wand to remove some fat from the chin
and neck line. He uses a scalpel to remove the fat that has drooped
over the years from this 49-year-old woman's cheeks down into her
jowls.
</P>
<P>
   All along, he's traced the purple Magic Marker lines he drew
before surgery, while the patient was sitting upright. When he's
done, he staples all the cuts in her hairline and sews the more
visible ones by her ears.
</P>
<P>
   He finishes by lasering away the top layer of her skin _ along
with the wrinkles that have become part of it.
</P>
<P>
   It's chilling watching Cooper pull the skin from her face,
vacuum and trim and then staple it all back together. But by the
end of the operation, while still on the table, she looks a decade
or so younger than the ``before'' pictures hanging nearby. He's
restored her chinline and her eyelids are much smoother.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the next few hours her face will swell so much no
one will recognize her. It may take months before she feels normal
again.
</P>
<P>
   Day one is usually a blur.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda and her fellows recuperating in Cooper's ward remember
they fell in and out of consciousness, anesthesia still in their
system. Their heads propped at 30 degrees from the bed to keep the
blood drained from the area.
</P>
<P>
   Day-one patients look like members of them same ugly tribe:
eyes-swollen shut, cheeks swollen wide, heads in bandages. They are
so bandaged and hard to distinguish from one-another that those in
the recovery area sport name tags. Chewing is out of the question.
Drinking is done only through a bent straw. And oral hygiene is
limited to swishing mouthwash through a straw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an extraordinary doctor, but no matter how much you try
to brief yourself, you can't imagine what you're going to look like
on Day One or Day Two,'' Bransford said.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point for Rhoda is day three. Still all bandages and
Band-Aids, Rhoda gets stir crazy and decides she's up for a stroll
_ into downtown Stuart. She takes pains to do this in mid-summer _
she's not allowed to sweat or significantly raise her heartbeat.
Both are recuperation no-nos.
</P>
<P>
   By Day five, all of Rhoda's bandages are gone. But she still
feels stiff and looks battered. While bathing is OK, a shampoo is
still out of the question. She can't do that with the staples and
stitches.
</P>
<P>
   When a crew of four facelift patients gather in the recovery
ward's dinner table, all agree that what they've been feeling isn't
pain. They've got pills if it starts to hurt. But they all report
discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to sleep with your head propped up. You can't open
your mouth real wide. You can't chew. They put this stuff in your
eyes, so you can't read,'' one says, barely nibbling at a
scrumptious confection sprinkled in chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Satomassimo is feeling stiff even a month after her
facelift. Sitting in one of Cooper's check-up rooms, the
60-year-old she asks if she can get a haircut yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can cut, you can perm, the only thing you have to worry
about is the sun,'' Cooper tells her. ``You'll notice your skin is
a little drier than normal. You might have numbness, your skin, it
feels like leather, like wood. But do everything. Go out sailing,
whatever. Just protect yourself from the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   At one month, Bransford celebrated the fact that she could open
her mouth an inch from tooth to tooth, ate a regular meal at a
restaurant and no longer used a thin eyebrow brush to brush her
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Be realistic.
</P>
<P>
   A better looking you is possible. A career switch to runway
model is not.
</P>
<P>
   About a year after surgery, Helen Bransford described the
transformation of her 40-something face this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very liberating. I don't worry. I no longer walk into
every room self-conscious about whether my skin is sagging or
drooping. It allowed me to focus on the people around me more. I
didn't expect that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a facelift doesn't mean you're Cindy Crawford
overnight. You're not a babe or anything. It's just that now you're
the best you can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda returns home still black and blue, which shocks a couple
friends who aren't used to seeing a fresh face job. The bruises
eventually disappear, though a feeling of tightness under her chin
and numbness around one ear linger for more than eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a year later, while she's out with her 5-year-old
granddaughter, people mistake her for the girl's mother, she says.
A store clerk figures aloud that Rhoda is in her early 40s _ to
which Rhoda confesses she isn't.
</P>
<P>
   And her friends are impressed, she says. Rhoda believes a couple
of them have followed her lead, though they aren't as candid about
it as she's been.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda says a stroll past a wall of family pictures earlier this
month cemented her good feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the pictures and said, `Oh my God, I don't look 10
years younger, I look 15 years younger,'' Rhoda says from her home
in New York. ``I'm looking very, very good and I'm very, very
happy.''

 &HT;    Calming fussy baby may be a mouseclick away
 &HT;    By Amy Kincheloe
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ As a new father, Mike Lampkin searched for
something that would calm his fussy daughter, especially during a
changing when it is not possible to hold her.
</P>
<P>
   So with the help of a friend and a little research, Lampkin
found what he calls a ``simple but effective solution'' in The
Lampkin Fussy Baby Help Page Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a freebie site I keep up to help other parents
out,'' said Lampkin, of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin, a graphics designer, developed a poster and a slide
show with `` . . . a series of pictures and patterns which are more
attractive to babies from the age of newborn and up.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the poster and the slide show feature simple shapes in
black and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read that the part of the brain that develops first is the
part that recognizes shapes,'' Lampkin said. ``So I made it very
basic and very easy to see. The circles, squares, triangles, stars
and even the happy faces can be recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin said he hung the poster next to his daughter's changing
table and she was easily distracted by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works best on babies that are grumpy or tired,'' Lampkin
said.
</P>
<P>
   For extreme emergencies, Lampkin offers a ``panic button'' on
the Web site. When pushed, the slide show starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just hold the baby up next to the computer and (the images)
will distract them; they become mesmerized,'' Lampkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin said he also has found it helpful to keep a copy of the
poster in the car and the diaper bag for those inconsolable moments
away from home.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site (www.lampkindesign.com/fussybaby/) was created in
1996, and so far Lampkin said he has received many affirmative
comments from parents who have tried it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just put it on the Web for fun and got a huge response,''
Lampkin said. ``The site gets several thousand hits a day, and I
get e-mail and letters from people telling me how they've used it.
I recently got an e-mail from a nurse in New York who wanted
permission to hang the posters up in the nursery she works in.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin admits that he's not sure exactly why the images from
the poster and the slide slow work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's like giving a little kid a toy _ it keeps them
occupied,'' Lampkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Pat Lambden, clinical nurse specialist in pediatric
education at Scott &AMP; White Children's Health Center, said she can
see how Lampkin's poster could work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes at 3 to 4 months, babies tend to get bored and need
extra stimulation,'' Lambden said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lambden was quick to add that when a baby is fussy, parents
should rule out hunger, a wet diaper, gas, sickness or pain before
chalking it up to ``crying for no apparent reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Crying is a baby's way of communicating, Lambden said.
``Sometimes it depends on their temperament. Sometimes they're
bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Motion is one of the best things to calm a fussy baby, Lambden
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking them for a car ride or putting them in a swing can be
very soothing,'' Lambden said. ``Also, just picking them up,
holding them upright and walking around from room to room with them
can help calm them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, Lambden found stroller rides to be helpful with her
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the parents and the child have `cabin-fever,' so
just getting them outside in the stroller can calm them and the
parents down,'' Lambden said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Lambden's suggestions for calming a fussy infant are
tried-and-true methods that have been passed on for as long as
women have been having babies. But with today's technology, parents
have even more choices when it comes to dealing with a fussy baby.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Polster, Toys ``R'' Us store manager, said the
best-selling baby calming devices produce noises or light. There's
the Mommybear, a plush toy that makes a heartbeat sound; the new
``Bear and Bunny'' device that makes nature sounds; and Lullaby
Globes, which produce light images on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually sell out of the Mommybear,'' Polster said. ``Some
people say it works hands-down, and some people say it doesn't work
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambden said finding the right thing to soothe a baby is not
always easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of trial and error,'' Lambden said. ``Some
things don't work on some babies _ you have to find what works for
your baby.''
</P>
<P>
   And when all else fails and the baby still won't quiet down,
Lambden suggests calling in members of your support staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they just won't calm down, and at that point it is
good to have someone else to hand them off to,'' Lambden said.
``This can be helpful by allowing you time to regroup.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambden also said parents should consult a physician if the
baby's crying is constant and lasts for more than two hours.

 &HT;    Electronic gadgets prove it's a new (kids) world
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Forget the Barbies, Beanie Babies and action
figures. If it doesn't talk, beep, ding or dong, it may get left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   An onslaught of electronic toys and gadgets seem to be taking
over the toys of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interactive toys are probably more important to kids than
something else,'' said Barbara Rystrom of McGregor, as she and her
daughter, Stephanie, 9, shopped for electronic toys recently at
Toys 'R' Us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids today are used to using mechanical, hand-held-type
things, and they don't play as much imaginarily like with a doll.
They always have to have something that does something in order to
entertain. A doll just sort of sits there.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic gadgets attracting the attention of girls include the
electronic diary, talking watches and pens, toy beepers that send
messages to nearby friends and voice-activated bedroom door passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the Friend.link (beepers) and the talking watches,''
Stephanie Rystrom said of the gadgets that have LCD screens and
virtual characters that say all sorts of things. ``I came in to
look at the watch, but now I also like the password journal and the
door pass, which you have to say the password before it lets you in
your room.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina Parton's day just wouldn't be the same without her
electronic diary.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old keeps track of her schedule and homework, reads
her daily horoscope, gets advice from an internal match-making
device and takes care of an internal giga-pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write in it a whole lot about guys I like and personal phone
numbers and the things I've done that I don't want other people to
know about,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She likes her electronic diary much better than its predecessor
_ pencil and paper diaries she used to write in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost everyone of them before I got this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the big plus _ it's private. Only she has the code
that allows her to fire up the diary, which means her sisters can't
get into it.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly one of the biggest electronic phenomenons to hit lately
is drawing the attention of millions of young boys throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Move over yo-yos. Pokemon passion is taking over.
</P>
<P>
   The Nintendo Gameboy game, pronounced po-kee-mahn, is
essentially a derivation of the ancient low-tech game of rock,
paper, scissors. Inside the game, 11-year-old Ash Ketchum captures
and trains 151 Pokemon, or pocket monsters, each of whom has a
special ability.
</P>
<P>
   Since last fall, Nintendo has sold more than 1.5 million of the
game cartridges, and young viewers are tuning into a daily TV
cartoon and searching for Pokemon memorabilia, such as trading
cards.
</P>
<P>
   If your children sound like they are speaking in code, they've
probably been bit by the bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this, we're probably going to trade a Flareon, which is
an evolution of the Eevee if you give it a fire stone,''
12-year-old Jorge Colmenares said. ``I don't know what I'm going to
trade for the Flareon, yet, though.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two versions of Pokemon _ a red and a blue version _
and in order to capture all 151 Pokemon, kids link red and blue
Pokemon games together with a cable to trade Pokemon and battle
other players.
</P>
<P>
   What's refreshing for many parents is that the game isn't
violent like many of its counterparts. Even though there are
battles, Pokemon don't throw punches, shoot each other, bleed or
die.
</P>
<P>
   Once captured, they just faint or teleport away. The rotund
little creatures _ including the popular Pikachu, a bright yellow,
rodent-like creature with ``shocking'' powers _ are actually kind
of cute, especially before they evolve into larger creatures and
become more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect that appeals to parents is the fact that this
game may help sharpen memorization. Each Pokemon evolves twice and
changes names and attains various capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Colmenares, who has captured 147 Pokemon, says he remembers
who's who by memorizing each Pokemon's physical appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you play for a while, you remember the names,'' added
Rocky Shen, 13, who captured all 151 Pokemon in less than two
months before starting the game over. He now has another 118 under
his belt.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokedex also helps players keep track of the game. ``Every
Pokemon you get, it shows you in your Pokedex,'' said Max Silver,
12, who recently started playing the game. ``If you trade somebody,
it will show you on the Pokedex that you own it but you really
don't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game also enforces sharing and working together since the
only way a player can get all 151 Pokemon is by hooking up to a
friend's Gameboy.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of advice: when you ask a Pokemon player why it's a great
game, get ready for an earful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun trying to catch all of them, and there's different
cities and you can fly different places, and you can trade with
your friends if you don't have something, and sometimes there's two
Pokemon you have to catch at one time and if you don't catch them,
you have to trade with a friend because there's two different kinds
of games, a blue version and a red version, and there's Pokemon you
can't get in the red version so you have to trade for the blue
version,'' Silver blurted out in one long, breathless sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Silver plays seven or eight hours a week, after his homework, of
course, and endless hours on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I forget to read, and Mom has to stop me from
playing and make me read,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest torture of all is when he gets grounded and
there's no more Pokemon for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is torture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Colmenares guesses he plays about five hours a day and admitted
he once snuck the game to bed with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the sound down,'' he said. ``I've only done it once and
never been caught.''
</P>
<P>
   With a chuckle, he says he thinks he's addicted to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I've got a Pokemon battle now,'' he says turning his
attention to his Game Boy, his face growing serious.
</P>
<P>
   Shen says he's not ``addicted to the game'' but admits he'll
play from the time he gets home from school until bedtime if he
doesn't have any homework.
</P>
<P>
   He said his parents think he plays too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always sitting there playing, and they tell me to read a
book or something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shen said the appeal to Pokemon is that the game lasts longer
than others he's played and is more challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more exciting and has much more than just men
(fighting),'' Colmenares said. ``And the time just goes by fast
because you're so hooked on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver agrees, adding that he likes the fact that after he
captures all 151 Pokemon, he can start over and the game will be
completely different.
</P>
<P>
   Experts expect Pokemon to be as popular or even more so than
games like Super Mario Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   But even with all the hype of new games like Pokemon, there are
still some traditionalists hooked on good-ol' standbys. Devon Hunt,
13, has been hooked on Donkey Kong for years and plays about three
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something to do and fun way to waste time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for what's next in the world of electronic toys, employees of
Toys 'R' Us said ``it's anybody's guess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only imagine,'' said Scott Cressman, store director.
``They'll keep updating graphics and certainly color on these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Meador, sales manager, said many of these new interactive
toys evolved from the virtual pet toys that were huge several years
ago, including Tamagotchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets a little different every year,'' he said. ``We never
know what to expect or what's on a company's drawing board.''

 &HT;    My father's song: Forgive, don't hate
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ My father, Nishan Kalajian, had the
misfortune to be born in the city of Diyarbakir in southeastern
Turkey in 1912, a desperate and convulsive time in the
disintegrating Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   He was 3 years old when the soldiers came first to take the
young men, including his father, and then returned for all the
other Armenians. The pattern was repeated in village after village.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing slaughter was eventually given a formal name: The
Armenian Genocide. The ghostly survivors became almost as familiar
to newspaper readers of their time as the refugees from Kosovo are
today. The starving Armenians, as they were widely known, became an
international cause.
</P>
<P>
   And then they were forgotten so completely that the people who
rule their land today can blandly deny that anything so awful ever
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.5 million victims are memorialized each April 24 almost
entirely by other Armenians. These days, the survivors are
memorialized too. They are nearly all gone, including my father. He
told me only a little of his sad and miraculous story before he
died; when I was young, my mother made me promise never to ask
because she hated to see him cry.
</P>
<P>
   I managed to pick up many of the threads over the years. I know
that he was snatched from his dying mother's arms. That he was
taken away to live with Kurds. That he was sent out into the world
alone and hungry again a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   He had, I thought, every right and reason to hate Turks and want
revenge. Although my father became a deeply patriotic American
after coming to this country at age 16, his Armenian soul was never
masked.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't tell the story he lived, but he enjoyed sharing
stories about the kings and poets of his lost country. I felt the
loss was mine. My Armenian friends were always my closest, and we
became even closer when we went off together to an Armenian summer
camp in Massachusetts when I was 9 years old.
</P>
<P>
   I met plenty of kids from around the country whose parents and
grandparents were less reluctant than my father to share their sad
stories. We ate in a drafty mess hall beneath turn-of-the-century
photographs of men wearing bandoleers, Armenian revolutionaries. We
sang their marching songs and imagined we were marching with them.
</P>
<P>
   I went back every summer to sing the songs and kill imaginary
Turks. I shot a thousand of them with tree-branch guns. When I was
older, I shot tin can Turks with a real rifle. I was certain that
some day I'd find the Turk who killed my grandmother and kill him
on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I could never tell my father, but I felt certain he
somehow understood. Until one night, when I was 15 years old, he
invited two Turks to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure I wasn't paying close attention when this first came
up; all I understood was that two musicians were coming. That
wasn't unusual. My father loved music and people who made it.
Musicians, mostly young Armenians, came by often for dinner and
played into the night.
</P>
<P>
   My father sometimes sang along with them if he was in just the
right mood. Not necessarily a good mood. He sang most often when
the songs were sad.
</P>
<P>
   It was sometime just before the Turks arrived that I realized
from my parents' conversation that these guests were different. Why
was I surprised? My father listened to Turkish music as much as to
Armenian music. It was, after all, the music he heard as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   I had heard him say more than once that music has no nationality
or politics, but those were just words until I saw the Turks sit
down at our dining room table. I don't remember much about them
except that one was tall and the other wasn't. Both had mustaches.
They wore suits and ties.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke no English, but my father translated their greetings
and compliments on my mother's cooking. Then one of them spoke to
me. I'm sure it was a polite gesture, but I felt my throat close
with anger.
</P>
<P>
   I threw my fork into my plate and ran upstairs to my room. My
father followed a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only time in my life, I believe, that I ever raised
my voice to him. I screamed that he had no right to bring Turks
into our house. No right to make my mother cook for them. No right
to make me sit there and be polite to them.
</P>
<P>
   My father didn't raise his voice. He tried, very calmly, to
explain that his guests deserved to be treated with respect.
</P>
<P>
   But they're Turks, I reminded him, and we hate Turks. His reply
was the most startling thing I ever heard him say: ``I don't hate
Turks.''
</P>
<P>
   I was so shocked that, without thinking, I uttered the
unmentionable. ``You have to hate them,'' I said. ``The Turks
killed your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   My father looked suddenly sad. He said, very softly, ``The Turk
who killed my mother is dead. The Kurd who saved me killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   I felt ashamed then, and still do, to have said something so
hurtful and stupid. Who was I to tell my father how he should feel
about something I could never understand? I should have apologized,
but I just stared silently. My father finished the conversation for
me.
</P>
<P>
   You can hate people who do terrible things, he explained, but
you can't hate someone who wasn't there or wasn't even born. ``You
can't hate an entire people,'' he said. ``You may want to, but it
doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   He left me alone to think about what he'd said. I'm still
thinking, more than 30 years later. I long ago stopped shooting at
imaginary Turks, and I've made friends with at least a few real
ones, but I can't say I truly absorbed my father's wisdom or
pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   I know he was right, about music and about people, but I'm still
angry for what he lived through. I can't hate an entire people, but
I can hate anyone who says the century's first genocide never
happened.
</P>
<P>
   I never did go downstairs to apologize. After my father left, I
lay on my bed with the door open. When the talking stopped, I heard
an oud, the Middle Eastern proto-lute that has no frets to force
the notes into a rigid, western scale.
</P>
<P>
   Its deep and quavering sound became more impossibly sad as the
night went on. I could hear my father singing.

   Q: Is gout related to diet?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gout is a disease in which the body either produces too much
of a substance called uric acid, or excretes too little, causing
blood levels to rise. Uric acid can then be deposited within joints
and tissues, causing severe pain.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, doctors recommended that those with gout avoid foods
high in purines (organ meats and a few other foods) because purines
are broken down into uric acid. But further research has shown that
uric acid is formed from a variety of substances and for most
people does not seem much affected by these diets.
</P>
<P>
   Medications are the main treatment for gout today. Avoid (or at
least limit) alcohol, since it increases production and decreases
excretion of uric acid. Eat regularly and drink plenty of fluids.
Weight loss usually helps those who are overweight, but should be
accomplished with healthfully balanced meals, since high-protein
fad diets can raise uric acid levels.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can someone know if they are getting enough fiber?
</P>
<P>
   A: Current recommendations call for 20 to 35 grams of dietary
fiber each day to help lower risk of cancer, prevent heart disease
and promote overall health. One way to make sure you're getting
enough is to check nutrition labels on all packages of grain
products (including cereals, bread, crackers, and pasta), fruits,
vegetables, beans, and mixed dishes. Be sure to adjust the fiber
content listed for how your portion compares to the one listed.
</P>
<P>
   Since fresh produce is not labeled, approximate its fiber by
counting two or three grams for each half-cup serving; lettuce and
juice should not be counted as supplying any fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to check the fiber in your diet is to simply make
sure you eat at least the minimum recommendations for a mostly
plant-based diet: five standard-size servings of fruits and
vegetables, and six servings of grain products, of which three or
more should be whole grains.
</P>
<P>
   If you reach this basic nutrition goal, you'll average 21 grams
of fiber or more, which meets recommended goals. By eating more of
these healthy foods, or including beans or a high-fiber cereal,
it's easy to get to 30 or 35 grams of fiber.

 &HT;    Dos and Don'ts of Capri Pants
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Shins are in.
</P>
<P>
   Their moment in the fashion sun comes courtesy of capris,
cropped pants and clamdiggers _ all those britches hitched up at
the hem.
</P>
<P>
   They, along with pedal pushers and toreadors, are the latest
style to be regurgitated here at century's close. Fashion's
capricious finger now points back to the '50s and early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of the millennium, and we're revisiting our
favorite times,'' says Michele Weston, fashion and style director
of Mode magazine. ``And weren't the '50s a wonderful time to be
around?''
</P>
<P>
   When shorter pants resurfaced last spring, fashionable New
Yorkers quickly took them to the streets. The look is still going
strong this year, and high waters are now hot around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has enjoyed a lengthy love affair with hiked-up hems.
Capris turned Audrey Hepburn into a beatnik for her first screen
musical, Funny Face, and transformed Mary Tyler Moore into a
trend-setting housewife in her first big TV foray, The Dick Van
Dyke Show.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their retro pedigree, capri pants and their short-seamed
sibs are resolutely modern.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look now,'' says Suzanne Yalof, executive fashion editor
of Glamour magazine. ``They're an instant updater.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy to wear, too. Just about everybody can find a capri or
clamdigger to suit her figure and style personality. Some hit just
below the knee, some hug the calf, some hover above the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen it work for so many women, whether they're petite
or tall,'' says Weston of Mode, which targets sizes 12 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Modern-day capris and clamdiggers are cut from denim, gabardine
and twill. Army-fatigue green and khaki stand ready as the next
look, says Anne Slowey, fashion news director of Elle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less about looking edgy and more about looking fresh,''
she says. Capris ``look smart, in that old-fashioned sense of the
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Trendy though they may be, capris possess a timeless quality.
Think Jackie Kennedy wading in the Hyannis surf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capris are almost a staple,'' Slowey says. ``As women build
their wardrobe, they should go out there and find the best pair of
capris they can and never get rid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   A user's guide
</P>
<P>
   DO'S
</P>
<P>
   Do try a wide variety of cuts to find the shape and length that
works best for you.
</P>
<P>
   Do pull on a pair of form-fitting clamdiggers if you've got
great calves or fuller cropped pants if your calves are on the
chunky side.
</P>
<P>
   Do keep the top sporty, simple and lean. However, if you like
the coverage of a bigger shirt, that's ``great as long as it's worn
with a slimmer-legged toreador,'' says Michele Weston of Mode.
</P>
<P>
   Do wear flats: sneakers with or without tiny socks, sandals,
slingbacks, mules or ballet slippers. ``Anything else looks kind of
silly,'' says Glamour's Suzanne Yalof.
</P>
<P>
   DON'TS
</P>
<P>
   Don't go for the shortest of the cropped styles if you're
petite. In general, the shorter you are, the longer the style you
should opt for.
</P>
<P>
   Don't wear cropped pants if you're pear-shaped. ``For some
reason, they make (a big rear end) look bigger,'' Yalof says.
</P>
<P>
   Don't show your stomach. ``I wouldn't recommend a bra top with
capris,'' says Anne Slowey of Elle. ``That brings to mind West Side
Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget your toes. ``The three words we always say are
`pedicure, pedicure, pedicure,''' Weston says.
</P>
<P>
   Who's wearing the pants?
</P>
<P>
   A short history of shortened pants
</P>
<P>
   When magazine editor Anne Slowey thinks of capris, the
standard-bearers who come to mind are Audrey Hepburn and Jacqueline
Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Hepburn gave capris a kick in Sabrina and Funny Face. More than
40 years later, her signature look is still fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of her fashion lessons can be adapted for use right now;
indeed, her influence on contemporary style is incomparable,''
writes Pamela Clarke Keogh in the new Audrey Style (HarperCollins,
$40). ``Audrey popularized the gamine haircut, flat ballet shoes,
the turtleneck, slim capri pants. . . '' And the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   But Hepburn wasn't the only one to give capris that je ne sais
quoi sense of everlasting cool:
</P>
<P>
   In capris and a tee, Jean Seberg left Jean-Paul Belmondo waiting
to exhale in Breathless.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Kennedy hit the green in capris as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Tyler Moore popularized capris as a trend-setting housewife
in The Dick Van Dyke Show.
</P>
<P>
   In Pulp Fiction, Uma Thurman wore cropped pants on her
heartstopping date with John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   Mix and match these separates
</P>
<P>
   Can't tell a capri from a clamdigger?
</P>
<P>
   You're in good company: Distinguishing toreadors from pedal
pushers can prove daunting for even the savviest New York fashion
editor. We consulted Fairchild's Dictionary of Fashion. See how
well you do and then follow suit _ all these looks are current. (We
can't have you resurrecting your gauchoes, after all!)

 &HT;    Fashions get brighter for the younger crowd
 &HT;    (Eds: Story has accompanying art _ Call CoxNet at 404-526-5456.)
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ It's hard to miss the eye-stopping colors and
styles of kids' clothes for spring.
</P>
<P>
   Young girls' clothing aisles are spattered with the pinkest of
pinks, opulent oranges, vibrant violets and brilliant blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely wanting brights,'' said Jan Koskela, who
works at Kid's Korner clothing store at Doc and Laddy's.
</P>
<P>
   Lime green is currently the No. 1 color choice, store owners
report. Paired with lemony yellows, the vibrant colors brighten up
even the dreariest day.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get a little tired of the pastels,'' said Jackie Howk,
store team leader for Gymboree at Richland Mall. ``People kind of
go with pastels in February, March and April. Then parents get real
tired of seeing that after Easter. I have some customers who won't
buy anything but a primary color.''
</P>
<P>
   But just because the colors are bold and bright doesn't detract
from the cute and playful looks many parents still want in young
girls' clothing. Frilly lace, floral prints, fashionable
embroideries and even bloomers dress up fashions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want their 5-year-old in things that 18-year-olds
are wearing,'' Howk said. ``Most people, I think, want
age-appropriate clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   For active girls, look for dresses with matching bike shorts or
leggings. One-piece jumpers made from lightweight material, such as
cotton seersucker, are a popular standby with children and mothers
alike. For a more dressy look, A-line cotton-knit or sheer dresses
are items to look for this spring.
</P>
<P>
   For two different looks, Gymboree has a new reversible dress in
several colors _ one side features a solid-colored dress while the
other has a floral pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get dirty or just feel like having fun, they can turn
it over,'' Howk said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides flower and butterfly patterns, which are perennial
favorites, look for prints with chickens, lollipops and even
angels, said Sheila Saucedo, co-owner of Kid's Korner with Donna
Dowell.
</P>
<P>
   She reports that her customers are always scoping out clothes
that are ``unique and different,'' including an exclusive line of
hand-painted girls' clothing she carries called Balu Essentials
from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Boys are fit to be tied this spring in cargo pants and shorts in
khaki and other trendy colors, Howk reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even starting with the little-bitty boys, mothers want to buy
cargo shorts for their newborns,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The older boys get, the more their clothing begins to resemble
daddy's ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to make it more like what daddy wears or
something they're seeing their football and baseball heros in,''
Howk said. ``They used to make (boys) clothes kind of cutsie. I
don't think (cute) goes over as well as with girls clothes.
(Parents) don't want cute once their sons reach 3 or 4 years of
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for shirts with stripes or golf motifs for little boys this
spring, as well as overall shorts and pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can wear overalls with something under it or if it's
really hot, they can wear it by itself,'' Howk said.
</P>
<P>
   Mix-and-match pieces work well for young boys, who often need
different sizes for tops and bottoms, said Sherena Barrett, owner
of Jelly Beans children's clothing store on Lake Air Drive. Olive
drab, khaki and navy are top colors for boys and anything with
safari, tropical or bug prints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big, popular thing to do right now is accessorize,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many young boys' clothing manufacturers are attaching fun
toy-like accessories to some boy's clothing, like a pair of
binoculars attached to a safari shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the clothes more appealing since little boys don't
get as excited about clothes as little girls,'' Barrett said.

 &HT;    A bigger sound for `Star Wars'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When George Lucas' fourth ``Star Wars'' film debuts
May 19, it won't sound at some theaters like any movie you've ever
seen and heard before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace'' has been recorded in Dolby
Digital Surround EX, the latest in movie sound systems. And at
least one theater chain is installing the system at its newest
metro Atlanta megaplex.
</P>
<P>
   Regal Cinemas is working extra hours to complete its new
Hollywood 24 theater by mid-May, before ``Phantom Menace'' opens.
The megaplex had been set to open in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   At Hollywood 24, the two largest screening rooms, each seating
about 500 patrons, will be equipped with Surround EX. And another
chain _ United Artists _ is considering the technology for some of
its screens.
</P>
<P>
   Dolby Digital Surround EX, developed by Lucasfilm's THX division
and Dolby Laboratories, involves installing four speakers on the
back walls of a screening room at a cost of between $2,000 and
$4,000. Moviegoers already are used to sound emanating from
speakers at the right and left  theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds another level of surround sound,'' says Phil
Zackaretti, senior vice president of marketing and advertising for
Regal. ``Instead of left and right, you have left, right and
rear.''
</P>
<P>
   The intent is to envelop audiences in sound. They could, for
example, hear a spaceship come in from behind them, pass overhead,
then head into the distance in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   The system will ``open up new possibilities and place sounds
exactly where you would hear them in the real world,'' says Gary
Rydstrom, the Oscar-winning sound designer who devised the new
format.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Phantom Menace,'' the next film set to be recorded in
Surround EX is Dreamworks' ``The Haunting,'' directed by Jan De
Bont (``Speed'') and due out July 23.

 &HT;    Lewinsky manages to charm curious at bookstore
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ She's been dumped by a president,
deposed by a special prosecutor and betrayed by her best friend.
</P>
<P>
   But Monica Lewinsky can still unleash a smile to outshine a
paparazzi's flash.
</P>
<P>
   According to the famous First Intern, Clinton was attracted to
her bubbly personality. To the way, he supposedly told her, that
she lit up a room.
</P>
<P>
   So I drove to her book signing in Fort Lauderdale not to cluck
or chide or talk politics or morality or other Big Issues.
</P>
<P>
   I went solely to check out the charmisa factor; her ``wattage,''
if you will. Does she burn brightly enough to light up a room? Or
does she unleash barely enough amps to power an electric
toothbrush?
</P>
<P>
   I can report this: Monica shines.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know. I'm supposed to be cynical and hard-edged and
dislike this 25-year-old whose shaky morals almost toppled the
presidency. But the way she treated the almost 500 people who
waited in line to buy her best-selling ``Monica's Story'' won me
over.
</P>
<P>
   She did all the right things: She made eye contact with everyone
who paraded before her and often added a cheery ``Hi there!'' She
made quick small talk with some. When she was presented with gifts,
she was careful to explain that she was giving the presents to
security for safe-keeping, not merely casting them aside.
</P>
<P>
   People responded.
</P>
<P>
   One woman presented her with a rhinestone barrette and reacted
with teenybopper glee when Monica clipped it on her impossibly
shiny, jet black mane. ``I have such thick hair,'' Monica said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your hair is beautiful,'' assured the barrette woman.
</P>
<P>
   Monica turned her head to model. ``Does it look OK?''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to tell if Monica was born with the star power
to attract a president or if it comes courtesy of her recent
media-ready makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Friday she wore slimming black _ from chunky platforms to capri
pant to v-neck tee. She must have read _ and believed _ her own
press, because she appeared to be wearing the same makeup thousands
of women clamored for after the famous television interview with
Barbara Walters.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there weren't some things about the event that
seemed symbolic or ironic or just plain goofy. Like the fact that
after meeting Monica, book buyers at Liberties exited the signing
area between shelves holding ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to the
Impeachment of the President'' and ``The Lady is a Tramp'' sheet
music.
</P>
<P>
   Or how she coaxed wary autograph seekers over _ and conjured up
unfortunate mental images _ with a chirpy ``I don't bite.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of the assembled, a passing glimpse at one of the
world's most famous women seemed to be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the back of her head!'' said Ann Porter of Davie as
Monica and her entourage strode by 20 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``She saw the back of her head. I saw her face,'' said Porter's
friend, Kristin Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   A passing glimpse is probably enough. After all, if you look too
long, you might get burned.

 &HT;    New hope for schizophrenia's bewildered victims
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASTROP, Texas _ A man sits on a couch in his duplex, not
smoking. Junk mail, loose papers and a Bible piled on the coffee
table in front of him, a set of 1970 World Books on a shelf against
the wall behind. Short brown hair a little mussed on the right
side. Alert eyes set deep in a pillow of a face. This man tells an
old and familiar story in an autopilot monotone, then looks up,
smiles and says: ``I'm just a Pentecostal preacher who had some
hard times.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Exactly. A Pentecostal preacher who had some hard times,
makes $5.65 an hour as a courtesy clerk at the H-E-B store here and
has a six-year-old cat named Rosie. Rosie's litter is supposed to
be the odorless kind, but you can smell it.
</P>
<P>
   If you were just looking at the man not smoking, you wouldn't
know any of that. Nor would you know that when he smokes _ always
out on the back slab porch next to the garbage can _ he inhales
down to his toes.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't know that the man has seen the apocalypse and what
comes after.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would you know that when he takes his meds, the voices and
visions and delusions stop and he can get down to the business of
maintaining an existence within the parameters of what the world
defines rather narrowly as sanity. He goes to his job, checks the
oil in his car, listens to his Christian CDs, prays and struggles
to understand why this happened to him. The man is trusting, kind,
utterly without irony _ a discarded, forgotten part of you.
</P>
<P>
   The man is named Wesley Duty _ onetime preacher, would-be family
man, consistent hard worker. He's had schizophrenia for more than
half of his 37 years. Mental health advocates estimate some 11,700
Texans are receiving the medications, but some 34,000 _ again, an
estimate _ are still waiting. This year, the Texas Department of
Mental Health and Mental Retardation asked the Legislature for $150
million over two years to dispense the new drugs and services. (The
final amount, if approved, is likely to be less)
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the same anti-psychotics have been prescribed to
schizophrenics, but the drugs produced side effects in two-thirds
of those who took them _ facial tics, muscle spasms, tremors,
panting and grimacing among them. This frequently led to patients
taking themselves off the medicines, which in turn led to another
stay in the hospital. A new generation of ``atypical''
anti-psychotics offers schizophrenics at least a shot at a more
independent life. Two of the new drugs, risperidone and olanzapine,
received FDA approval in 1996 and 1997, respectively, and others
are on the way. Side effects are generally rarer and more
manageable in the new generation of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Wesley's apartment is a world away from the Capitol and the
suits, the powerful pharmaceutical companies and social
policymakers and budget appropriators. In Wesley's apartment sits a
man who knows how far he's come and how far he has yet to go.
</P>
<P>
   The little boy from Lubbock who was never quite right
</P>
<P>
   A woman and her husband sit on a couch in their northeast
Austin, Texas home, talking about schizophrenia as a family
affliction. The woman is Anita Glass, Wesley's sister. The husband
is Joe. They got married 20 years ago this summer, about the time
that Wesley started acting strangely.
</P>
<P>
   Anita: ``I liked him. He was my baby brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe: ``Always a nice man. A little hard to talk to, a little
self-absorbed, I guess. He had an imaginary world. He had all the
aspirations and goals of an average person and he wasn't achieving
them. He wanted the nice girlfriend and the car and the house, but
it was escaping him, and I don't think he understood why. I think
he spent a lot of time trying to figure out why everybody else was
getting those things and he wasn't. . . . When he's on his
medication, he sees the world more as it really is. And that ain't
all that pretty. He starts to realize his life is not all that
great, and he's not happy with that. So when he stops taking his
medication, he's happier for a while, but then he loses
functionality. He's smart enough to know what's going on around
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia advances with stealth and patience. But eventually
there's a line of demarcation, if only one that's recognized in
hindsight, between that's-just-Wesley-being-Wesley and
there's-something-really-wrong-with-Wesley. He was always, shall we
say, eccentric, and he didn't excel in school. Still, when his
father got him those World Books he inhaled them, reading about
other countries. In high school he was in French and German clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Wow, this world is magnificent. It's really
starting to show itself to me,' '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then the tremors started. And the voices and delusions. And
Wesley's mind slammed the door shut.
</P>
<P>
   So, why is it that, in the abstract, we romanticize this thing _
mental illness, insanity, craziness, whatever we call it somehow
seems inaccurate, hurtful or unnecessarily obfuscatory? How can we
make songs out of craziness? How dare we use it to describe
ill-advised choices in love (``Crazy,'' Willie Nelson) or an excuse
to party down (``Let's Go Crazy,'' Prince) when those who have been
through it and out the other side can't even put it into words?
</P>
<P>
   Why is it we do that on the one hand, and then when suddenly
mental illness becomes the elephant in our living room we pretend
we don't see it. Because we don't understand, don't want to think
it might be hereditary, don't want to entertain the notion that
maybe it has something to do with the time when we dropped the baby
on her head. Because we can't stop thinking, Why won't he just stop
acting like that?
</P>
<P>
   Wesley's mother was dying in the hospital, and he took a little
break from reality _ noncommunicative, utterly withdrawn. And,
because he wouldn't be diagnosed as schizophrenic until four years
later, all Anita could think was what a self-obsessed jerk her
brother was being.
</P>
<P>
   One of his mother's last requests before she died on May 6,
1989, was that Wesley see a doctor. Wesley thought she wanted him
to be a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Bible school, Vegas and the crack-up
</P>
<P>
   What Wesley wanted to be, always, was a man of God. Clinging
white-knuckled to a fierce faith made it easier to handle objects
moving around the room by themselves. And so Wesley went to a Bible
school in an obscure corner of an obscure Midwestern state. One of
those places where they teach you that if you hear the Devil
talking, you've got a real problem.
</P>
<P>
   Once he tried to cook his Bible and eat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Devil can confuse you,'' he says, before adding, ``I
realize schizophrenia and demon possession are two different
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesley values skills such as deductive reasoning he learned at
the school, but they didn't teach him how to get through everyday
life in a cramped little Lubbock efficiency with his father, a man
for whom tough love was the only kind he knew or could express.
</P>
<P>
   At his sister's urging, Wesley had been making efforts to get
help through MHMR, but he wasn't good about keeping appointments.
</P>
<P>
   And then in January of 1993, ``I cracked.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a journey that would be called, in hindsight, his
major episode. He ran to Denver. ``Well, I didn't run, I took a
bus,'' he says. He stayed there a few days, then went to Las Vegas,
where the Bad Wesley took over and partook of . . . well, you know,
Vegas. And he did a heroic job of running through money but had
enough to get to Burbank, where he toured Universal Studios before
flying back to Vegas, blowing the rest of his stash, staying in a
shelter and calling his sister with the few quarters he had left in
his pocket. And the family fetched him home and talked with him,
and Wesley agreed that the hospital would be an OK place to stay
for a while. Then he went to the state hospital in Big Spring,
where he became attached, and arguably engaged, to a fellow patient
whom he never saw after her discharge. He traded a coat for a ring.
</P>
<P>
   She went back to El Paso, I guess,'' he says. ``She was nice. We
went to dances together.''
</P>
<P>
   A place of his own
</P>
<P>
   Because schizophrenia frequently emerges in late adolescence,
the disease frequently derails education or careers. And those who
suffer from it tend to exhibit less than complete social
development.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who will take advantage. Wesley got the job at
the H-E-B in May of '97, but the heat and stress made him break out
in a rash. He took a leave of absence, a breather. Then he began
forgetting to take his medicine because people were knocking on his
door, demanding money, saying they were the police.
</P>
<P>
   One night he lay in bed, his back to the wall, thinking about
his illness. He heard a gurgling, the cacophony of demons
chattering, dribbling out of his left ear.
</P>
<P>
   The delusions are largely in the past, thanks in part to the new
medications and in part to Wesley's adherence to a schedule that
provides structure. He no longer has to call his sister and ask,
``Did I die?''
</P>
<P>
   One theory of schizophrenia is that those who suffer from it
process information like wide-open open floodgates, unable to
filter the superfluous stuff _ ambient noise, for example. In the
days when Wesley was susceptible to distractions, the smallest
thing could trigger an elaborate delusion: A number on his
apartment key suddenly led to heaven on earth; a bump on his head
made him believe he'd been shot in Dallas; the sound of rain became
applause, and it was always for him; every show on TV was about
him.
</P>
<P>
   When these things would happen, he would isolate himself and
wait for the episodes to pass. It's been a long time since he's had
one.
</P>
<P>
   His care manager and his family seem accepting of Wesley's
progress. He knows he's making gains and he knows he's the one who
has to keep doing the work, taking the medication, working at the
H-E-B, buying his groceries and carton of Winstons on payday. He
plays a home-grown version of the civilization-building PC game
``Sim City'' using an old Slim-Fast can with pieces of paper in it,
an elaborate game involving two imaginary worlds that's been going,
off and on, since the Lubbock days. It takes a lot of time, but
Wesley has learned to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   Doubly so in gaining ground with his disease. His sister and
brother-in-law tell him to treat it like diabetes, to never forget
to take his medication. He wants out of the system. He wants a wife
and kids. And he wants to be a missionary. These things may or may
not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that he'll get much better,'' said Steve Lefler,
his care manager. ``I think he's doing as well as can be
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he gets depressed. ``Sometimes I get lonely and forget
to do things,'' he says. ``So I do retreat sometimes into my own
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes in the winter, when it gets very cold, he smokes
inside.

 &HT;    New hope for schizophrenia's bewildered victims
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASTROP, Texas _ A man sits on a couch in his duplex, not
smoking. Junk mail, loose papers and a Bible piled on the coffee
table in front of him, a set of 1970 World Books on a shelf against
the wall behind. Short brown hair a little mussed on the right
side. Alert eyes set deep in a pillow of a face. This man tells an
old and familiar story in an autopilot monotone, then looks up,
smiles and says: ``I'm just a Pentecostal preacher who had some
hard times.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Exactly. A Pentecostal preacher who had some hard times,
makes $5.65 an hour as a courtesy clerk at the H-E-B store here and
has a six-year-old cat named Rosie. Rosie's litter is supposed to
be the odorless kind, but you can smell it.
</P>
<P>
   If you were just looking at the man not smoking, you wouldn't
know any of that. Nor would you know that when he smokes _ always
out on the back slab porch next to the garbage can _ he inhales
down to his toes.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't know that the man has seen the apocalypse and what
comes after.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would you know that when he takes his meds, the voices and
visions and delusions stop and he can get down to the business of
maintaining an existence within the parameters of what the world
defines rather narrowly as sanity. He goes to his job, checks the
oil in his car, listens to his Christian CDs, prays and struggles
to understand why this happened to him. The man is trusting, kind,
utterly without irony _ a discarded, forgotten part of you.
</P>
<P>
   The man is named Wesley Duty _ onetime preacher, would-be family
man, consistent hard worker. He's had schizophrenia for more than
half of his 37 years. Mental health advocates estimate some 11,700
Texans are receiving the medications, but some 34,000 _ again, an
estimate _ are still waiting. This year, the Texas Department of
Mental Health and Mental Retardation asked the Legislature for $150
million over two years to dispense the new drugs and services. (The
final amount, if approved, is likely to be less)
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the same anti-psychotics have been prescribed to
schizophrenics, but the drugs produced side effects in two-thirds
of those who took them _ facial tics, muscle spasms, tremors,
panting and grimacing among them. This frequently led to patients
taking themselves off the medicines, which in turn led to another
stay in the hospital. A new generation of ``atypical''
anti-psychotics offers schizophrenics at least a shot at a more
independent life. Two of the new drugs, risperidone and olanzapine,
received FDA approval in 1996 and 1997, respectively, and others
are on the way. Side effects are generally rarer and more
manageable in the new generation of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Wesley's apartment is a world away from the Capitol and the
suits, the powerful pharmaceutical companies and social
policymakers and budget appropriators. In Wesley's apartment sits a
man who knows how far he's come and how far he has yet to go.
</P>
<P>
   The little boy from Lubbock who was never quite right
</P>
<P>
   A woman and her husband sit on a couch in their northeast
Austin, Texas home, talking about schizophrenia as a family
affliction. The woman is Anita Glass, Wesley's sister. The husband
is Joe. They got married 20 years ago this summer, about the time
that Wesley started acting strangely.
</P>
<P>
   Anita: ``I liked him. He was my baby brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe: ``Always a nice man. A little hard to talk to, a little
self-absorbed, I guess. He had an imaginary world. He had all the
aspirations and goals of an average person and he wasn't achieving
them. He wanted the nice girlfriend and the car and the house, but
it was escaping him, and I don't think he understood why. I think
he spent a lot of time trying to figure out why everybody else was
getting those things and he wasn't. . . . When he's on his
medication, he sees the world more as it really is. And that ain't
all that pretty. He starts to realize his life is not all that
great, and he's not happy with that. So when he stops taking his
medication, he's happier for a while, but then he loses
functionality. He's smart enough to know what's going on around
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia advances with stealth and patience. But eventually
there's a line of demarcation, if only one that's recognized in
hindsight, between that's-just-Wesley-being-Wesley and
there's-something-really-wrong-with-Wesley. He was always, shall we
say, eccentric, and he didn't excel in school. Still, when his
father got him those World Books he inhaled them, reading about
other countries. In high school he was in French and German clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Wow, this world is magnificent. It's really
starting to show itself to me,' '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then the tremors started. And the voices and delusions. And
Wesley's mind slammed the door shut.
</P>
<P>
   So, why is it that, in the abstract, we romanticize this thing _
mental illness, insanity, craziness, whatever we call it somehow
seems inaccurate, hurtful or unnecessarily obfuscatory? How can we
make songs out of craziness? How dare we use it to describe
ill-advised choices in love (``Crazy,'' Willie Nelson) or an excuse
to party down (``Let's Go Crazy,'' Prince) when those who have been
through it and out the other side can't even put it into words?
</P>
<P>
   Why is it we do that on the one hand, and then when suddenly
mental illness becomes the elephant in our living room we pretend
we don't see it. Because we don't understand, don't want to think
it might be hereditary, don't want to entertain the notion that
maybe it has something to do with the time when we dropped the baby
on her head. Because we can't stop thinking, Why won't he just stop
acting like that?
</P>
<P>
   Wesley's mother was dying in the hospital, and he took a little
break from reality _ noncommunicative, utterly withdrawn. And,
because he wouldn't be diagnosed as schizophrenic until four years
later, all Anita could think was what a self-obsessed jerk her
brother was being.
</P>
<P>
   One of his mother's last requests before she died on May 6,
1989, was that Wesley see a doctor. Wesley thought she wanted him
to be a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Bible school, Vegas and the crack-up
</P>
<P>
   What Wesley wanted to be, always, was a man of God. Clinging
white-knuckled to a fierce faith made it easier to handle objects
moving around the room by themselves. And so Wesley went to a Bible
school in an obscure corner of an obscure Midwestern state. One of
those places where they teach you that if you hear the Devil
talking, you've got a real problem.
</P>
<P>
   Once he tried to cook his Bible and eat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Devil can confuse you,'' he says, before adding, ``I
realize schizophrenia and demon possession are two different
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesley values skills such as deductive reasoning he learned at
the school, but they didn't teach him how to get through everyday
life in a cramped little Lubbock efficiency with his father, a man
for whom tough love was the only kind he knew or could express.
</P>
<P>
   At his sister's urging, Wesley had been making efforts to get
help through MHMR, but he wasn't good about keeping appointments.
</P>
<P>
   And then in January of 1993, ``I cracked.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a journey that would be called, in hindsight, his
major episode. He ran to Denver. ``Well, I didn't run, I took a
bus,'' he says. He stayed there a few days, then went to Las Vegas,
where the Bad Wesley took over and partook of . . . well, you know,
Vegas. And he did a heroic job of running through money but had
enough to get to Burbank, where he toured Universal Studios before
flying back to Vegas, blowing the rest of his stash, staying in a
shelter and calling his sister with the few quarters he had left in
his pocket. And the family fetched him home and talked with him,
and Wesley agreed that the hospital would be an OK place to stay
for a while. Then he went to the state hospital in Big Spring,
where he became attached, and arguably engaged, to a fellow patient
whom he never saw after her discharge. He traded a coat for a ring.
</P>
<P>
   She went back to El Paso, I guess,'' he says. ``She was nice. We
went to dances together.''
</P>
<P>
   A place of his own
</P>
<P>
   Because schizophrenia frequently emerges in late adolescence,
the disease frequently derails education or careers. And those who
suffer from it tend to exhibit less than complete social
development.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who will take advantage. Wesley got the job at
the H-E-B in May of '97, but the heat and stress made him break out
in a rash. He took a leave of absence, a breather. Then he began
forgetting to take his medicine because people were knocking on his
door, demanding money, saying they were the police.
</P>
<P>
   One night he lay in bed, his back to the wall, thinking about
his illness. He heard a gurgling, the cacophony of demons
chattering, dribbling out of his left ear.
</P>
<P>
   The delusions are largely in the past, thanks in part to the new
medications and in part to Wesley's adherence to a schedule that
provides structure. He no longer has to call his sister and ask,
``Did I die?''
</P>
<P>
   One theory of schizophrenia is that those who suffer from it
process information like wide-open open floodgates, unable to
filter the superfluous stuff _ ambient noise, for example. In the
days when Wesley was susceptible to distractions, the smallest
thing could trigger an elaborate delusion: A number on his
apartment key suddenly led to heaven on earth; a bump on his head
made him believe he'd been shot in Dallas; the sound of rain became
applause, and it was always for him; every show on TV was about
him.
</P>
<P>
   When these things would happen, he would isolate himself and
wait for the episodes to pass. It's been a long time since he's had
one.
</P>
<P>
   His care manager and his family seem accepting of Wesley's
progress. He knows he's making gains and he knows he's the one who
has to keep doing the work, taking the medication, working at the
H-E-B, buying his groceries and carton of Winstons on payday. He
plays a home-grown version of the civilization-building PC game
``Sim City'' using an old Slim-Fast can with pieces of paper in it,
an elaborate game involving two imaginary worlds that's been going,
off and on, since the Lubbock days. It takes a lot of time, but
Wesley has learned to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   Doubly so in gaining ground with his disease. His sister and
brother-in-law tell him to treat it like diabetes, to never forget
to take his medication. He wants out of the system. He wants a wife
and kids. And he wants to be a missionary. These things may or may
not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that he'll get much better,'' said Steve Lefler,
his care manager. ``I think he's doing as well as can be
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he gets depressed. ``Sometimes I get lonely and forget
to do things,'' he says. ``So I do retreat sometimes into my own
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes in the winter, when it gets very cold, he smokes
inside.

 &HT;    Star Wars fans, Only 480 hours to go!
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When you start waiting in line for a
movie 42 days ahead of time, you should expect someone to mock your
zealotry.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes for the two dozen dedicated souls who are waiting for
the next saga in the Star Wars series, Episode 1: The Phantom
Menace, at the makeshift campground outside Mann's Chinese Theater
in Hollywood, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Most passersby toss a quizzical,
what's-that-accident-by-the-side-of-the-road look their way. Others
are less charitable, such as a band of Star Trek fans who drove by
the other day and hurled insults, acting out a mild version of
sci-fi gang warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``A car full of guys yelled, `Get a life, you losers!''' said
fan Rick Carter. ``They went down Hollywood Boulevard a ways,
turned around, came back and yelled it again. Now, who's the bigger
loser? Us? Or the guys driving around shouting, `Loser' at the
supposed losers?''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's been in line since April 6. By the end of the month,
the 42-year-old screenwriter and movie director will have camped
out for 576 hours with several dozen friends. That's 576 hours
down, 480 more until showtime.
</P>
<P>
   He's part of a group that literally crossed oceans for the
chance to see the new flick first. The clan met on the World Wide
Web at a site dedicated to counting the days, hours and minutes
until the movie debuts. (The aptly named http://countingdown.com)
</P>
<P>
   While it has all the makings of a publicity stunt, these folks
aren't messing around. It may have started as a small, quirky idea,
but it's now a multimedia extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   The group is armed with laptop computers, cellular phones and a
host of digital cameras that snap photos and transmit video
glimpses of their line to the Internet. They've created a Web site
about their effort, using a computer powerful enough to run an
office building and attract 500,000 visits a day. (They're on line
on line, so to say.)
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors are providing power and telephone lines, as
well as money for each hour they spend in line. (The group aims to
raise $40,000 for the Starlight Foundation, which helps terminally
ill children.) Five months ago, they began plotting to take turns
in shifts to save their spots. They acquired city permits and a $1
million insurance policy so they could assemble a makeshift urban
campground. They're doing media interviews almost around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   And they're having a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay Leno came by the other day to film a comedy bit with us,''
said Carter, who at 42 is double the age of most in line. ``Jake
Lloyd, the little boy who plays the young Darth Vader in the new
movie, also came by to sign autographs and bring us a box of
candy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second go-round for Carter. In 1977, he saw the
original Star Wars at the Chinese Theater on opening day. There was
no line _ it wasn't until a week later that word of mouth caused
moviegoers to cram theaters. It won't be that way this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once stood in line at 11 a.m. for a 7 p.m. showing of the
X-Files movie, but this is totally different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of Carter is Lincoln Gasking, a 22-year-old real estate
broker from Melbourne, Australia. The creator of countingdown.com,
Gasking flew into Los Angeles earlier this month, planning to start
the line on April 19. Instead, he jumped in on April 6 when word
got out that two teenagers had already formed a line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lincoln has been doing interviews nonstop,'' said Carter, who
joined the line four hours after Gasking. ``He finishes with one
and another crew steps up.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendees vary according to the time of day. The line diminishes
a bit during the workday but swells to more than 30 at night, when
others drop by to talk about the movie, nosh on junk food and
commune among friends.
</P>
<P>
   Across town at the Mann's theater in the Westwood section of Los
Angeles, 20-year-old software engineer Ilya Haykinson is waiting
with another dozen friends from countingdown.com.
</P>
<P>
   Their accommodations are more subdued. They're just as
technologically wired, but there's less space, so they're resorting
to umbrellas and lawn chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It rained the other night, so we just ducked into our cars,''
Haykinson said. ``The cars were parked right next to the sidewalk,
so we technically were still in line.''
</P>
<P>
   Another technicality: Haykinson and others continue to work. (It
helps that his Internet company in Santa Monica is helping sponsor
the line.) After work, he waits in Westwood, leaves early in the
morning to go home and take a shower and then goes to work again.
Gasking also keeps tabs on his job from the line by phone. Carter
doctors scripts while he waits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also helps that most of the town is about to go on hiatus
and they've bought all the scripts they'll need for next year's TV
season, so I have the time to spend.''
</P>
<P>
   The goofball quotient has been low among the diehard fans. No
one is dressed up like Obi-Wan Kenobi. Only a few people have
brought Star Wars toys or trinkets. A couple have Star Wars
tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one girl in line at the Chinese theater who has been
sitting in line full-time _ except for showering and eating _ only
as a social experiment,'' Haykinson said. ``She's not even going to
see the movie. She's donating the tickets she buys to fans and
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, they've become temporary darlings around town. Shows
such as Access Hollywood and Entertainment Tonight can't get enough
video of the group. During a premiere the other night at the
Chinese theater, a few got to hang with paparazzi so they could
snap digital pictures for the Web site of Sean Connery pressing his
hands and feet into wet cement.
</P>
<P>
   ``And every now and then Mann's brings us a big bag of
popcorn,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is actually flying faster than I wanted it to,''
Haykinson said.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-ESCAPE &LR;  -- Just as the lords of evil were about

words. By David Fromkin, author of ``The Way of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-MEDICINE &LR;  -- In 1796 Edward Jenner tried the

<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-LOVESONG &LR;  -- Not ``You're a Hard Dog to Keep

Love You.'' The prize for finest love song goes to Richard Strauss,

Lorrie Moore, author of ``Birds of America.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PORT &LR;  -- ``Talk has been of Venice sinking below

history of the Byzantine Empire.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-VICTORY &LR;  -- It was a come-from-behind triumph:

about the universe that our major millennial anxiety is the
desperate wish to sort it out. So we hunger to rank almost
everything as The Best. 1,500 words. By op-ed columnist and senior
writer for The New York Times Magazine, Frank Rich.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PIANO &LR;  -- The keyboard music of Johann Sebastian

Offering.'' 400 words. By Charles Rosen, concert pianist and author
of ``The Classical Style.''
</P>
<P>

   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-IDEA &LR;  -- It is romantic love, which in the

Carol Oates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-INVENTION &LR;  -- No doubt, the printing press is

Diamond, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and physicist.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-SERMON &LR;  -- The concept, the `Shining City on a

Colony's Gov. Robert Winthrop. His plea for civic virtue inspired

a Dream'' speech. 1,200 words. By Peter J. Gomes, minister of The
Memorial Church at Harvard.

University &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Artwork availability: 35mm color slides or electronic transmission
(via E-MAIL, NEWSCOM or WIECK photo database) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This flat map of the world traced the route of Magellan's
voyages and the Spanish silver fleet. Decorated with cherubs' faces
in a cosmos of billowing clouds and turquoise skies, it is a high
mark of the Renaissance fascination with science and humanism.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-DEMOCRACY -- Every dictator's nightmare is the
idea that humans have rights. The universal principle of the
fundamental rights of man is any tyrant's ``province of terror.''

pro-democracy leader Wole Soyinka.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-TIME &LR;  -- In this panel discussion moderated by

where they'd have lived, given the choice. 1,900 words.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PRODUCT &LR;  -- Forget electricity, the microchip
and the car. Without beans we wouldn't have made it out of the Dark
Ages. If human beings are still here, descendants of the Pilgrim
Fathers or the Spanish conquistadores, it is thanks to beans. 2,400
words. By Umberto Eco, the author of ``The Name of the Rose'' and
``Foucault's Pendulum.''

the Battle of Saratoga. 1,200 words. R.J. Apple Jr., chief
correspondent for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-UTOPIA &LR;  -- As utopians go, the Shakers were a
kindly, harmless bunch. They never took up with Big Brother; they
were pacifists; they didn't kill anyone; they didn't try to impose
their ideas by force. Plus they made a lasting contribution to
furniture design and music. 700 words. By Margaret Atwood, author
of ``A Handmaid's Tail'' and ``Alias Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-GAME &LR;  -- Soccer is a perfect substitute for war,

Brinkley, a Columbia history professor and author of ``Liberalism
and Its Discontents.''
</P>
<P>

<P>

again. 600 words. By Ron Chernow, the author of ``Titan,'' a
biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-LEADER &LR;  -- ``Just look how well she governs,''
the once-reluctant subjects of Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, later

editorial board member Gail Collins.

<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-NUISANCE &LR;  -- Octavia Hill, queen of open spaces,
loved the English countryside, its green fields and fresh air. And
the tiny, stout, badly dressed Hill was obstinate, a downright
bully, about preserving the land she loved. 350 words. By Penelope
Fitzgerald, author of ``The Blue Flower.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-ESCAPE &LR;  -- Just as the lords of evil were about
to make the world part slave colony and part death camp ... the
democracies seized their chance, and mankind made its narrow escape
from global darkness. In short, the Axis self-destructed. 400
words. By David Fromkin, author of ``The Way of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-MEDICINE &LR;  -- In 1796 Edward Jenner tried the
first smallpox vaccine. Its success signaled the first step in

Kimmelman.

Language of Clothes.''

<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-IDEA &LR;  -- It is romantic love, which in the
ancient world was virtually unknown. ``Eros'' referred to chaos,
even disaster. But to the modern sensibility, love is the very
engine of life. 1,100 words. By the prolific American author Joyce
Carol Oates.
</P>

Diamond, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and physicist.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-SERMON &LR;  -- The concept, the `Shining City on a

Colony's Gov. Robert Winthrop. His plea for civic virtue inspired

a Dream'' speech. 1,200 words. By Peter J. Gomes, minister of The
Memorial Church at Harvard.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAPPING the MILLENNIUM: ``The Best View of the World'' &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; ''The Agnese Map'' -- Created by Battista Agnese, a Venetian
cartographer, in Venice, in the mid-16th century &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; CREDIT: Courtesy of the John Carter Brown Library at Brown
University &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Artwork availability: 35mm color slides or electronic transmission
(via E-MAIL, NEWSCOM or WIECK photo database) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This flat map of the world traced the route of Magellan's
voyages and the Spanish silver fleet. Decorated with cherubs' faces
in a cosmos of billowing clouds and turquoise skies, it is a high
mark of the Renaissance fascination with science and humanism.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-DEMOCRACY -- Every dictator's nightmare is the
idea that humans have rights. The universal principle of the
fundamental rights of man is any tyrant's ``province of terror.''
1,900 words. By Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and Nigerian
pro-democracy leader Wole Soyinka.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-TIME &LR;  -- In this panel discussion moderated by
veteran New York Times columnist Russell Baker, the talk is of the
best time to be alive. The Ming dynasty? Puritan New England?
Yale's Jonathan Spence, Harvard's Orlando Patterson and others tell
where they'd have lived, given the choice. 1,900 words.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PRODUCT &LR;  -- Forget electricity, the microchip
and the car. Without beans we wouldn't have made it out of the Dark
Ages. If human beings are still here, descendants of the Pilgrim
Fathers or the Spanish conquistadores, it is thanks to beans. 2,400
words. By Umberto Eco, the author of ``The Name of the Rose'' and
``Foucault's Pendulum.''
</P>

<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-BATTLE &LR;  -- The millennium would see other great

the Battle of Saratoga. 1,200 words. R.J. Apple Jr., chief
correspondent for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-UTOPIA &LR;  -- As utopians go, the Shakers were a
kindly, harmless bunch. They never took up with Big Brother; they
were pacifists; they didn't kill anyone; they didn't try to impose
their ideas by force. Plus they made a lasting contribution to
furniture design and music. 700 words. By Margaret Atwood, author
of ``A Handmaid's Tail'' and ``Alias Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-GAME &LR;  -- Soccer is a perfect substitute for war,
by assuaging national rivalries. Case in point: Last summer more

France's victory in the World Cup. Just a sports coup? 800 words.

music director of the American Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-REVOLUTION &LR;  -- Thanks to Gandhi, the peacemaker,
India won its freedom without firing a shot. ``Of the many
revolutions ... the human-rights revolution seems to be the most
morally appealing to the world of our time.'' 700 words. By Alan
Brinkley, a Columbia history professor and author of ``Liberalism
and Its Discontents.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-STORY &LR;  -- ``Scheherazade'' has everything a tale
should have: sex, death, treachery, vengeance, magic, humor, wit,
surprise, a gorgeous heroine and a happy ending. 2,000 words. By
the noted storyteller A.S. Byatt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-DEAL &LR;  -- The purchase of the Suez Canal Co. gave
bankers more power than they had yet known or would ever know
again. 600 words. By Ron Chernow, the author of ``Titan,'' a
biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-LEADER &LR;  -- ``Just look how well she governs,''
the once-reluctant subjects of Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, later
would remark. For the ravishing ruler exceeded all expectations,
and by now she is namesake to an era. 500 words. By New York Times
editorial board member Gail Collins.
</P>
<P>

and Ethiopians. 1,500 words. By Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, author of
``Millennium,'' being made into a TV series for CNN.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-NUISANCE &LR;  -- Octavia Hill, queen of open spaces,
loved the English countryside, its green fields and fresh air. And
the tiny, stout, badly dressed Hill was obstinate, a downright
bully, about preserving the land she loved. 350 words. By Penelope
Fitzgerald, author of ``The Blue Flower.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-ESCAPE &LR;  -- Just as the lords of evil were about
to make the world part slave colony and part death camp ... the
democracies seized their chance, and mankind made its narrow escape
from global darkness. In short, the Axis self-destructed. 400
words. By David Fromkin, author of ``The Way of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-MEDICINE &LR;  -- In 1796 Edward Jenner tried the
first smallpox vaccine. Its success signaled the first step in
medicine's control over the microbial world _ one that led to the
discovery of safe, inexpensive and effective vaccines. 400 words.
By Harvard medical school physician and professor Jerome Groopman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-SCANDAL &LR;  -- When it comes to failed romance,
nothing beats the British royals. Case in point: Henry VIII and
Anne Boleyn. 450 words. By Josephine Hart, author of ``Damage,''
``Sin'' and ``Oblivion.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-ART &LR;  -- Florentine architect Brunelleschi's

the wall. 500 words. By New York Times chief art critic Michael
Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-BREED &LR;  -- Keep your AKC pedigree and ``give me a

Bond Between People and Dogs.''

``Therapy: A Novel'' and ``The Practice of Writing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-FASHION &LR;  -- The zipper is probably the only
clothes fastener to have been the star of a Broadway song. And yes,
there's nothing sexier than a zipper, a ``perfect set of teeth.''
500 words. By Alison Lurie, author (appropriately), of ``The
Language of Clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PUNCTUATION &LR;  -- Natch, it's the period.
``Diminutive as a mote of dust, a mere peck of the pen, a crumb on
the keyboard, the full stop _ the period _ is the unsung legislator
of our writing systems ... the irreplaceable ``dot that death
devours.'' 500 words. A gem by Alberto Manguel, author of ``A
History of Reading.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-SHOT &LR;  -- A nameless bowman in the forests of

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-LOVESONG &LR;  -- Not ``You're a Hard Dog to Keep

Love You.'' The prize for finest love song goes to Richard Strauss,

Lorrie Moore, author of ``Birds of America.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PORT &LR;  -- ``Talk has been of Venice sinking below
the flood. But it has not been so. So rich is the port, so
incomparably hemmed around by beauty, that it will remain a prodigy
among the havens, a true bride of the sea, a port of a thousand
years.'' 750 poetic words. By Jan Morris, author of ``The World of
Venice.''

history of the Byzantine Empire.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-VICTORY &LR;  -- It was a come-from-behind triumph:
Oct 2, 1978, the Red Sox were ahead 2-0, with the tying runs on

left-field fence. 300 words. By Keith Olbermann, senior
correspondent and anchor for Fox Sports News.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-QUESTION &LR;  -- ``What interests me,'' Albert

eaten by Columbus after he set foot on this continent?
Unfortunately, nobody's sure. 500 words. By Ruth Reichl, the former

</P>
<P>

about the universe that our major millennial anxiety is the
desperate wish to sort it out. So we hunger to rank almost
everything as The Best. 1,500 words. By op-ed columnist and senior
writer for The New York Times Magazine, Frank Rich.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PIANO &LR;  -- The keyboard music of Johann Sebastian
Bach cannot be called piano music, but there is one magnificent
exception: the six-voice ``ricercare'' from ``The Musical
Offering.'' 400 words. By Charles Rosen, concert pianist and author
of ``The Classical Style.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-TOOL &LR;  -- ``It is not an exaggeration to say that

of ``A Clearing in the Distance.''
</P>
<P>

everything as The Best. 1,500 words. By op-ed columnist and senior
writer for The New York Times Magazine, Frank Rich.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-LOVESONG &LR;  -- Not ``You're a Hard Dog to Keep
Under the Porch.'' Not even Dolly Parton's sublime ``I Will Always
Love You.'' The prize for finest love song goes to Richard Strauss,

the ravishing final trio of ``Die Rosenkavalier.'' 600 words. By
Lorrie Moore, author of ``Birds of America.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PORT &LR;  -- ``Talk has been of Venice sinking below

years.'' 750 poetic words. By Jan Morris, author of ``The World of
Venice.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-BUILDING &LR;  -- The Seagram Building, a 38-story

history of the Byzantine Empire.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-VICTORY &LR;  -- It was a come-from-behind triumph:
Oct 2, 1978, the Red Sox were ahead 2-0, with the tying runs on
base, and harmless Yankees shortstop Bucky Dent stepped up to the
bat and miraculously sent a homer into the netting over the
left-field fence. 300 words. By Keith Olbermann, senior
correspondent and anchor for Fox Sports News.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-QUESTION &LR;  -- ``What interests me,'' Albert
Einstein once remarked, ``is whether God had any choice in the
creation of the world.'' That is, might the universe be any other

eaten by Columbus after he set foot on this continent?
Unfortunately, nobody's sure. 500 words. By Ruth Reichl, the former
chief restaurant critic for The New York Times, who is now the

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-WHY &LR;  -- We live in a time when we know so much
about the universe that our major millennial anxiety is the
desperate wish to sort it out. So we hunger to rank almost
everything as The Best. 1,500 words. By op-ed columnist and senior
writer for The New York Times Magazine, Frank Rich.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PIANO &LR;  -- The keyboard music of Johann Sebastian

Offering.'' 400 words. By Charles Rosen, concert pianist and author
of ``The Classical Style.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-TOOL &LR;  -- ``It is not an exaggeration to say that

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-SPEECH &LR;  -- Forget ``Give me liberty or give me

   INHALER-HEART-MED _ SAN DIEGO _ A type of inhaler commonly used
to suppress asthma attacks may bring on a heart attack in some
at-risk patients, according to a report expected to be released
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of more than 4,500 asthmatics, Seattle researchers
found that the use of beta-agonist metered-dose inhalers increased
the risk for heart attack in some patients who also suffered from
heart disease. The risk was highest for new users of the inhalers.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to otherwise healthy asthmatics who did not use
beta-agonist inhalers, those with underlying heart disease who had
recently started on beta-agonist therapy were seven times more
likely to suffer a heart attack, researchers reported at the annual
joint meeting of the American Lung Association and the American
Thoracic Society.
</P>
<P>
   This elevated risk, according to Dr. David H. Au of the
University of Washington, likely involves the fact that new inhaler
users have not yet adjusted to the medication's side effect of
speeding up the heart rate. (500 WORDS)
</P>
<P>
   SMOKING-GENDER-MED _ SAN DIEGO _ Male and female smokers'
varying mood swings help determine why they reach for a cigarette,
and may help researchers fine tune smoking-cessation efforts to the
sexes, according to a report to be released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigating what drives smokers to rip open a pack of
cigarettes, University of California at Irvine researchers asked 60
men and women ages 18 to 42 to record their moods before and after
lighting up. The subjects kept diaries for two days.
</P>
<P>
   While some emotions, such as anger and anxiety, drove both men
and women to scurry for a light, there were marked differences in
their smoking urges, Dr. Ralph Delfino and colleagues found. For
instance, when men were sad, they reached for a pack. Not so with
women, who tended to light up when happy. And anxious men only
worsened stress by smoking, while women found solace in their
cigarettes. (350 WORDS)
</P>
<P>
   TRANSPLANT-GENDER-MED _ SAN DIEGO _ Lung transplants may be more
successful if both the donor and the recipient are female, experts
are expected to report here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As early as six months after a lung transplant, women who
received an organ from a man were at greater risk of serious
complications, according to a study of 98 men and women who
underwent the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the operation, the transplanted lung was
functioning in just three of the 16 women who received a lung from
a male donor, according to Dr. Keith C. Meyer of the University of
Wisconsin at Madison. In contrast, the lung was functional in 14 of
25 women who received a lung from another woman.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the American Lung Association and the American
Thoracic Society's annual meeting, Meyer and colleagues are
expected to encourage doctors to take the sex of the donor into
account when making transplant decisions. (DEVELOPING) (500 WORDS)

   VITAMINS-FRACTURES-MED _ EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE TUESDAY AT 4 P.M.
EASTERN _ While many are aware of the calcium's role in maintaining
healthy bones, relatively few know that vitamin D is also needed to
preserve bone strength.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 30 postmenopausal women seeking treatment for hip
fractures, researchers led by Dr. Meryl S. LeBoff of the Brigham
and Women's Hospital in Boston compared the group's vitamin D level
with that of 68 women of a similar age admitted for elective joint
replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Joint replacements are given to people suffering from damaged
joints, usually due to arthritis, while hip fractures are
associated with osteoporosis, a condition in which the bones thin
and weaken, becoming vulnerable to fractures.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published Wednesday in the Journal of the American
Medical Association (JAMA), the researchers reported that the blood
tests of the women with hip fractures revealed lower levels of
vitamin D than in those seeking joint replacements. This was also
the case when the fracture group was compared with 17 of the 68
joint-replacement participants who were also diagnosed with
osteoporosis. (500 WORDS)
</P>
<P>
   OZONE-TRAFFIC-MED _ SAN DIEGO _ In cities where highways are
clogged with cars, ozone levels often exceed government standards.
These ``ozone-alert'' days can take a particularly heavy toll on
people with asthma.
</P>
<P>
   According to new research to be presented here Tuesday, cities
can reduce ozone levels by making changes in their citizens'
commuting habits.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, officials attempted to
reduce traffic congestion in a number of ways, including
encouraging residents to take shuttle buses to and from work in the
downtown area. These efforts resulted in a more than 22-percent
decline in the number of cars on the roads during the morning rush
hour and a 28-percent decline in peak ozone levels, according to
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic-reduction program had a significant impact on asthma
cases in the Atlanta area, the investigators are expected to report
at the American Lung Association and the American Thoracic
Society's joint annual meeting. Compared with the periods four
weeks before and four weeks after the Olympics, hospitalizations
and emergency-room visits for asthma declined by 11 to 44 percent
during the 17 days of the Olympics. (DEVELOPING) (350 WORDS)

   --When spring arrived I began to sneeze and developed what
seemed like a mild cold, along with a slight sore throat. I am in
my 30s and have never had allergies before, but I'm wondering if
this could be hay fever. Do people ever develop these allergies
during adulthood? And how do you tell the difference between a cold
and allergies?
</P>
<P>
   --I recently started weight training and often have pain and
stiffness the day after a session, sometimes quite severe. How can
I avoid this, and what's the best way to deal with stiff muscles?

NETWORKS SADDLING UP FOR WILD SWEEPS RIDE

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not the Kentucky Derby, but, ladies and gentlemen, we do
have a horse race as we enter the last month of the 1998-1999 TV
season. As the networks round the clubhouse turn, CBS leads NBC by
a nose in total viewers, and NBC holds a length's lead over Fox
among viewers 18-49.
</P>
<P>
   How they will finish _ and, in turn, how they will help their
affiliates to finish _ is what the May sweeps (Thursday-May 26) is
all about. And in this particularly competitive TV year, the horses
are geared up for what could be a memorable kick to the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   Six miniseries, four series finales and several
better-than-average TV movies mark the makings of a memorable May.
Not to mention, there are several highly regarded series _ NBC's
``Homicide'' prominent among them _ that have yet to be renewed for
fall and, we can assume, will be strutting their best stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Here's our guide to the best of the month _ not just among the
sweeps contestants, but all of television. May the best horse win.
</P>
<P>
   Top 10 handicappers
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Joan of Arc,'' May 16 and 18, CBS. A grand cast delivers
sterling performances in this well-written realization of the life
of the peasant girl ``called'' to lead warriors against Britain in
a quest to unite the provinces of France. New star Leelee Sobieski,
a ringer for Helen Hunt, is impressive in the lead role. Supplying
more than adequate support are Peter O'Toole, Neil Patrick Harris,
Peter Strauss, Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Maximilian
Schell, Jacqueline Bisset, Powers Boothe and Robert Loggia. Were
the battle scenes more grand, this would score higher. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Great Expectations,'' May 9-10, PBS. Ioan Gruffudd, so good
as the lead in A&AMP;E's ``Horatio Hornblower'' movies (and the
lifeboat captain in ``Titanic'' who goes back for survivors),
shines again in this new adaptation of the Dickens story. Charlotte
Rampling is a wonder as Miss Havisham. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Cleopatra,'' May 23-24, ABC. The show is not yet ready for
previews, but there's a good chance this will be worth seeing. A
``making of'' film that critics were shown in January showed
evidence that respected producer Robert Halmi Sr. was sparing
little expense on this project. Reports have surfaced that the
movie exceeded its purported $30 million budget. And Elizabeth
Taylor's not even in this one; instead, it stars newcomer Leonor
Varela (``Man in the Iron Mask''), with Timothy Dalton as Julius
Caesar and Billy Zane as Marc Antony.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Double Platinum,'' May 16, ABC. Diana Ross plays a woman
who abandons her baby girl in pursuit of a singing career. When she
comes back to see her, she discovers her daughter, played by
Brandy, has a voice of her own _ one she uses beautifully in song
and cuttingly as a child long spurned. The story's a bit off-key,
but the music's solid gold. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   5. ``The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax,'' May 20, CBS. Angela
Lansbury returns in the role of Pollifax, who this time finds
herself involved in a secret CIA mission. Sounds preposterous but
we buy it thanks to Dorothy Gilman's talent as author and
Lansbury's talent playing a sweet but wily widow. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Our Guys,'' May 10, ABC. Heather Matarazzo (``Welcome to
the Dollhouse'') brilliantly portrays a mildly retarded girl who
becomes the victim of a gruesome sexual assault by a group of high
school football players. Ally Sheedy and Eric Stoltz play the cops
who try to nail the assailants. Not helping: The victim, who just
wants to be liked, is recanting right and left. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   7. ``The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn,'' May 9, CBS. Sidney
Poitier plays a carpenter rooted in old-fashioned ways and values
who becomes the target of a greedy developer. Dianne Wiest and
Mary-Louise Parker co-star. Though unavailable for preview, we sure
do like this cast.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``A Lesson Before Dying,'' May 22, HBO. Joseph Sargent's
much-anticipated adaptation of Ernest Gaines' searing novel. Don
Cheadle stars. Unavailable for preview.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Noah's Ark,'' Sunday and Monday, NBC. Producer Robert Halmi
Sr. allows incredible liberties with the Bible (is nothing
sacred?), casting Noah and Lot as old friends and introducing what
appears to be an unknown survivor of the flood. There's some
dialogue we think was intended to be funny (but isn't) and some
special effects that weren't supposed to be funny-looking (but
are). Jon Voight and Mary Steenburgen star. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Atomic Train,'' May 16-17, NBC. This could be the sleeper
hit of the sweeps. Rob Lowe attempts to stop a runaway train loaded
with nuclear waste and, uh-oh, one stolen nuclear bomb. We can't
keep this a secret: He fails, and poor Denver is blown to
smithereens. The special effects are OK to good, and the idea of
focusing on a train loaded with nuclear waste is a good one. The
bomb was one too many hard things to swallow. Grade: C

</P>
<P>
   OLDDRIVE (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Evelyn White, 84, has driven
almost every day since she got her license as a teen-ager. And she
never had an accident _ until one chilly day last December. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   White didn't see the pickup as she turned left into traffic. The
crash, which barely dented her fender, jolted her into reassessing
her own driving skills. ``I realized I couldn't hear so good
anymore and, well, little things are going wrong with my body,''
she said. ``It was time for me to stop driving.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While White reached that realization on her own, many of this
country's 17 million drivers over age 75 continue to drive long
after they can safely do so. Missouri has a new law that is
becoming a national role model for creating a safe, effective way
to get drivers with impairments (failing vision, etc.) off the
road. By Lee Kavanaugh. With photos. (Story will move in the ``a''

   GUN _ Today President Clinton calls for legislation to make
parents liable if children use their parents' firearms in crimes.
We get local reactions. Johnson County prosecutor says it's a bad

as well as both state legislatures to see if there is support for

PAVAROTTI'S GREATNESS WILL ENDURE, EVEN IF HIS VOICE DOESN'T 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Should Luciano Pavarotti retire?
</P>
<P>
   It depends on who's talking. The 63-year-old tenor's harshest
critics, citing the effects of age on one of the century's great
larynxes, say yes. Rabid admirers say no. Opera fanatics say yes.
He says no, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that I'll have to stop sooner or later,'' he told a
Newsday interviewer last year. ``But if I stop, the only reason
will be a physical failing of some kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti didn't specify, but it's easy to guess which ones: In
the last several years he's been plagued by ailments, from a
crippling weight problem to chronic leg woes that limited his
mobility on stage. His voice, too, seemed to have lost some of its
radiance, becoming less focused during piano (or soft) sections and
less reliable on high notes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 he caused a small firestorm of disapproval when he
transposed a difficult Donizetti aria (``Pour mes amis'' from ``La
Fille du regiment'') down a half-step, turning every high C into a
cool B natural. Three years earlier, he got caught lip-syncing
before a live audience in his native Modena, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's kept at it. And at it. In recent months he's dropped
a lot of weight, his hobbling joints have been replaced, and his
voice (as though in sympathy with his rejuvenated body) has been
ringing with new vim. He continues to appear in operas and tour the
world in one big-splash gig after another.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti, the Energizer Bunny of global singing sensations,
keeps on ticking. And why not? He wants to sing. His fans want him
to sing. Therefore, until both his voice and his fan base
disintegrate entirely or until the Hand of God strikes him dead in
the middle of ``Nessun dorma,'' there is no reason why Luciano
Pavarotti shouldn't go on singing indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   He's a free man in a free market catering to free consumers with
free cash and the freedom to spend it wherever they like.
</P>
<P>
   The Pavarotti debate nevertheless raises an interesting issue.
When should a performer hang it up? When he gets tired of
performing? Or when his artistic prowess has started to sag?
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, we're accustomed to athletes retiring at the height
of their powers and feel slightly embarrassed when they don't;
Wayne Gretzky's graceful departure from hockey and Michael Jordan's
from basketball stand in stark contrast to, say, Sugar Ray
Leonard's cringe-inducing refusal to retire from boxing. We want to
see our idols play in top form. We don't want to see them getting
old.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with classical musicians. Like world-class athletes,
world-class soloists become famous mastering skills of monstrous
technical difficulty. No mere human can score 55 points against the
New York Knicks, just as no mere human can play a Paganini violin
caprice without error or nail the high Cs in Rossini. Those who can
are a class apart. And those in a class apart are expected to stay
there, or pack it up and go home.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti is, without doubt, in the highest class of all. Some
say he's the world's greatest tenor. Some say he's the century's
greatest tenor. Others say he's the most popular tenor ever. All of
this is hyperbole, and all of it's endlessly disputable: The first
statement might be refuted with two words (``Placido Domingo''),
the second by another two (``Jussi Bjoerling''), the third by yet
two more (``Enrico Caruso'').
</P>
<P>
   Yet what's missing in all of this earnest wrangling is a
workable definition of ``great.'' What distinguishes a great
performer from a so-so one isn't purely a matter of technical
ability; it's a matter of communication, inspiration and emotion,
both theirs and ours.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Callas' strength as a soprano was never the perfection of
her voice that was Renata Tebaldi's business but the wild fire in
her phrasings, the emotive power of her roles. The best musician
sends chills up our spines. A middling one, no matter how
note-perfect the performance, does not.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti has always been a good one for chills. From his
earliest recitals in Modena through his 1968 Metropolitan Opera
debut and the three-plus decades of music that followed, he has
snared listeners with his bright-hued lyric tenor. His first
recordings show a voice both dazzling in tone and explosive in
power, a perfect combination for the ornate, urgent lyricism
typical of the 18th-century bel canto operas (Bellini, for
instance) that established his early career.
</P>
<P>
   But as Pavarotti's reputation soared, he began to take on
heavier dramatic roles _ think Berlioz _ and started to tax his
supple voice. The thrilling high notes didn't disappear, but they
became less breathtakingly facile. Listen to his most recent
recordings, and you'll hear it: that same, gleaming voice, still so
seductive, reaching for high notes from a tip-toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``A once-fabulous voice is no longer viable for operatic
performance,'' Peter G. Davis wrote just a few months ago in New
York magazine, and he isn't alone in his opinion. Critics often
bemoan the passing of Pavarotti's brilliant instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for my operatic career, I know it cannot go on forever and
that it must end before too long. I will know when,'' wrote the man
himself (with some help from William Wright) in a tome of memoirs
titled ``Pavarotti: My World.''
</P>
<P>
   Please note: He said operatic career, not concert career.
Performing the standard repertoire in the Met or La Scala is a much
tougher undertaking, musically and acoustically, than belting out
``Singin' in the Rain'' with Domingo and Jose Carreras at a ``Three
Tenors'' bash.
</P>
<P>
   Opera houses are smaller, more intimate, less wired (i.e., no
amps) and far less forgiving; ears are sharper, errors less easily
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   If and when Pavarotti ever announces his retirement, chances are
he'll be retreating not from the large concert halls of the world
but from the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Pavarotti's ailments over the years, he has what he's
always had, and that's greatness. So long as that survives, so will
his career.

LEARN TO BE SAFE TRAVELING ABROAD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the conflict continues in Yugoslavia, the tenor of my
correspondence grows more somber. Concerns spread far beyond the
war zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think I should cancel my vacation in Italy?'' one
reader asked recently. ``Is it still safe to cruise to the Greek
islands?'' another inquired. ``Are American travelers being
targeted abroad?'' yet another pierced the heart of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Hamilton, deputy assistant secretary of state for consular
affairs, senses the uneasiness, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tell people whether or not they should go places, but
we try to provide information that will help them make wise
decisions,'' Hamilton said during a recent visit to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   State Department-issued consular information sheets for every
country in the world are available free of charge. So are travel
warnings issued for all or parts of specific nations (currently
totaling 28).
</P>
<P>
   Separate ``Tips for Travelers'' pamphlets, available for $1 to
$1.50, cover popular destinations such as Mexico, Canada, Central
and South America and the People's Republic of China. Several other
publications focus on general travel advice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TAKING PRECAUTIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most travel remains essentially safe. Indeed, cruise lines and
tour companies are redirecting itineraries originally scheduled in
the Balkans to Italy and Greece. But basic common-sense
precautions, while always important, take on increased significance
when our country is in the international spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   One strong recommendation from Hamilton: ``Don't do anything
that labels you as an American.'' Resist the urge to take along
those (Houston) Comets and Rockets world-championship sweat shirts
and Astros and Aeros caps. It's OK to be Houston-proud; just stress
inner pride while abroad. ``It's best not to wear anything with a
logo,'' Hamilton says. ``Don't call attention to yourself; try to
blend in with others.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't become involved either _ even on the periphery _ in any
demonstrations. A worldwide caution in effect since the beginning
of NATO military operations March 24 against Serbia-Montenegro
advises: ``Demonstrations against these operations have taken place
and are continuing at a number of U.S. embassies and institutions
worldwide. These protests have sometimes turned violent.'' Though
tourist facilities and private Americans have not been targeted,
all U.S. citizens are urged to remain alert.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EMBASSIES HELPFUL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The State Department continues to encourage U.S. citizens to
register with the embassy at any foreign destination, but Hamilton
suggests not lingering at embassies, which have become targets for
terrorists. Online registration is now available at some embassies,
and Hamilton says, ``We've asked all our other posts to look at
adopting this procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton advises travelers, prior to leaving home, to record
phone numbers of embassies at every intended destination. ``If you
have a problem, someone is on duty at all times,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Several readers have inquired about the safety of travel to
Mexico, especially Mexico City and the state of Guerrero, where the
popular resort Acapulco is located. The State Department cautioned
several weeks ago about possible post-election protests in
Guerrero, but that notice has expired and no travel advisories are
now in effect for that area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of people go to Mexico every year and have wonderful
vacations,'' Hamilton says. ``If you take common-sense precautions,
you can have a perfectly safe trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Isolated attacks on passengers in Mexico City taxicabs is a
concern. Passengers arriving at Benito Juarez International Airport
are advised to take only airport taxis (yellow, with an airport
symbol on the door) after pre-paying the fare at a designated booth
inside the terminal. When needing a taxi elsewhere in the city,
call a radio taxi or ``sitio'' (pronounced C-T-O) at 271-9146,
271-9058 or 272-6125. Travelers should ask a hotel concierge or
other person calling a taxi to write down the license number. Taxis
parked in front of nightclubs and theaters or cruising the city
should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Hamilton says, ``We have consular agencies in a lot of
places in Mexico, and they are there to assist Americans.'' A list
of these agencies, with addresses and telephone numbers, is
included in the consular information sheet for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton offers other suggestions for international travelers:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Purchase health insurance. It's not expensive. The ability
to get medical care overseas can be difficult. It's especially
important that this insurance covers possible emergency evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``In any foreign city, the dangers are the same as in U.S.
cities. Even in a reasonably comfortable place, petty crime can be
a problem. Don't carry purses that can be moved off your shoulder.
Don't walk away from an ATM machine with money in your hand.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Always make copies of your passport information. Keep one
copy with you in a different place than the passport itself. Leave
another copy with someone at home.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Leave your itinerary with someone at home.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Start thinking now about the year 2000. Nobody knows what is
going to be affected by computer problems. Make certain you have
enough money in case credit cards aren't accepted. We're also a bit
concerned about places that are real cold; if computer problems
affect electricity, we want to make sure travelers have a way to
keep warm.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's Web site at travel.state.gov will include
updates on Year 2000 issues affecting travelers.
</P>
<P>
   That online site also represents the easiest and quickest way to
access consular information sheets and travel warnings. Or call
202-647-5225 for recorded information; or from your fax machine,
dial 202-647-3000, using the handset as you would a regular
telephone, and listen to instructions; or send a self-addressed,
stamped envelope to Overseas Citizens Services, Room 4811 N.S.,
Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Washington,
D.C. 20520.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tips for Travelers'' pamphlets and other publications also are
available at travel.state.gov. Or call 202-512-1800 or write to the
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,
Washington, D.C. 20402.

COLLECTION BRINGS TOGETHER ELLINGTON'S PROLIFIC MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP ELWOOD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ No one _ composer, conductor, bandleader,
instrumentalist, classical European or classical jazz, blues,
whatever _ came close to recording as much material as Duke
Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 50 years, from 1924 until 1973 (a few months before
his death) Ellington recorded, for commercial issue, about 3,500
jazz numbers, pop songs, soundtrack renditions and so forth. He
also recorded transcriptions for radio (each containing about a
dozen selections), and the number of Ellington radio broadcasts,
taken (illegally) off the air, then privately issued on LPs and CDs
over the years, has totalled more than 350.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Duke Ellington Centennial Edition: The Complete RCA Victor
Recordings 1927-1973'' (RCA Victor, 24 CDs, boxed set; list price
$407) includes everything that Ellington recorded for the Victor
Talking Machine Co. (after 1929, RCA Victor) starting in 1927.
There are unissued numbers from the vaults as well as second and
third ``takes'' and, of course, all the small-group numbers issued
under the names of Johnny Hodges, Barney Bigard, Rex Stewart and
other Ellington sidemen.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Ellington signed a major-label recording contract, it
was stipulated that his band's principal soloists would make
small-group recordings (with the Duke on piano) for sale on the
major company's cheaper label, in RCA Victor's case, the Bluebird
label; Brunswick-Columbia had its less expensive Vocalion label.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in his early recording years, despite contractual
agreements with one or another major label (Victor, Columbia,
Brunswick, Okeh), Ellington also recorded simultaneously for
smaller ``dime-store'' labels, under various pseudonyms. For the
cardboard ``Hit of the Week'' discs, Ellington's band was the
``Philadelphia Melodians'' or the ``Ten Blackberries.''
</P>
<P>
   For Okeh, the title was ``The Harlem Footwarmers'' or ``Harlem
Hot Chocolates.'' Brunswick used ``The Washingtonians'' and ``The
Jungle Band,'' and Columbia released some of Duke's 78s as ``Sonny
Greer and his Memphis Men.'' Greer was the Ellington drummer for
nearly 30 years, replaced in 1950 by Louie Bellson.
</P>
<P>
   During the 46 years of Ellington's career covered on this
remarkable RCA Victor set, there were many periods during which he
recorded exclusively for other companies (Brunswick-Columbia,
Capitol, Reprise, for example) as well as thousands of times that
he conducted recording sessions that he kept for future use. Many
of these are still in the can, awaiting possible use by the
Ellington Estate.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1963 radio interview, saxist Russell Procope said, ``Our
rehearsals are in the recording studios; that's where we work
things out.'' Baritone saxist Harry Carney, also in the studio,
nodded his agreement.
</P>
<P>
   This immense package of Ellingtonia is divided six ways: The
Early Recordings, seven discs (1927-1934); The Early '40s, six
discs; Mid '40s, four discs; The Seattle Concert (1952) ends disc
17. Then there are three Sacred Concerts from 1965-1973 (not
including the first, in Grace Cathedral), and the Last Recordings
section (four discs) includes an expanded Far East Suite.
</P>
<P>
   Older Ellington fans will find particular pleasure in the neatly
produced re-mastering of such numbers as ``Black and Tan Fantasy,''
``Creole Love Call,'' ``The Mooche,'' ``Jubilee Stomp,'' ``High
Life,'' ``Harlemania,'' ``Misty Mornin,'' ``The Duke Steps Out,''
``Jazz Lips,'' ``Sweet Jazz o' Mine,'' ``Ring Dem Bells'' and, of
course, ``Mood Indigo,'' ``Solitude,'' ``Rockin' In Rhythm,'' the
strange ``Mystery Song,'' ``Ebony Rhapsody'' and all the rest, most
of which were issued as ``Duke Ellington and his Cotton Club
Orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   RCA Victor recorded most of the best of Ellington's great
1940-42 orchestra, and 140 titles from that grand period, sometimes
called ``The Blanton Years'' for bassist Jimmy Blanton, are in this
set _ such as ``Cottontail,'' ``Harlem Air-Shaft,'' ``Jack The
Bear,'' ``Ko-Ko'' and many more. The early '40s tracks in this set
also include all the great small-combo records already mentioned,
as well as much of the material from Ellington's musical show,
``Jump For Joy,'' which included such tunes as ``I Got It Bad and
That Ain't Good.''
</P>
<P>
   The period after World War II was difficult for big bands, but
Ellington carried on, redoing many older titles, dabbling with pop
novelties, gradually expanding his longer works and eventually
creating religious and global-based concert presentations.
</P>
<P>
   When asked in the early 1950s, when his and all other bands were
losing money, why he didn't break up his orchestra, live on his
considerable royalties and devote his time to composition and the
concert world, he answered: ``Give up my band? Why, without my band
how could I hear my music?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The last 10 CDs in the set, covering RCA Victor's issues of
Ellington music from 1944-1973, include material from ``Black,
Brown and Beige,'' the ``Perfume Suite,'' three ``Sacred
Concerts,'' the ``Far East Suite,'' the ``Duke at Tanglewood'' and
``His Mother Called Him Bill'' LPs, as well as a large number of
remakes of earlier classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Popular Duke Ellington'' LP from 1966 is here in its
entirety (including some unreleased tracks). its digital
remastering improves the original album's beautiful sound.
</P>
<P>
   This Ellington Centennial Edition set, for the most part, is the
work of producer Orrin Keepnews. The large, lavish, 122-page
accompanying book is loaded with photos and the essays and
commentary of Mary Lou Williams, Dan Morgenstern, Stanley Dance,
Patricia Willard, Stanley Crouch, Keepnews and others. Their
contributions, the photos and layout help make this Ellington
Centennial Edition a very special _ in fact, essential _ part of
any jazz fan's library.
</P>
<P>
   Because this set is ``The Complete RCA Victor Recordings,'' it
must, necessarily, include everything in the vaults, including
quite a number of ordinary arrangements of inferior pop tunes,
particularly in the postwar years of the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Also presumably essential is the inclusion of all ``takes'' of a
number, even if there is no discernible difference from one to the
other. Listening to the same selection two or three times in a row
can, to some, become an annoying and frustrating experience.

   A colleague was discussing her ``third hotel room'' philosophy
recently during a break from a business meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The lodging ritual, she explained, had become all too familiar
and frustrating: At check-in, the registration clerk would provide
a set of keys, smile and offer directions to the assigned room. If
the room didn't meet her standards for safety, ambience and
practicality established during years of frequent travel, she would
return to the front desk and politely request an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Though usually an improvement, the second room, too,
occasionally had deficiencies. So again she would approach the
registration desk, this time more forcefully _ perhaps with the
suggestion that she was prepared to take her business elsewhere _
and, presto, the attendant would find a bigger or brighter or
better room.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now, to save everyone involved time and frustration, when I
first arrive I just ask them to give me the third room they're
going to offer (the best room available),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
STANDARD PROCEDURE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This may seem a radical procedure to the majority of other
American travelers, but I've known Europeans who never accept the
first room offered, at least not before making an inspection.
Hoteliers there expect this kind of discriminating attitude from
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Why are most of us less choosy? We pay hard-earned money for
lodging away from home. But I can count on the fingers of one hand
the number of times I've openly rejected a hotel room or uttered
more than a mild complaint (except under my breath) when the lights
were too dim, the pillows too lumpy and the toilet too balky.
</P>
<P>
   One reason we're easily appeased is that we're so often in a
rush. Overnight accommodations are usually a means to an end _ a
place to hang our hats between treasured activities _ and not a
high priority for venting emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, most Americans _ myself included _ are conditioned by
motels and hotels whose cookie-cutter rooms are similar or
identical in design. At a Holiday Inn or Motel 6, usually the only
reason to request different accommodations is if we're too close to
the elevator or laundry room or too far removed from the car or ice
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not every lodging establishment fits a specific mold.
Individual rooms in historic hotels, bed-and-breakfasts, boutique
hotels, resorts and country inns can take on distinct
personalities. And we can enhance our comfort level and overall
enjoyment by trying to match our preferences to a room's
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Even with prefabricated chains, it behooves us to be more
demanding _ in a nice way, of course _ about basic essentials.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PERSONAL EXPECTATIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I'll never adopt a ``third hotel room'' policy _ and
my experiences with lodging have been largely positive _ but my
colleague's persistence is prompting me to give new emphasis to
qualities I deem important. A Houston travel agent once forwarded a
fascinating list of about 50 qualities he admires about a good
hotel room; my list isn't that long, but here are some
expectations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Adequate safety precautions. Doors should have multiple locks.
A peephole is essential. Windows should be tightly secured. Fire
evacuation material should be clearly displayed. A sprinkler system
is always welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good lighting, especially beside the bed, in the bathroom, in
the closet and at a desk.
</P>
<P>
   _ A desk or table. I never cease to be amazed _ and irritated _
when a room-service waiter delivers dinner on a tray and asks,
``Where do you want me to put it?'' when the bed and floor clearly
represent the only options.
</P>
<P>
   _ Abundant and conveniently located electrical outlets. Do
hoteliers take delight in placing outlets behind a bed frame bolted
to the wall?
</P>
<P>
   _ Adequate storage space, preferably in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   _ A bathroom in which I can turn around. Extra towels. A toilet
that doesn't drip all night. A shower that doesn't produce water
boiling hot at one moment and icy cold the next. Spare tissue and
toilet paper. Room to place a toothbrush and newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heating and air conditioning that I can control.
</P>
<P>
   _ A no-smoking floor.
</P>
<P>
   _ A comfortable bed with enough pillows that I can sleep with my
head raised.
</P>
<P>
   _ Soundproofed windows, especially at hotels situated near
freeways or airports.
</P>
<P>
   _ Room doors that aren't built 3 inches off the carpet, allowing
noise from hallways to permeate the room.
</P>
<P>
   _ A clock that illuminates in the night.
</P>
<P>
   _ Proximity (at least on the same floor) to an ice machine that
functions properly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cable television. I like to keep up with the Astros and
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   _ A comfortable chair that faces (or can be moved to face) the
TV.
</P>
<P>
   _ A computer-friendly telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Some travelers no doubt would place kid-friendly qualities high
on their priority lists. Others relish being near a swimming pool
(or distanced from the pool). Still others appreciate or require
rooms designed for individuals with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   What are your druthers? Your pet peeves about lodging? When
dissatisfied, do you adopt an alternative to the ``third hotel
room'' philosophy? Write to me at 801 Texas Ave., Houston, Texas
77002; fax 713-217-1369; or send e-mail responses to

ELLINGTON EMBODIES AMERICAN MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A half-century ago, the U.S. State Department
promoted a series of overseas jazz-concert tours by distributing
hundreds of red, white and blue placards that read: ``What Is More
American Than Jazz?''
</P>
<P>
   This slogan came to mind when it was announced that Duke
Ellington, 25 years after his death in 1974, was the recipient of a
Pulitzer Prize for his contribution to America's musical culture.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the world will celebrate the centennial of Edward
Kennedy Ellington's birth, recognizing the immense contribution
this larger-than-life talent made to America's _ and the world's _
music.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of this year, and century, there will be polls
taken to determine the ``Best of the Century'' for every
conceivable activity in the land. In the ``Greatest American
Composer of the Century'' category, the names of George Gershwin
and Ellington will loom large, but for many of us it's no contest _
Ellington wins, hands down, if for no other reason than the purely
American perspective from which he always viewed his music-making.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin was born in New York; Ellington was from Washington _
can't get much more American than that. Both Gershwin and Ellington
as teen-agers emerged as ambitious, driven piano players in the
wartime, ragtime-to-jazz transition era.
</P>
<P>
   By 1920, Gershwin had scored with a pop tune, ``Swanee,'' thanks
to Al Jolson, and was ready to conquer Broadway with his first hit
show, ``Lady Be Good'' _ as soon as he premiered ``Rhapsody In
Blue,'' with Paul Whiteman (later, an Ellington fan) in Manhattan's
Aeolian Concert Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington was in Harlem to stay by 1922-23, and with his
Washingtonians sextet began recording in 1924. In the mid-1920s,
Ellington's name and music became familiar on the New York scene,
while Gershwin's already was known throughout the Western world.
</P>
<P>
   But though often referred to as ``jazz'' or even ``blues,''
Gershwin's was composed popular (and semi-classical) music,
attractive as hell but having none of the roots that Ellington
automatically and effortlessly dug into on the keyboard, in band
performance and composition.
</P>
<P>
   By 1927-28, both Ellington and Gershwin, good friends and mutual
admirers, were on their way _ Gershwin, with less than 10 years to
live, to Hollywood; Ellington, always New York-based, looking
forward to 50 years of nonstop composing, performing and recording.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin's early scores frequently alluded to ragtimey jazz,
pop-gospel and blues. Ellington's music (as heard on records)
defined jazz, blues, black church music, and African-American
rhythms and harmony as played by a jazz ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to his first Victor record, ``Creole Love Call'' and
``Black and Tan Fantasie'' (1927) _ both astonishing variations on
the blues, with murky harmonies, abrupt dynamic shifts and
astonishingly original, intertwined, melodic lines, some (as on
``Creole Love Call'') sung wordlessly _ the voice becoming an
instrument accompaniment by the woodwinds.
</P>
<P>
   To be appreciated, Ellington's music demanded that his band play
it. From ``East St. Louis Toodle-Oo'' to ``Rockin' in Rhythm,''
from ``Sophisticated Lady'' to ``Satin Doll,'' it was the Ellington
bandsmen's performance, constantly changing, that defined the
composition.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing is more American than jazz, nothing defines jazz more
than Ellington's music.

BOOK EXPLORES TARZAN CREATOR'S SWINGS OF FORTUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN R. GODDARD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the best-selling authors of the 20th century, Edgar Rice
Burroughs in 1912 created a true superhero, Tarzan, inspiring a
multimedia dynasty in books, comics, radio shows, movies and
merchandising that is still thriving today.
</P>
<P>
   With the Disney animated version of ``Tarzan'' due at theaters
in June, the lord of the jungle is sure to be everywhere, but his
creator remains an enigma.
</P>
<P>
   Austin-based John Taliaferro, former senior editor for Texas
Monthly, has written a timely, highly readable biography of
Burroughs, tracing his career from down-and-out Chicago pencil
sharpener salesman to Southern California conglomerate. Rarely
bogging down in too much detail, ``Tarzan Forever: The Life of
Edgar Rice Burroughs, Creator of Tarzan'' (Scribner, $30) combines
a magazine writer's flair for storytelling with a historian's
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Much as he did in his previous book, ``Charles M. Russell: The
Life and Legend of America's Cowboy Artist,'' Taliaferro chronicles
the lasting impact of the creator of a popular cultural icon, a
writer whose contributions to the American myth are shunned by
academic critics.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs was one of the first writers to incorporate, and that
was wise, since Tarzan inspired a rabid following, complete with
conventions, fan clubs and mountains of memorabilia long before
``Star Trek'' and ``Star Wars'' captured the hearts and the
pocketbooks of millions.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than growing out of the myth of the ``noble savage,''
Tarzan emerges as a product of Burroughs' belief in eugenics _ the
controversial interpretation of Darwinism as ``biological
determinism'' that the Nazis used to justify their Final Solution.
Burroughs was obsessed with his own genealogy and extremely proud
of his nearly pure Anglo-Saxon lineage.
</P>
<P>
   While most people associate Tarzan with the slow-talking,
slow-witted movie character played by Johnny Weissmuller, the
Tarzan of Burroughs' books is a misplaced English lord, self-taught
but fluent in several languages. He is as at home in the city as
the jungle. The movie ``Greystoke'' is probably the most faithful
screen adaptation, although the Disney ``Tarzan'' reportedly
restores the original story line.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney most likely will tone down Burroughs' more racist
tendencies. In the Tarzan stories, black Africans are generally
superstitious and Arabs rapacious. Although frequently interpreted
as an early environmentalist, Tarzan doesn't hesitate to kill rare
and endangered animals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tarzan is such a pliable hero that his appeal is nearly
universal for young males. Tarzan's tales have been published in
more than 30 languages.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs the man was full of energy, tackling all sorts of
projects and business schemes while churning out 300,000 to 400,000
words a year. He wrote 75 books, 24 featuring Tarzan. But his
best-known works, ``Tarzan'' and ``John Carter of Mars,'' were
written in a hurry, often on deadline and under pressure to
generate money for his profligate spending habits.
</P>
<P>
   With only a couple of exceptions, he never achieved his dream of
graduating from the pulps into the realm of ``serious literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs had the instincts of a businessman, but he never
figured out how to manage his fortune. With some of his early movie
money, he bought a large ranch near Los Angeles that today is the
suburb Tarzana. However, as Taliaferro explains, Burroughs was one
of the few people who failed to make money in Southern California
real estate. Despite a sizable income during the Depression,
Burroughs was always one scheme away from poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Taliaferro ends his story with Burroughs' death in 1950, though
you may wish he had continued to follow the history of the family
business, Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc., which still operates in the
small Spanish-style bungalow on Ventura Boulevard that Burroughs
built as an office.
</P>
<P>
   In a day when fiction has a shelf life of less than six weeks,
Burroughs' novels are all still in print and his first editions are
highly prized collectibles. While he never gained the approval of
critics, his best revenge is the immortal Tarzan.

POETRY WELL SUITED FOR MOTHER'S DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Mother's Day around the corner, there's a great book just
out that could be fun for mothers and children to enjoy together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rainbow Hand: Poems About Mothers and Children,'' by Janet
S. Wong with illustrations by Jennifer Hewitson (Margaret K.
McElderry Books, $15), is a slim (26 pages) collection of poems
celebrating the mother-child bond, often with a twist and always
with vibrant illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   The author, born in the United States of Chinese and Korean
heritage, brings that tradition to her poems, as in ``Smother
Love'':
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy asks his mother,
</P>
<P>
   `Who will take care of me when you die?'
</P>
<P>
   `I will not die soon,' the mother says,
</P>
<P>
   and pats him on his head like a dog.
</P>
<P>
   But the boy wants to know,
</P>
<P>
   `What if you die next month? Next year?'
</P>
<P>
   The boy, so small, has made his mother afraid.
</P>
<P>
   She looks twice before she crosses the street.
</P>
<P>
   She washes her hands ten times a day.
</P>
<P>
   She stops eating duck skin,
</P>
<P>
   standing in front of the microwave.
</P>
<P>
   She holds his hand tight in the market.
</P>
<P>
   She hugs him so hard he cannot breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Red in the face, the boy struggles free from her arms,
</P>
<P>
   shouting, `You trying to kill me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Readers young and old will find chuckles and warm feelings in
this clever volume.

AUTHOR MAKES DEBUT WITH A STUNNING THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Irish writer John Connolly's debut thriller, ``Every Dead
Thing'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25, 395 pages) is a stunner.
</P>
<P>
   New York Police Detective Charlie Parker's marriage is on the
skids. One night after another verbal battle with his wife, Susan,
he heads for the local bar. When he stumbles home, he finds the
bodies of Susan and their 3-year-old daughter Jennifer. Both had
been tortured and both have had their faces removed. Consumed by
guilt, Parker leaves the force, works as an unlicensed private
investigator and is determined to find his family's killer.
</P>
<P>
   His hunt takes him to New Orleans, where FBI agent Woolrich
tells him of Tante Marie, a psychic who gets messages from a young
girl who has been murdered in the bayou, but her body has never
been found. Tante Marie also says the girl has no face.
</P>
<P>
   Parker visits Tante Marie, who knows about his wife and child.
She tells him their murderer is ``the Travelin' Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, he is hired by Isobel Barton, a wealthy widow
who runs the Barton Trust, which aids child-related causes.
</P>
<P>
   During a fund-raiser at the Barton estate, a young boy
disappeared and has never been found. Now Barton wants Parker to
find Catherine Demeter, a young woman she had befriended and has
now disappeared. Demeter had been dating Barton's stepson, who has
ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   His investigation leads him to Haven, Va., where he learns that
Demeter's sister and three other children had been brutally
murdered years before. No one in Haven wants to talk about the
past, but someone now is trying to erase any clues to the old
murders by killing anew. Aided by two career criminals, Parker
finds an old warehouse in Flushing, N.Y., and the bodies of many
murdered children.
</P>
<P>
   Parker discovers the identity of the murderer, but before he can
close down his investigation he gets a call from Tante Marie's
niece, who says, ``Mista Parker, she say you gotta come now and you
gotta tell no one you comin'. No one, Mista Parker ... Mista
Parker, she say the Travelin' Man comin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly has created a complex tale that is as riveting and
chilling as Thomas Harris' ``Silence of the Lambs'' and James
Patterson's ``Kiss the Girls.'' Well-paced and character-driven,
``Every Dead Thing'' is a terrific addition to the genre.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Silva's third thriller, ``The Marching Season'' (Random
House, $25.95, 418 pages) is a gripping look at the hatreds that
have fueled the troubles in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after Northern Ireland's people voted to accept the
Good Friday peace accords, a new Protestant militant group emerges
bent on destroying any chance of peace.
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast, a gunman kills Eamon Dillon, Sinn Fein's
third-ranking officer. At the same time, a man walks into the
reading room at Dublin's National Library and sets a timer on a
bomb he leaves behind in a briefcase. But before he can get to
safety, the bomb goes off and he becomes one of the many victims.
</P>
<P>
   In London, a young woman takes a rolling suitcase down the
stairs at the Knightsbridge entrance to the subway. She boards a
train headed for Heathrow, where she exits the train at the first
stop after setting the timer on the bomb in the suitcase. Before
she can get to safety, this bomb explodes and she too dies.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the BBC receives a call saying the murder and the
bombings were the work of the Ulster Freedom Brigade, ``which will
continue its campaign of armed resistance until the so-called Good
Friday peace accord is dead and buried. All those who support this
betrayal of Northern Ireland's Protestant community should regard
this statement as fair warning.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, British Prime Minister Tony Blair asks U.S.
President James Beckwith ``to appoint a superstar to be your next
ambassador to London. Someone all sides can respect ... I want
someone who can help me achieve my goal, a permanent settlement to
the conflict in Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   So Beckwith names his old nemesis, former Sen. Douglas Cannon.
Cannon's son-in-law, retired CIA officer Michael Osbourne, returns
to the agency to head the Northern Ireland desk. On a routine
mission to Belfast to meet with an operative, he learns that the
Ulster Freedom Brigade plans to assassinate Cannon in London.
Osbourne launches a plan to lure the brigade into a trap.
</P>
<P>
   What Osbourne does not know is that the assassin who tried to
kill him and his family the year before is alive and once again
will attack Cannon and the Osbourne family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marching Season'' is a fast-paced read with well-developed
characters. Its one flaw? A couple of scenes that are too
reminiscent of parts of Silva's ``Mark of an Assassin.''

SAN FRANCISCO'S FOOT-IN-MOUTH PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sometime in the not-too-distant future: A tour
bus pulls up near the newly remodeled Ferry Building in San
Francisco. Dozens of tourists climb down and gather 'round the tour
guide.
</P>
<P>
   She points southward at a small white rectangle. Upon closer
inspection, it reveals itself to be a standard, painted
cinderblock.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' says the tour guide, ``is the one and only surviving
piece of public art in San Francisco. It's called, `Not
Bothersome.' It is the creation of six people who once served on
the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.''
</P>
<P>
   A man from Texas says: ``I don't get it. What's it supposed to
be?''
</P>
<P>
   The tour guide smiles and says, ``Just what its name implies.
The goal of its creators was to make a piece of public art that no
one would notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredulous laughter.
</P>
<P>
   A woman from Iowa asks, ``What's the point of having public art
that the public doesn't notice?''
</P>
<P>
   The guide suggests that the group sit down so she can give them
some backround.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1999, she says, a majority of San Francisco
supervisors voted to kill a $475,000 proposed sculpture of a bare
foot. The culmination of 5 1/2 years of planning and the work of a
Seattle artist named Buster Simpson, the statue would have been 18
feet high, balanced on the ball of The Foot. It would symbolize
several aspects of San Francisco's waterfront and history.
</P>
<P>
   The Foot had been approved by several committees, including the
city's Art Commission. But, acting as the San Francisco Transit
Authority (the sculpture was part of an Embarcadero roadway
improvement project) six of the 11 supervisors chose to reverse the
process and amputate The Foot.
</P>
<P>
   Says a tourist from New York, ``What, were they all art
majors?''
</P>
<P>
   No, the guide explains. They responded to many citizens who
called and wrote to say they didn't want a Foot. People gave all
kinds of reasons, from The Foot's purported racism and sexism _ it
was white and seemed male _ to the fact that it might attract
vandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``But somebody always has a problem with any proposed public
art,'' the New Yorker says. ``Isn't that why cities have art
commissions instead of ballot measures to decide this kind of
stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   The tour guide says it was like that in San Francisco until The
Foot controversy. Since then, the Art Commission's job has been to
dismantle every piece of public art in town and find homes for them
in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who'd long disliked this piece or that saw an
opportunity,'' the guide says. ``They mounted similar protest
campaigns and, one by one, got all the sculptures ripped out and
the murals painted over. Now, all of San Francisco is a zone free
of public art.''
</P>
<P>
   The tourists shake their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, what's the point of this thing?'' says the Texas man,
giving a sideways kick to ``Not Bothersome.'' ``You can't sit on
it. It doesn't even have a plaque. It's utterly useless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not true,'' the tour guide says. ``This sculpture doesn't
bother anyone. In San Francisco, that is not only useful, it's
thoroughly representative of the collective aesthetic. We think of
it as post-mediocrity.''

   LAKESIDE, Texas _ Trying to raise Mandy MacWhirter, according to
her dad, was like trying to restrain a wild horse.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster, she was competitive and aggressive, a high
achiever who excelled in math and science and showed little
tolerance for peers who whined or exhibited low standards. She had
a fiery temper and a penchant for defying authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got an attitude a mile long,'' Steve MacWhirter said
over the weekend, joking with pride about his now 26-year-old
daughter. ``Anybody that knows her knows she'd give you the shirt
off her back, but she'll tell you off in a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of attitude that makes a helicopter pilot,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   First Lt. Mandy MacWhirter, an Azle High School graduate with a
``show-me attitude,'' is among the U.S. Army's first female Apache
helicopter pilots and could engage in combat as part of Operation
Allied Force's mission to damage Serbian forces in Kosovo, said Lt.
Col. Lew Boone, an Army spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   MacWhirter, a weapons officer, is one of about 50 Apache pilots
who landed Wednesday in Tirana, Albania. She couldn't be reached
for comment, and it was unknown whether she had any connection to
the Apache helicopter that crashed on a training mission on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not her. I'm worried sick,'' Steve MacWhirter said
last night after hearing of the mishap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had female Apache pilots only for the last five years,''
said Boone, who noted that artillery and cavalry positions were
first opened up to women in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   They flew in Bosnia, but only as top cover, he said. U.S.
attacks on Iraq during Operation Desert Fox late last year marked
the first time that female pilots had dropped bombs in combat.
</P>
<P>
   The brigade of 24 Apaches _ dubbed Task Force Hawk _ has joined
Operation Allied Force at the request of Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's
supreme commander.
</P>
<P>
   A quick-reacting, all-weather gunship that can fly as low as 10
feet off the ground, hide behind mountains and pop up to unleash
Hellfire missiles in a surprise ambush, the AH-64 Apache is the
Army's primary attack helicopter. NATO officials are looking for
the tank-killers to provide a more direct response to Serbian
infantry and armored units than that afforded by the jet fighters
used so far in Operation Allied Force.
</P>
<P>
   Apache aviators are ``probably our best pilots,'' Boone said.
Those sent to Albania are based in Illesheim in southern Germany as
part of the 11th Aviation Regiment. ``They're very gung-ho. They
swagger'' when they walk, he said jokingly. ``They have this
fighter-pilot mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve MacWhirter, 49, agrees. ``They're kind of like a bunch of
cowboys, proud and gung-ho ... the kind of people that go to
extremes and you feel like you have to reach out and pull them
back.''
</P>
<P>
   A native Californian, Mandy MacWhirter moved to Lakeside with
her family just in time to start the ninth grade at Azle High
School. After graduating in 1990, she attended Texas Christian
University on a three-year Army ROTC scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Female cadets more often choose nursing, said retired Lt. Col.
Roger Wilson, one of MacWhirter's senior year instructors. When he
met her, ``she had a bit of a chip on her shoulder. ... There
aren't that many female pilots, and you have to have a little bit
of an attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   MacWhirter was a leader, not a follower, he remembered. She
graduated from TCU and its ROTC program in 1995 with a degree in
astrophysics and went on to the Army's flight school at Fort
Rucker, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   She has since taken part in a mission to Bosnia, where she
refueled aircraft; supervised her platoon in Germany; and was
involved in the logistics of moving the Apache pilots' camp to
Albania, her parents said.
</P>
<P>
   The achievements of their outgoing daughter are a source of
pride for the MacWhirters. But they are also acutely aware that the
Apache's heralded ability to fly low is also what makes this
mission inherently dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll be in positions where they'll be susceptible to being
shot down'' by Serbian soldiers carrying shoulder-fired
anti-aircraft weapons, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The anguish was apparent on the face of Vivian MacWhirter, 73,
the pilot's grandmother, as she sifted through family photographs
and postcards _ one picturing an Apache helicopter _ and mulled the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're filled with anxiety, and on the other hand, we're
trusting in the Lord,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Diane MacWhirter, 49, said her daughter grew up in the church,
and the family realizes that ``you get to a point where you have no
control. It's out of our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But reports of ethnic Albanian women being raped by Serbs and
the capture of three American soldiers bring worry. ``God forbid
she should be taken captive,'' said Mandy MacWhirter's aunt, Janice
Luder.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who has kept in touch with MacWhirter since she left
TCU, imagines that his former student is probably ``looking at it
as a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain amount of anxiety, but it's anxiety that
you've been (preparing) for,'' he said of the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be terrible to have a football team practice for 20
years and not ever play a game. She's getting ready for the game.''

 REAL MEN DRINK ROOT BEER  
 From truck drivers to chefs, everybody's rooting for the new 
 hand-crafted brews  
   
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  America is in the middle of the root beer
revolution, and a stream of the nation's oldest soda pop is pouring
through the Bay Area.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Root beer fans include burly former beer drinkers, pregnant
women, Baby Boomers on nostalgia trips and club hoppers looking for
something different in their kegs.
</P>
<P>
   They're drinking upscale versions of the soda at hip
neighborhood bars like kilowatt in the Mission District and
top-drawer restaurants like Farallon and LuLu.
</P>
<P>
   Local microbrewers at brewpubs like San Francisco's ThirstyBear
are turning over vats once reserved for batches of ale to root
beer. At Berkeley's Pyramid Brewery, freshly made root beer is
poured alongside alcoholic brew.
</P>
<P>
   The soda is even foaming up cyberspace. Chi-An Chien, 27, is a
Princeton-educated multimedia programmer who is the master of a
nationally recognized root beer Web site. Along with Star Wars
memorabilia stuffed into her Mission District apartment, Chien
stacks cases of root beer _ samples from brewers hoping to make it
onto her ``A List.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you get into it, the more you can discern what makes
one better than the other,'' she says. ``A lot of people think of
A&AMP;W as the standard in root beer. It's a decent root beer for
floats but not what you want to drink straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Like coffee, bread and microbrewed beer before it, root beer has
gone gourmet.
</P>
<P>
   But why is a brew that began as a medicinal tonic Native
Americans shared with New World settlers enjoying a resurgence?
</P>
<P>
   Some see its rise as reflection of where the Bay Area finds
itself at the end of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '90s, everything's gone gourmet,'' says Dean Halpern, a
manager at Millennium, a vegetarian restaurant in San Francisco.
Thomas Kemper bottled root beer is on the restaurant's beverage
list because the almost-all-natural product fits the restaurant's
profile.
</P>
<P>
   Others are less cynical about the recent surge of craft root
beers, crediting it to a mix of Boomer-driven nostalgia, a move
toward sobriety and the elevated taste of Bay Area consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The craft root beers have such a strong flavor characteristic
to them. People in cities like Seattle and San Francisco enjoy
things that have stronger, more distinct taste,'' says Michael
Goldsberry, spokesman for Pyramid, which makes Thomas Kemper soda
both in Seattle and Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Root beer is just a rich, wonderful flavor _ one of those
things that as soon as you have it in your mouth, you make a
connection with it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, root beer has been around long enough to establish
itself as one of the strongest nostalgia-inducing drinks in
America. The great-grandfather of the version most people drink
today was invented before cola. But today, cola has 60 percent of
the soda market and root beer, just 3 percent. Even orange soda
beats it, with a 4 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   Still, marketers and makers alike agree root beer is the
fastest-growing product in the soda pop family. Premium-brand IBC
has more than doubled its sales since 1995. Coca-Cola bought Barq's
three years ago and is marketing the brew on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kemper sales have jumped 20 percent over last year.
Stewart's, a root beer sold on the East Coast since 1924, is a
relativerelative newcomer to the Bay Area. Despite its hefty $3.50
price per four-pack, sales here have grown 54 percent in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   What attracts aficionados to the premium-priced varieties? Among
other characteristics, the bubbles. And the right bubbles can only
be had in bottles, they claim, not in cans.
</P>
<P>
   That's because manufacturers have to pump excess carbonation
into canned root beers to maintain the pressure a can demands.
``Root beer should be lightly carbonated, like a microbrew. It
shouldn't boil off the tongue like Coke,'' says Matt Pearson, a
beverage distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson and his brother, Eric, like root beer so much that they
started making their own in 1996. They brewed up batches in their
kitchens, made a label from an image of the Golden Gate Bridge cut
out from the phone book and found a bottler.
</P>
<P>
   In just three years, sales of Pearson Bros. root beer have grown
to 3,000 cases. It's available in about 300 stores and restaurants
in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The Pearsons believe the information age sparked the rise in
craft root beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People turn to something comforting and homey in the face of
all this technology,'' Eric Pearson says. ``It's like the
Volkswagen Beetle or mashed potatoes and meat loaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Root beer's spice, smoothed by its sweetness, makes it work well
with salty food. Pizza, popcorn and hot dogs are good matches, and
it stands up well to barbecue and pastrami, the Pearson brothers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a root beer has a creamy taste, hints of cinnamon and
nutmeg, the spice of wintergreen or any of a hundred other flavor
variations comes down to the ability to replicate the desired
flavor in a laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all root beers, even boutique versions, are flavored with
a synthesized base. Original recipes are forged from a dozen or
more natural ingredients. But to produce a consistent taste and aid
sterile, large-scale manufacturing, the brewer's recipe is captured
by chemists working at what the industry calls ``flavor houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewers mix that base with sweeteners like corn syrup and honey.
Then they cool the mixture and dissolve carbon dioxide into the
cold, sweet liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Critical palates describe root beer with phrases one might find
at a wine tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Chien's glossary: Tang is the first bite or sensation.
Body is the depth of taste. Kick is the sensation left in the mouth
after swallowing. Aftertaste is what happens next.
</P>
<P>
   She likes Pearson Bros., but IBC is her favorite. She describes
it like this: ``Smooth, spicy taste, not too sweet with a fantastic
kick to it. Dark and full-bodied.'' She also gives high marks to
Stewart's (``a nice, solid beer with a dark taste'') and Thomas
Kemper (``A nice, spicy bite ... heavy on the cloves'').
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is root beer, not Cabernet. So things can get a
little playful. ``Cloying means taste that sticks around too long,
like an old boyfriend when you're ready to move on,'' she writes on
her Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But like most food and drink, taste is a personal matter. San
Francisco chef and recipe consultant Catherine Alioto is a newcomer
to the root beer revolution. During her recent pregnancy, a root
beer craving hit her hard at about the sixth month. She embarked on
a quest to find the perfect root beer. She tore through brands that
were too medicinal, overly sweet or poorly carbonated. None matched
her childhood &UR;  &LR; memory or satisfied her craving.
</P>
<P>
   Then she drove to an A&AMP;W stand in Marin County and found
nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something about drinking root beer fresh from the tap
in a chilled glass that no other was able to duplicate,'' she says.
``It was reassuring to realize that, even today, there are some
things that are as you remember.''

first to promote it. He took his formula to the same Philadelphia
centennial expo in 1876 where the typewriter, Alexander Graham
Bell's telephone and H.J. Heinz ketchup were introduced. &HT;    Other root beer facts:
 &HT;    Root beer makes up only 3 percent of the nearly $60 billion soft
drink market. Cola products make up 60 percent and lemon-lime
drinks, 12 percent.
 &HT;    Unlike original recipes, today's root beers don't contain any of
the root or bark from the sassafras tree. The Food and Drug
Administration in 1960 banned safrole, found in sassafras root,
because it has been linked with liver cancer.
 &HT;    Root beer can be brewed in a third of the time it takes to make
beer.
 &HT;    The average American drinks 54 gallons of soda a year. Less than
5percent of it is root beer.
 &HT;    In the early days, some unscrupulous root beer manufacturers
added soap to their recipes to increase the foam. Today, some
large-scale producers use a foaming agent to achieve the same
effect.
 &HT;    Root beer is the oldest continuously marketed soft drink in the
country.

 Soda Evolved From Native Tea to Upscale Quencher

<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; That bottle of upscale root beer selling for $2 or
$3 at a restaurant traces its roots back to Native American
healers.
<P>
   They boiled a host of plant material, including licorice,
sassafras and fennel, into a sort of tea and used it for a variety
of ailments, especially gastric distress, according to several
sources on root beer and American history.
</P>
<P>
   European settlers fell in love with the natural potions. By the
late 1700s, sassafras-flavored elixirs were among the hundreds of
remedies Americans guzzled. Traveling medicine shows that worked
Southern backwoods and the ever-expanding Western frontier helped
the evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The process of adding fizz to mineral water emerged in 1768, and
``fixed air'' water became a popular tonic for ailments ranging
from weak blood and shaky nerves to indigestion. Pharmacies began
pumping it out, adding flavors to draw customers. Early versions of
root beer were among them.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, historians don't agree on exactly when root beer
moved from the purview of pharmacists to a country drink stirred up
in rural kitchens to a common commercial product.
</P>
<P>
   Early stoneware root beer bottles are dated from the 1850s.
Southern California author Laura Quarantiello, who wrote ``The Root
Beer Book: A Celebration of America's Favorite Soft
Drink''(LimeLight Books, 1997), says a New York brewer made root
beer in 1842. Several other favorite American drinks, such as Dr.
Pepper and Coca-Cola, were born about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every root beer historian credits Philadelphia
pharmacist Charles Hires with naming and popularizing root beer in
1876. His formula contained 16 spices, roots and berries, including
ginger, hops, vanilla, juniper, wintergreen and sassafras. He
pushed it as a temperance drink. To make his sweet herbal tonic
appeal to hard-drinking Pennsylvania miners, he called it root
beer. It took off when he introduced it at the world's fair that
year.
</P>
<P>
   The temperance movement buoyed root beer. When Prohibition hit,
local breweries in almost every American town started putting
yeast-based root beer in their brown bottles. Most brews had a
touch of alcohol from the yeast.
</P>
<P>
   The number of craft-style root beer brewers started to dwindle
around mid-century, partly due to increased mass-production. At
about the same time, a government-mandated change in ingredients
altered the taste of root beer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, the Food and Drug Administration banned safrole, a
produced in the root of the sassafras tree, as a possible
carcinogen. (The leaves of the sassafras tree which are still use
to produce a spice called file commonly used in gumbo, don't
contain significant amounts.) While some manufacturers, like
Barq's, use a form of sassafras with safrole removed, most rely on
a mix of artifical and other flavors for the root beer taste.
</P>
<P>
   America's tastes as well as manufacuring methods also combined
to change root beer's character. The number of A&AMP;W stands, which
reached 2,000 in the 1960s, fell to a quarter of that. Mass
production, the advent of chemical flavorings and souped-up
carbonation in cans all affected root beer's character.

 CHRON   EDITORS NOTE: This is part of a three-take package. The others

 Make a Great Root Beer Float and recipes from the San Francisco 
 restaurant Aqua.  
   
   
 HOW TO MAKE A GREAT ROOT BEER FLOAT  
   
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  To find out how to make a great root beer float,
we went to two experts: the chef at Aqua, a San Francisco
restaurant renowned for sophisticated food and decor, and the owner
of an A&AMP;W restaurant in Lodi, home of the nation's first A&AMP;W root
beer stand.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Aqua, a decidedly upscale root beer float is a signature
dessert. Chefs layer small scoops of house-made root beer sorbet
and sassafras-flavored vanilla ice cream, then pour on Thomas
Kemper root beer. A crisp chocolate wafer and two chocolate straws
top it off. The $8 dessert is served with two homey, warm chocolate
chip cookies.
</P>
<P>
   In Lodi, &UR;  &LR; Peter Knight takes a simpler approach. Knight owns the
A&AMP;W in the town where the nation's first A&AMP;W root beer stand opened
in 1919. Knight started working for A&AMP;W in 1972 and figures he's
poured more than a couple of million floats.
</P>
<P>
   He starts with an ice-cold frosted mug right from the freezer.
He pours the root beer first, down the side of the glass to prevent
building up too much foam, then adds a scoop or two of locally made
butterfat-rich vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   The key is the ice cream, he says. ``Refrain from using a cheap
ice cream. It won't stand up to the sweetness and the vanilla of
the root beer.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;W, the nation's top-selling root beer, has a wintergreen kick
and is not as heavy with vanilla or honey flavors as some of the
gourmet brands. The crispness provides a sharp counterpoint for the
ice cream, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The balance between ice cream and root beer is the key at Aqua,
too. Chef Michael Mina and pastry chef Jason Gingold tasted several
root beers before deciding on Thomas Kemper, made by Pyramid
Brewery in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too sweet,'' Mina says. ``Sometimes root beer can be
too sharp or too sweet, like a cream soda.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternating scoops of sorbet and sassafras-flavored ice
cream based on creme anglaise provide contrast.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the mix is hard to duplicate at home. The root
beer syrup used in the Aqua's sorbet is a commercial product,
unavailable to consumers. In testing the accompanying recipe, we
used Torani root beer syrup, which will be in markets next month.
But with this syrup, the sorbet takes a long time to freeze. An
alternative is to eliminate the sorbet entirely. That's not true to
the Aqua recipe, but we found that the rich ice cream and the root
beer alone made an outstanding float.
</P>
<P>
   Knight offers one last suggestion for enjoying a float: Allow it
to sit for two or three minutes. ``It lets the ice cream melt and
the root beer freeze a little around the ice cream. When the ice
cream just melts into the root beer, that's when you get that
flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight, by the way, will test his float making skills on a grand
scale June 19 in Lodi when he and his crew attempt to make the
world's biggest float.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kemper Brewing Co. set the record in 1996, with a
2,166-gallon concoction. To smash the record, Knight will mix 400
gallons of ice cream and 2,100 gallons of root beer in a wine vat
during a daylong celebration. The float is expected to serve more
than 20,000 people. The event is free.

 &HT;     EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The San Francisco Chronicle's panel
of 
 professional tasters tries a different product available in 
 supermarkets.    TASTER'S CHOICE: Root Beers Branch Out Too Much in Flavor  
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Microbrew root beer may be the latest trend in
beverages. We found several brews on local store shelves and
decided we should get the tasting panel's opinion.
<P>
   We chose only root beer bottled in glass; canned root beer has
more carbonation, which interferes with flavors. We included the
relatively large producer IBC because it's bottled rather than
canned. (We did not choose any brands in the 1-liter plastic
bottles.)
</P>
<P>
   The root beers varied in price by as much as $2 per carton, but
not all of the most expensive brands fared particularly well.
</P>
<P>
   While the panel liked a couple of the beverages, overall they
found many of the root beers too odd with strange flavor components
like maple and star anise.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's favorite was  &UR; Thomas Kemper &LR;  (six 12-ounce bottles,
$4.59 at Andronico's). One panelist described it as ``a
well-rounded root beer'' and especially liked the sweet, spicy
flavors. All would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Stewart's &LR;  (four 12-ounce bottles,
$3.19-$3.39 at many supermarkets). Three panelists commented on the
thin flavor, but another thought it epitomized a root beer. Others
liked the carbonation. Three would buy it; two might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IBC &LR;  (six 12-ounce bottles, $3.29-$3.59 at many supermarkets)
came in third. One panelist thought the flavors were complex but
balanced; another found the finish bitter. Others thought the
beverage tasted too heavily of sarsaparilla. Two would buy it, two
might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Scores dropped dramatically down to fourth place, which went to
 &UR; Henry Weinhard's  &LR; (six 12-ounce bottles, $4.59-$4.99 at many
supermarkets). The panelists found the honey overpowering and
thought the root beer was too sweet overall. None would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Journey, Boylan Bottleworks, Natural Brew, Virgil's and
Tommyknocker scored too low to rate.

 FOOD IN THE NEWS: California Artichoke Crop Is Best in Years  
   
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO  &LR; _ Artichokes are the big news this week. Growers and
produce brokers are nearly beside themselves because the California
crop of Green Globes is the best the state has seen in four years.
<P>
   ``We're awash in artichokes,'' says Andy Powning of GreenLeaf, a
San Francisco produce supplier. ``There was a lot of rain and some
frost, but the (artichokes) which were affected by the early April
frost are picked. They're gone. Now, we're into a really good
season for 'chokes.''
</P>
<P>
   A good supply means cheaper prices and better quality. At area
greengrocers this week, most large artichokes are selling for just
under a dollar. Prices range from 79 cents at Berkeley Bowl to
$1.39 at Andronico's in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A string of exceptionally wet years since 1995 had drowned
plants and devasted the state's $49 million annual crop, but this
year promises a complete turnaround, says Pat Hopper of Ocean Mist
Farms, the biggest producer in Castroville, Calif., with 4,000
acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of the artichokes this year is super,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But artichoke growers and sellers say the crop took longer than
usual to get to marketable size and shape because it had to endure
a cold March and frosts in early April.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year it seemed to go from winter to summer with about an
inch of spring in between,'' GreenLeaf's Powning says. ``We had the
coldest March of the decade. What happens with that is, even though
the growing days get longer, plants grow slowly. Now it's hot, so
they're bursting.''
</P>
<P>
   While things are looking good in Monterey County, Half Moon Bay
in San Mateo County is a little slower to recover. Farmers report
December's freeze, excessive rain and lingering effects of El
Ni &LR; n &LR; o have set them back. Earlier this month, Giusti Farms in Half
Moon Bay reported packing only a quarter of what normally is
harvested in April.
</P>
<P>
   But San Mateo County's overall contribution to California's
artichoke crop is small _ less than 450 acres out of a statewide
total of about 9,000.

<P>
   Go ahead and order an egg for breakfast. And if you hold the
bacon, you don't have to feel guilty about it.
</P>
<P>
   A study of more than 100,000 healthy individuals shows an egg a
day doesn't appear to increase your chances for heart disease or
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published April 21 in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, concludes that nutrients and so-called good
cholesterol _ high-density lipoproteins _ in eggs probably offsets
the bad cholesterol, called low-density lipoprotein.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for egg lovers who may have been pining since
eggs took on a reputation for being cholesterol bombs and were
banned from the diets of people prone to or suffering from heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, the public has been advised to keep
cholesterol intake to 300 milligrams a day. An egg contains 213
milligrams and about 75 calories. But the study shows the two sorts
of cholesterol in eggs likely balance each other, and antioxidants,
folates, B vitamins and unsaturated fat in eggs can be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your diet is balanced, you don't have to avoid eggs and can
even include them in your diet,'' says Dr. Frank Hu of the Harvard
School of Public Health, the study's author.
</P>
<P>
   The study, based on information taken from two larger ongoing
studies, is notable for its scope. It includes statistics drawn
from 80,000 nurses in 11 states who have been reporting their
health status and living habits since 1976. The other group
includes 37,000 male health professionals who have been followed
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease prevention should focus on reducing the intake of
saturated fat, Hu says. That includes the kind that remains solid
at room temperature, such as butter, palm oil and fat found in
animal products like bacon.

 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Maurizio Bruschi is a fourth-generation Italian
cook who began working with his grandmother in the family
restaurant in Rome when he was only 15 years old.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years later, he came to San Francisco and worked in various
restaurants, but his first love always has been Roman cooking.
</P>
<P>
   His dishes, such as Swordfish with Peppercorn Sauce, have a
lusty simplicity with maximum flavor derived from minimum
ingredients. Here the fish fillets are breaded with crumbs and
fried to a golden crunch over high heat. All that's needed to
complete the dish is lemon and green peppercorns. It takes just 10
minutes to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Bruschi has cooked at and owned several restaurants around the
city, including Pazzia and Bonta, but he has been at Ideale in
North Beach since 1993. In this simple storefront restaurant that
exudes casual charm, he indulges his Roman roots and produces
seafood salad, beef wrapped in radicchio with balsamic vinegar, and
prosciutto wrapped around pears with mascarpone.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the crisp, succulent swordfish.
</P>

<P>
   4 swordfish fillets, 8 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   Breadcrumbs
</P>
<P>
   8 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the fish fillets and pat dry. Beat the eggs in a bowl.
Working with one fillet at a time, dip the fish into the beaten
egg, turning to coat, then roll in breadcrumbs, turning so both
sides are well covered. Press the fillet with both hands to make
the crumbs adhere securely.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan. Add the
fillets and saute over high heat for 2 minutes on each side. Season
with salt then transfer to paper towels to drain for a minute or
two. Arrange on a heated platter and set aside in a warm spot.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the green peppercorns, lime or lemon juice, the parsley,
green onion, a pinch of salt, and the remaining 2 teaspoons oil;
mix well. Pour over the hot swordfish.

 AT THE SOURCE: No Missing Links in Sausage Maker's Repertory  
   
   
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 NAPA VALLEY, Calif.  _ Don't tell Gerhard Twele any wurst/worst
jokes. The German-born Napa Valley sausage maker has heard them
all.
 &HT;    In fact, before he acquired his company, it had been known as
The Wurst Place, which Twele and his American wife, Nancy, thought
was a little too corny. So they opted for his given name plus the
Napa Valley designation _ Gerhard's Napa Valley Sausage _ which has
just a little more culinary cachet.
 &HT;    Not that Twele has abandoned the bratwursts and other sausages
he learned to make as a teenage apprentice in the small Rhine
Valley town of Mittelheim, but he has expanded his repertoire
beyond these traditionals.
 &HT;    Trained in Europe as a chef and restaurateur as well as a
sausage maker, Twele roamed the world as a merchant marine cook and
a land-locked chef in kitchens from Paris to the Cote d'Azur,
Montreal, San Diego and the Napa Valley.
 &HT;    In Napa in 1985, the Tweles saw a niche to be filled: sausages
leaner and less artery-clogging than the conventional products
while still offering the same strapping, hearty appeal.
 &HT;    Working from a tiny Yountville kitchen, Gerhard Twele developed
sausages with all the time-honored herbs and spices but based on
lean poultry rather than fatty meats. He compensated for the
moisture lost by adding apples, cranberries and vegetables to the
mix.
 &HT;    Eventually, Twele started incorporating Asian and Mediterranean
flavors and added other pork, beef and lamb products (brandied
chorizo, fresh bratwurst, mild and hot Italian sausages and Syrian
lamb sausage), although always with low fat content.
 &HT;    As the menu expanded, so did the business. His Yountville
kitchen, reportedly the smallest establishment ever approved by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture for wholesale production, finally
gave way to a large facility in an industrial park on the edge of
Napa (he retained the Yountville place as retail showcase for some
years). Even the new facility keeps expanding _ most recently to
27,000 square feet _ and the original 400-pounds-a-week output has
grown to more than 50,000 pounds.
 &HT;    In the '80s, Gerhard's sausages were sold to restaurants and
specialty stores. Today, they are found in meat counters at Lucky
stores, Albertson's, Cala, Vallergas, Bell and Trader Joe's
markets, as well as some tony stores on the East Coast (Sutton
Place and New York's Dean&AMP;Deluca, although not at that firm's St.
Helena branch).
 &HT;    The all-natural chicken sausages are still Gerhard's biggest
draw, with chicken/basil/pine nuts giving the original
chicken/apple sausage competition for first place.
 &HT;    Success has not gone to the genial sausage maker's head. He
still supervises everything from the purchase and storage of
ingredients to the mixing of spices, and is a stickler for quality
control.
 &HT;    Like his zesty products, his business philosophy is a blend of
New World know-how and Old Country principles. On the one hand, he
explains his ever-expanding repertoire by saying one has to go with
the times. On the other, he says the secret to success in business
is to ``service even your smallest account as if it were your
largest.''
 &HT;     
 
 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) 
 
 A Sausage for Every Reason  
  
Traditionally, Americans think of sausage as breakfast food or
picnic fare. &HT;    Sophisticated sausages, like those produced by Gerhard's Napa
Valley Sausage, go beyond that. They can fill the bill for just
about any meal and course _ except dessert. Nothing wrong with
serving them for breakfast, of course, but they are equally good as
appetizers and as lunch or dinner entrees.
 &HT;    The packaged sausages have heating instructions. Smoked, fully
cooked sausages can be simply warmed by placing them in barely
simmering water for 10 minutes, or they can be barbecued, fried,
grilled or sauteed. Small fresh sausages can be browned directly in
a nonstick pan with a little oil. Large ones are best when poached
in water, broth or wine, then browned lightly.
 &HT;    Sausages are a must in Alsatian choucroute garni _ try smoked
duck sausage for a taste adventure. Brandied smoked chorizo is
perfect in paella; lamb sausage pairs well with pilaf; chicken with
habaneros and tequila makes great taco and enchilada fillings, and
just about any sausage can lend character to pizzas and pastas _ as
in a hot Italian sausage for a tomato sauce or a chicken sausage
with basil and pine nuts for an alfredo-type sauce.
 &HT;    Needless to say, bratwurst is a natural with red cabbage and
fried potatoes, and smoked Bavarian beerwurst pairs happily with
crusty bread or a German potato salad _ an ice-cold beer doesn't
hurt, either.
 &HT;    Sausage maker Gerhard Twele, who is also a professional chef,
recommends a simple but sophisticated appetizer: Poach curried
chicken sausages in white wine, place them on sheets of phyllo
large enough to enclose each sausage, top with a teaspoon of
chutney, wrap and bake at 375 degrees until golden. Cut sausages
into serving-size pieces.
 &HT;    For a picnic treat, wrap any blanched sausage (chicken Provencal
with leeks would be perfect) in brioche dough and bake at 400
degrees until the bread is done. Cool on a rack. To serve, cut into
thick slices and serve with a couple of interesting mustards.

<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  The selection of sausages available these days
seems limitless, making sausages a more versatile ingredient than
ever. Herbs, spices and all types of meat are fitted into casings
and served up alongside or with aromatic rice, beans and sauces.
<P>
   &UR; Saffron Jambalaya &LR; . Warm a little olive oil in a saucepan and
add 1/4 cup chopped onion, 1 chopped garlic clove, a generous pinch
of saffron threads, a cinnamon stick and 1 tablespoon slivered
almonds. Stir together until fragrant, and add 1 cup basmati rice
and mix. Stir in 1 tablespoon tomato paste, 1 cup chicken broth, 1
cup water, 1/4 cup coarsely chopped dried apricots, 1/4 cup
raisins, salt to taste and 2 chicken-apple (or other fruit blended)
sausage, cut into 1-inch rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer about 20
minutes, or until the liquid is fully absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   For a little spiciness, add a coarsely chopped Thai or other
small chile.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Baked Sausage-Filled Cherry Tomatoes.  &LR; Gently trim the tops
from 1 pint cherry tomatoes and scoop out the seeds. Remove the
casing from 1 spicy Italian sausage and spoon a small amount of the
meat into each tomato, mounding it slightly at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Place the tomatoes in a foil-lined baking dish just large enough
to hold them comfortably. Bake in a 400 oven until the juice from
the sausage runs clear, about 25 minutes. Serve as a snack or hors
d'oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rigatoni with Tomato, Olive and Sausage Sauce. &LR;  Warm a little
olive oil in a saute pan; add 1 coarsely chopped garlic clove and
cook, stirring, until fragrant. Add 2 cups diced fresh or canned
tomatoes, freshly ground pepper, 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary
needles, 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, a few pitted black olives and 2
fennel-seasoned sausages, cut into 1/2-inch rounds. Stir together,
cover and cook over low heat until the sausages are done, about 25
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serve over rigatoni pasta and sprinkle with freshly grated
Parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rosemary-Seasoned Cannellini Beans &LR; . Soak 2 cups cannellini
beans overnight in water. The following day, drain the beans and
place in a large soup pot with 2 or 3 fresh Italian bay leaves and
a bunch of 5 or 6 rosemary sprigs, which have been tied together.
Add 3 cups chicken broth and 3 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce
heat to low and simmer, salting the beans as they begin to soften.
Cook until very tender but not falling apart, about 11/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with charcoal-grilled sausages and a green salad.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Roasted Pepper, Zucchini and Sausage Stuffing &LR; . Soak 3 slices
bread in a little milk, then squeeze dry.
</P>
<P>
   Stir together 1 cup coarsely chopped roasted red peppers (about
3 large peppers), 1 pound sausage (casings removed), 1 cup coarsely
chopped zucchini, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the milk-soaked
bread and some chopped Italian parsley. Mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the mixture to a baking dish. Do not spread the mixture
too thinly or it will dry out. Bake in a 400-degree oven until it
just begins to pull away from the sides of the dish and the juices
run clear.

   EDITORS NOTE: Bay Area Classics profiles
food-related  businesses more than a half-century old.   BAY AREA CLASSICS: DiMaggio Ate Dinner Here  
   
 By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  In the days of Seals Stadium, the nearby Double
Play restaurant and bar on Potrero Hill was a stomping ground for
drinking, smoking and baseball fever.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Joe DiMaggio, Dario Lodigiani, Bobby Layne, Doak Walker _ they
were all in here,'' says Gigi Fiorucci, who bought the Double Play
in 1989 and recalls the sports figures who hung out there when
Seals and Kezar stadiums were home bases for San Francisco sports.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out the front window, he repeats a story that's made
the rounds: ``In the '30s, the ball players would come over here
between innings, get a shot and go back.'' It was an easy play.
Situated kitty-corner from where Seals Stadium once stood, the run
to Double Play was about the distance from first to second base.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fiorucci and Don Russo, a San Francisco firefighter
and baseball-loving friend who grew up near Seals Stadium, Double
Play was opened as a bar in 1909 when Potrero Hill was a commercial
neighborhood dominated by factories. It acquired its baseball-savvy
name after the sports-loving Stanfel family bought it in 1937.
(Dick Stanfel, a son, went on to professional football as a guard
for the Detroit Lions.)
</P>
<P>
   The Stanfels sold the Double Play in the mid-'80s to a group of
partners. Shortly after the sale, a fire broke out, and Double Play
was closed for about 11/2 years. When it reopened, the owners had
expanded the tiny bar and had added a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Double Play is a three-room restaurant-bar filled with
sports memorabilia and old timers who relive sports stories over a
hearty breakfast. The top of the Seals Stadium flagpole hangs over
the bar and every inch of wall space is crammed with sports photos
and baseball mitts, some from professional players.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorucci, a restaurateur who had owned several restaurants in
the city including Maye's Oyster House, was attracted to the Double
Play because it was smaller than his other restaurants and he
wanted to slow down. ``Thirty five years of split shifts,'' he says
in a voice that claims, ``Enough!''
</P>
<P>
   All too familiar with the parking headaches in San Francisco,
Fiorucci says its adjacent parking lot was another reason he bought
Double Play. But he didn't leave the lot entirely to cars. In the
early '90s, he turned a 20-by-60-foot space of it into a dining
room _ ``Seals Stadium'' _ where every wall features a mural that
depicts fans cramming the bleachers. ``We want to rename the room
`Joe DiMaggio Stadium,' '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fiorucci likes his work schedule as it is now _
serving breakfast and lunch weekdays, with the bar open until 8
p.m. if the restaurant isn't booked for a private party. Otherwise,
evenings and weekends are devoted to private banquets.
</P>
<P>
   And he's training his son, Gino, in the business. ``I'm going to
be a bum,'' Fiorucci says, ``and take a sabbatical.'' Still, it
will be hard to leave the Double Play, he says. ``This is the only
landmark left from Seals Stadium.''

 REAL MEN DRINK ROOT BEER  
 From truck drivers to chefs, everybody's rooting for the new 
 hand-crafted brews  
   
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  America is in the middle of the root beer
revolution, and a stream of the nation's oldest soda pop is pouring
through the Bay Area.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Root beer fans include burly former beer drinkers, pregnant
women, Baby Boomers on nostalgia trips and club hoppers looking for
something different in their kegs.
</P>
<P>
   They're drinking upscale versions of the soda at hip
neighborhood bars like kilowatt in the Mission District and
top-drawer restaurants like Farallon and LuLu.
</P>
<P>
   Local microbrewers at brewpubs like San Francisco's ThirstyBear
are turning over vats once reserved for batches of ale to root
beer. At Berkeley's Pyramid Brewery, freshly made root beer is
poured alongside alcoholic brew.
</P>
<P>
   The soda is even foaming up cyberspace. Chi-An Chien, 27, is a
Princeton-educated multimedia programmer who is the master of a
nationally recognized root beer Web site. Along with Star Wars
memorabilia stuffed into her Mission District apartment, Chien
stacks cases of root beer _ samples from brewers hoping to make it
onto her ``A List.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you get into it, the more you can discern what makes
one better than the other,'' she says. ``A lot of people think of
A&AMP;W as the standard in root beer. It's a decent root beer for
floats but not what you want to drink straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Like coffee, bread and microbrewed beer before it, root beer has
gone gourmet.
</P>
<P>
   But why is a brew that began as a medicinal tonic Native
Americans shared with New World settlers enjoying a resurgence?
</P>
<P>
   Some see its rise as reflection of where the Bay Area finds
itself at the end of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '90s, everything's gone gourmet,'' says Dean Halpern, a
manager at Millennium, a vegetarian restaurant in San Francisco.
Thomas Kemper bottled root beer is on the restaurant's beverage
list because the almost-all-natural product fits the restaurant's
profile.
</P>
<P>
   Others are less cynical about the recent surge of craft root
beers, crediting it to a mix of Boomer-driven nostalgia, a move
toward sobriety and the elevated taste of Bay Area consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The craft root beers have such a strong flavor characteristic
to them. People in cities like Seattle and San Francisco enjoy
things that have stronger, more distinct taste,'' says Michael
Goldsberry, spokesman for Pyramid, which makes Thomas Kemper soda
both in Seattle and Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Root beer is just a rich, wonderful flavor _ one of those
things that as soon as you have it in your mouth, you make a
connection with it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, root beer has been around long enough to establish
itself as one of the strongest nostalgia-inducing drinks in
America. The great-grandfather of the version most people drink
today was invented before cola. But today, cola has 60 percent of
the soda market and root beer, just 3 percent. Even orange soda
beats it, with a 4 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   Still, marketers and makers alike agree root beer is the
fastest-growing product in the soda pop family. Premium-brand IBC
has more than doubled its sales since 1995. Coca-Cola bought Barq's
three years ago and is marketing the brew on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kemper sales have jumped 20 percent over last year.
Stewart's, a root beer sold on the East Coast since 1924, is a
relativerelative newcomer to the Bay Area. Despite its hefty $3.50
price per four-pack, sales here have grown 54 percent in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   What attracts aficionados to the premium-priced varieties? Among
other characteristics, the bubbles. And the right bubbles can only
be had in bottles, they claim, not in cans.
</P>
<P>
   That's because manufacturers have to pump excess carbonation
into canned root beers to maintain the pressure a can demands.
``Root beer should be lightly carbonated, like a microbrew. It
shouldn't boil off the tongue like Coke,'' says Matt Pearson, a
beverage distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson and his brother, Eric, like root beer so much that they
started making their own in 1996. They brewed up batches in their
kitchens, made a label from an image of the Golden Gate Bridge cut
out from the phone book and found a bottler.
</P>
<P>
   In just three years, sales of Pearson Bros. root beer have grown
to 3,000 cases. It's available in about 300 stores and restaurants
in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The Pearsons believe the information age sparked the rise in
craft root beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People turn to something comforting and homey in the face of
all this technology,'' Eric Pearson says. ``It's like the
Volkswagen Beetle or mashed potatoes and meat loaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Root beer's spice, smoothed by its sweetness, makes it work well
with salty food. Pizza, popcorn and hot dogs are good matches, and
it stands up well to barbecue and pastrami, the Pearson brothers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a root beer has a creamy taste, hints of cinnamon and
nutmeg, the spice of wintergreen or any of a hundred other flavor
variations comes down to the ability to replicate the desired
flavor in a laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all root beers, even boutique versions, are flavored with
a synthesized base. Original recipes are forged from a dozen or
more natural ingredients. But to produce a consistent taste and aid
sterile, large-scale manufacturing, the brewer's recipe is captured
by chemists working at what the industry calls ``flavor houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewers mix that base with sweeteners like corn syrup and honey.
Then they cool the mixture and dissolve carbon dioxide into the
cold, sweet liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Critical palates describe root beer with phrases one might find
at a wine tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Chien's glossary: Tang is the first bite or sensation.
Body is the depth of taste. Kick is the sensation left in the mouth
after swallowing. Aftertaste is what happens next.
</P>
<P>
   She likes Pearson Bros., but IBC is her favorite. She describes
it like this: ``Smooth, spicy taste, not too sweet with a fantastic
kick to it. Dark and full-bodied.'' She also gives high marks to
Stewart's (``a nice, solid beer with a dark taste'') and Thomas
Kemper (``A nice, spicy bite ... heavy on the cloves'').
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is root beer, not Cabernet. So things can get a
little playful. ``Cloying means taste that sticks around too long,
like an old boyfriend when you're ready to move on,'' she writes on
her Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But like most food and drink, taste is a personal matter. San
Francisco chef and recipe consultant Catherine Alioto is a newcomer
to the root beer revolution. During her recent pregnancy, a root
beer craving hit her hard at about the sixth month. She embarked on
a quest to find the perfect root beer. She tore through brands that
were too medicinal, overly sweet or poorly carbonated. None matched
her childhood &UR;  &LR; memory or satisfied her craving.
</P>
<P>
   Then she drove to an A&AMP;W stand in Marin County and found
nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something about drinking root beer fresh from the tap
in a chilled glass that no other was able to duplicate,'' she says.
``It was reassuring to realize that, even today, there are some
things that are as you remember.''

HERE'S A CHANCE TO SEE THE BIG BEND FROM A CAMEL'S BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been many uncommon sights on the high desert of the
Big Bend _ curanderos packing their medicinal plants, mountain
lions seeking their prey, and chili fiends heading for the
Terlingua cook-offs. The latter is perhaps the scariest of the
three.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there will be another. This summer, those who have often
wondered what Big Bend Ranch State Park might look like from atop a
camel's back will get a chance to see firsthand. The Texas Camel
Corps will begin two-day treks through the rugged, scenic southwest
Texas park in July.
</P>
<P>
   Camels, believe it or not, have a history in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp Verde General Store on Texas 173 south of Kerrville is
all that remains of Camp Verde, a one-time Army post that was home
to the 34 camels and the 12 Armenian drivers and their families who
arrived there in 1856.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment was the idea of U.S. Sen. Jefferson Davis of
Mississippi. When Davis became secretary of war in 1855, Congress
appropriated $30,000 for the training of soldiers to use camels for
carrying supplies and for exploring new territories between El Paso
and the Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   The camels, obtained in North Africa, landed at Indianola, near
Port Lavaca, in April 1856. They were then delivered to Camp Verde.
It was to be their permanent base, but the soldiers never came to
adore the camels the way the Cavalry embraced its horses. The
soldiers complained that the camels held grudges, sometimes waiting
for weeks to exact their revenge by kicking or spitting.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Civil War broke out and interest in the camels was
lost. The fort eventually was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were camels in the area that is now Big Bend Ranch State
Park,'' said David Alloway, a park naturalist. ``In 1859 and 1860,
the Big Bend region was explored by a group of cameleers under Lt.
William Echols.''
</P>
<P>
   Echols had the job of mapping the unexplored region and to test
the camels' usefulness in the rugged terrain. There were also
camels in the Big Bend last year, when the Odyssey Exploration
Society from Calgary, Alberta, trained for a 900-mile camel trek
across Arabia's Empty Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Vision Quest, a youth rehabilitation organization,
held a camel trek on the ranch. Vision Quest moved on to Arizona
this year, but the camels and their trainer, Doug Baum, stayed
behind to establish a tour business in Big Bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the treks here at Big Bend Ranch State Park will
be more than six to eight miles a day,'' Alloway said. ``It's hard
to find tough camels any more and it hard to find tough people to
ride them.''
</P>
<P>
   Alloway said the most difficult aspect of the ride is getting
used to the height and the constant sway of the camels.
</P>
<P>
   ``These camels are very gentle; it's just an odd sensation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day safaris are scheduled for July 24-25, July 31-Aug.
1, Aug. 7-8, Sept. 18-19 and Sept. 25-26. The trips are limited to
six people and cost $650 per person, which includes park fees,
guides, lodging and meals.
</P>
<P>
   More information is available from Big Bend Ranch State Park,
(915) 229-3416.

PIZZERIA UNO PONDERS THE ROAD AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thank God a slice of pizza can be reheated within a matter of
minutes. Some things don't work that way.
</P>
<P>
   Public shares of local Italian eateries, hot investments in the
early 1990s, went cold years ago and stayed that way even as
business improved.
</P>
<P>
   Now the last of three leading Massachusetts companies, Uno
Restaurant Corp., has formed a committee of outside directors and
hired investment bankers for advice on how to get out of its stock
rut. The usual options: sell the company or organize a leveraged
buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spencer, the chairman of Uno and owner of a 61 percent
interest in the Boston company, filed documents Monday saying he
was consulting a financial adviser and might propose a merger or
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of moribund stock activity was what drove
Bertucci's Inc. founder Joey Crugnale to make an offer for his
company's public stock last year, a bid that was later topped by
another private investor group.
</P>
<P>
   Then Charlie Sarkis took his Back Bay Restaurant Group private
in a $38 million deal that was completed just three weeks ago. Back
Bay Restaurant Group, based in Boston, owns the Papa-Razzi chain
and other restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Uno has hired BancBoston Robertson Stephens to consider the
company's options and report to three outside directors, including
former Boston Edison chief Stephen Sweeney and former Chelsea
receiver James Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   Uno shares have been stuck in a price band of $6 to $8 per share
for the last three years. The company itself has rebounded from
problems in the mid-1990s, posting an 85 percent earnings gain in
the most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Uno shares a small value-oriented investment, far out
of style in a market focused on large growth companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``For small, nontechnical companies with no research coverage,
this just isn't their world,'' said Tom Spiro of Spiro Capital
Management Inc., a small New York investment firm that owns Uno
shares. ``I'm not complaining, I think they're doing all the right
things. If it was Uno.com, the circumstances might be very
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer portrays Uno in a similar light, a little stock ignored
in a big-stock world. ``We're a small-cap stock, small is even too
big a word,'' he said. ``We're just little guys and presently this
market is not paying attention to little guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Uno has been a consistent buyer of its own stock under
repurchase programs. Spencer said current prices make the
investment in Uno stock similar to that of opening a new store, in
the range of four times earnings before interest, depreciation,
taxes and amortization.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer bristles at the idea of being lumped together with
companies that stumbled and later went private, though Uno too has
managed through problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the experiences of investors who have owned shares of Uno,
Bertucci and Back Bay Restaurant Group illustrate the power and
occasional excesses of the system that pumps capital into American
companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the decade, investment bankers sold their
customers on the concept of restaurant stocks on a scale never seen
before and raised hundreds of millions of dollars. All those
companies had to expand to put their new capital to work and meet
new growth expectations from Wall Street, roughly at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   They were the ``story'' stocks of the moment, sold on similar
investment themes.
</P>
<P>
   Some stumbled as they tried to grow. Others simply found it hard
to build business as they were competing against a crowd of other,
newly public restaurant companies.
</P>
<P>
   The market had discovered a small industry, pumped too much
money into too many stocks and then abandoned the survivors once
they disappoined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small capitalization restaurants, existing stories without any
kind of fashion sizzle, are just of no interest to anyone,'' said
analyst Bret Jordan of Advest Inc. ``They only way they can
recognize any value is the leveraged buyout or to sell to someone
else buildling a conglomerate of restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is a cycle that appears to be starting anew, just
as Uno employs financial advisers because investors seem
uninterested in bidding up its public shares.
</P>
<P>
   Buca Inc., operator of a Minneapolis-based chain of Italian
restaurants, launched a $36 million initial public stock offering
last week. The shares, priced at 12, jumped to 18 1/4 in their
first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   P.F. Chang's China Bistro Inc. of Phoneix went public in
December at 12 per share. It finished at 25 1/4 Monday. On deck:
Rubio's Restaurants Inc. of Carlsbad, Calif., considered a hot IPO
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   More will surely follow. The question: how many will be
pondering their own moves to go private a few years from now?

BRAEKFAST TRADITION THERE FOR THE TRAVELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traditions are one of the more enjoyable aspects of Discovering
America.
</P>
<P>
   One tasty tradition to discover is right in our own New England
backyard _ the May breakfasts of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   The May Breakfasts have become a rite of spring and can be found
in 21 communities in the tiny state. And wherever you go, more than
likely the traditional Rhode Island johnnycake will be on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition began 132 years ago at the Oak Lawn Community
Baptish Church in Cranston as a fundraiser and will again be served
up May 1 by Quaker-costumed hostesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some 25,000 people are expected to participate in one of the
feasts that include fried or scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, baked
beans, muffins, juice, coffee, tea, and milk as well as the
johnnycake.
</P>
<P>
   The johnnycake is derived from an Indian recipe using flint
corn, a variety of hard-kernel corn that thrives in the fog and
salt air of the Ocean State. Early settlers stuffed the small, hard
cakes called ``journeycakes'' into their pockets or saddlebags for
sustenance on long trips, and now when people think of johnnycake,
they think of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   While most breakfasts are held on May 1, others are on May 4,
Rhode Island's Independence Day. Still others will hold their May
Breakfast on April 30, and May 2, 3, 7, 8, and 16. Besides churches
the breakfasts also are held by Rotary Clubs, volunteer fire
associations, and even the Norman Bird Sanctuary (the 11th annual
May Birds and Breakfast on May 16).
</P>
<P>
   For locations, times, and prices, call the Rhode Island Economic
Development Corp. at 800-556-2484.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
Virginia for lovers
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, the ``Virginia is for lovers'' travel slogan has
encouraged visitors to discover all there is to love about
Virginia. The slogan has become the longest-running and one of the
most recognized state slogans. To celebrate the anniversary the
state has two sweepstakes with monthly drawings for prizes. One is
the `` `Virginia is for lovers' If You Were Born in 1969
Sweepstakes'' and the other is ``Fall in Love with Virginia
Sweepstakes.'' To enter either contest, go to the Visit Virginia
Website at www.VIRGINIA.org and click on the contest icon. For a
travel guide to the state, call 800-932-5827. By the way, do you
remember any other slogans from '69? Among them were ``It's the
Real Thing,'' ``The Big Mac,'' ``The Silent Majority,'' and ``One
Giant Leap for Mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Spectacular scenery
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Skamania and Klickitat counties in Washington state
are not on most people's destination list. But, since most people
want great scenery, maybe these counties should be. This is the
Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, the only place in
America that has been designated by Congress as a ``National Scenic
Area.'' And, there's a lot more to do then just take in the

VOLCKER ON BILL BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By David Warsh 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems like another world _ the one in which Bill Clinton was
elected president in 1992, after Ross Perot split the Republican
vote. The President-elect was an unknown then. Big-spending
traditionalist? Or fiscally conservative ``new Democrat''?
</P>
<P>
   Probably Clinton didn't know himself. He chose Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat, to serve as
Treasury secretary _ and began the process of trial and error that
led to the present day.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's zigzag leadership, the Democrats have learned
how to dominate the Senate by proving to be more careful stewards
of the Republican program than the GOP itself. Witness the long
boom and the balanced budget. What a long strange journey it has
been!
</P>
<P>
   Alas, what has remained the same since 1992 is Clinton's
reputation for slightly slippery behavior. For all the contemptible
tactics of his foes for the past six years, and for all the success
he has had in finding his way to a sure command of the political
mainstream, the president's reputation as ``Slick Willy'' remains
the overarching legacy of his administration. It's a heavy handicap
to his would-be successor, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It is of some interest that the Democratic potentate whom
Clinton passed over in 1992 to appoint Bentsen to the treasury post
has now endorsed Gore's opponent, former New Jersey Senator Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Volcker's iconic influence among the Democratic Party's
faithful has never been as great as among the Reagan Democrats, who
for 12 crucial years proved to be the swing factor in American
politics. But then that is precisely the point.
</P>
<P>
   The man who brought runaway inflation under control in two terms
as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board from 1979 to 1987 is the
Democratic Party's only other successful leader besides Clinton in
the past quarter-century. Compared to the endorsement of Jimmy
Carter say, or Walter Mondale or Michael Dukakis, Volcker's
imprimatur means a lot _ at least for the kinds of moderate
business Republicans whose support is necessary if Democrats are to
retain the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So when the former Fed chairman stood before a cheering throng
at the New York Sheraton earlier this month he struck a chord when
he said, ``I am a disturbed citizen. For too many years I've seen
the healthy skepticism of Americans about government erode into a
corrosive cynicism. That cynicism and distrust needs to be
changed,'' said Volcker. ``It seemed to me long ago that Bill
Bradley had the potential _ had the essential qualities, the
character to do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Volcker and Bradley share a good deal of background and
temperament. Volker was raised in New Jersey; Bradley represented
the state in the Senate for 18 years before stepping down in 1996.
The two are among Princeton University's most famous graduates;
Bradley starred at basketball there before turning pro with the
National Basketball Association's New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if nothing else, the Volcker endorsement underscores the
extent to which the presidential race has turned into a type of
tong war among three leading Ivy League universities. George W.
Bush is the Yale man. Gore went to Harvard. Each has built a dense
network of connections to alumni and faculty of his alma mater. All
started out in the 1960s, in the aftermath of John F. Kennedy's
assassination and under the shadow of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-cutting and deficit politics of the 1980s and 1990s have
long since superseded the issues of those turbulent years. The
political consequences of the impeachment proceedings have replaced
those debates in turn. Bradley said as much in his New York
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair or not (trust) is something we need to repair today. The
people of the United States need to be able to trust the president,
and the president needs to trust the people to understand the world
they live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever chance Bradley has of wresting the Democratic
nomination from a sitting vice president has to do with this
fundamental issue.

A WELCOME SIDE TRIP IN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ It was an unlikely, isolated stop on our
cross-country journey, far off the East-West interstates, almost to
the Left Coast, with a reputation for New Age kookiness.
</P>
<P>
   But in our five years living out West during the 1980s, the town
of Sedona had topped the list of highly-recommended places we never
quite got to. The photo editor at the Denver newspaper that
employed me was a sybaritic marvel: the kind of guy who always knew
the name of the great new French restaurant in Provo, Utah. And
Sedona, he told us, was not to be missed.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, we discovered the old photo dog was right. When
a research trip took me (and my 15-year-old daughter/research
assistant) on a coast-to-coast tour of archives and libraries, I
recalled his advice and planned a break at the ``midway'' point to
explore Arizona's red rock country. We found solitude and comfort,
an increasingly rare combination in today's West.
</P>
<P>
   After crossing Texas and New Mexico, we picked up my wife and
10-year-old son at the Phoenix airport and pointed our now worn and
dirty station wagon north on Interstate 17, for the 120-mile ride
to Sedona. The northern Arizona scenery was immediately rewarding,
with forests of saguaro and stark lunar ranges as we gradually
climbed from the 110-degree heat of the central Arizona basin to
the mile-high rim of the Colorado Plateau. The temperature,
thankfully, dropped 30 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Sedona's location on the Mogollon Rim of the enormous plateau _
it is the same massive geologic formation through which the
Colorado River has carved the Grand Canyon _ gives it four mild
seasons and a climate that is, on the average, some 20 degrees
cooler in summer than Phoenix or Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneers and prospectors arrived here in the early 1800s, but
two Pennsylvania Dutch settlers gave Sedona its name. Theodore
Schnebly arrived in 1901 and planned to open the first post office
at the place he called Schnebly Station. His brother suggested that
Theodore's wife Sedona had a name better suited for the beautiful
natural surroundings, thus saving the town from an incongruous fate
as Schnebly, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Geographic and geologic placement give Sedona its spectacular,
signature red rock formations, which were formed as wind and water
shaved the sandstone and limestone edges of the Mogollon Rim. As we
drove into town we identified the red bluffs and spires by name:
Cockscomb, Chimney Rock, Coffee Pot, Bell Rock, Steamboat Rock,
Elephant Rock, Courthouse Butte. The magnificent Cathedral Rock,
which towers over Oak Creek, is one of the West's most scenic
sites. My son was delighted by Snoopy Rock, which unquestionably
resembles the cartoon hero asleep on his doghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Sedona is a dispersed 16,000-soul community of tiny resorts,
vacation homes and modest shopping centers where a small collection
of New Age hippies mingles with retirees, artists, writers, and
outdoors enthusiasts. A shortage of water and privately-owned land
has preserved the town from the curse of development. Surrounded by
the Coconino National Forest, Sedona has but 15 square miles of
private property. We arrived on a three-day holiday weekend, and
found the Y intersection that serves as the center of town jammed
with traffic. But then the work week drew the crowds back to
Phoenix, and left the place with its trademark laid-back feel.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet search had provided us a home for the week: the
terrific Junipine resort on the banks of Oak Creek. The resort's
roots date to a collection of cabins and outhouses built in an
apple orchard in the 1920s, but it now offers 50 wooden
``creekhouses'' _ modern, privately-owned townhomes that come with
big, comfortable beds; equipped kitchens; maid service; fireplaces;
wide decks; and cable television. Some units have lofts and hot
tubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Junipine cafe and grill served three meals a day (room
service available) and Sedona offered several noteworthy
restaurants, but we generally preferred to cook at home _ packing
breakfasts or lunches for our hikes and day trips, and using the
resort's charcoal grills for steaks and chicken at night. Loud, fat
mountain jays welcomed us to the deck each morning, and at dusk my
son took his fishing pole to sit on the rocks along trout-stocked
Oak Creek.
</P>
<P>
   There was too much to do in only a week. We took day trips to
the Grand Canyon, the Meteor Crater, and the old
mining-town-turned-artist-hangout of Jerome, precariously built on
the side of a mountain. I took off for two mornings of golf at the
justly-celebrated Sedona Golf Resort and Oak Creek Country Club,
and joined my son on two afternoons at the pretty nine-hole,
pitch-and-putt course of the Poco Diablo resort. We never got
around to Sedona's famous jeep tours of the surrounding
countryside; at $30 per person per hour, they seemed expensive
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   One stop was a big letdown: the Slide Rock State Park, where Oak
Creek cascades through a series of pools and chutes like a natural
water slide. The parking lot was full; the creek jammed with
people, and the banks of the stream littered with soda cans and
trash. A trickle of dirty water flowed into the creek from an
obviously overburdened latrine. Though the warning signs said that
the e-coli level in the cold creek water was safe that day, my
daughter grew dizzy and nauseous and broke out into hives. It must
have been quite a wonderful swimming hole in its day, but like many
of the West's natural attractions, Slide Rock has been loved to
death: failing under pressure from too many visitors and leaky
upstream septic fields.
</P>
<P>
   We had far happier experiences on our hikes, where we walked for
hours without seeing more than one or two people. The terrain
offered dazzling choices: We hiked among the ponderosa pines and
cottonwoods of the West Fork Trail in Oak Creek Canyon; to the
Native American ruins at the Honanki and Palatki archeology sites;
and up into the red rocks to see (and in the kids' case, fearlessly
dance upon) the towering natural arch called Devil's Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the last nights of our stay, we ignored the
rattlesnake warning signs (11 species of rattler are native to
Arizona) and joined a ranger for a moonlight hike through Red Rock
State Park. We wandered up a trail through juniper and manzanita as
the sunset threw gold and purple streaks across the sky, and
exchanged greetings with a rancher and his wife, who were out on a
nighttime horseback ride. From an overlook high above Sedona, we
saw the full moon rise into the desert night. The rapid moonrise
was hypnotic, akin to the earthrise filmed by the Apollo astronauts
from the lunar surface, and gave us that same acute perception of
movement through space.
</P>
<P>
   We returned to Red Rock park again on our last day in Sedona,
inadvertently disturbing some graceful, good-natured nude
sunbathers. It was the one time we chanced upon Sedona's
understated New Age community, and the encounter sparked plenty of
conversation on the ride to California.
</P>
<P>
   As we hiked one final time through the shallow pools of Oak
Creek, my daughter put the lessons of her high school photography
course to good use. At Christmas she gave us her portrait of
Cathedral Rock, which now graces our living room, calling us back
to the red rock country.

<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Most energy in the United States comes from solar,
nuclear and hydroelectric generation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Seventy percent of our electricity is produced by
burning coal and other fossil fuels _ sources linked to global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Plastic six-pack rings do not break down in the
environment and can trap marine animals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  The rings are designed to disintegrate in sunlight, but
the process can take 10 years. Therefore, the rings should be
snipped, recycled or avoided altogether. Surveys have shown that
the rings can strangle birds and fish, but the worst culprit is
abandoned plastic fishing line responsible for 37 percent of marine
entanglements.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Destruction of tropical rain forests will cause Earth's
atmosphere to run out of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Oxygen makes up almost 21 percent of atmospheric gases.
Burning all the tropical forests in the world would decrease the
proportion of oxygen by four-hundredths of one percent. Destruction
of tropical rain forests, however, would significantly increase the
concentration of carbon dioxide _ the most important greenhouse gas
_ in the atmosphere by 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Household and industrial chemicals are routinely tested
and approved for safe use by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Federal officials do not test pesticides or household
products for safety. They rely on producers to do so.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  The solar-energy market has plateaued.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Worldwide sales of solar cells increased 11 percent a
year from 1990 to 1996, then jumped by 43 percent in 1997 and by
another 28 percent in 1998. Sales of coal and oil have grown by
slightly more than one percent a year since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants _ which will
remain radioactive for millions of years _ are safely stored in a
deep underground facility in the West.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  No such long-term storage facility exists. All fuel rods
are stored temporarily at the nation's 103 active nuclear plants.
Another 12 plants have been shut down, but the spent rods are still
stored at the plants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Most oil pollution comes from tankers that run aground
or ships that wash out their holds at sea.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  More than twice as much oil gets into the environment
each year because of sloppy activities involving automobiles and
boats. At least 200 million gallons of oil are dumped each year in
the U.S. by people who change their own automobile engine oil.
Overfilling auto gas tanks also contributes to the mess, as do
spills when refilling outboard-motor tanks. However, tens of
thousands of leaky auto engines whizzing over already polluted
urban environments can't compare with the damage done to a pristine
environment by a single oil tanker such as the Exxon Valdez, which
spilled 10 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound in
Alaska in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Aerosol spray cans are the leading source of
ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  CFCs were banned from aerosol cans in 1978. They are
still found, however, in many air conditioners and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Government agencies test bottled water for safety and
purity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT &LR; : Bottled water is not tested by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Our national forests are protected from logging, mining
and drilling for oil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Fifty-two percent of national forests are logged, mined
and crisscrossed by more than 373,000 miles of roads, enough to
circle Earth 14 times. Just 18 percent of national forest land is
permanently protected wilderness, and much of that is thin soil
over rock where trees rarely grow.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Little more than a year ago, on the night of Feb. 9, the
170-foot research ship Wecoma headed west from the Oregon coast
into darkening rough seas. Within hours, the ship was making its
way into a gale. By the next day 45-knot winds were jacking waves
up to heights of 30 feet. Oceanographer Ed Baker remembers Feb. 14
as the worst night of all. Waves crashed over the deck and the wind
would suddenly change direction without warning. The Wecoma pitched
and bucked violently.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the storm, Baker, a researcher at the Pacific Marine
Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, and his colleagues were
determined to launch a half-ton deepwater probe into the Pacific to
collect evidence of a newly discovered side effect of giant
underwater twisters of hot water, called megaplumes.
</P>
<P>
   The night of the 14th was memorable not only because the seas
were so rough but also because the researchers had to deploy an
acoustic beacon the size of a telephone pole. Baker remembers, ``It
went off without a hitch, but that was probably the scariest part
of the trip.'' Several days later, everyone was relieved when the
beacon began broadcasting data.
</P>
<P>
   The voyage took 10 days but when the Wecoma docked in Oregon,
Baker was happy because the data he and his colleagues had
collected painted a picture of a far more violent spectacle on the
seafloor than the scientists had experienced in the storm on the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   The first rumblings of that unseen spectacle had begun weeks
earlier, on Jan. 25. A network of sensitive hydrophones in the
North Pacific, deployed by the U.S. Navy to listen for Soviet
submarines, picked up a swarm of earthquakes at the summit of an
undersea volcano called Axial. The quakes shook loose the rock that
had stopped up the volcano's plumbing. Through the newly cleared
rocky pipes came an inferno of molten rock and boiling water driven
upward by the intense pressures and temperatures of the inner Earth
miles below.
</P>
<P>
   A typical volcano on land, such as Mount St. Helens, fills the
sky with a plume of ash when it erupts. But Axial belched forth an
equally massive eruption of superhot water. That was followed by
streams of lava, some as deep as six feet, flowing down the sides
of the volcano. Along Axial's flanks, fields of geysers suddenly
pierced the ocean bottom, shooting up superheated jets of water
darkened with heavy concentrations of minerals from Earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimated, roughly, that there were 10 gigawatts of energy
coming out of the volcano's caldera,'' Baker says. ``By comparison,
Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River puts out about one gigawatt,
and that can provide energy for three million homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip on the Wecoma was launched to find out what happens
when all that energy breaks loose. The instruments dropped by Baker
and his fellow oceanographers measured water temperature, current
flow and the chemicals released during the eruption.
</P>
<P>
   Baker was particularly interested in learning more about
megaplumes which can soar more than several thousand feet off the
ocean floor and spin like slow but gargantuan tornadoes. They can
be 12 miles across and travel hundreds of miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bomblike event,'' says Baker, who was among a group of
oceanographers who discovered the phenomenon in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The plumes have attracted interest for three reasons. First,
they're new. Second, megaplumes stir up huge amounts of ocean,
carrying minerals and gases and heat almost to the sea's surface.
As they rise from the ocean's depths, megaplumes may bring energy
and food to animals in shallow water. Third, megaplumes move great
distances horizontally, too. In their travels, they may have helped
some of the oddest and oldest beasts in the world colonize the
planet. Megaplumes, which remain intact, spinning and drifting for
months and traveling hundreds of miles, could be mobile ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   The Juan de Fuca Ridge which runs right below Axial has garnered
a lot of scientific interest because it runs roughly parallel to
the northwest coast of the United States only 300 miles offshore.
Axial lies on top of a segment midway along the ridge. In 1986 a
research vessel carrying Ed Baker and his colleagues lay above a
southern segment called Cleft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to map the ridge to see where vent fields were
likely to be,'' Baker says. ``We were doing something called a
towyo, where you tow instruments behind the ship and send them up
and down at the same time. This lets you sample the water at
different depths. All of a sudden, we started getting a bunch of
plumelike signals up here'' _ the oceanographer raises his hands,
indicating a point high above the seafloor _ ``in an area where
there shouldn't have been any plumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a while to realize these were plumes ... but
instead of plumes rising 200 meters above the seafloor, we had
plumes 1,000 meters above it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker began to visit other eruption sites at various segments of
the Juan de Fuca Ridge and saw megaplumes at all of them. ``The
plumes are pretty distinctive,'' he says. ``They've got a definite
top and bottom. Their temperature and salt content are different
from the surrounding water. They're warmer, and they're more fresh.
In part that explains why they rise so high _ hot fluids are more
buoyant than cooler ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat is a reason megaplumes maintain their shape. Baker
describes the plumes as similar to underwater hurricanes. Their
shape and movement result from a devilishly complex interaction
between the rising plume and the sideways rotation of the planet.
Viewed from the side, Baker says, a megaplume might initially look
like a huge twirling mushroom but eventually it takes on the form
of a giant Frisbee.
</P>
<P>
   Baker has been trying to figure out how megaplumes form and
where they go. To find out the answers to these questions, Baker's
colleague Bob Embley is laying the groundwork for an observatory at
Axial that will be put in place early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   He envisions a network of sensors and cameras on the seafloor,
transmitting data to buoys near the surface, which in turn bounce
the signals off satellites to Baker's office in Seattle. This New
Millennium Observatory (NeMO, for short) will also employ an
autonomous submarine at a permanent mooring on the site so that a
scientist, after hearing the rumbles of an upcoming eruption, can
tell it to ``please do survey number 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Baker says, with the memory of 10 horrible days at sea
still fresh in his mind, ''I could dial up the results on the Web
from the comfort of my home.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: IS THE SEAFLOOR LIKE A HOT PLATE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How does a megaplume get started? What prompts such a massive
explosion of hot water in such a short time? No one knows for
certain, but two competing views have gained ground.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Baker believes in the sponge theory, envisoning a magma dike
shooting up from below, squeezing a massive amount of fluid out the
top of the loose seafloor.
</P>
<P>
   While Pacifc Marine Environmental Laboratory chemist David
Butterfield envisions megaplumes formed by the geologic hot-plate
theory. ``It's not hard to imagine a magma dike breaching the
seafloor and laying out 1200-degree lava over half a square mile.
That would expose a lot of seawater to heat, but only once. The
water would be warmed as it passed over the molten rock _ like a
pot of water on a hot plate _ and start to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker doesn't buy it. ``These guys envision the megaplumes
forming in a week or so. I think they happen in a much shorter
time, days or hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent voyages to Axial were supposed to test both theories.
however, the researchers found few clues, and the debate still
rages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like being a chemist in a lab where you can say,
'Okay, I want to do this kind of experiment to prove my theory.'
We're sort of at the mercy of Mother Nature here,'' Baker says.

<P>
   Little more than a year ago, on the night of Feb. 9, the
170-foot research ship Wecoma headed west from the Oregon coast
into darkening rough seas. Within hours, the ship was making its
way into a gale. By the next day 45-knot winds were jacking waves
up to heights of 30 feet. Oceanographer Ed Baker remembers Feb. 14
as the worst night of all. Waves crashed over the deck and the wind
would suddenly change direction without warning. The Wecoma pitched
and bucked violently.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the storm, Baker, a researcher at the Pacific Marine
Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, and his colleagues were
determined to launch a half-ton deepwater probe into the Pacific to
collect evidence of a newly discovered side effect of giant
underwater twisters of hot water, called megaplumes.
</P>
<P>
   The night of the 14th was memorable not only because the seas
were so rough but also because the researchers had to deploy an
acoustic beacon the size of a telephone pole. Baker remembers, ``It
went off without a hitch, but that was probably the scariest part
of the trip.'' Several days later, everyone was relieved when the
beacon began broadcasting data.
</P>
<P>
   The voyage took 10 days but when the Wecoma docked in Oregon,
Baker was happy because the data he and his colleagues had
collected painted a picture of a far more violent spectacle on the
seafloor than the scientists had experienced in the storm on the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   The first rumblings of that unseen spectacle had begun weeks
earlier, on Jan. 25. A network of sensitive hydrophones in the
North Pacific, deployed by the U.S. Navy to listen for Soviet
submarines, picked up a swarm of earthquakes at the summit of an
undersea volcano called Axial. The quakes shook loose the rock that
had stopped up the volcano's plumbing. Through the newly cleared
rocky pipes came an inferno of molten rock and boiling water driven
upward by the intense pressures and temperatures of the inner Earth
miles below.

<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Most energy in the United States comes from solar,
nuclear and hydroelectric generation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Seventy percent of our electricity is produced by
burning coal and other fossil fuels _ sources linked to global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Plastic six-pack rings do not break down in the
environment and can trap marine animals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  The rings are designed to disintegrate in sunlight, but
the process can take 10 years. Therefore, the rings should be
snipped, recycled or avoided altogether. Surveys have shown that
the rings can strangle birds and fish, but the worst culprit is
abandoned plastic fishing line responsible for 37 percent of marine
entanglements.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Destruction of tropical rain forests will cause Earth's
atmosphere to run out of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Oxygen makes up almost 21 percent of atmospheric gases.
Burning all the tropical forests in the world would decrease the
proportion of oxygen by four-hundredths of one percent. Destruction
of tropical rain forests, however, would significantly increase the
concentration of carbon dioxide _ the most important greenhouse gas
_ in the atmosphere by 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Household and industrial chemicals are routinely tested
and approved for safe use by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Federal officials do not test pesticides or household
products for safety. They rely on producers to do so.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  The solar-energy market has plateaued.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Worldwide sales of solar cells increased 11 percent a
year from 1990 to 1996, then jumped by 43 percent in 1997 and by
another 28 percent in 1998. Sales of coal and oil have grown by
slightly more than one percent a year since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants _ which will
remain radioactive for millions of years _ are safely stored in a
deep underground facility in the West.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  No such long-term storage facility exists. All fuel rods
are stored temporarily at the nation's 103 active nuclear plants.
Another 12 plants have been shut down, but the spent rods are still
stored at the plants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Most oil pollution comes from tankers that run aground
or ships that wash out their holds at sea.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  More than twice as much oil gets into the environment
each year because of sloppy activities involving automobiles and
boats. At least 200 million gallons of oil are dumped each year in
the U.S. by people who change their own automobile engine oil.
Overfilling auto gas tanks also contributes to the mess, as do
spills when refilling outboard-motor tanks. However, tens of
thousands of leaky auto engines whizzing over already polluted
urban environments can't compare with the damage done to a pristine
environment by a single oil tanker such as the Exxon Valdez, which
spilled 10 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound in
Alaska in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Aerosol spray cans are the leading source of
ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  CFCs were banned from aerosol cans in 1978. They are
still found, however, in many air conditioners and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Government agencies test bottled water for safety and
purity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT &LR; : Bottled water is not tested by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MYTH: &LR;  Our national forests are protected from logging, mining
and drilling for oil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACT: &LR;  Fifty-two percent of national forests are logged, mined
and crisscrossed by more than 373,000 miles of roads, enough to
circle Earth 14 times. Just 18 percent of national forest land is
permanently protected wilderness, and much of that is thin soil
over rock where trees rarely grow.

   Little more than a year ago, on the night of Feb. 9, the
170-foot research ship Wecoma headed west from the Oregon coast
into darkening rough seas. Within hours, the ship was making its
way into a gale. By the next day 45-knot winds were jacking waves
up to heights of 30 feet. Oceanographer Ed Baker remembers Feb. 14
as the worst night of all. Waves crashed over the deck and the wind
would suddenly change direction without warning. The Wecoma pitched
and bucked violently.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the storm, Baker, a researcher at the Pacific Marine
Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, and his colleagues were
determined to launch a half-ton deepwater probe into the Pacific to
collect evidence of a newly discovered side effect of giant
underwater twisters of hot water, called megaplumes.
</P>
<P>
   The night of the 14th was memorable not only because the seas
were so rough but also because the researchers had to deploy an
acoustic beacon the size of a telephone pole. Baker remembers, ``It
went off without a hitch, but that was probably the scariest part
of the trip.'' Several days later, everyone was relieved when the
beacon began broadcasting data.
</P>
<P>
   The voyage took 10 days but when the Wecoma docked in Oregon,
Baker was happy because the data he and his colleagues had
collected painted a picture of a far more violent spectacle on the
seafloor than the scientists had experienced in the storm on the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   The first rumblings of that unseen spectacle had begun weeks
earlier, on Jan. 25. A network of sensitive hydrophones in the
North Pacific, deployed by the U.S. Navy to listen for Soviet
submarines, picked up a swarm of earthquakes at the summit of an
undersea volcano called Axial. The quakes shook loose the rock that
had stopped up the volcano's plumbing. Through the newly cleared
rocky pipes came an inferno of molten rock and boiling water driven
upward by the intense pressures and temperatures of the inner Earth
miles below.
</P>
<P>
   A typical volcano on land, such as Mount St. Helens, fills the
sky with a plume of ash when it erupts. But Axial belched forth an
equally massive eruption of superhot water. That was followed by
streams of lava, some as deep as six feet, flowing down the sides
of the volcano. Along Axial's flanks, fields of geysers suddenly
pierced the ocean bottom, shooting up superheated jets of water
darkened with heavy concentrations of minerals from Earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimated, roughly, that there were 10 gigawatts of energy
coming out of the volcano's caldera,'' Baker says. ``By comparison,
Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River puts out about one gigawatt,
and that can provide energy for three million homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip on the Wecoma was launched to find out what happens
when all that energy breaks loose. The instruments dropped by Baker
and his fellow oceanographers measured water temperature, current
flow and the chemicals released during the eruption.
</P>
<P>
   Baker was particularly interested in learning more about
megaplumes which can soar more than several thousand feet off the
ocean floor and spin like slow but gargantuan tornadoes. They can
be 12 miles across and travel hundreds of miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bomblike event,'' says Baker, who was among a group of
oceanographers who discovered the phenomenon in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The plumes have attracted interest for three reasons. First,
they're new. Second, megaplumes stir up huge amounts of ocean,
carrying minerals and gases and heat almost to the sea's surface.
As they rise from the ocean's depths, megaplumes may bring energy
and food to animals in shallow water. Third, megaplumes move great
distances horizontally, too. In their travels, they may have helped
some of the oddest and oldest beasts in the world colonize the
planet. Megaplumes, which remain intact, spinning and drifting for
months and traveling hundreds of miles, could be mobile ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   The Juan de Fuca Ridge which runs right below Axial has garnered
a lot of scientific interest because it runs roughly parallel to
the northwest coast of the United States only 300 miles offshore.
Axial lies on top of a segment midway along the ridge. In 1986 a
research vessel carrying Ed Baker and his colleagues lay above a
southern segment called Cleft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to map the ridge to see where vent fields were
likely to be,'' Baker says. ``We were doing something called a
towyo, where you tow instruments behind the ship and send them up
and down at the same time. This lets you sample the water at
different depths. All of a sudden, we started getting a bunch of
plumelike signals up here'' _ the oceanographer raises his hands,
indicating a point high above the seafloor _ ``in an area where
there shouldn't have been any plumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a while to realize these were plumes ... but
instead of plumes rising 200 meters above the seafloor, we had
plumes 1,000 meters above it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker began to visit other eruption sites at various segments of
the Juan de Fuca Ridge and saw megaplumes at all of them. ``The
plumes are pretty distinctive,'' he says. ``They've got a definite
top and bottom. Their temperature and salt content are different
from the surrounding water. They're warmer, and they're more fresh.
In part that explains why they rise so high _ hot fluids are more
buoyant than cooler ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat is a reason megaplumes maintain their shape. Baker
describes the plumes as similar to underwater hurricanes. Their
shape and movement result from a devilishly complex interaction
between the rising plume and the sideways rotation of the planet.
Viewed from the side, Baker says, a megaplume might initially look
like a huge twirling mushroom but eventually it takes on the form
of a giant Frisbee.
</P>
<P>
   Baker has been trying to figure out how megaplumes form and
where they go. To find out the answers to these questions, Baker's
colleague Bob Embley is laying the groundwork for an observatory at
Axial that will be put in place early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   He envisions a network of sensors and cameras on the seafloor,
transmitting data to buoys near the surface, which in turn bounce
the signals off satellites to Baker's office in Seattle. This New
Millennium Observatory (NeMO, for short) will also employ an
autonomous submarine at a permanent mooring on the site so that a
scientist, after hearing the rumbles of an upcoming eruption, can
tell it to ``please do survey number 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Baker says, with the memory of 10 horrible days at sea
still fresh in his mind, ''I could dial up the results on the Web
from the comfort of my home.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: IS THE SEAFLOOR LIKE A HOT PLATE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How does a megaplume get started? What prompts such a massive
explosion of hot water in such a short time? No one knows for
certain, but two competing views have gained ground.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Baker believes in the sponge theory, envisoning a magma dike
shooting up from below, squeezing a massive amount of fluid out the
top of the loose seafloor.
</P>
<P>
   While Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory chemist David
Butterfield envisions megaplumes formed by the geologic hot-plate
theory. ``It's not hard to imagine a magma dike breaching the
seafloor and laying out 1200-degree lava over half a square mile.
That would expose a lot of seawater to heat, but only once. The
water would be warmed as it passed over the molten rock _ like a
pot of water on a hot plate _ and start to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker doesn't buy it. ``These guys envision the megaplumes
forming in a week or so. I think they happen in a much shorter
time, days or hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent voyages to Axial were supposed to test both theories.
however, the researchers found few clues, and the debate still
rages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like being a chemist in a lab where you can say,
'Okay, I want to do this kind of experiment to prove my theory.'
We're sort of at the mercy of Mother Nature here,'' Baker says.

TUITION HIKE SPARKS FIGHT OVER MEXICO UNIVERSITY'S MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Instead of sitting in class last week at the
National Autonomous University, Salvador Gomez Carrillo and Mario
Rivera were in each other's faces.
</P>
<P>
   The two undergraduates have been friends since they began
attending college here in 1997. Now, however, they find themselves
on opposite sides of an explosive issue that has paralyzed the
hemisphere's largest university. For the first time in 50 years,
Mexico's top public institution of higher education is raising its
full-time tuition _ from 20 cents a semester to $120.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't abandon poor families,'' Gomez shouted at Rivera
in a confrontation in front of the administration building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hurt everyone with a weaker university,'' Rivera yelled
back.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the price hike has grown so intense that
the sprawling university, known as UNAM, was shut down last week by
thousands of protesting students, who declared a strike and blocked
access to 30 of the school's 34 departments.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign perhaps of the changing attitudes among Mexican
youths, an equally large number of students have voiced their
support for the higher tuition and have called for an end to the
strike so that they can get back to their studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that higher tuition means better resources for us and
our university,'' said Elizabeth Oliver, a 21-year-old psychology
student. ``Times are different now, and we can't expect that our
education should be free.''
</P>
<P>
   UNAM administrators say the price hike is necessary to make up
for cuts this year in government funding. As much as 90 percent of
UNAM's annual budget comes from the federal government, which has
also scaled back on subsidy programs for consumer products like
tortillas and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the tuition increase will squeeze out the poorest
students, and they blame everyone from university president
Francisco Barnes de Castro, who initially proposed it, to the World
Bank, which has urged many Latin American countries to make
universities less dependent on government funding.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents argue that the proposal violates Mexico's
Constitution, which says public schools are supposed to provide
``free'' education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm against the tuition because it's being imposed without any
dialogue,'' said Omar Suarez, a 21-year-old architecture student.
</P>
<P>
   None of the country's other public colleges are free. And when
compared to Mexico's private universities, which on average charge
about $2,000 a semester, UNAM is still a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1940s, '50s, and '60s, the university was Mexico's
foremost training ground for its political, business, and cultural
leaders. But it has lost much of that luster in recent years as
private institutions have grown in prestige and because more elite
students have chosen to study in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Its enrollment of 270,000 makes it nearly five times larger than
the largest US campus, and its home on the southern edge of the
capital is a city within a city, spread over 4 miles.
</P>
<P>
   UNAM offers a wide range of academic programs, from a
high-school-level college prep curriculum to doctoral studies and
schools in law, medicine, and business.
</P>
<P>
   It has often been a hotbed for political and social revolts. In
1966, students protested proposed enrollment restrictions by taking
the rector, or university president, hostage. Two years later,
shortly before the Olympic Games opened in Mexico City, militant
students staged protests that resulted in the massacre of hundreds
of students.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, during a previous attempt to raise tuition, hundreds of
thousands of protesters choked traffic by filling the city's main
avenues up to the government square known as the Zocalo.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the price hike this year isn't unanimous. One
reason may be because the higher tuition will apply only to next
year's arriving class, not to any current students. Those who
cannot afford the higher tuition, Barnes said, will be given
exemptions or scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to disarm your opponents is by taking away their
potential recruits,'' said one administrator at the private Colegio
de Mexico. ``Once they realized that they wouldn't have to pay,
many students would rather get back to class and finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason may be politics. With presidential elections
about a year away, insiders say Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which is facing serious challenges to its
70-year grip on the presidency, is doing all it can to squash the
protest by helping organize students against the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barnes and his supporters have accused the leftist
opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution of stoking the
disruptions by backing the protesters _ a claim that party leaders
deny.
</P>
<P>
   Still another reason the tuition hike may happen this time has
much to do with the university's image.
</P>
<P>
   Although UNAM remains the country's most influential university,
it no longer has a monopoly on producing the best students. Many
employers say their first preference is for a graduate from one of
the private universities. Some newspaper help-wanted ads have been
known to specifically state that ``UNAM graduates need not apply.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a feeling that you can have more confidence in the
work of a private school graduate than in someone from UNAM,'' said
Carla Avila de Jesus, a department store personnel manager, who
added that raising the tuition may help erase UNAM's reputation as
the ``inexpensive'' university.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``Raising the tuition is one thing. Raising the
quality of students is another. I think that's what everyone should
be arguing about.''

BARD'S HOMETOWN IS LOOKING GOOD

   STRATFORD-UPON-AVON, England _ Who's Shakespeare?
</P>
<P>
   The guy with the hots for Gwyneth Paltrow is one current answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A local boy who made good drama,'' says Ronnie Schwartz, a
visitor completing a sentimental journey from Chicago to see the
Bard's hood for herself.
</P>
<P>
   My Uncle Studley defines him as ``a man who had words for every
situation. He anticipated Red Sox fans with `What fools these
mortals be!' And often evicted his dog from the house with, `Out,
damned Spot!' Centuries ago he gave loan sharks their present day
name: Shylocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Stratford, a town of 25,000 beside the gentle River Avon where
swans swim and tourists swoop and swoon at the thought of walking
streets and floorboards trod by himself, Will Shakespeare, the
timeless scribbler.
</P>
<P>
   Though such as Pizza Hut and McDonald's (hardly food for
thought) have intruded, Shakespeare's old hometown of half-timbered
residences and public buildings has held up almost as well as his
works. Yorick _ the ``Alas, poor Yorick'' court jester _ holds up
even better than the original. Bigger than death as a frolicking
bronze figure near the bus depot, the Y Man has had his role
fleshed out by a sculptor from the graveyard cameo, a skull in
Hamlet's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Since Shakespeare Meets Oscar (as well as Paltrow) is one of the
year's catchy stories, the tourist trade, already a healthy
four-cottage industry, soars higher. The four: those of his wife,
the former Anne Hathaway, in Shottery, and his mother, Mary Arden,
in Wilmcote (both close by); and in Stratford, his birthplace, and
the home of son-in-law and daughter, Dr. John and Susanna Hall.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy just about anything bearing a Shakespearean logo _
yes, even your own Shakespeare-model quill pen with which to
scratch out a sonnet to your love. Or a re-write of the Katherina
of Padua story as ``The Blaming of the Shrews,'' co-starring Linda
Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was a big day hereabouts, April 23, the date of the
Bard's 1564 birth and 1616 death. Naturally some of us softly
hummed, ``Happy birthday to you . . . .'' beside his tomb within
Holy Trinity Church. There his effigy smiles down on those willing
to pay a buck to approach the hallowed spot.
</P>
<P>
   The second floor room of his birth, papered in a cheery floral
pattern, said to be a replica, is crowded with those who may feel
that they are positioned to breathe in literary inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``My post cards will be better composed after this,'' believes
Ronnie Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, ``Fondly wishest thou wert here''? How about, ``Wherefore
art I? In the bosom of the Bard.''
</P>
<P>
   The American writer Washington Irving was not impressed during
his visit in 1815, calling the parental residence of John and Mary
Shakespeare ``a poor house made of sticks and mud.'' But Keats and
Byron were enthralled, signing their names on the ceiling (since
whitewashed over), and other writers etched names, yet visible, on
the window pane. Glorious graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Actually papa John was a man of some means, indicated by the
good stone floors and high ceilings downstairs. He'd come up in the
world after marrying Mary Arden, heiress daughter of a prosperous
farmer on whose land he humbly worked. A Mrs. Court, a butcher's
wife, occupied the Henley Street property between 1806 and 1846,
and showed select visitors around, expecting a monetary
remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, fortunately, the preservation-minded Shakespeare
Trust took over the landmarks. However, not before the Bard's own
residence of later life, New House, was torn down by the owner, a
resentful Rev. Gastrell, who tired of sightseers calling on him,
and didn't have Mrs. Court's knack for making history pay. All that
remains on the corner lot is the attractive flower garden.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most interesting location is the Wilmcote farm of
Robert Arden, where the Bard's mother, Mary, was reared and lived
until she married his father in 1557. It is still a working farm
with longhorn cattle, very hairy Cotswold sheep, a well-inhabited
dovecote and falcons and owls that are trained to hunt by Danielle
Shearsby.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a desirable homestead in its day, the farm, with
stone and half-timbered buildings, endured so well that it was
lived in until about 30 years ago. Its leading asset may be a guide
named Julia Bruce, a source of all sorts of everyday information of
Shakespearean times. While ``Shakespeare in Love'' is a colorful,
romantic film, be grateful that it wasn't accompanied by the odors
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bathed once a year, and never washed their hair,'' says
Bruce, ``although Queen Elizabeth I (currently alias Judi Dench and
Kate Blanchett) was scandalous because she took a bath every month.
June became the marital month because it was mild enough for the
annual bath, and the bride took hers before the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fleas were a problem. Beneath their gowns women might keep a
piece of meat, a small dog or a piglet in an armpit to draw off the
fleas from elsewhere. Spring cleaning meant throwing out the
threshings that covered the floor and by then were covered with all
sorts of garbage and droppings, animal and human. At least the
trash was hard to see because the rooms were smoky from fireplaces,
and the horn windows didn't let in much light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thatched roofs were the haven for all sorts of creatures.
Canopy beds helped keep them off, but it was best to sleep with
your mouth closed, or on your belly. When people traveled they took
their own mattresses. Better the creatures you knew. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   She says, ``The people drank a lot of ale, getting 40 percent of
their nourishment from malt and barley. Even the children, who
drank eight pints a day.'' High times at high school? ``Not exactly
mother's milk, but, well, it was a source of vitamin B.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Robert Arden's chair beside the fireplace. The husband
had the only good chair, with arms _ thus, the chairman. As
chairman of the board, he sat at the head of the table. Over here
is the spooning bench. Shakespeare would have sat on a similar one
while courting Anne Hathaway. To keep a suitor's hands busy he was
given a piece of wood and told to carve a spoon. Thus, spooning.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Will didn't carve enough. His and Anne's first child,
Susanna, was born six months after their marriage. Twins Hamnet and
Judith came two years later, and soon Shakespeare was off to London
to pursue fame, fortune and Gwyneth Paltrow et al.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' says Bruce, ``He sent money home to take care of Anne
and the kids. He wasn't a deadbeat dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. Our hero, Will, didn't want love's labor lost.

SAN FRANCISCO DOWNSIZES ITS MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Does it seem to you that Mayor Brown is
getting smaller?''
</P>
<P>
   A friend who works at City Hall asked me that question last
week. He meant smaller physically, as well as pettier in his
private dealings and less noisy in his public appearances. I had to
agree that Willie Brown, the mayor of San Francisco, seems to be
disappearing inside his $3,000 suits.
</P>
<P>
   When I saw Brown at a press conference last week he wasn't his
ebullient, jocular, vicious self. With all the verve of former
Mayor Frank Jordan in his wet period, Brown talked about his
traffic program, elegantly called ``Unclog 2.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what all that vision has come to, signs saying ``No
double parking.'' Even if you're emperor of the city, at some point
you have to get down to the nitty-gritty and roll up the sleeves on
your lack of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad it's about three years too late.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall regulars say Brown seems depressed, as well he should,
with recent polls showing only 28 percent of San Francisco voters
would re-elect him mayor come the November election.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Brown about as popular as the city's mass transit
system, Muni. Coincidence? Even I felt sorry for the incredibly
shrinking larger-than-life mayor.
</P>
<P>
   After the press conference he made none of his usual jokes or
jibes at reporters. A handler hustled him away from the microphones
and notebooks. The idea of Brown being handled is depressing all on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   Brown managed to stop to tell one innocuous story about Ronald
Reagan's trick for giving a speech, using contact lenses with
different prescriptions so he could look at the audience while
reading the TelePrompTer.
</P>
<P>
   I guess that's the visual equivalent of how Brown can talk out
of both sides of his mouth at the same time. But the point of the
story seemed to be ``Reagan and I, we used to be like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an interesting story _ if it was true that Reagan could
zoom in and out of focus and give a speech at the same time. But I
walked away thinking better of Reagan, and worse for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost as if his glory days were behind him, despite the
half-million taxpayer bucks in gold leaf on the City Hall dome
above him.
</P>
<P>
   But he has brought his smallness in the polls on himself, so I
don't feel that sorry for him.
</P>
<P>
   Count the ways Brown has diminished his chances in the next
election:
</P>
<P>
   _ Brown gets all over town for functions and parties, but the
ones he likes best are with the celebrities and socialites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite his wit, there's only so much you want to read about
him in the social pages if you're one of those whose rents have
been blown sky-high by the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The economic boom that Brown, like President Clinton, takes
credit for has been wonderful for Brown's lobbyist and developer
friends.
</P>
<P>
   _ The face of the city has changed as if at the hand of a
fly-by-night plastic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   _ High-rise buildings have sprouted South of Market. Overpriced
plywood ``live-work'' spaces, the slums of tomorrow, have been
thrown up by a loftwaffe of Brown's builder pals.
</P>
<P>
   The development boom comes at the cost of the destruction of
small businesses and light industry and the loss of thousands of
parking spaces. And Muni is as bad as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Forget being a transit-first city. This is a shoe leather-first
city.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, a smart young amateur ran Muni, qualifying for
the job by having been a Brown aide. As mayor, Brown has always
chosen loyalty over expertise, appointing a variety of hack
loyalists, inexperienced kids and ex-girlfriends (I mean
non-ex-girlfriends) to high-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has dared to disagree with Brown has been fired.
Anyone who has been loyal but a screw-up has been transferred to
another job to screw up.
</P>
<P>
   With the election around the corner, Brown finally appointed a
professional rapid-transit man to run Muni. Timing is everything in
transit and politics, and the appointment of a pro was even later
than the average bus.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is becoming a theme park of attractions _ cafes,
restaurants, the Museum of Modern Art, the new ballpark. The
problem is, you can't get there from here, or from anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   We're developing a new underclass besides the homeless _ the
limoless. Like the homeless, the limoless aren't Brown's sort of
people. They're the middle class. They can't get to their jobs that
don't pay enough from their homes they can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   Even liberals have tired of the so-called liberal mayor who
hangs out with Pacific Heights Republicans. ``Run, Tom, Run''
buttons have appeared all over town urging Tom Ammiano, the
president of the Board of Supervisors, to run for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is scared to death of having the gay, progressive Ammiano
jump into the race against him with the somewhat more conservative
Clint Reilly. So Brown is working hard at looking like a mayor
instead of an emperor. Unfortunately, that makes him look smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The emperor has no clothes, and now they don't fit.

ATTRIBUTIVE, THY NAME IS WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `In the military, they have `mission creep,' wrote Nat Hefferman
in a recent e-mail. ``In English, we seem to have `usage creep,'
when a word gradually changes its part of speech, e.g. from noun to
adjective.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed we do _ in fact, ``mission creep'' is standard operating
procedure for the English lexicon, though some changes meet more
vigorous resistance than others. The one troubling Hefferman at the
moment is the use of woman as an adjective _ woman doctor, woman
driver _ when female would serve the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Grammatically speaking, woman driver is no more unusual than
chicken farm or business strategy. The first element in each
combination is a noun used ``attributively'' _ in front of another
noun, modifying it as an adjective would. But woman, chicken, and
business haven't turned into adjectives: They can't be used
``predicatively,'' as an adjective could be. The woman is tall, the
farm is huge, the strategy is idiotic all work in English, but not
the woman is driver, the farm is chicken, the strategy is business.
</P>
<P>
   Such modifiers, says language expert David Crystal, ``are no
longer strictly nouns, because (for example) they have lost their
ability to pluralize: we cannot say the gardens party. On the other
hand, they are not strictly adjectives either, because (for
example) the cannot compare: we cannot say the gardenest party.''
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, a fundamental part of the language.
Grammarians make some fine distinctions among such compounds, but
in one form or another they go back to the beginnings of English.
We find woman frend (spelled that way) in 1300, woman politicians
in 1659, and woman-journalist in 1902 (in a quotation that calls
her ``the most loyal, earnest and teachable person under the sun.''
My, how she has changed).
</P>
<P>
   Mission creep has crept even further in the case of an
expression reader Joel Wechsler finds annoying: so fun!, as in
``The party was . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Fun, like many nouns used attributively, moved gradually into
its new role. Originally spelled fon, it was both verb (meaning to
fool someone) and noun (meaning a hoax or joke) for centuries. But
the OED notes the appearance of a fun-room _ the rec room of the
19th century _ in an 1846 citation. With 1959 comes fun person, and
now we can not only have fun, we can be fun. (And fun furs are on
the way.)
</P>
<P>
   Fun as an adjective is still labeled colloquial in my
dictionary, but most people saying the party was fun would call
that fun an adjective, and few would object to it. But if it's now
an adjective, can't we say it was so fun, just as we would say it
was so exciting or so deadly? (All these are elliptical statements,
but no less acceptable for that.) The ``standard'' English today
would be such fun or so much fun, retaining the noun-ness of fun,
and perhaps these versions will prevail. Or maybe so fun will be
less fun when it no longer irritates the grown-ups, and it will go
quietly off to the land of retired slang. Meanwhile, I wouldn't get
majorly upset over it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Were-wolves at the door
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week's item on was and were skipped one variety of
subjunctivitis that troubles several readers. ``In reporting the
direct quote `Are you happy with your run production?' it is
correct to write `He was asked if he was happy with his run
production,' '' writes David Sears. Often, Sears says, the indirect
quotation emerges as ``He was asked if he were happy with his run
production.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently that little if triggers a subjunctive reflex in some
writers. But if doesn't necessarily signal a counterfactual
situation. If I were you is subjunctive, but If I was unfair, I
apologize is not; the if clause is stating the premise on which the
apology depends, not expressing doubt about it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the degree of counterfactuality in a statement
can be hard to determine. ``Even if Naipaul were wrong about all
the many things Theroux suddenly discovered . . .'' wrote a
National Review critic, for instance. I would say ``Even if he
was'' _ just as I'd say ``Whether or not he was'' _ but the writer
may think Naipaul wasn't wrong, and hear his clause as contrary to
fact. In that case, I'd prefer ``if Naipaul had been wrong _ making
it clearly counterfactual. The moral is, Beware of were:You might
be better off with less of it.

`HOME MOVIES' IS THE LATEST IN THE NIGHTTIME TOON BOOM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
HOME MOVIES 
Starring the voices of: Paula Poundstone, Brendon Small, H. Jon
Benjamin  
On: UPN. The series begins its regular Monday at 8:30 timeslot
beginning next week.  
Rating: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nighttime toon boom continues Tuesday night with the
premiere of ``Home Movies,'' an animated sitcom from the producers
of Comedy Central's ``Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist.'' Each of
the new adult cartoons has its identifying mark _ ``Futurama'' is
from ``Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening, ``Dilbert'' is based on
the popular comic strip, ``The PJs'' is Eddie Murphy's
controversial vehicle _ and ``Home Movies'' is the one known for
featuring the voice of comedian Paula Poundstone. It's also the one
in Squigglevision, the minimalist animated style that seems to
quiver with anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The promising main characters in ``Home Movies'' are Paula
Small, a clueless single mother in suburbia, and her amusing
8-year-old son Brendon, who is more psychologically sophisticated
than the adults around him. Brendon tends toward modern weariness,
and when the world is too much with him, he regresses and plays in
a sandbox ``to reflect on things.'' His favorite creative outlet is
making films on videotape, and ``Home Movies'' features a few of
his sloppy productions in each episode. With their half-formed
plots about cops and prisons and bombs, these small gems give voice
to Brendon's chaotic subconscious feelings while they send up the
baser cliches of pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   The show's mordant humor is appealing. It avoids the
over-the-top crudeness of ``Family Guy,'' another new animated
domestic sitcom, as it takes aim at the more Freudian foibles of
human behavior. The vocal rhythms recall the detached, self-aware,
and almost hypnotic rhythms that distinguish the wonderful ``Dr.
Katz.'' (H. Jon Benjamin, who gives voice to Jason and Coach
McGuirk, also plays Dr. Katz's son, Ben.) But let's hope the
writers find some original situations in which to showcase their
sensibility and their characters. In Tuesday night's episode,
Brendon goes into an Oedipal funk when he finds out that his mother
is dating his soccer coach, a vain lunkhead with brand-name tattoos
all over his body. Mom-on-a-date is a tired plot line, and it only
leads to predictable bits about Brendon trying to scare his
competition by calling him ``Dad'' and Paula withstanding a boring
dinner. Surely the Smalls would thrive in stranger places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Movies'' airs at 8:30 p.m. Next week, the show moves to
its regular time slot of Mondays at 8:30, after ``Dilbert.''

FLYING THE (AIRPORT) COOP

<TEXT>
<P>
   Few things are as dull as hanging around an airport, especially
when there is an unexpected layover and you have hours to kill.
Even at airports that have upgraded their shops and restaurants,
there is a certain sameness to it all. Fortunately, several
airports are just a few minutes from stellar attractions. For
instance: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --From Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, the public transportation
system can whisk you to a tour of the new Turner Field in just 25
minutes. Or in 20 minutes you can visit the birthplace of Margaret
Mitchell, author of that smoldering classic ``Gone With the
Wind.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --From Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix, a 15-minute taxi ride will
get you the Heard Museum, with its extensive collection of Native
American artifacts and fine art. Or in 10 minutes you can go to the
Desert Botanical Garden, featuring 20,000 varieties of desert
foliage. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --From Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, the Grapevine Mills mall is
just five minutes away via a $9 ride by SuperShuttle. And what a
mall it is, with more than 200 stores and a variety of dining and
entertainment. Or a complimentary shuttle can take you in five
minutes from the airport to the Hyatt Bear Creek Golf and Racquet
Club, where you can play a few holes or prctice your swing on the
driving range. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --From O'Hare Airport in Chicago, a 20-minute taxi ride takes
you to the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio, with its
barrel-vaulted playroom and two-story drafting room. Or fitness
buffs can work out at the Hilton Athletic Club in the O'Hare
Hilton, adjacent to the airport. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Let's not forget Boston, with the New England Aquarium just an
eight-minute boat shuttle or 15-minute subway ride or from Logan
Airport. Or Cleveland, where the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a
20-minute rail ride from Hopkins Airport. Or Las Vegas, where the
pleasure palaces are a 5- to 10-minute taxi or shuttle ride from
McCarran Airport (which has its own slot machines). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You see, there really are other things to do besides staring
transfixed at those souvenir T-shirts in the airport gift shop. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``America is a vast conspiracy to make you happy.'' _
John Updike. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel bookshelf: ``Travelers' Tales Guide: America!'' (Setterberg,
$19.95) tells the comic, dramatic, and nostalgic stories of
travelers who have walked, paddled, driven, flown, sailed,
galloped, hitchhiked, and otherwise explored parts of this amazing
nation. Topics range from Josewph Lamb's ``Peoria Baseball'' to
Dave Barry's hilarious ``The Walt `You Will Have Fun' Disney
World.'' Other authors include E. Annie Proulx, Calvin Trillin, Jan
Morris, and James Fallows. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Grander Canyon: Idaho's Hell's Canyon surpasses the Grand Canyon's
deepest drop of 5,700 feet by 2,200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The poetry of art: ``Georgia O'Keefe: the Poetry of Things'' is
a special exhibition at the Phillips Collection in Washington,
D.C., through July 18. The exhibit, says curator Elizabeth Hutton
Turner, ``invites a closer look at O'Keefe's aesthetic and a new
way of looking at objects by placing her work in proximity to real
objects of the type she collected.'' In all, there will be 69
works. The museum is at 1600 21st St, NW; telephone 202-387-2151. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of Washington: Capitol Reservations at 800-VISIT-DC or
www.visitdc.com is a no-charge booking service, and available
discounts vary. But when we tried the service last fall, we were
able to book a moderately priced room at a lower rate than appeared
to be available elsewhere. Even the desk clerk was impressed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Highs and lows: The highest point in Pennsylvania is lower than the
lowest point in Colorado. &QL;

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Once the threat of computer viruses caused panic among
technical specialists and yawns among the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Now the responses are reversed. Far-reaching computer networks
make it easier than ever for harmful programs to wipe out data. But
even as computer users become more fearful, defenses against
electronic epidemics have improved to the point where antivirus
technicians sound like doctors giving routine advice for reducing
the risk of catching a sexually transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're practicing safe computing you should be OK,'' said
Raul Elnitiarta, an engineer at Symantec Corp. in Santa Monica,
Calif., which makes programs to detect and disable troublesome
code.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't take precautions run the risk of losing days or
weeks worth of work _ as computer users around the world, including
more than 100 Boston College students, discovered Monday, when the
virus known as Chernobyl struck their hard drives. The virus is so
named because it was set to activate itself on the anniversary of
the Russian nuclear disaster 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thought to have been created in the Far East, the Chernobyl
virus is often embedded in other programs downloadable from the
Internet. It strikes at computers running the 1995 and 1998
versions of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system, overwriting
the first 2,048 sectors of hard drives with gibberish and causing
the computer to think the rest of the drive is empty of data.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists have known of the virus for more than a year, and
after arming themselves with the latest software, most businesses
and large institutions reported few problems Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon just seven sites across the country,
representing about 30 computer users, had made formal notifications
they were affected, said Bill Pollak, spokesman for the Computer
Emergency Response Team.
</P>
<P>
   The group, part of a federally funded institute, is located at
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ``We're not hearing
anything that would indicate it was big in the US,'' Pollak said.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, an estimated 100,000 computer users in the United
States were affected by the so-called Melissa virus that spread
over the Internet last month. The Melissa virus caused more
widespread damage because it was distributed via commonly used
e-mail programs; Chernobyl, by contrast, infected only users who
had downloaded certain executable programs to their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   But woe befell plenty of people who weren't running electronic
countermeasures _ particularly local college students, who often
obtain free copies of pirated software from the Internet rather
than pay retail prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely ridiculous,'' said Patrick Morrissey, one
of the Boston College students whose records were vaporized Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   When Morrissey turns on his laptop now, the screen reads
``operating system not found,'' leaving inaccessible thousands of
e-mail messages and a 1,000-word theology paper due Tuesday at
10:30 a.m. ``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so annoying,'' said his roommate Drew Wetzler, who lost
to the virus eight hours of work he had done for an accounting
project.
</P>
<P>
   Morrissey acknowledged using pirated copies of certain word
processing programs available via the Internet, programs
specialists say are particularly likely to be infected. Still, he
said BC's computing center should have sent around e-mails to warn
students of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   A college spokesman said an update on a school Web site was
sufficient notice for the school's 8,600 undergraduates. In any
case, said spokesman Jack Dunn, they should have installed copies
of an antivirus program that was sold at the start of the academic
year.
</P>
<P>
   To those who didn't, Dunn said, ``We're sorry they put
themselves in that position.'' At Boston University, computer
consulting services director James Stone said a half-dozen students
called in with complaints about their hard drives Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Their options were limited, Stone said. ``Either they can hire
an expensive data recovery service or they can scratch the drive
and start again,'' he said. ``There's no good option.''
</P>
<P>
   Wire services reported the Chernobyl virus also struck at
computers in Finland and Russia. Bloomberg News reported that
Malaysia's stock exchange said computer systems at 12 of the
country's 60 brokerages were infected, slowing trading.
</P>
<P>
   Still, damages could have been worse, said Brooks Talley, test
manager for InfoWorld, a San Mateo, Calif.-based magazine published
by International Data Group in Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Melissa virus got everybody's imagination going
and they started to take steps'' to use antivirus software, Talley
said. The average company of 100 people today spends about $23 per
employee per year on antivirus programs, he said, and home users
should expect to run antivirus protections about once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Virus creators are also developing more powerful programs to
test those measures, said John Vranesevich, principal of the
AntiOnline Web site that monitors hacking groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see more of this because of the growth of
Internet computing, the more companies do collaborations on line,
and the more distance-learning projects there are,'' he said.
``When something gets created and released it's spreading on a much
larger stage.''

`Every Man Should Try': Adventures of a Public Interest Activist 
Jeremy J. Stone (PublicAffairs, $27.50) 
 
 By PAUL SCHATT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The butterfly flaps its wings in Paris, setting into motion
events resulting in a storm in New York. That image, straight from
chaos theory, is cited by Jeremy Stone as his explanation for
imagining that his individual activism could help shape events on a
global scale.
</P>
<P>
   He's at the same time a royal pain in the neck of the
establishment and, surprisingly, detached enough to describe his
major failures and egotistical moments.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, for 30 years president of the Federation of American
Scientists, has devoted his life to activism on a grand scale,
working for nuclear disarmament, freedom for Andrei Sakharov,
halting an illegal CIA mail-opening operation, challenging the
Nixon administration on Watergate, fighting the Shining Path in
Peru, proposing a solution to the China-Taiwan problem, attempting
to end the war in Cambodia, . . . etc. And a dozen or so other
causes, many of them of the lost variety.
</P>
<P>
   You can disagree with many of his political stands, yet give
grudging admiration to how tenaciously he has fought for them.
Obviously, the neutrality laws are no longer enforced against
private citizens who stick their noses into foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it should come as no surprise to know that last year he
tried, unsuccessfully, to push a solution to the Kosovo crisis,
proposing that the Kosovar Albanians ``rent'' the area from the
Serbs, providing virtual autonomy to the Albanians while giving
legal recognition to the Serbian ownership. Like many of his
proposals, this one was simple, logical _ and politically naive.
And he admits it.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Stone's honesty is winning, even to a reader who
disagrees with his politics and feels his campaigns used the
authority of `science'' to cover for political judgments. After
reading this candid, fascinating self-portrait of a man who feels
driven to do what little he can do to advance causes he favors,
you'll want to do something, somehow, to make a difference. His
title is taken from a John F. Kennedy quote, ``One man can make a
difference, and every man should try.'' It beats nihilism.
</P>
<P>
   The author's father, the late I.F. Stone, gained fame as a
crusading newsletter editor who challenged establishment truths and
occasionally won a point. However, I.F. Stone's reputation was
marred, after his death, when Soviet KGB files hinted he had
received Soviet money, presumably for propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Stone describes what he does as entrepreneurial activism.
He approaches each cause as a political campaign, seeking to do
whatever he can as an individual to push the needle, even a little
bit. However, he recognizes that one can do only so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not every rifle shot in snowy mountains brings an avalanche,''
he writes. ``Similarly, not every activist foray in public life
hits a fracture line that produces important, lasting change.
Indeed, if change were this easy to manipulate, change would come
too fast for all of us to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Here he injects a dash of reality into his idealism, by
admitting some of his publicized charges were just off target. For
example, he fought for a congressional veto over first use of
nuclear weapons, only to be shocked to discover that most
congressmen didn't really want to be responsible for making such
decisions. He confesses, ``I took too seriously the periodic
hypocritical complaints of leading members of Congress that the
executive branch refused to consult them in emergencies.'' He's
almost smelling the coffee here.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, his honesty is compelling. My favorite case
study is his responsible, truly scientific reaction when Carl Sagan
wanted him to call a press conference and scare the bejesus out of
the East Coast. Sagan believed that unexplained booms in Nova
Scotia and off the United States were precursors of massive
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Stone investigated and declined calling a press conference; the
booms were caused by the Concorde. One less hysterical scientific
false alarm may not seem like much, but, like a butterfly flapping
its wings in Paris, it can have an effect. &QL;

SOME SIGNS OF TROUBLE WERE EVIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF AND LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The SWAT teams fell back, waiting, watching,
deciding how to respond to the deadly threat posed by the rampaging
school gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Helmeted, armored, assault weapons ready, they stood in
jet-black uniforms outside the bullet- and bomb-damaged school last
Tuesday. But by then, authorities said, it was too late to stop
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, though, long before the teenagers strapped on
high-powered weapons and explosive-filled backpacks, there were
numerous opportunities to derail the duo, chances that were missed
or ignored or simply misread.
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to the slaughter of 12 students and one
teacher at Columbine High School, Harris and Klebold seemed almost
taunting in their displays of antisocial rage, daring someone to
take note of them and their inner torment, perhaps even daring
someone to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   During an early morning bowling class, they celebrated strikes
with Nazi salutes. Harris idolized Adolf Hitler and salted his
Internet web page with threats of violence. The two made a video
that other students called a prelude to the massacre. They broke
into a car. They retreated into an online world. They joined the
``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' a group of outcasts, and apparently passed
the time making pipe bombs and plotting revenge on rival cliques.
</P>
<P>
   At home, one kept Nazi literature, hate pamphlets and, most
tellingly, materials for explosives in plain view. A shotgun barrel
was found on a dresser. ``A lot of this stuff was clearly visible,
and the parents should have known,'' Jefferson County Sheriff John
Stone said recently. ``I think parents should be accountable for
their kids' actions.''
</P>
<P>
   But time and again, according to dozens of interviews with
friends, teachers, law-enforcement officials, and others, witnesses
to their behavior did little or nothing to help the troubled pair.
Even when someone did something, as when a father complained to
sheriff's deputies about Harris's web site, authorities were
reluctant to follow through, and the opportunity passed. The father
let it drop.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, there was a reason, or at least a rationale, for
not acting. Taken individually, few if any of the duo's troubling
acts could portend what was brewing. And it is difficult to imagine
anyone _ other, perhaps, than their mothers and fathers _ piecing
together enough of the clues to have perceived their downward
spiral and forestalled the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   It is convenient, but potentially misleading, after an atrocity
to pull together disparate threads and weave them into what then
resembles a clearly defined tapestry. It also should be remembered
that the world of Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, was not pure
darkness. While many Columbine students remembered their anger and
their scowls, some noted flashes of humor, intellect, and kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no mistaking the red flags the two young men
were waving at the world, and no denying that many people missed
opportunities to defuse a rage so intense that the gunmen laughed
at their dying victims before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   With 15 funerals to plan, and countless lives to rebuild, there
is a premium in this Denver suburb on unity. But already,
recriminations and questions are seeping through the grief, with
some looking inward and some looking for others to blame, from the
teenagers' parents to school and law enforcement officials, from
the media to the Internet, from the availability of guns to an
overall erosion of morals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we can all look to ourselves in this,'' said Harris's
neighbor, Bill Konen, who silently listened to the two teens
smashing glass the day before the massacre. Authorities now suspect
they were making shrapnel for their bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if I had made more contact with him, maybe if the
neighborhood had made more contact, that might have changed
things,'' Konen said. ``I think probably not, but I've been
thinking about that a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the glass-breaking episode, Konen learned that
the shattered glass would lead to a shattered community and a
shaken nation. Others would have to look further back into their
notes, into their memories, to find the overlooked signposts to
murder.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, Randall Brown was among the first to turn to
authorities. After a seemingly minor dispute, Harris had threatened
Brown's then-17-year-old son, Brooks, urging others to kill the
younger Brown in a message posted on the Internet. The two boys had
been friendly classmates. But Harris had changed, becoming
withdrawn and, Randall Brown feared, potentially violent.
</P>
<P>
   Brown reported the threats to the Jefferson County Sheriff's
Department. But sheriff's deputies and the local district attorney
said Brown filed only a ``suspicious incident report'' and not a
formal complaint. Brown said he feared that would have escalated
the situation. In turn, the sheriff's department felt it could do
nothing, and that is what it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you call me and say a person is threatening to kill me and
I want it stopped, you have to be willing to file a criminal
complaint,'' said Deputy Troy Gardalen. ``In order to have a
criminal investigation, there has to be a crime reported.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Dave Thomas acknowledged that the threat might
have been examined more closely. ``Maybe we've become desensitized.
We say `no big deal, we've heard that before,' '' Thomas said.
``I'm not saying any red flags were ignored and I've never said
that. What I know is what some of the kids said. They saw signs of
danger. . . . We need to learn what those red flags are.''
</P>
<P>
   Others also saw Harris's homicidal musings on his favorite form
of communication, the Internet, visible to anyone around the world
with a computer and a phone line.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps six months ago, a Web site signed by the Trenchcoat
Mafia and created by Harris caught the eye of two separate Internet
researchers, one in Los Angeles, one in Toronto. Working for the
Simon Wiesenthal Center, which studies on-line hate groups, they
picked it up because of its link to sites urging anarchy and
providing bomb-making instructions, said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, who
coordinates the center's study.
</P>
<P>
   But with no explicit calls for killing, the site was not
``captured,'' or downloaded for further investigation. Only after
the killings was the site reopened for study, now by federal
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Computers also provided Harris and Klebold with access to two of
their preferred pastimes: violent games, which they played
incessantly, shooting targets and decapitating enemies; and
studying recipes for explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities now believe they have seized from Harris's home the
Internet-generated instructions that taught the pair how to build
bombs with low-cost, everyday household materials. They said the
more than 30 explosive devices discovered at the school could have
been built for about $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of kids get into trouble and the parents don't hear about
it until later,'' said Littleton resident Dennis Wunderlich, whose
eighth-grade son, Victor, is home-schooled. ``But these kids had
that Web site, they were building bombs, they had propane tanks.
Sure there will be finger-pointing, because it seems like there's a
lot of blame to go around, but it's not that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Victor, ``You know you could hide it if you wanted to, but
these people weren't even trying to hide it.''

 LITTLETON, Colo.: ... hide it.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In March 1998, not long after their run-in with the Brown
family, Harris and Klebold were arrested trying to break into a
locked car to steal electronics. Charged with felony first-degree
criminal trespass, they were introduced to the Jefferson County
juvenile justice system. Spared jail because they were sentenced to
a diversion program, they succeeded mostly in diverting attention
from their own problems.
</P>
<P>
   During the 11-month program, they apparently passed alcohol and
drug screenings, performed 45 hours of community service, and so
impressed a counselor with their intellect and attitude that two
months ago he released them from the program with accolades.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, the counselor wrote, was ``a very bright young man who
is likely to succeed in life.'' Klebold, meanwhile, was a ``bright
young man who has a great deal of potential.'' The counselor
remains unidentified, but his superiors describe him as
``anguishing.''
</P>
<P>
   As members of the Trenchcoat Mafia, Harris and Klebold sought
strength in numbers, walking Columbine's halls in groups as large
as 10. Sophomore Katie Kirk was among those present last July
Fourth when Harris and Klebold opened the trunk of a car to show
off guns and lead pipes.
</P>
<P>
   The group was founded more than four years ago by Joseph Stair,
a 1998 Columbine graduate who has boasted in interviews about its
bomb-making predilection and anti-social ways. The gang attracted
sullen boys who ridiculed religion and reveled in racism. At a
physical education class held at the FunPlex bowling alley, the
boys celebrated strikes with straight-armed Nazi salutes. It is
unclear whether the teacher reprimanded them or brought their
behavior to the attention of school officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a philosophy class, Harris talked constantly about buying a
gun, said 16-year-old Jennifer Lucero. ``We ignored him,'' Lucero
said. ``Nobody paid them much attention. They were weirdos.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, writings and a video produced by the pair also did
not trigger alarms. Fellow students recalled an essay Harris
recently shared with creative writing classmates in which he
described enemies and explosions, a scene that foreshadowed the war
he and Klebold declared on the school during the lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the school year, Harris and Klebold worked together
to produce a video for a class project that some students said
showed them pretending to shoot classmates, particularly the
student-athletes with whom they feuded. Others said the video was
less specific, touching only obliquely on mayhem. A copy of the
video is now part of the investigation, another clue to be analyzed
too late.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Trenchcoat Mafia, including the presumed killers,
also threatened Columbine senior Isaiah Shoels, according to his
father, Michael. One of the few black students in the school,
Shoels was among the dead, executed in the library while the gunmen
spewed racial epithets. Witnesses said the killers sought him out
and took pleasure in his death.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shoels said that long before the shootings, he
complained about gang members' racism to the principal, Frank
DeAngelis, but nothing was done.
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis was among the school officials who said they did not
even know the Trenchcoat Mafia existed. ``I did not, or teachers
did not, see these people in trench coats walking down the hall,''
DeAngelis told reporters. ``Hopefully, this will be a wakeup call
for people around the nation. If I had to do it all over again,
that's the message I will say time and time again.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous Columbine students, however, said the hostility between
athletes and the Trenchcoat Mafia was public knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   At lunchtime, the athletes and the outcasts eyed each other with
disdain and hurled insults and threats. Eric Quintana, 16, said
Harris, Klebold, and their friends would repeat two words _ ``just
wait'' _ a threat Quintana and other students did not take
seriously. Stair, the trench coat group's founder, said they felt
``persecuted'' by the athletes, while several athletes said the
rival group courted trouble by taunting students outside its
insular circle.
</P>
<P>
   The missed signs of trouble continued up to the days before the
murders.
</P>
<P>
   Konen, Harris's next-door neighbor, was outside his home Monday
morning, painting the trim on the house, when the pair pulled up in
Klebold's black BMW. For about 15 minutes, the two used a baseball
bat in Harris's open garage to smash what sounded to Konen like
glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't sound like a dangerous noise, just an obnoxious
noise,'' Konen said. ``Like everybody, I've listened to the various
reports about how these guys acted, and of course I wish things had
been different.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on male teenage violence said it is not uncommon for
parents, school officials and friends to miss signals from boys on
the verge of hurting themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys won't reach out and ask for help, and won't look weepy or
sad. That means being vulnerable and that leads to shame, and
they'd rather be dead than be ashamed,'' said William Pollack, a
clinical psychologist at Harvard Medical School and author of the
book, ``Real Boys: Rescuing Our Sons from The Myths of Boyhood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to recognize the signs, particularly increased social
isolation, a sense of feeling like or being an outcast, a sense of
being rejected or overly teased, and a lowered sense of
self-esteem,'' Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost reflexively, parents whose own teenagers had cowered in
the cafeteria, in closets, as the bullets flew, wondered whether
they would have been able to recognize the signs in their own
children. One after another, they insisted they would, or at least
hoped they would.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what their families knew about Harris's and
Klebold's violent obsessions or deep-seated hatreds, despite what
investigators Saturday described as the teens' nonchalance about
concealing their intentions. Their parents' only public comments to
date have been statements expressing sympathy for the victims and
asking for privacy for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But there are suspicions that Klebold's family was at least
somewhat aware of his deadly potential. In the midst of last
Tuesday's siege, a lawyer for Klebold's father called the district
attorney's office asking if he could help. It was not known how
Thomas Klebold knew his son was involved. He was told it was too
late, in part because it was never a hostage situation.

 &HT;    INDEPENDENT AGENCY PROPOSED FOR TRUCK SAFETY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress needs to set up a new independent agency
to oversee the safety of the nation's trucking industry, witnesses
told a Senate committee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With more motorists dying in crashes with big rigs, the Office
of Motor Carriers (OMC) has gotten too chummy with the industry
that it is supposed to regulate and has failed in its mission to
keep unsafe trucks off the highways, warned Kenneth Mead, inspector
general of the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   This laxity comes at a time when the number of commercial
carriers is growing dramatically, creating pressure for more
enforcement of laws to keep unsafe trucks out of service, Mead told
the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The OMC has shifted emphasis from enforcement to a more
collaborative approach to safety,'' testified Mead. ``This is a
good approach for motor carriers that have safety as a top
priority, but it has gone too far. It does not work effectively
with firms that persist in violating safety rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The OMC ``has pushed lovey-dovey relationships'' with the
trucking industry rather than enforcing safety laws, complained
Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen and co-chair of
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., has introduced legislation in the House
that would move the OMC from the Federal Highway Administration to
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates
the manufacture of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But Mead and several other witnesses proposed creation of a new
independent agency, with a chairman to be appointed by the
president and confirmed by Congress, would be better suited to
focus exclusively on truck and bus safety.
</P>
<P>
   The new agency would be similar to the Federal Aviation
Administration, which oversees the airline industry, the witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Highway safety, as it relates to trucking, is not improved by
simply moving a box on an organizational chart,'' said Walter
McCormick, president of the American Trucking Associations, which
represents many of the major carriers. ``It requires an agency
committed to a core mission of improving trucking safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., said he was studying
the options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe we need to determine where motor carrier
responsibilities can best be carried out before we legislate
substantial organizational changes,'' he told the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The number of deaths resulting from truck crashes has been
increasing _ reaching 5,300 people in 1997, said Mead. ``This
equates to a major airline crash with 200 fatalities every two
weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fatality rate _ the number of fatalities per 100 million
miles traveled _ has remained constant for the past three years,
but the actual number of deaths has risen as the number of carriers
increased by 36 percent during this period.

SHOOTINGS CHANGE THE ISSUES FOR CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>

 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the day Gary Bauer was to announce his candidacy for
president, he ripped up his speech and wrote a new one. The
shootings at Columbine High School required him to respond, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of America, candidates for president in the year
2000 have been talking about the massacre in Littleton, Colo. But
for the politicians, the subject is a delicate one, as they try to
react without seeming to take a public relations advantage of a
horrible situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates have to be careful lest they seem to be exploiting
a tragedy,'' said John J. Pitney, a political science professor at
Claremont McKenna College in California. ``There's a fine line
between drawing lessons from an event like this and seeming to milk
political benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, there is off-the-record grumbling by campaign aides
accusing Bauer and other candidates of going too far. And many
spokesmen refused to even discuss why their candidates have said
what they did, fearful that any explanation would politicize the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of silly,'' Bauer says. ``It's one of the most
profound things facing the country. What would be bizarre is if
somebody wanting to have the highest office in the land was not
offering some ideas about why this is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   While most candidates expressed sadness and grief in brief
statements, Bauer and others have begun talking about public policy
and ways to avoid another school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to solve this problem until we get
over this hostility to faith in the public square,'' Bauer, a
conservative Republican activist, said. ``We have to return
voluntary school prayer and I would permit a teacher to hang up the
Ten Commandments in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle, the former vice president, said on CNBC that he
hoped the shootings would not be used as an excuse for strict new
gun controls. Texas Governor George W. Bush said he wanted to know
how the two young men in Littleton got their guns. ``We ought to
keep guns out of the hands of children like these,'' he said last
week during a news conference in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the candidates criticized television, movies, and
music lyrics for promoting violence in society. Vice President Al
Gore, said the most recent school shootings should serve as a
wake-up call. He also said it should speed up the V-chip proposal
to block children from watching violence on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to pay more attention to the problem of excessive
violence in the media, because in times past it was common for
people to say, `Well, you know, some kids are vulnerable, and if
you plant the seeds of violence in most, it won't have an impact.'
But in some, it does,'' Gore said during an interview on Larry King
Live.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Senator John McCain, concurs. ``Americans, I think,
should examine how they're raising their families and the
influences that are affecting young people today,'' said McCain,
62, a GOP hopeful. ``I'm talking about TV, movies, music,
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer and Bush also said they worried about the constant
violence on television.

<P>
   ``It ought to be a concern for all of us to worry about a
society where violent acts like this show up on our TV screens like
they have been over the last few years,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said that by the time children graduate from high school
they have been bombarded by visions of thousands of murders on
their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the America I want, those Hollywood producers and directors
would not be able to show their faces in public, because you and
every other American would go up to them and say, `Shame, shame,
shame on you for what you have done to American culture,' '' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidate Patrick J. Buchanan was even more pointed
as he cast the blame on a ``polluted and poisoned culture'' and
called the shootings a reflection of the dark side of American
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``America got a glimpse of the last stop on that train to hell
she boarded decades ago when we declared that God is dead and that
each of us is his or her own God who can make up the rules as we go
along,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the candidates grappled to say the right thing, many
also admitted that there are no good answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been asked what can a government do,'' said Bush. ``I
wish I knew the law that would make people love one another. I
would insist that it be passed.''

VOLATILE MIX OF PRESSURES FACES TEENS, SPECIALISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Don Ramsey remembers the first time he gave his son
Evan a popsicle. The boy laughed and chased it around the tray of
his highchair with his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey had a sleepless night Tuesday. The rampage at Columbine
High School, in Littleton, Colo., had him thinking about Evan, who
two years ago, as an acne-scarred teenager, marched into his high
school in rural Alaska and used a shotgun to kill the principal and
a popular sophomore basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flashback time, you know,'' said Ramsey, speaking by
telephone from Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey said he still finds it difficult to reconcile the
conflicting images of his son: the innocent toddler and the
16-year-old killer. Although the massacre this week at Columbine
seems equally impossible to comprehend, researchers say it exploded
from several disturbing changes that are occurring simultaneously
in the way children are growing up.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than random events or even copycat crimes, the eight
school shootings since 1996, which have killed 33 and wounded at
least 70, are byproducts of a growing subculture of severely
troubled youth, many researchers say. Inside this mostly hidden
world, millions of teens suffer from serious, untreated mood
disorders _ particularly depression _ and see violence as the
primary means of handling conflict. Their desperate alienation has
been made potentially lethal by guns that now seem as easy to
obtain as a six-pack of beer.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, many adults tend to view teenagers as children in the
midst of losing their innocence, their angst no different than what
they as children went through. Such assumptions are dangerous,
researchers say. ``There's no comparison,'' said Peter C. Scales, a
senior fellow at the Search Institute, a non-profit research
organization in Minneapolis that specializes in youth issues. ``It
was fantasyland 40 years ago. And that forces us into very
difficult questions today. I just hope we have the guts to have a
debate about some of these issues and not just pretend that putting
a metal detector up is the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Alan Unis, a psychiatrist and brain researcher at the
University of Washington, examined Barry Loukaitis, who committed
the first of the school shootings. Loukaitis, a wan 14-year-old,
opened the door of his algebra class at Moses Lake (Wash.) junior
high school, held up a .30-30 deer rifle and opened fire. He killed
two 14-year-old classmates and his teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Unis, who was asked by the prosecution to examine Loukaitis, was
stunned by what he found. Loukaitis was in the throes of depression
so severe he seemed almost catatonic. ``He was cold _ cold and
scary,'' Unis recalled. ``I can't begin to tell you how many times
since then I've thought about him.'' Behind eyes as blank as
marbles, Loukaitis showed no remorse. ``At one point I asked him
what should be done,'' said Unis. ``He told me, `True justice would
be to turn me over to the parents of the kids I killed and let them
do what they want to me.' He was still living by this credo of kill
and be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Unis was unnerved, believing he had gotten a glimpse of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only the beginning,'' he warned prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Unis said he believed that Loukaitis, who wore all black, like
the two Columbine killers, was an extreme example of trends he had
seen in his practice. Although there has been no systematic
analysis of the 10 boys who have committed the recent shootings,
they have shown similar characteristics: severe depression,
isolation, a fixation on death and violence, immersion in violent
video games and, perhaps most striking, an almost total absence of
empathy for their victims. Ramsey, shortly after committing two
murders in his rampage through the halls of Bethel Regional High,
calmly asked state troopers for a sandwich. Witnesses to the
Columbine shootings reported that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,
the two apparent perpetrators, gleefully yelled, ``We've waited to
do this our whole lives!''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Gorin, the executive director of the National Association
of School Psychologists, dismissed the theory that the boys were
inherently evil. ``They're not born with different violent
tendencies,'' she said. ``Any more so than kids ever were. It's all
environmental.''
</P>
<P>
   Scales said the difference in adolescence ``these days is the
cocktail that we've got is so much more explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   The mix includes:
</P>
<P>
   --Depression
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 1.5
million children under 18 suffer from serious depression. The
numbers may be much higher, many researchers say, given the
apparent obsession many teens seem to have with suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, conducted by the Centers
for Disease Control, more than 1 in 5 students said they had
seriously considered suicide the previous year; 7.7 percent said
they had actually made one or more attempts. Based on Department of
Education figures, the statistics indicate that more than 1 million
high school students attempted suicide last year.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Columbine shootings, in which the killers took their
own lives, most of the school shootings appear to have started as
elaborate plans by the shooters to end their lives in a blaze of
glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just shoot me,'' said 15-year-old Kip Kinkel, after he was
wrestled to the ground at the end of a shooting spree in
Springfield, Ore., last year.
</P>
<P>
   --Video games
</P>
<P>
   The $5.1 billion video-game market, which sold 115 units in
1997, has grown larger than the film industry. Although the vast
majority of the games are non-violent and even educational, some 5
percent are so-called ``point-and-shoot'' games in which the player
employs a full arsenal of weapons to wantonly kill. The systems are
often similar to those designed by the military to break down a
soldier's natural aversion to killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you actually play the point-and-shoot games you are
learning the motor skills to kill,'' said Colonel David Grossman, a
former West Point professor of behavioral sciences and the author
of a 1995 book on how people learn to kill. ``You are being
reinforced, you are being rewarded, not to passively accept the
violence of others, but to inflict the violence yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Immersion in the point-and-shoot games has been a thread
throughout the school shootings, and it surfaced again as a factor
in the Columbine killings. Eric Harris seems to have been an expert
at the so-called Doom series, in which the player's sole mission is
to kill, using everything from a pistol to a grenade launcher to
something called a B.F.G. 2000, which apparently stands for Big
(expletive) Gun.
</P>
<P>
   --Weapons
</P>
<P>
   According to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 8.5 percent of
students reported they had carried a gun, knife, or club onto
school property at least once in the previous month. Based on
Department of Education estimates of 14.6 million high-school
students nationwide, the survey indicates that more than 1.2
million students have carried some kind of weapon onto school
property in any given month.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Education reported that 6,093 students were
expelled during the 1996-97 school year for bringing a gun to
school. That number is believed to vastly underestimate the number
of guns in schools; by some estimates, 270,000 guns are taken into
schools each day.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkel, the Springfield, Ore., killer, received a .22-caliber
semiautomatic Ruger rifle, then a .9 mm Glock pistol from his
father. When those were taken away, he bought another gun from a
classmate with $110 he had earned staining his parents' deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The access to guns is unconscionable,'' said Gorin. Referring
to Columbine, she said: ``You can't kill 13 people with a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a first step to respond to the shootings, the Department of
Education issued a list of guidelines last year outlining how to
recognize potentially dangerous students. The guidelines were
issued to 190,000 school principals, but many researchers say the
measures fall woefully short of what is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policymakers have shown an ability to wring their hands, then
tinker around the edges and not face the really difficult issues,''
said Scales.
</P>
<P>
   He and others argue that schools are ill-equipped to deal with
the growing mental health needs of students and should focus on
providing more counselors. But Bill Modzeleski, director of the
Department of Education's safe and drug-free schools program,
questioned whether that was feasible. ``If suddenly we could wave a
magic wand and hire 100,000 more counselors, that would be great,
but that's not how policy is made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Poland, who heads a crisis-management team that treated
traumatized students after shootings in West Paducah, Ky., and
Jonesboro, Ark., has argued that tensions in schools are so high
that students should no longer be left alone after school with so
much time on their hands. ``We may even have to lengthen the school
day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reyne Athanas said answers will be difficult to find. A
former art teacher at Bethel Regional, she tried unsuccessfully to
get Evan Ramsey to give up his shotgun during his rampage through
the halls of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Athanas was sitting in a meeting when someone walked in
and said, ``It's happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   Athanas said she burst into tears. ``I just can't believe it,''
she said. ``It's unbelievable. I feel so, so sorry for those
people. I know what they're going to be going though the next
couple of years. You go through everything from extreme anger, and
then you think about what could have been done and the guilt sets
in. It really runs havoc in your personal relationships, working,
sleeping, and eating. And then everytime it happens, it all comes
back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Athanas said she believed it would.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know what it is: It's a mindset, and it's nationwide.
It comes from eveything that seems to be going on in our society
and continues to go on because we're all too apathetic to fix it.
And do I know how to fix it? No.''

MASSACHUSETTS WANTS FEWER TENURED PROFESSORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Noting that the percentage of professors with tenure
is higher at Massachusetts colleges and universities than at
comparable schools nationwide, the state's chancellor of higher
education reducing the number of tenured professors will be a top
priority over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Stanley Z. Koplik stressed that he did not want to
eliminate tenure, which many professors have come to claim as an
inalienable right. But he said, as many college presidents
nationwide have agreed, that the widespread use of tenure has made
it hard for institutions to stay within spending limits and respond
to demands for new courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for greater flexibility,'' Koplik said. ``I don't
think we would compromise the quality of the academic product with
a lower rate of tenure. There are highly regarded institutions
where the rates are lower than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Koplik suggested he and the state's Board of Higher Education
would try to get the state's faculty unions to agree to offer new
faculty the chance to forgo tenure in favor of multi-year contracts
with a higher salary. While a significant portion of schools
nationwide are experimenting with contracts and other piecemeal
changes to tenure, Massachusetts would be the first state system to
institutionalize such a dramatic alternative.
</P>
<P>
   But the suggestion to reduce the ranks of the tenured puts
officials at odds with the state's powerful teachers' unions on
perhaps the most potent issue in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Just under 80 percent of professors at the University of
Massachusetts, state colleges, and community colleges have tenure.
Professors say it gives institutions stability and prestige, by
requiring faculty to prove themselves over six years to earn
tenure. Suggesting that the state is not committed to tenure would
negate the work it has done to improve the quality of public
colleges and UMass, they say, because quality professors would seek
more secure jobs in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Koplik made his comments in an interview Monday discussing the
first annual report on the Condition of Higher Education. New
legislation requires the yearly report to track the state's
progress as it moves toward the goal of making the system one of
the nation's best _ and one of the most affordable _ by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The report documents Massachusetts' widely-touted
accomplishments, most notably the increase in the quality of
students applying to state schools and the consistent decrease in
the cost of attending.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows that schools have pared down administrative
costs and done more to take care of their facilities _ both goals
the Legislature imposed as requirements for getting state funding.
But the high rates of tenure, the report says, present an obstacle
to improvement.
</P>
<P>
   At UMass, 78 percent of faculty have tenure, compared with 70
percent at peer institutions, such as schools in the University of
Wisconsin system and the University of Connecticut. At state
colleges, 76 percent of faculty have tenure, compared with 62
percent of peer institutions, which include public schools in the
New Jersey and New York systems. The contrast is greatest at
community colleges, where 79 percent of Massachusetts faculty have
tenure, compared with 54 percent at peer institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, many systems are making changes in tenure,
which was institutionalized by the American Association of
University Professors in 1915. In 1995, the most recent year with
such data, the rate of faculty with tenure was at its lowest ever,
at 30 percent. Full-time faculty with tenure _ the measure
Massachusetts looks at _ was at 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that about 30 percent of public and private schools
are requiring even those with tenure to undergo periodic reviews.
Last month, the University of Central Arkansas became the first in
the nation to offer new faculty a choice between the tenure track
and a higher salary. In that case, the premium offered was 55
percent. Koplik said Massachusetts would offer somewhere around 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tenure, he said, can make it harder for schools to try to
establish new programs and get rid of ones that are
undersubscribed.
</P>
<P>
   Offering an alternative, he said, ``allows an institution to
make hiring decisions that don't have longer-term consequences. It
allows them to put together programs based upon student demands
much faster.''
</P>
<P>
   The state and community college faculty unions would have to
approve any such change in contract negotiations. With an extension
on their expired contract due to run out June 30, they are under
pressure to come up with a settlement, and are considering a
proposal that would offer some alternative to tenure. But some
union leaders say the discussion of alternatives has driven some
potential faculty to look for jobs in other states. While it is
often portrayed as a cushy lifetime job guarantee, professors say
tenure is their only protection from being fired for unorthodox
views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without tenure, I'd be hard pressed to believe you would not
see firings based on people's different theories about different
issues,'' said Priscilla Lyons, head of the higher education
division for the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which
represents 10,000 professors at UMass and state and community
colleges. ``They say it wouldn't happen but those were the main
reasons that tenure came about _ because those things do happen.
Can somebody seriously persuade me that if we were going to go down
this road that we will attract and retain the best and brightest in
the system? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Professors say it also allows them to resist students' pressure
to inflate grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some kind of protection so we can make evaluations
without repercussions,'' said Brad Art, chairman of the bargaining
committee considering the contract proposal. ``I'm not bothered, I
don't think anybody ought to be bothered, that we have a large
number of tenured professors, because it means we have people
who've proved themselves. Most people want to have experienced
folks doing things for them, their doctors or their lawyers. You
want people who've been in the classroom and doing research. It's
desirable to have more experienced people.''

A REFUGEE WEB WIZARD DAZZLES IN A NEW LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Three weeks ago, Vigan Budima was just another
young refugee, one of the thousands of anonymous faces seen fleeing
desperately from Kosovo. But in the days since, he has become
something else: the top Web page designer at Albania Online, the
biggest Internet company in the capital, his temporary hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Budima, 18, arrived here with his parents after a four-day
journey through Montenegro with only packets of food and the
clothes on his back. He had no idea what had become of his brother,
Valon.
</P>
<P>
   So, as thousands of refugees waited in long lines for a
telephone, Budima knocked on the door of an Internet provider he
saw listed in the newspaper and asked if he could send his brother
an e-mail. Within hours, he had persuaded the owners of Albania
Online to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for me. I don't have anything else to do,'' Budima
said, fiddling with a computer mouse and demonstrating his latest
designs from what has become his private office. ``Also, this is a
poor country. This Internet is new for them. There's not much
home-page development here.''
</P>
<P>
   His good fortune is one extraordinary story in a country where
hundreds of thousands of Kosovars spend their days in cramped
refugee camps, and hundreds have no shelter at all. But his
ambition is strikingly common among his peers, many of whom have
sought jobs or volunteer work since arriving in Albania in an
effort to hold on to a fragment of normal life.
</P>
<P>
   In hotels and restaurants in Tirana, as well as in humanitarian
organizations in northern Albania, Kosovars are seeping into the
fabric of the country, with engineers working as English
translators and teachers working as office assistants. Some have
even managed to get jobs in their own field, like the doctors now
working with humanitarian health teams.
</P>
<P>
   Their motive clearly is not economic; few Albanian companies can
afford to pay refugees for work, and any wages are far below what
professionals earned in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many refugees seemed to be emerging from a state of
shock into one of boredom, leaving them anxious to recreate pieces
of their former lives. They are frustrated by the length of time
that has passed since they left Kosovo. Although they hope to
return home in a matter of weeks, many say they are looking for
things to do in the meantime _ particularly if it means helping
other refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember: These aren't peasants. Kosovo is not
in the Stone Age,'' said Rick Grant, an official of CARE
International. ``These are educated, cultivated people, and it's
natural for people who are successful in their homelands to want to
show some initiative, even in this kind of situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Grant said, ``Nothing is worse than to sit in a refugee
camp, day after day after day. It's like being in a penitentiary.
There's absolutely nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdet Nila can attest to that. After traveling into Albania
from his hometown of Pec, Nila, 35, said he spent a week in a
Tirana refugee camp, wandering all day between rows of tents. When
the owner of a nearby hotel offered to shelter Nila and his family
for a few days, he accepted, but only after insisting on
volunteering as a translator at the hotel's front desk. He soon
realized he was the only employee who could speak English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the owner, no pay is fine,'' said Nila, who ran a
family paint business in Kosovo and who now stays with his wife,
parents, and three children in room 42 of the Hotel Balkani. ``In
the camp, all the time I was saying, `I need work to spend my time.
I don't want to just walk around and smoke cigarettes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Urban Kosovars appear to be the most restless _ and the most
useful to Albanian and foreign companies _ because many worked
office jobs in cities such as Pristina and Prizren and learned to
speak more than one European language. In that sense, they are more
employable than many Albanian natives, whose formal education
sometimes stops at the eighth grade. The sudden emergence of
refugees in the work force is a welcome sign to humanitarian
officials, who say it creates a kind of welfare-to-work atmosphere
in a system otherwise built on communist-era dependence.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanians ``obviously know the language, know the
culture, know the needs,'' said Rick Brennan, director of health
for the International Rescue Committee, a New York-based medical
team that has hired refugees in Macedonia and Albania. ``It allows
them to maintain their skills and their dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   At Albania Online, the symbols of Budima's gratitude are
emblazoned on his computer screen. He has created five home pages
in the past two weeks _ all for major clients, including the
Albanian Democratic Party and Top Albanian Radio, the largest
station in the country.
</P>
<P>
   He learned his skills after school, by trial and error, on an
outdated computer in his parents' home. But he was a pro even in
high school: When his brother Valon, 27, opened an
Internet-provider firm in Pristina two years ago, Budima became a
long-distance employee, designing sites and communicating by modem
from Pec.
</P>
<P>
   His brother's company, Pro.net, shut down last month after the
NATO airstrikes began. Valon left a few days later. Budima and his
parents, both teachers, left their apartment March 28.
</P>
<P>
   They had seen Serb neighbors scribbling names in Cyrillic on the
doors of Serb homes to tell Yugoslav troops which houses not to
destroy. Budima said his family ``decided we should leave
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   After driving first to Montenegro, they decided to go on to
Albania, in the hopes that distant relatives might take them in.
</P>
<P>
   When Budima got here, he thought that he might be able to reach
Valon by e-mail, though he realized the chance was slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here and asked if I can use the computer for just half
an hour,'' he said from the office of Albania Online. ``Then I
showed them some home pages I'd done. They were impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked out a deal: $30 per home page and access to the
Internet. But several days later, he got an even greater reward.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail came back from Valon. He said he had fled south from
Pristina toward Macedonia, spending six horrific days trapped near
the border before being allowed to enter a refugee camp. After
making it to safety, Valon had the same inspiration as his younger
brother.
</P>
<P>
   He sought out an Internet cafe. And there, from hundreds of
miles away, he let his family know he had survived.

US OFFICIALS SEE SIGNS OF DISCORD WITHIN THE REGIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Events in Yugoslavia over the past two days have
led several US officials to voice a suspicion that the regime of
the Serb leader, Slobodan Milosevic, may be cracking.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing event was a broadcast Sunday by Serbia's
deputy prime minister, Vuk Draskovic, calling on leaders to ``stop
lying to the people in Serbia'' and to admit that ``we cannot
defeat NATO.'' Draskovic repeated the point in an interview with
CNN Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Equally interesting, the Associated Press reported from Belgrade
that Yugoslav Army units Monday took over Studio B, which had aired
Draskovic's comments. Such an act would suggest that his comments
may reflect a genuine fissure, and not, as some had initially
suspected, a propaganda gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   Another report over the weekend had Milosevic placing some of
his top military officers under house arrest. The implication here
would be that they may have been tiring of the NATO bombing
campaign _ which is slowly wrecking the Serbian Army _ and were
trying to foment opposition to Milosevic's policies or even his
rule.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a BBC interview Sunday, in which Milo
Djukanovich, the president of the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro,
said he would mount resistance to any coup attempt against him by
Milosevic's army.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro has come under heavy pressure to abandon pro-Western
leanings, to the point where talk is widespread of a ``creeping
coup'' mounted by Yugoslav troops, according to US officials. Some
officials find it significant that Djukanovich, who has been fairly
quiet on these issues, suddenly feels emboldened to talk about them
in public.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Hitchner, director of the center for international
programs at the University of Dayton _ which, since the 1995 Dayton
peace accord, has developed extensive contacts on Balkan issues _
is one of several analysts, in and out of the government, who finds
these developments most interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody at every level is turning their heads a bit at
this,'' Hitchner said in a phone interview. ``You put it all
together, and it suggests there may be some instability high up in
the Yugoslav government.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he cautioned, ``This is all speculation. Clearly,
there's something going on, but what it is exactly, nobody over
here can really say.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchner said he has been ``skeptical'' of the notion _ put
forth by NATO and Pentagon officials _ that the bombing campaign
would drive a wedge between Milosevic and his cronies, who own some
of the factories and other assets being bombed. However, he said,
``You can't rule it out. Too many of these things are going on at
the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's comments are widely seen as the most intriguing, in
part for their substance, in part for their source. Draskovic used
to be the charismatic, nationalistic leader of the main Serbian
opposition movement to Milosevic. Milosevic had him arrested and
severely beaten in the early 1990s, which made it surprising last
year when the Yugoslav president appointed Draskovic deputy prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchner said that Milosevic was trying to appear amenable to
the West at the time. He wanted to join NATO's ``partnership for
peace'' program. The Western officials who had negotiated with him
on Bosnian issues found Milosevic charming as an individual.
Bringing an old foe like Draskovic into his government, Milosevic
believed, would earn him public-relations points.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Western-outreach is no longer on Milosevic's agenda,
the revival of a rift with Draskovic was considered inevitable. But
Draskovic's public dissent seems to suggest a rift that involves
more than just the two men, Hitchner and some US officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In his broadcast Sunday, Draskovic said the Serbian leaders must
tell their people the truth about ``what will be left of Serbia in
20 days if the bombing continues.'' On CNN Monday, he added that
Serbia is ``very, very alone'' in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Draskovic blasted the West as well. ``Serbia looks very
close to Hiroshima,'' he said on CNN, adding, ``I blame NATO'' for
the destruction, which amounts to ``collective punishment against
one small and innocent nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a settlement should leave Kosovo as a part of Serbia but
acting ``with a very high level of autonomy.'' He also said all the
Kosovar refugees should return, and that an international force,
under UN auspices, should establish and protect the peace.
</P>
<P>
   US officials have said a UN peacekeeping force would be
acceptable, as long as NATO commanders were ``at its core.''

</P>
<P>
   In a small European town there lived a sheriff who believed he
had solutions to all problems. One day a fire broke out. The
sheriff gave orders to form a fire brigade. A group of farmers
formed a line from the riverside to the burning house.
</P>
<P>
   Each farmer was given a pail to bring water to the burning
building. From hand to hand went the pail, quickly, until it
reached the first person close to the burning house. With a big
heave the water would be emptied on the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff observed that the fire was taking too long to be
extinguished. He decided to do something himself. He found a pail,
not realizing that it was full of gasoline, ran to the fire and
emptied the contents, thus engulfing the building and burning down
the town.
</P>
<P>
   This story reminds me of what is taking place in the Balkans and
how we are dealing with the problem. Instead of having an organized
approach to this terrible problem we seem to be pouring more and
more gasoline on the fire.
</P>
<P>
   NATO reports that more than 700,000 refugees are homeless.
Ethnic Albanian communities are gone. The so-called ethnic
Albanians pray for a miracle but none seems to be happening. The
more NATO bombs fall, the more the Serbs retaliate. The damage is
incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   Who is to blame for all of this?
</P>
<P>
   Evil Slobodan Milosevic is sticking to his plans. Kosovo will be
Serbian and rid of any ethnic Albanians. He claims that there
really is no Serb aggression, it is NATO that is the aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   Look here, he seems to say, we are fighting for statehood. All
countries and nationalities fight for statehood. All we want is our
homeland, Serbia, to be free of ethnic Albanians. If ethnic
cleansing means moving hundreds of thousands of people to other
countries, then we are guilty of that in the name of national
determination. We don't kill, he claims, we deport.
</P>
<P>
   He fools his people and the world, by stating that it is NATO
that has been killing people. The recent air attacks show that the
bombs have, indeed, fallen on innocent people. Each bomb causes
havoc and spreads death.
</P>
<P>
   It is no great miracle for NATO to bomb the land into the Stone
Age. It will, however, take a miracle to rebuild the land from the
Stone Age. Which ethnic Albanian in his right mind will want to
return to Kosovo? If and when they do, they won't blame Slobodan
Milosevic for the carnage, they will end up blaming NATO. Sad, but
true, it is Milosevic's plan that is now being carried out by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically it is NATO that is finding homes for the displaced
ethnic Albanians. Their organization for the resettlement of these
people guarantees Milosevic's plan of a Moslem-free Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans have seen fighting for 600 years. They have inbred
hatred but have co-existed. Milosevic has fewer than 30,000 troops.
By involving NATO he has been able to put 700,000 people into
misery. He has caused the death of innocent people. It is so
unfortunate that he has been helped by our bombs.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, we should go after the man and not the country. By
bombing and destroying the land we galvanize the enemy and
antagonize the Russian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to this dilemma is to find out how democratic
countries such as Israel deal with religious differences.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians want a homeland. They want Israel's capital,
Jerusalem, to be their capital. This is no less than what is taking
place in Yugoslavia. Israel does not want that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   But does Israel bomb refugee camps? Do they ask America to call
in NATO to perform air strikes, destroy homes and displace the
people? No, Israel holds talks and then more talks and
negotiations. They meet in Oslo, they meet in France, in the White
House and in Jordan. They will do anything but have an outright
war.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are those who oppose the talks. There are those who
blow up buses and market places, but Israel does not do mass
deportations or ethnic cleansing. Israel searches out the
perpetrators and destroys only the perpetrators' homes. A strong
Israel does not take advantage of its superior military strength.
It does everything possible to keep the peace. The state of Israel
has chosen not to do what NATO is guilty of doing, killing and
bombing in the name of peace. They have chosen a more humane way to
deal with people who hate them, people who swear to drive them into
the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust taught the Jewish state a very important lesson.
Never to forget what was done to them. To them the message of
``never forgetting'' leads to always forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have taken the message ``never to forget'' to mean
``never forgive.'' Now they repeat the same sins of their former
oppressors. They must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said, ``We must follow the example of the
World War II generation by standing up to aggression and hate, and
then by following through with a post-conflict strategy for
reconstruction and renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is pretty far off track. The World War II generation
lived through a war of untold proportions which was started by a
Hitler who had hundreds of thousands of soldiers with aspirations
to conquer the entire world.
</P>
<P>
   I know Milosevic's plans are bad for ethnic Albanians, but he is
no Hitler and, remember, displacement is not genocide. Milosevic is
one terrible man whom I despise deeply. But let us not help him win
his war.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish state has shown us the path. They have the correct
way to deal with ethnic differences. It is leaderships that must be
replaced and not countries destroyed. It would do NATO good to
study Israel's policies and to learn from them.

DEFIANT MONTENEGRO INSISTS IT COULD HOLD ITS OWN  
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CETINJE, Yugoslavia _ It's a tiny, poor region without an army
of its own, under increasing pressure from a better-armed,
more-populous neighbor with a recent track record of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   If Montenegro did the math, it might think twice about defying
Serbia, its larger, sister Yugoslav republic. Montenegro's
population of 600,000 is a mere fraction of Serbia's 10 million.
Its local police force _ estimated at 8,000 to 10,000 _ is without
the heavy-weapons arsenal and air fleet held by the Yugoslav
military.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Montenegrins are unfazed, insisting they could hold off
an attack, be it from NATO or their Serbian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to fight for Montenegro, and we are going to die,
if necessary,'' said Momo Strugar, a 23-year-old electrician in
Cetinje, the historical capital of Montenegro. ``We don't
surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the Balkan mentality, and its roots go back many
centuries. Call it pride or stubbornness, but the behavior of the
often-sparring Balkan peoples is the same: fight to the end, no
matter how formidable the enemy or horrific the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Montenegrins are a very proud people,'' Strugar said. ``And
we won't be the victims of the policies of Slobodan Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Balkan history is filled with stories of glorious battles, and
the tales continue to rally the region's ethnic groups _ even if
they lost.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1389 the Serbs lost to the Turks at Kosovo
Polje, ushering in a half-millennium of brutal Turkish rule.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Serbs still celebrate this failed battle every year, and
Yugoslav President Milosevic has successfully whipped up resentment
among modern-day Serbs to gain support for his behavior toward
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrins have a long war history, including 400 battles
in 1,000 years, many of them against the Turks, said Radoje
Pajovic, a historian at the University of Podgorica. But as nearly
any Montenegrin schoolchild can recite, tiny Montenegro was the
only territory that held off the Ottoman Empire, sometimes in
battles where the Turks outnumbered them by as much as 10 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   While the Montenegrins accepted the authority of Turkish rule
during the 16th and 17th centuries, the local ruling government was
made up of Montenegrins, Pajovic notes.
</P>
<P>
   The main museum in Cetinje, the historical heart of Montenegro,
is a celebration of the resistance against the Turks. Set in the
onetime home of King Nikola I, it displays 47 captured Turkish
flags, and a collection of seized weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   The Turks vastly outnumbered the Montenegrins, but the locals
``knew the land, knew the canyons and the mountains,'' said
Pajovic. A typical tactic was to lure the Turks into a valley,
surround them, and kill them, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of years have passed, and modern warfare tends toward
high-tech weaponry. The defiant Balkan mentality, however, endures.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, a ragtag, civilian force outfitted
at first with only smuggled Kalashnikovs, took on the Serbs last
year despite being vastly overmatched by the Yugoslav military.
More than a year after open fighting began, Kosovar Albanians have
been run out by the hundreds of thousands, and their houses have
been burned.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the KLA survives and continues to recruit, its leaders
say, despite the overwhelming power of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the KLA's enemy, Milosevic, backed down in the face of
the greater military power of NATO. After a month of bombing,
Milosevic is still standing up against the most powerful military
force in the world, and among Serbs and Montenegrins, ``he is
getting stronger and stronger with each bomb that is dropping,''
notes Nenad Markovic, a 20-year-old Montenegrin civilian who says
he detests Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO ``wants to kill our dignity, but they won't succeed,'' said
a pro-Milosevic speaker at a recent demonstration here. ``We'd
rather lose our heads than our souls.''
</P>
<P>
   Big weapons don't seem to deter people in this region, who in
many ways still fight on a level that is centuries old.
</P>
<P>
   The Western military alliance leaders count their planes and
missiles, use advanced radar technology, and speak of ``degrading''
Yugoslav military ability. Modern Western warfare is characterized
by terms like ``surgical strike'' and ``collateral damage,'' a
phrase used to describe unintended civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a brutal intimacy to Balkan warfare. The battles of
this century _ even this decade _ are characterized by tales of
gouging out of eyes, mass graves, and point-blank executions.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, families in the northern mountains still participate
in blood feuds; if a family member is killed, the male head of the
clan is obliged to murder a family member of the first killer.
</P>
<P>
   With a war at their border and threatening to spill over,
Montenegrins don't talk about weapons technology, or a matchup of
troops and guns. Instead, they insist their determination and pride
alone is sufficient to fend off an attacker, be it NATO ground
troops or Yugoslav Army soldiers bent on bringing the local
Montenegrin police under their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic needs an obedient Montenegro,'' said Radomir
Sekulovic, an adviser to the anti-Milosevic Montenegrin government
of Milo Djukanovic. But the republic will not give in, he said,
adding: ``The Montenegrin people _ civilians, also _ will defend
Montenegro from any aggression from Serbs, even from NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrins sound fearless in their defiance of the Milosevic
regime. Sekulovic called him ``a killer, a barbarian, a leader of
thugs,'' while the Montenegrin prime minister, Filip Vujanovic,
called Momir Bulatovic, Yugoslav's prime minister, mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Young men here openly evade the draft; the justice minister,
Dragan Soc, has refused conscription and gives a sarcastic salute
when he passes the military court on his way to work.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav Army soldiers in Montenegro alone outnumber the
local police by as much as 4 to 1, sources said. But should a fight
break out, Montenegrin loyalists could be as successful as their
predecessors were against the Ottoman Empire, said Miodrag
Ilickovic, a member of Parliament from the Socialist Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 170,000 men,'' he replied when asked how Montenegro
could hold off bigger and more powerful foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Turks never conquered us,'' he said. ``Our way of fighting
is original. No one can fight better than Montenegro in the
mountains.''

THE WILL OF NATO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- To get pseudo-macho for a second, Slobodan
Milosevic has not cried ``uncle'' after one month of NATO's
initially limited and probing military campaign against his
murderous regime.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Milosevic has cried ``nephew'' _ far from good enough,
but revealing nonetheless. There's going to be a lot more of that
as NATO continues to remove the limits on the campaign and as a
flurry of diplomatic activity centered on Russia unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   As all this occurs, it will become even more clear how an
astonishing gathering of NATO and all of its official partners here
proved pivotal. Far from being a planned birthday bash that got
hijacked by horror, the summit was either an example or a harbinger
of what NATO can be if it lives out the meaning of its freshly
vigilant creed. Apart from the dinners, the interminable parade of
available big shots and the speeches, the success of the gathering
was driven home by three events that got far less attention _ a
private dinner, a phone call, and a testy meeting about Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner, on the eve of the summit's opening, from which many
of the alliance's next moves flowed, joined President Clinton and
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   The phone call, also before the summit, linked Clinton and Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres of Portugal in an excellent example of
alliance politics in action.
</P>
<P>
   And the testy meeting was between Republican Representative Curt
Weldom of Pennsylvania and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbot.
It stopped an incipient attempt at amateur diplomacy involving
Russia and Yugoslavia almost on the eve of the announcement of
Talbot's own crucial mission to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, these events are a window on the key element in
NATO's campaign: will.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Clinton are not NATO's inner cabinet; the unity behind
this campaign is much broader and deeper than that. But they are
leading through some skillful agenda setting, Blair more publicly
and Clinton less so, as became apparent over last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The best example is the evolving strategy for the bombing
campaign and the preparations for possible use of ground troops in
Kosovo in some form of combat.
</P>
<P>
   With hindsight, it is clear that NATO could not have united all
at once behind an all-out air assault and the positioning of tens
of thousands of troops on the Albanian and/or Macedonian borders.
</P>
<P>
   It is also clear that it should not have. Clinton was right to
remark that it is obvious that no bomb, no matter where it is
dropped, can stop a thug from murdering a civilian. But it's also
true that an all-out assault after the breakup of the Rambouillet
negotiations in March would have been politically pointless as
well.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, it was Milosevic's mass murder and aggression
via refugees that demonstrated his true intentions. The escalation
that followed is on him, not NATO. It was no accident that after
Blair and Clinton met, the bombing intensified, military commanders
got more of the direct targeting authority they properly seek, a
halting but determined effort to deny Milosevic's military machine
its petroleum began, and the politics of ground troops changed.
</P>
<P>
   As British officials have said, an invasion a la Persian Gulf is
not the idea. Instead, planning has begun for the possible
insertion of 100,000 troops against Yugoslav forces, which have
been seriously battered from the air but not to the point where
Milosevic has formally met the NATO demand that he withdraw them.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the alliance together as all this moves ahead is
grinding daily work, as Clinton's presummit chat with Guterres
demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal is firmly aboard on Kosovo, but Portugal has other
concerns. In particular, it has been up to its ears recently in
helping negotiate a tentative deal for the separation of its
long-ago colony, East Timor, from its brutal annexors in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   For any deal to work, Indonesia's new rulers need to clamp down
on militias tied to it that are still violent. The United States
can help put pressure on, and should. Hearing Guterres out and
responding is part of what allies do for each other; good politics
and good diplmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy, however, is not for congressional dabblers in the
middle of a crisis, as Weldon discovered. With buddies in the
Russian Duma, he was preparing to travel to Belgrade and Moscow
this week. For a skilled manipulator like Milosevic looking for
wedges and wiggle room, it would have been a major opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   And the Clinton administration was right to step on Weldon hard.
Subsequent events have only made the intervention by Talbot more
appropriate _ oil embargo dangers, Boris Yeltsin's long private
chat by phone with Clinton over the weekend, and Talbot's own
mission.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a responsible role for Russia in this madness _
in the Balkans directly and as part of the broader international
background at the United Nations as well. But that is a topic for
people who represent nations, not legislative factions.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that emerges from all this is not neat or always
completely clear, and it is maddening as the horror in Kosovo
continues.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a picture of will being applied relentlessly. And that
is why the cry of ``nephew'' has been heard, which will become
``uncle'' if the will is maintained.

SLOW GROWTH OF THE FRENCH RESISTANCE IS SUBJECT OF ``RED GOLD''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
RED GOLD 
By Alan Furst 
Random House, 258 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Furst's last novel, ``The World at Night,'' wasn't his
best, but it introduced his most compelling character: Jean Casson,
film director, sensual man, and almost-accidental patriot who finds
himself participating in the French Resistance even before it
really existed in any organized way.
</P>
<P>
   Furst's new book brings Casson back, and ``Red Gold'' may be
Furst's finest achievement to date. In this area of accomplishment,
Furst belongs in the select company of Charles McCarry and John le
Carre.
</P>
<P>
   Furst published his debut novel in 1976 and followed it up with
three others, which he no longer bothers to include in the list of
his works. In 1988 he discovered home ground with ``Night
Soldiers,'' which led to four successors, including ``Red Gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Furst's great subject is Europe in the period just before he was
born, the years, beginning in 1938, that led to World War II.
Countless novels and films have made this familiar ground _ so
familiar that most contemporary genre writers have chosen to avoid
it, even though historians and memorists have recovered much
incident and detail that was unknown to writers like Eric Ambler
who staked out the territory in fiction at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge is therefore one factor in Furst's superiority. He
knows the players, the board, the language, the culture, the
tradecraft, the landscape, and, intimately, the interior weather.
He's also an excellent, understated, observant writer. There is a
gritty, gray reality in his work that is absent from the popular
collective _ and selective _ memory of the period.
</P>
<P>
   The point was brought home to Furst in 1990 when he wrote a
column for the International Herald Tribune commemorating the fall
of Paris to the Germans 50 years earlier. ``I got hammered for
it,'' Furst has said in an interview, because the article ``took
off its hat and tiptoed down the hallway of French history.''
Critical letters pointed out how many Frenchmen did actively or
passively collaborate with the Germans, and how long it took the
resistance to develop. It was this controversy that led him to
write ``The World at Night'' and now ``Red Gold.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The World at Night,'' Furst may have wandered down a blind
alley when he tried to incorporate a doomed romance worthy of the
movies. That book ended when Casson, on a boat to safety, dives off
and swims back to France, where his love and destiny lie. ``Red
Gold'' opens in September 1941; Jews are being rounded up and
``deported.'' Casson is back in Paris, desperate for money, wanted
by the Gestapo, and entirely cut off from his old life in the world
of films, society, and commerce _ a world he can follow only in the
newspapers, which report that it is thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Casson's colleagues had natures more accommodating, or
realistic, than his. ``Up in Passy, his former life went on.
Marie-Claire and Bruno, the Arnauds and the Pichards, would be
chattering over after-dinner drinks. Good talk, witty and dry _
life was irony. No doubt they would be talking about the affreux _
dreadful _ Germans. Not so affreux, of course, that one refused to
get rich off them.'' Casson, on the other hand, is a romantic, but
one without many remaining illusions.
</P>
<P>
   Casson is approached with a dangerous mission. Will he establish
contact with the Communists, whose members are well-placed to help
with sabotage operations? The Communists, deeply underground, have
no desire to be contacted by anyone; they are profoundly and justly
suspicious of their class enemies. What happens in the eight months
covered by the book, and why, is not something for a review to
reveal, but it's worth pointing out that the characters have a
strong grasp of political purpose, nuance, and expediency which
reflects that of their creator.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in Furst's superiority to the competition is a
novelistic ability that transcends the requirements of genre
fiction. He knows how to spin out a suspenseful story, but this is
not a mechanical process for him. Casson participates in a couple
of loosely related operations in ``Red Gold,'' and some other
operations are described because they play a role in what happens
to him. But Furst is not interested in a mechanically perfect plot.
What interests him instead is ordinary people and their response to
extraordinary events _ responses that reveal how extraordinary most
people are. Furst is not a sentimentalist, nor does he bother with
political correctness; his characters are complex mixtures of
qualities that make them capable of surprising us _ and surprising
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The five mature Furst novels are interlinked; the focus of each
book is different, but characters and places reappear. ``Red Gold''
is the first real sequel in the series, and there are welcome hints
that others will follow _ characters are carefully introduced who
have no real function beyond contributing to a texture of
dislocation and dread, at least yet. The book ends ambiguously with
the suggestion that a new adventure for Jean Casson might lie
behind a doorway, and let's hope it does.

GIRL MADE FAMOUS IN PHOTO STRUGGLING FOR A HAPPY ENDING 
</HEADLINE>

 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The image of a tiny girl and a young woman frozen in
midair _ arms awkwardly outstretched as they fell to the ground _
was burned into the memory of almost everyone who saw it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hot July day nearly 25 years ago when Diana Bryant, who
was only 19 years old, stood on the rusty fire escape of her
burning Back Bay apartment, clinging to a Boston firefighter and
trying to shield her godchild from the flames. They were only
seconds from safety when the fire escape collapsed, plunging Bryant
five stories to her death. The little girl, 2-year-old Tiare Jones,
whose fall may have been cushioned by Bryant's body, escaped
without serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   Only moments before, Stanley Forman, a 30-year-old photographer
for the Boston Herald American, had arrived at the scene; he
captured the moment in a series of photographs that were so searing
they were published in 400 newspapers the following day and
ultimately won him a 1976 Pulitzer prize. Forman's pictures will be
among a handful featured in a TNT documentary this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Forman is now a WCVB-TV photographer, and he asks: How is Tiare?
``I always wondered how she made out.'' Forman, who would go on to
win another Pulitzer the year after photographing the accident,
hasn't seen her since a few days after the 1975 fire, when she
returned home from the hospital and he brought her a teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   For Tiare Jones, her stunning survival and the brief moment of
public adoration that followed weren't portents of a happy life:
For many years, she continued to fall, eventually landing in a
halfway house from which she now is working to uplift herself.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the little girl in the picture is 26 years old and a
mother herself. Almost since the day she escaped death, her life
has been marked by pain. She has been in and out of foster homes
and has in the past dealt with substance and domestic abuse. Three
years ago, she was separated from her four daughters, ranging in
age from 2 to 9.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, though, Tiare (pronounced Tee-are-rah) Jones
has begun to remake a life that nearly shattered almost a quarter
century ago. And this time, she says, she is determined to succeed.
As a condition of regaining custody of three of her children that
were taken by the Department of Social Services, she is living in
the halfway house in suburban Boston. She already has custody of
her oldest daughter, Antoinette, 9, who has been living with her
since February.
</P>
<P>
   In a Framingham dental office, Jones recently showed Antoinette
a photograph of herself taken just days after the 1975 fire while
she was still in the hospital. Antoinette looked intently at the
picture and began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor mummy,'' Antoinette said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a long time ago,'' Jones whispered, wiping her
daughter's tears.
</P>
<P>
   But Antoinette persisted, asking for more details about the fire
and about the woman who saved her mother's life: ``Was she a good
woman, mummy?''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, she was. Diana Bryant was a Boston hairdresser
who loved children. She was especially fond of Tiare and her
sister, Keysha, the two young daughters of Pat Jones, a 25-year-old
single mother who worked as a keypunch operator for Bank of Boston.
Bryant had volunteered to baby sit for Tiare for a few days at her
new apartment, giving Jones something of a break.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Jones was unaware of the fire at the five-story apartment on
Marlborough Street until she peered at someone's newspaper on the
trolley ride to work the morning of July 23 and saw her daughter's
eyes staring back at her from the front page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screamed: `That's my baby. That's my baby,' '' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She jumped off at the next trolley stop in a blur, and rushed to
her apartment in the Mission Hill housing development; soon after,
she was reunited with her daughter at New England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so little, with all these tubes and machines connected
to her,'' recalled Tiare's sister, Keysha Jones, who is now 29.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was devastating to the Jones family, but the years
before the fire already had been difficult for Tiare's mother. She
was fairly new to the city, having recently moved from a small town
in Maryland, and she was struggling to find friends and build a
stable life for her two girls.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the unthinkable happened.
</P>
<P>
   Strangers tried to help, sending good wishes and money.
Eventually, the excitement around the little survivor died down,
and Pat Jones stopped talking about what had happened. For years,
Tiare Jones said, she remembered nothing about the experience. She
said she only learned about it when she was 12 years old and
stumbled across the Forman photo on a shelf in her mother's
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was too young, but I remember everything,'' said Keysha,
who was 4 in 1975. ``That fire was just the first of a downward
spiral for our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Ronnie, disappeared from her life, and then, only
two years later, the family lived through yet another fire; and
although there were no fatalities, the consequences were
devastating. In the midst of the 1978 blizzard, while their mother
was out shopping for food, Tiare and Keysha started playing with
matches in bed and set their Mission Hill apartment on fire.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Pat Jones was working two jobs _ one at Bank of
Boston and another at Boston Edison, where she still works today.
After the fire, she says she asked for help from DSS and in the
course of the agency's inquiry, DSS asked her to quit one of her
jobs so she could supervise her children more closely. She refused,
and soon afterward, her two girls were taken into DSS custody.
Tiare was 4 and Keysha, 6. The three never lived together
permanently again. The girls were in and out of foster homes for
most of the rest of their childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stupid. I didn't know the rules,'' said Pat Jones.
``That's why I plead to Tiare not to make the same mistake. There
are no shortcuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat never forgave herself for nearly losing her daughter twice.
To compensate, she showered her with all the material things a
steady job could offer. ``Whenever she fell again, I tried to
cushion her fall,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tiare felt alone, Keysha said. ``I tried to look after
her.''
</P>
<P>
   And although Tiare was smart, well-spoken, and good in English
and math, she never focused on her studies at Brighton High School.
Instead, she hung out with the wrong crowd, experimented with
drugs, and had a child at 16. By 25, she would have four children.
Through the years, Tiare said, she stayed in a relationship with a
man who was abusive.
</P>
<P>
   Her world fell apart when DSS took her children. Today, she
said, she and Antoinette ``never talk about the day DSS came.''
</P>
<P>
   But during the past three years, when she has had only limited
visits with her children, she began to see things differently.
After those visits, she would write down her feelings as she rode
home on the T, sometimes scribbling them on a bag from a doughnut
shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose to one day have a normal life,'' she said. ``I didn't
want to be a statistic _ black female, drugs, kids gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the picture Forman took of her almost 25 years ago has
taken on new meaning: ``Now, she says ``I could see how it must
feel to almost lose your own child.''

PLAN FOR PARENTS RIGHTS OPENS A DOMESTIC DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Joanna Upton got fired from her job in 1993, she
said, because she refused to attend a business meeting when her boy
was sick or to work a 60-hour week. A single mother who sued her
employer for parent discrimination and lost, Upton is just the
woman the White House is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Harvey Schwartz, Upton's attorney in Boston, sent a
letter to Vice President Al Gore last week, as soon as he heard
about a new Clinton administration initiative aimed at making it
illegal for employers to discriminate against parents in hiring,
firing, and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls every day from people who've worked 10, 20, 30
years and think they are putting their job on the line if they go
to their child's hockey game,'' Schwartz wrote.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt the White House also wants to appear attentive
to the tensions between work and family obligations. It's a hot
topic around many American dinner tables, a big headache for job
recruiters, and a political issue candidates in 2000 will ignore at
their peril, pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
   But to some, this new idea of making ``parent'' a protected
class under the law, like race, gender, age, or religion, is an
overdose of legal Prozac to treat a personal and cultural anxiety
and an expensive political solution in search of an unmeasured
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether a working parent has to take time off to go to a
soccer game or stay home with a sick child isn't a legal issue.
It's a problem of life, and in a free society, life is full of
choices,'' said Roger Pilon, director of the Center for
Constitutional Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates insist the initiative isn't about giving a mother the
right to slap a lawsuit on a boss who makes her miss a ballet
recital, or letting a father haul an employer into court if he has
to work a weekend. It is not aimed at mandating companies to have
family-friendly policies, either, such as providing on-site day
care or no-overtime rules.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says this is about eliminating a more subtle
discrimination that punishes parents in the workplace. It happens
when an employer hires a nonparent over a parent, believing the
former will be more productive and require fewer benefits. It
occurs when a boss steers a parent off a path of career advancement
on the assumption that the applicant won't be able to handle the
extra travel or longer hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at overt discrimination by employers who,
through demonstrated hostility or mistaken belief, say parents
can't do a job,'' said Bruce Reed, President Clinton's domestic
policy adviser. ``This won't do any good for parents who don't
measure up or won't put in the hours'' to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Single mothers seeking their first post-welfare job are
particularly vulnerable to parent discrimination, some family
advocates say, but it also can be a worry for single fathers, the
fastest-growing segment of the parenting population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is getting at old-fashioned prejudice, and it doesn't
matter how much of that there is,'' said Donna Lenhoff, general
counsel of the National Partnership for Women and Families, a
private group. ``If it is there, it should be eradicated.''
</P>
<P>
   In a survey done last year for the National Partnership, 62
percent of the women and 55 percent of the men said finding time
for both work and family responsibilities has gotten harder in the
last five years. In the poll, 92 percent of the Democratic
respondents and 87 percent of the Republicans said employers and
businesses should do more to help working families.
</P>
<P>
   But are many parents really victims of discrimination? The White
House admits its evidence of the problem is mostly anecdotal. In
the eight states that do bar parent discrimination in employment,
``it has not been a hugely litigated issue,'' said a spokeswoman
for Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who intends to
introduce the White House initiative as legislation next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scratching my head,'' said Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow
at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution and a longtime
economic and employment policy maker. ``I don't know what the
problem is. I don't see a lot of evidence that employers are
discriminating against parents, particularly at this point in
history, when employers are competing to attract mothers into the
work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawhill said she puts antidiscrimination legislation far down
the list of things that working parents really need, such as
subsidized child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``But since there isn't a lot of money around for tangible
things, this proposal could be pure symbolism, because everybody
wants to be in favor of kids and parents these days,'' Sawhill
said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dodd has no GOP co-sponsors for his bill, but the Cato
Institute's Pilon said he expects the legislation to attract wide
bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of proposal is tailor-made for the Republican
family-values types,'' Pilon said. ``They will be hard-pressed to
oppose it because they will be shown to be either hard-nosed in the
defense of business or hypocritical in the defense of family
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, proposals aimed at easing the burden of working parents
are plentiful these days. The Clinton administration is pushing to
expand the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act so it would apply to
businesses with as few as 25 employees. Currently, companies with
50 or more workers must provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for
the birth or adoption of a child or for a family illness. Five
bills are pending in the Massachusetts Legislature that would
expand benefits under the act, including finding ways to pay for
now-uncompensated leaves.
</P>
<P>
   After he lost the Upton case, Schwartz lobbied the state
legislature to pass a bill barring job discrimination against
parents, but his efforts failed. If the administration's initiative
were law, Schwartz said, ``Joanna Upton would have won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court threw out Upton's suit
against now-defunct JWP Businessland because no law explicitly
prohibited workplace discrimination against parents. Still, the
court wrote in its 1997 opinion, ``we sympathize with the
difficulties of persons who have faced the challenge of reconciling
parental responsibilities with the demands of employment.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers without children aren't always sympathetic. They
sometimes feel exploited or discriminated against by employers who
seem to bend over backward to accommodate parents' needs. No one is
contemplating giving childless workers the right to sue for such
bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good family policy shouldn't divide the populace so privileges
go to parents, and employees who don't have families feel like they
are the ones being discriminated against,'' said Barbara Brandt of
Somerville, Mass., a national spokesperson for the Shorter
Work-Time Group, which advocates a shorter work week.
</P>
<P>
   Others find different faults with it. David Rubin, a Boston
lawyer who represents employers, said many companies are still
struggling to administer the Family and Medical Leave Act, and this
initiative would cause ``huge problems'' by creating new avenues
for costly and time-consuming litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Sawhill speculates that making parents a legal category could be
counterproductive. The more burdens parent-workers put on
businesses, the less likely employers may be to hire them, even
though that's what the proposal is designed to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the modern American dream: We can all get ahead by
filing lawsuits,'' said Allan Carlson, president of the Howard
Center for Family, Religion, and Society in Rockford, Ill. ``But if
you really believe that families are important and should be
uplifted in this society, then reducing parents to yet another
victim class is the radically wrong approach.''

   ARMENIAN-GENOCIDE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ My father, Nishan
Kalajian, had the misfortune to be born in the city of Diyarbakir
in southeastern Turkey in 1912, a desperate and convulsive time in
the disintegrating Ottoman Empire. He was 3 years old when the
soldiers came first to take the young men, including his father,
and then returned for all the other Armenians. The pattern was
repeated in village after village. The ensuing slaughter was
eventually given a formal name: The Armenian Genocide. The ghostly
survivors became almost as familiar to newspaper readers of their
time as the refugees from Kosovo are today. The starving Armenians,
as they were widely known, became an international cause. And then
they were forgotten so completely that the people who rule their
land today can blandly deny that anything so awful ever happened.

students went back to school. Within mintues, 100 or so parents _
some broken with fear _ gathered at make-shift information center,
waiting on news that they're kids were OK. Most acknowledge that
the events of the last week or so have left their emotional cups

`SNOW' AUTHOR'S SENSE OF PLACE IMBUES NOVEL WITH CHARACTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
(With sidebar, Book-Guterson) 
 
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first thing you realize during a conversation with David
Guterson is that he's not what the media have made him out to be.
</P>
<P>
   It's true he has helped them along. He has showed up for
interviews wearing flannel shirts, which reporters have parlayed
into a Guterson trademark. He has posed for dramatic photographs in
the forests near his home on Bainbridge Island, Wash., a short
ferry ride from Seattle and the model for the setting of his
bestselling first novel, ``Snow Falling on Cedars.'' He even smiled
for the cameras when ``People'' magazine named him one of ``The 50
Most Beautiful People in the World,'' noting his
``strong-shouldered'' looks and anointing him ``the thinking man's
Grizzly Adams.''
</P>
<P>
   He survived all of this with apparent good nature, but it's easy
to imagine him cringing in retrospect. Guterson speaks with a
methodical earnestness that makes him sound more like a professor
than a celebrity lumberjack, and he has handled the success of
``Snow'' _ it has sold more than 2.5 million copies, a miraculous
performance for a literary novel _ with a serenity that approaches
nonchalance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my temperament,'' he says. ``I'm pretty detached from it,
and it's really kind of divorced from my actual life. The truth is,
you can't just fall into the whirlwind. You have to stand outside
of it and learn to manage it. If you don't, if you just let it all
happen to you, you're in trouble. I'm fortunate that ``Snow Falling
on Cedars'' has done so well, but the important thing to me, and
the most enjoyable thing, is to be working on the next book.''
</P>
<P>
   That next book is ``East of the Mountains'' (Harcourt Brace,
$25), Guterson's much-awaited second novel, which was released this
past week. It's the story of Ben Givens, a 73-year-old retired
surgeon who has terminal cancer. The book begins with Ben's plan to
take his own life before the disease destroys him, but it turns
into an eventful journey to his childhood home amid the apple
orchards of eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' this novel contains a character
that transcends all others: the landscape. It was fixed in
Guterson's mind long before he invented any of his human
characters, and it is one of the elements that always drives his
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I begin, always, with theme,'' he says. ``I engage in a
process of self-reflection, asking myself what it is that I care
about the most, what issues are foremost for me at a given time.
After that, what I want to evoke is landscape _ a sense of place, a
love of that place or at least very strong feelings for it. Then I
ponder what sort of character and what sort of conditions will
allow me to address these themes in this landscape. That's my
starting place for storytelling.''
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Snow,'' Guterson's new book is filled with the history
of its setting, the country along the eastern bank of the Columbia
River. In the early days, Ben Givens' father tells him, a
schoolhouse was pulled on skids from farm to farm each summer so
residents would share the burden of boarding the accompanying
teacher. Theirs was a stoic existence that produced people like
Ben's mother, who died when he was a boy but whose presence lingers
throughout the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a character in ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' Ishmael
Chambers' mother, who had something of the same feeling,'' Guterson
says. ``Both of these mothers are clear-headed, energetic people,
and powerful influences in their sons' lives. I admire women like
that, and I've felt a closeness to certain older women in my life.
It was like that with one of my high school teachers, and it's like
that with an editor I have right now. They're strong women, and I
guess that comes out in the characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Guterson began writing ``East of the Mountains'' in 1993, just
after he completed ``Snow Falling on Cedars.'' Since then, things
have changed considerably for him. Before the success of ``Snow,''
which took eight years to finish, he taught high school English on
Bainbridge Island, rising at 4:30 each morning to work on his novel
before he moved on to his responsibilities. He, his wife and their
four children still rent the same modest house, but he no longer
teaches or struggles to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   He was reportedly paid more than $1 million for film rights to
``Snow'' ``Falling on Cedars.'' The movie, directed by Scott Hicks
(``Shin''e) from a screenplay by Ron Bass (``Rain Ma''n), will be
out this fall. Guterson helped scout locations in Alaska,
Washington and British Columbia, and he assisted in revising the
screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an author, you have to recognize that this is a different
medium with different artistic goals, that it can't possibly be
what the book is, nor should it be,'' he says. ``In other words,
you have to remind yourself that you're a participant in someone
else's artistic attempt. If you try to control it, you're in
trouble. It was a good experience for me. I've seen the film and
it's brilliant, and I hope people will respond well to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he never felt compelled to write a second novel that
would live up to the critical and commercial success of his first.
</P>
<P>
   What has been the most rewarding aspect of success?
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit down at my desk and write a story and it ripples out in
all directions and suffuses people's lives,'' he says. ``I find
students at high schools and colleges with hardbound editions of
the book that are ragged and marked with notes because they've been
thinking about it, talking about it, writing papers about it and
sort of being shaped by it. That's enormously gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   And the downside of success? When Guterson answers he sounds
genuinely uncomfortable, an amiable man who cannot find a way to
please.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unsettling that at readings there are often other writers
present, and they ask questions about how to accomplish your goals,
how to connect with readers,'' he says. ``If I could answer those
questions, I'd be grateful for the opportunity. But I don't know
the answers. I have no secrets. I sense that's what they want _
some mystery that I know the answer to and they don't. I just tell
them what they've heard before. Work hard, and keep on working. I
don't know what else to say.'' &QL;

`MOUNTAINS' TAKES SENTENCE TO LOFTY HEIGHTS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
(Sidebar to Author-Guterson) 
 
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Bass, who is known for writing stories marked by a profound
sense of place, once said that in reading fiction we should
remember that it's not just books that are important, but the
sentences within them.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to think otherwise, to judge a novel by the cohesive
effect of its story, and in many instances that's the way it should
be. But there are quiet moments in David Guterson's new book,
``East of the'' ``Mountains,'' that have nothing to do with what
happens in its pages, and everything to do with what happens in its
sentences _ in the patience and language with which they are
rendered, and in the power that simple description can have in the
hands of a deeply reflective writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``East of the Mountains'' is, at its core, a road trip. Retired
Seattle heart surgeon Ben Givens has terminal cancer and is
determined to spare his family the misery of his slow demise by
taking his own life before illness incapacitates him. Through a
series of mishaps, beginning with an accident that destroys his
car, he and his dogs are left far from home and dependent, for a
while, on the kindness of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   They meet several, and all are unremarkable _ if this succession
of minor characters was the best Guterson had to offer, his book
would be a disappointment. But Ben's journey is suffused with
memories of his youth, of his parents and his courtship of his
wife, Rachel (they were married for 50 years before her death), of
his experiences during World War II and, finally, of the orchards
of central Washington where he was raised.
</P>
<P>
   Guterson's descriptions of these people and places are written
with such patience that they seem lavish. There is one chapter, in
which he traces the history of the orchards and the Givens family,
that is a novel in itself. Ben's mother appears on Page 69 and
becomes so real by the time she dies on Page 77 that many readers
will turn weepy at seeing her go.
</P>
<P>
   Guterson's first novel, ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' was
lyrically written but not without problems, including a too-easy
resolution of the murder trial that was its climax. There is no
simple resolution in ``East of the Mountains,'' but the book's
appeal is not in the destination. It's in the getting there. That's
not a bad trade-off when you're in the company of a man who writes
sentences so well. &QL;

 &HT;    GORE CITES FAMILY'S HISTORY IN BID FOR BLACK SUPPORT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore is evoking his personal
``connection'' to the modern civil rights movement, giving him a
valuable calling card with African Americans as he pursues a
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore name means something to the black community,'' Rep.
John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat who was at the forefront of voting
rights demonstrations in the Deep South in the 1960s, said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Wednesday night in New York, Gore will be the subject of
a special tribute at the Black Leadership Forum's annual gala.
About 500 African American leaders will be on hand for the Gore
salute.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture comes as Democrats are trying to secure the backing
of a constituency vital to its hopes in next year's elections, and
as Gore battles Bill Bradley for the chance to compete as the
party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore benefits tremendously from the near-legendary rapport of
President Clinton with black voters and from the administration's
steadfast defense of affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president's most personal link to black America
came just three weeks before his eighth birthday.
</P>
<P>
   It was March 1956 and his father, then a U.S. senator, refused
to sign the ``Southern Manifesto'' calling on Southern lawmakers to
support their states in defying desegregation rulings by the
Supreme Court. Al Gore Sr. and fellow Tennessean Estes Kefauver
were the only two senators from old Confederacy states who did not
sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a speech Sunday night to the Detroit chapter of the
NAACP, paid tribute to his father's stands against racism, and in
doing so, subtly reminded African Americans of a political debt
owed to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a connection to that struggle and to the NAACP in a
personal way,'' Gore said. ``My father was a United States senator
from the South who had courage. He fought against the poll tax in
the 1940s, and for civil rights in the '50s. He was one of only two
senators to refuse to sign the hateful Southern Manifesto. He voted
for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and he voted against Supreme
Court nominees whose commitment was respect. And those brave stands
probably cost him his career.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior Gore's career ended in 1970, for a variety of
reasons, some of which had nothing to do with his positions on
racial matters. But clearly, his progressive stands on race,
including a vote in his final term in the Senate against a ban on
using busing to integrate schools, endeared him to civil rights
leaders.

Hall of Famer and Gore's sole rival for the 2000 presidential
nomination, has also stood with African Americans in times of
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Following George Bush's 1988 presidential election, a campaign
that featured the notoriously racist Willie Horton ad that
benefited Bush, Bradley delivered a speech to the National Press
Club drawing on his pro basketball career in an eloquent challenge
to the president to do more to improve race relations in America.
</P>
<P>
   And after the police beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles,
Bradley went to the floor of the Senate to condemn the brutality,
dramatically hitting the lectern with a pencil 56 times to simulate
the blows delivered to King's body.
</P>
<P>
   And in a speech last week, Bradley promised that racial
tolerance would be a key element of his presidency, if elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ronald Reagan was president, everyone knew that if you
wanted to please the boss, you cut taxes, increased military
spending and found communism,'' Bradley said. ``If I'm president, I
want one thing to be known: If you want to please the boss, one of
the things you'd better show is how in your department or agency
you've furthered tolerance and racial understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some African American leaders were ``put off by
Bradley's abandoning his Senate seat'' in 1996, said Julian Bond,
the former Georgia politician who is now chairman of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bradley ``seems to talk about ideals,'' Bond added
in an interview, ``but what is also needed _ and is much harder to
talk about _ is strong legal remedies'' to racial bias. And in
that, Gore benefits politically from Clinton's ``generally good
record on civil rights,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his speech Sunday night, sought to build on that
benefit, emphasizing the continuing need for affirmative action,
the anti-discrimination programs born that are under legal and
legislative challenge today as illegal ``preferences'' for
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the critics of affirmative action,'' Gore said.
``They're in favor of affirmative action if you can dunk the
basketball or sink a three-point shot. But they're not in favor of
it if you merely have the potential to be a leader of your
community and bring people together, to teach people who are hungry
for knowledge, to heal families who need medical care.''

 &HT;    GORE CITES FAMILY'S HISTORY IN BID FOR BLACK SUPPORT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore is evoking his personal
``connection'' to the modern civil rights movement, giving him a
valuable calling card with African Americans as he pursues a
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore name means something to the black community,'' Rep.
John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat who was at the forefront of voting
rights demonstrations in the Deep South in the 1960s, said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Wednesday night in New York, Gore will be the subject of
a special tribute at the Black Leadership Forum's annual gala.
About 500 African American leaders will be on hand for the Gore
salute.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture comes as Democrats are trying to secure the backing
of a constituency vital to its hopes in next year's elections, and
as Gore battles Bill Bradley for the chance to compete as the
party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore benefits tremendously from the near-legendary rapport of
President Clinton with black voters and from the administration's
steadfast defense of affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president's most personal link to black America
came just three weeks before his eighth birthday.
</P>
<P>
   It was March 1956 and his father, then a U.S. senator, refused
to sign the ``Southern Manifesto'' calling on Southern lawmakers to
support their states in defying desegregation rulings by the
Supreme Court. Al Gore Sr. and fellow Tennessean Estes Kefauver
were the only two senators from old Confederacy states who did not
sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a speech Sunday night to the Detroit chapter of the
NAACP, paid tribute to his father's stands against racism, and in
doing so, subtly reminded African Americans of a political debt
owed to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a connection to that struggle and to the NAACP in a
personal way,'' Gore said. ``My father was a United States senator
from the South who had courage. He fought against the poll tax in
the 1940s, and for civil rights in the '50s. He was one of only two
senators to refuse to sign the hateful Southern Manifesto. He voted
for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and he voted against Supreme
Court nominees whose commitment was respect. And those brave stands
probably cost him his career.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior Gore's career ended in 1970, for a variety of
reasons, some of which had nothing to do with his positions on
racial matters. But clearly, his progressive stands on race,
including a vote in his final term in the Senate against a ban on
using busing to integrate schools, endeared him to civil rights
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former U.S. senator from New Jersey, a basketball
Hall of Famer and Gore's sole rival for the 2000 presidential
nomination, has also stood with African Americans in times of
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Following George Bush's 1988 presidential election, a campaign

SAN FRANCISCO RAISES FINES FOR SMOKING SCOFFLAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A sequence of increased fines for those who
repeatedly violate California's smoking ban in San Francisco bars
is expected to force tavern owners to discourage nicotine addicts
from lighting up.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Health Department spokeswoman Eileen Shields
announced Monday that Superior Court judges, at the urging of
health officials and the city attorney's office, agreed to change
the fine structure from a flat $77 per violation to penalties that
increase with each infraction.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons who caught smoking in bars will now face fines that jump
to $136 on the second violation in a year and $271 on the third.
The fines also pertain to bar owners or their employees who don't
enforce the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The new fines went into effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect it to have some effect on owners,'' said Thomas
Rivard, senior environmental health inspector. ``The chances of
citing a patron a second or third time are less likely unless you
stumble on the same patron. But owners are at much greater risks of
getting second and third violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the year, when health inspectors and the
police began cracking down on outlaw bars in San Francisco, 78
citations have been issued. While the majority of those cited for
smoking have been patrons, seven owners and one bartender have also
been fined.
</P>
<P>
   The anit-smoking law, passed in 1994, was intended to protect
restaurant patrons and employees from secondhand smoke. Bars were
forced to abide by the law in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Under state guidelines, penalties for bar owners who allow
smoking in their establishments can be $100 for the first offense,
$200 for the second and $500 for subsequent violations within one
year's time. After the third offense, the state Occupational Safety
and Health Administration may be asked to investigate, which could
result in a fine of up to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows local governments to set fines for both bar
owners and patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was graduated (fines) all along,'' said Gary
Clayton, a bartender at the Hole in the Wall Saloon on in San
Francisco. ``Those bureaucrats can't help playing mother, can
they?''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said since the ban was imposed inside free-standing
bars, business has declined.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Joy of the American Lung Association in Daly City welcomed
the increased penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we were hoping for higher fines,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   California is the only state that prohibits smoking in
free-standing bars.

democratic state. (Will include a 3-column color illustration of

``Countdown to `Star Wars,''' outlining the number of days

</P>
<P>
   WITH: STAR FILE: Salma Hayek, the bewitching Mexican bombshell,
is a tad somber. Today, anyway. Legs tucked under her, she's
perched on a couch receiving reporters one at a time. Although a
childhood prankster, Hayek, 30, isn't one to make mirth, as if
being all business will make folks take her more seriously. (Either
that, or she's never been asked which Pop-Tart is her favorite.
It's strawberry). (Will include a 1-column color photo of Hayek.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: VIDEO REVIEWS: Reviews of ``Elizabeth,'' ``Happiness'' and
``Stepmom.'' (Will include a 2-column color photo from
``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CD REVIEWS: On his first new album in seven years, Tom
Waits fancies himself a scarecrow: a kind of '40s film noir
scarecrow, from whose grimy black suit-coat tumbles a whiskey
bottle, a big soup bone, a pocket watch, a post horn and a sheet of
music.

1-column color photo of man stirring a dish in a wok.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: RECIPES: Chipolte Chicken Enchiladas, Peanut Noodle Salad.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CYBERSPICE: If the thought of gritty hot dogs and
marshmallows on a stick has turned you against spending much time
in the great outdoors, think again. Camp-side gourmets have taken
up the challenge and have transformed typical outdoor grub into
camp-side cuisine.

   FORD RANGER: Extra doors are the big deal these days for trucks
and vans, and Ford has taken that concept to the max with the '99
Ranger compact pickup. Just add $660 to the purchase price, and the
hot-selling Ranger becomes a four-door vehicle. (Includes 3-column

Sport Supercab.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SHARP DRIVING: It has rubber floor mats, no air bags, no
5-mph bumpers and a sticker price of $97,100. I've never felt safer
in any vehicle in my life. What is it? It's a Hummer, of course.
When offered the opportunity to test-drive the Hummer, I
halfheartedly accepted. But after a week with my competition yellow
civilian version of the same vehicle that our troops are using
around the world, I came away a fan.(Includes 1-column color
photograph of columnist.)

   EVOLUTION OF THE TELEVISION: Industry executives are crowing
over digital TV, but when will the rest of us start to care?
Despite the cost, though, HDTV is slowly but surely entering the
marketplace. (Includes one 4-column color illustration.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS: Just in time for the Year 2000 bug, comes a

deleted or written over, lost from virus attacks or lost from
problems stemming from installation and system crashes. (Includes
1-column color photo.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY: Over the years, writing a technology column,
I've urged you to rush out and buy faster modems, bigger computers,
more memory for the computer you own, scanners for your
photographs, shortwave radios and even a fancy telescope. Now I'm
going to tell you what not to buy: the Pentium III. (Includes
1-column color mug shot of columnist.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRENDS: It took only a glance at the 268-page program
guide for the spring Comdex/Windows World conference to see what's
going on in the computer industry: Computer hardware manufacturers
are stepping out of the limelight while Internet and on-line
networking services are taking center stage. (Includes 6 pica color
mug shot of Bill Gates.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PAGE INCLUDES THREE COLOR PHOTOS
</P>
<P>
   HIP ICELAND: Perhaps Iceland never crossed your travel radar. It
is, after all, way up on top of the globe. But it's become a hot
spot for young Americans, especially college spring breakers
trolling for an experience beyond the ordinary. Plus, the sights,
such as beaches made of volcanic lava, are awesome to behold.
(Includes 3-column color photo of partiers in bar, 2-column color
photo of aurora borealis and 1-column color photo of statue of
explorer Leif Ericson.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: INFO BOX: Bring plenty of cash when traveling to Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: ICELAND NIGHTLIFE: Always quick to ferret out the latest
hot spot, the media lately has developed a tic for painting
Reykjavik as an Arctic Bangkok, seething with the exotic and the
erotic. In truth, it's basically a small town that marries Euro
ultra mod and Old World quaintness, with residents who display both
Continental savoir-faire and British civility.
</P>
<P>
   ICELAND BEAUTY: Icelanders apparently do not feel the urge, as
Americans do, to put up billboards telling tourists where all the
cool stuff is. It's not hidden, but you have to know where to look.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRAVEL BRIEFS: If you would like to rent a luxury car in
London, Avis has inaugurated a program that it says can guarantee
you the make and model you want within 24 hours of your request.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOOKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PAGE INCLUDES THREE COLOR ILLUSTRATIONS, ONE COLOR PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   LITERARY TITANS: Ernest Hemingway and Vladimir Nabokov could not
have been more different. To mark the 100th anniversary of their
births, there is a flurry of new and reissued books. (Includes one
3-column color illustration of Hemingway and Nabokov.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: HEMINGWAY: Ernest Hemingway once said he wanted no
biography of himself written while he was alive and preferably not
for a hundred years after he died. He was granted the first wish,
but not the second. (Includes 1-column color illustration of
Hemingway.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: HEMINGWAY LIST: A list of forthcoming books about
Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: NABOKOV: On the centenary of his birth, Vladimir Nabokov
has never thrown off the criticism that his novels and stories were
those of a dilettante. (Includes 1-column color illustration of
Nabokov.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: NABOKOV LIST: A list of forthcoming books on Nabokov.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SKUBE ON BOOKS: In a world focused on the conflict of
Kosovo, another book on Clinton's infidelities seems to matter less
every day. (Includes 6-pica color photo of book jacket.)

   PAGE INCLUDES ONE COLOR ILLUSTRATION, TWO COLOR PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   CHILD ALIENATION: The American teen-ager: yearning to stand out,
and desperate to fit in. Struggling to be a rebel, yet terrified of
losing status with the cool group. It is an age of alienation. A
sense of being on the outside looking in is ``typical in
adolescence, from 12 to 18,'' say experts who deal with teens. Such
alienation breeds feelings of rejection. What makes a troubled kid
cross the line into real anger, and real violence? (Includes
6-column color illustration of teen caught in whirlwind, 1-column
color photo of teens comforting each other.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: BOOK EXCERPT: The ability of children to manage anger and
handle conflict is a topic of conversation in the wake of the
school shootings in Colorado. During the next five weeks, the
SCIHEALTH page will feature excerpts of a book that addresses the
conflict issue, ''Tired of Yelling.'' Part 1 will deal with
reflexive defensiveness _ a conditioned, rapid, automatic response
of resistance children develop that limits communication and shuts
down learning. (Includes 6-pica color photo of book jacket.)

OF VICE PRESIDENT SHAKING HANDS WITH SUPPORTERS AND ONE OF HIM
RELAXING WITH WIFE TIPPER.

</P>
<P>
   PAGE WILL INCLUDE SIX COLOR PHOTOS AND 2 COLOR ILLUSTRATIONS.
</P>
<P>
   WILLIE NELSON: Everybody doesn't like something, but nobody
doesn't like Willie Nelson. The ponytailed
songwriter-turned-singer-turned-star-turned-actor-turned-icon is,
in so many ways, a little of something for everyone: a one-man
democratic state. (Will include a 3-column color illustration of
Willie Nelson.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: WILLIE FILE: A box outlining the life and music of Willie
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: PHANTOM MENACE COUNTDOWN: A 2-column color graphic,
``Countdown to `Star Wars,''' outlining the number of days
remaining until `The Phantom Menace' opens.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: STAR FILE: Salma Hayek, the bewitching Mexican bombshell,
is a tad somber. Today, anyway. Legs tucked under her, she's
perched on a couch receiving reporters one at a time. Although a
childhood prankster, Hayek, 30, isn't one to make mirth, as if
being all business will make folks take her more seriously. (Either
that, or she's never been asked which Pop-Tart is her favorite.
It's strawberry). (Will include a 1-column color photo of Hayek.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: VIDEO REVIEWS: Reviews of ``Elizabeth,'' ``Happiness'' and
``Stepmom.'' (Will include a 2-column color photo from
``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CD REVIEWS: On his first new album in seven years, Tom
Waits fancies himself a scarecrow: a kind of '40s film noir
scarecrow, from whose grimy black suit-coat tumbles a whiskey
bottle, a big soup bone, a pocket watch, a post horn and a sheet of
music.
</P>

   &UR; NASCAR (Available by 5 p.m., Thu., April 29) &LR;  &QL;

   ETHNIC EATING: All the signs indicate that we will only continue
to stir ethnic cuisines into our daily eating habits. No place
bears witness to this trend better than the local supermarket.
(Includes one 4-column color photo of Peanut Noodle Salad and one
1-column color photo of man stirring a dish in a wok.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: RECIPES: Chipolte Chicken Enchiladas, Peanut Noodle Salad.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CYBERSPICE: If the thought of gritty hot dogs and
marshmallows on a stick has turned you against spending much time
in the great outdoors, think again. Camp-side gourmets have taken
up the challenge and have transformed typical outdoor grub into
camp-side cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: RECIPE: Skillet Cheddar Toasts.
</P>

<P>
   FORD RANGER: Extra doors are the big deal these days for trucks
and vans, and Ford has taken that concept to the max with the '99
Ranger compact pickup. Just add $660 to the purchase price, and the
hot-selling Ranger becomes a four-door vehicle. (Includes 3-column
color photo of a Ranger Sport Supercab, 2-column color photo of
Ranger Sport Supercab's interior and 1-column detail photo of
logo.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: AT A GLANCE: Fact box previewing the 1999 Ford Ranger
Sport Supercab.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SHARP DRIVING: It has rubber floor mats, no air bags, no
5-mph bumpers and a sticker price of $97,100. I've never felt safer
in any vehicle in my life. What is it? It's a Hummer, of course.
When offered the opportunity to test-drive the Hummer, I
halfheartedly accepted. But after a week with my competition yellow
civilian version of the same vehicle that our troops are using
around the world, I came away a fan.(Includes 1-column color
photograph of columnist.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PAGE INCLUDES THREE COLOR PHOTOS, 1 COLOR ILLUSTRATION.
</P>
<P>
   EVOLUTION OF THE TELEVISION: Industry executives are crowing
over digital TV, but when will the rest of us start to care?
Despite the cost, though, HDTV is slowly but surely entering the
marketplace. (Includes one 4-column color illustration.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS: Just in time for the Year 2000 bug, comes a
software program called GoBack, that recovers files that have been
deleted or written over, lost from virus attacks or lost from
problems stemming from installation and system crashes. (Includes
1-column color photo.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY: Over the years, writing a technology column,
I've urged you to rush out and buy faster modems, bigger computers,
more memory for the computer you own, scanners for your
photographs, shortwave radios and even a fancy telescope. Now I'm
going to tell you what not to buy: the Pentium III. (Includes
1-column color mug shot of columnist.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRENDS: It took only a glance at the 268-page program
guide for the spring Comdex/Windows World conference to see what's
going on in the computer industry: Computer hardware manufacturers
are stepping out of the limelight while Internet and on-line
networking services are taking center stage. (Includes 6 pica color
mug shot of Bill Gates.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PAGE INCLUDES THREE COLOR PHOTOS
</P>
<P>
   HIP ICELAND: Perhaps Iceland never crossed your travel radar. It
is, after all, way up on top of the globe. But it's become a hot
spot for young Americans, especially college spring breakers
trolling for an experience beyond the ordinary. Plus, the sights,
such as beaches made of volcanic lava, are awesome to behold.
(Includes 3-column color photo of partiers in bar, 2-column color
photo of aurora borealis and 1-column color photo of statue of
explorer Leif Ericson.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: INFO BOX: Bring plenty of cash when traveling to Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: ICELAND NIGHTLIFE: Always quick to ferret out the latest
hot spot, the media lately has developed a tic for painting
Reykjavik as an Arctic Bangkok, seething with the exotic and the
erotic. In truth, it's basically a small town that marries Euro
ultra mod and Old World quaintness, with residents who display both
Continental savoir-faire and British civility.
</P>
<P>
   ICELAND BEAUTY: Icelanders apparently do not feel the urge, as
Americans do, to put up billboards telling tourists where all the
cool stuff is. It's not hidden, but you have to know where to look.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRAVEL BRIEFS: If you would like to rent a luxury car in
London, Avis has inaugurated a program that it says can guarantee
you the make and model you want within 24 hours of your request.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOOKS &LR;  &QL;

   PAGE INCLUDES THREE COLOR ILLUSTRATIONS, ONE COLOR PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   LITERARY TITANS: Ernest Hemingway and Vladimir Nabokov could not
have been more different. To mark the 100th anniversary of their
births, there is a flurry of new and reissued books. (Includes one
3-column color illustration of Hemingway and Nabokov.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: HEMINGWAY: Ernest Hemingway once said he wanted no
biography of himself written while he was alive and preferably not
for a hundred years after he died. He was granted the first wish,
but not the second. (Includes 1-column color illustration of
Hemingway.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: HEMINGWAY LIST: A list of forthcoming books about
Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: NABOKOV: On the centenary of his birth, Vladimir Nabokov
has never thrown off the criticism that his novels and stories were
those of a dilettante. (Includes 1-column color illustration of
Nabokov.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: NABOKOV LIST: A list of forthcoming books on Nabokov.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SKUBE ON BOOKS: In a world focused on the conflict of
Kosovo, another book on Clinton's infidelities seems to matter less
every day. (Includes 6-pica color photo of book jacket.)

<P>
   WITH: N.Y. TIMES BEST SELLERS LIST

   &UR; SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   CHILD ALIENATION: The American teen-ager: yearning to stand out,
and desperate to fit in. Struggling to be a rebel, yet terrified of
losing status with the cool group. It is an age of alienation. A
sense of being on the outside looking in is ``typical in
adolescence, from 12 to 18,'' say experts who deal with teens. Such
alienation breeds feelings of rejection. What makes a troubled kid
cross the line into real anger, and real violence? (Includes
6-column color illustration of teen caught in whirlwind, 1-column
color photo of teens comforting each other.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: BOOK EXCERPT: The ability of children to manage anger and
handle conflict is a topic of conversation in the wake of the
school shootings in Colorado. During the next five weeks, the
SCIHEALTH page will feature excerpts of a book that addresses the
conflict issue, ''Tired of Yelling.'' Part 1 will deal with
reflexive defensiveness _ a conditioned, rapid, automatic response
of resistance children develop that limits communication and shuts
down learning. (Includes 6-pica color photo of book jacket.)

<P>
   The founder of Cable News Network and TBS, Turner sold his
broadcasting company to Time Warner in 1996 for $7.57 billion,
becoming the company's vice chairman and largest stockholder.

   In September 1997, Turner pledged $1 billion to the United

serious about running for president,'' according to Newsday.

   LOS ANGELES _ Spanish actress Penelope Cruz is still adjusting
to the peculiarities of working in America _ the differences in
language, the longer hours, the bowling lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to bowl now; I really didn't have a choice,'' Cruz
says with a laugh. ``Billy Bob (Thornton) almost requires it if
you're in one of his movies, and it's actually kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz just finished filming Thornton's big-screen adaptation of
the Cormac McCarthy lyrical western best-seller ``All the Pretty
Horses'' in San Antonio. The film is her second cowboy picture.
Cruz played Billy Crudup's consolation-prize girlfriend last year
in Stephen Frears' little-seen ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' With Matt
Damon headlining, ``All the Pretty Horses'' should find a much
wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, who turns 25 today, is due for much wider recognition,
too. Already a star in Spain through movies like the Oscar-winning
``Belle Epoque'' and the recent favorite ``The Girl of Your
Dreams,'' Cruz will be seen by American audiences in at least three
films this year. In theaters now is the excellent psychological
thriller, ``Open Your Eyes''; coming in early June is ``Twice Upon
a Yesterday'' a smart and funny romantic fantasy in the vein of
``Sliding Doors.'' ``The Girl of Your Dreams,'' for which Cruz won
the Goya for best actress, should be in theaters by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Cruz will still be able to roam the streets here
largely unrecognized until ``All the Pretty Horses'' opens next
year. And that suits her just fine since the Spanish paparazzi have
been known to chase her all around Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot go on holiday there,'' Cruz says. ``Last summer, I
was lying on a secluded beach and they came up to me with a
television camera and microphone. I'm there in a bikini, totally
embarrassed. It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Crazy that they found her on a secluded beach or crazy that the
beautiful Cruz was self-conscious in a swimsuit? Probably a little
of both.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Cruz talks about the good things Spain has to offer, why
she likes mysterious men and the advantages of being a foreign
actress in an American bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You spent more than a year going after your role in ``All the
Pretty Horses.'' What was the attraction?
</P>
<P>
   CRUZ: It's just so amazing, so rich and full of heart and soul.
I had to convince a lot of people that I was right for the part
because I have not made many movies in America. But it was worth
everything I did. It's going to be a beautiful movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The film has a lot of horseback riding. Have you spent much
time on a horse?
</P>
<P>
   CRUZ: I have now! We began training four weeks before the movie
started. I rode bareback five hours every day for almost that
entire time. They gave us exercises that were supposed to help with
the soreness, but the first few days were terrible. I didn't think
my butt or my legs would ever recover.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any secrets to bareback riding?
</P>
<P>
   CRUZ: Find a big horse. They're scarier, but once you're on,
they're easier to ride.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And how is Billy Bob as a director?
</P>
<P>
   CRUZ: Very interesting. He knows everything you're thinking so
he can surprise you a lot. Sometimes he gives you directions that
seem like the opposite of what you should do. But that's part of
his plan. He asks you to do something else in order to get what he
really wants. It makes you much more free and alert and in the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You didn't mind the bowling?
</P>
<P>
   CRUZ: It was a lot of fun. (Co-stars) Matt (Damon) and Henry
(Thomas) had lots of tips. All the guys did.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'll bet. Did you improve?
</P>
<P>
   CRUZ: Not really. Sometimes, at the end of the night, I would
take all the balls left over and go up and down the alley and roll
them all down. The owner would get a little mad, but I would shrug
my shoulders and pretend not to understand. That's when being from
Spain comes in handy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do love about your native country?
</P>
<P>
   CRUZ: I love the people here in America and the way they work.
But sometimes, when I was living in New York, I felt like people
were thinking too much about work and not taking care of the other
part of their life.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, we enjoy life better. Everything is closed from 2 to 5
in the afternoon and then reopens from 5 until 8. People work and
have what they need for living and at the same time, they take care
of their family and take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You were 17 when you made your first movie (``Jamon Jamon'').
The role was pretty sexy. Were you ready for that?
</P>
<P>
   CRUZ: It was a great part, but you're right, I wasn't really
ready for the nudity. But I have no regrets because I wanted to
start working and it changed my life. So even if I went through
some difficult things, I learned a lot. I saw what I wanted to do
and what I wasn't prepared for.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the biggest lesson you learned?
</P>
<P>
   CRUZ: Follow your heart. It doesn't always pay as much, but it's
not worth it to do a movie just for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you ever fall for an Englishman like you do in ``Twice
Upon a Yesterday''?
</P>
<P>
   CRUZ: My boyfriend is Czech. So I don't want to fall for anyone
else because I'm very happy with him. But he speaks English. He's
learning Spanish because Czech is too difficult. It would take me
15 years just to learn the basics.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the film, men and women seem often communicate on two
completely different levels. What about men remains a mystery to
you?
</P>
<P>
   CRUZ: A lot of things. But that's good because men don't
understand a lot of things about women. There has to be a little
mystery. Men say we're crazy, and we think they are the crazy ones.
In truth, all of us are crazy. &QL;

   HUNGARY-PAPRIKA (Zeged, Hungary) _ Driving south from Budapest
across the Alfold, the Great Hungarian Plain, you pass men walking
behind horses, guiding plows through earth the color of Hershey
Bars. The willows are wearing gauzy-green spring outfits, and the
forsythia is blooming. It is March, planting season in paprika
country. Paprika doesn't amount to much in the American kitchen.
But for the Hungarians, paprika is a way of life, a source of
flavor as indispensable to their cuisine as lemongrass is to the
Thais and basil is to the Neapolitans. Each Hungarian consumes a
pound of the stuff a year. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   FAT-COOKING (Undated) _ Fat. For years, it's been a four-letter
word so repugnant to many of us that it only required three. And
yet the best chefs know they can't be great without it. Sometimes
they use a lot. Sometimes a little. No one is campaigning for a
diet dominated by what used to be called artery-cloggers, but in
the high-priced world of the occasional indulgence, where a dish is
valued most for its artistry, fat _ duck, goose, butter or olive
oil, even lard _ is the unspoken ingredient cooks rely on more than
most diners might ever imagine. By Melissa Clark.

<HEADLINE>
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST: HOW TO PROTECT THE SKIN FROM SUN'S RAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the missive that wandered around the Internet
last year, one of the gems of life-advice was: ``Wear your
sunscreen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise words (they were falsely attributed to Kurt Vonnegut as his
commencement address to Vassar College, and actually written by a
Chicago-based journalist), given that skin cancer rates are
increasing at the rate of four percent a year, and one person in
every six will have some form of skin cancer during the course of
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sun is a major risk factor for skin cancer and melanoma. And sun
is the major cause _ along with cigarette smoke _ of premature
aging. Photoaging is what sun damage is called. The results are
brown sun spots, collagen collapse and deep lines and wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing, though. Sun damage is almost totally avoidable,
just by taking certain precautions: Stay out of direct sun when you
can and use sunscreen or sunblock to keep harmful ultraviolet
radiation from doing a little toxic dance on your skin.
</P>
<P>
   A number of dermatologists in this country have spent hours in
the lab, seeking ways to prevent sun damage and mitigate existing
problems.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Dr. Sheldon Pinnell, 62, the J. Lamar Callaway
Professor of Dermatology at Duke University in North Carolina. He
is the medical and scientific adviser to the SkinCeuticals skin
care line which specializes in topical Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid)
skin products, including a line of moisturizers with sunblock.
</P>
<P>
   I am very reluctant to recommend any kind of beauty product. But
SkinCeuticals' moisturizers with sunblock are such good products
with no serious downsides that I can't resist.
</P>
<P>
   SkinCeuticals is not the kind of line you will find on counters
at department stores. It is one you will find at your
dermatologist's office or facialist's salon.
</P>
<P>
   But so many preparations, particularly the ``organic''
sunscreens, can be very occlusive (pore-clogging). The culprit in
this case is OMC or oroxymetho-oxycinnimate, an ingredient in most
over-the-counter products.
</P>
<P>
   If you have small pores or sensitive skin, this ingredient,
which screens out the harmful short ultraviolet rays that cause
sunburn, or UVBs, can make your skin break out. The ``physical''
blockers, usually Parsol (avobenzone) and titanium dioxide, are
designed to screen out the more insidious, longer ultraviolet rays,
the UVAs (or the ``agers.'') But they don't block out everything.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two or three years, the one physical blocker that
has taken care of both UVA and UVB rays is a product called Z-Cote,
a transparent form of zinc oxide, the noxious white stuff that
lifeguards wear on their noses. Pinnell and his research team have
been working with Z-Cote and as a result, SkinCeuticals put it in
their combination moisturizer and sunblock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't tell people to stay out of the sun,'' Pinnell said in
a telephone interview. ``If you tell people that, they'll think
you're nuts. People feel better when they've been in the sun. So I
am interested in people being able to be in the sun if they have a
way of protecting themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinnell said there were three things to remember about getting
sun exposure: ``The most important thing (for) protection is the
right clothing. Stay covered up. Secondly, stay out of the noonday
sun. If you're out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., you've
avoided 80 percent of the UVB radiation and 70 percent of the
UVA.''
</P>
<P>
   The third step is wear sunblock on your face, hands, ears, the
back of your neck and on the line of bare scalp where you part your
hair.
</P>
<P>
   SkinCeuticals products include a very high concentration of
Z-Cote. ``We're pushing the limits,'' Pinnell said. ``With SPF 30
in the Ultimate Sun Defense (cream), it protects people who are at
very high risk.''
</P>
<P>
   You're in this category if you are of Irish-English extraction
with white-white skin and freckles, or anyone with sensitive skin
or skin that sunburns easily.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What I particularly like about this line is that the two
products, one with SPF 20 and the other with SPF 30, go on easily,
don't cause skin eruptions and provide a smooth base for foundation
makeup. Another plus: Unlike sunscreen products that wash off when
you swim or sweat, these creams do not need reapplication every two
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Pinnell's other contribution to the SkinCeuticals line is the
Vitamin C or antioxidant products. His team at Duke University
found that L-ascorbic acid is the only form of Vitamin C that our
bodies can actually absorb through the skin and use. Since the body
cannot store Vitamin C, Pinnell and others have worked to develop a
topical formula that would allow Vitamin C to penetrate and protect
the skin.
</P>
<P>
   How does this work?
</P>
<P>
   ``When light hits the skin,'' Pinnell said, ``it bombards the
tissue and you have more damage than the body can repair or protect
against.''
</P>
<P>
   With products like SkinCeuticals' Vitamin C and sun-care lines,
damage from the sun can be kept at a minimum. In some cases, these
high-tech antioxidant products have reversed minor sun damage and
promote collagen production.
</P>
<P>
   To my mind, these products are ushering in a new age of hope in
a jar and truly are miracle creams.

favor of strict interpretation of the illegal gratuity law. A

that such a conviction can only stand if there was an official act

<P>
   Your home soon will be worth less than it is now. And in a few
years, it will be worth even less. And in a few decades, it will be
worth a lot less. That's right _ less.
</P>
<P>
   Forget what real-estate brokers tell you. Forget what you read
in the real-estate section of your local newspaper. Forget your
dream about cashing out of that new split-level on steroids when
you retire and taking off for some sunny and cheaper clime.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it. You're doomed because of demographics. You're doomed
because of disinflation. You're doomed because home builders will
keep building homes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, your home _ unless you're one of the lucky few _ might
be losing value right now, as you sleep, as you mow the lawn, as
you fix the roof, as you write the mortgage check.
</P>
<P>
   You thought the real-estate recession was over? Just wait until
the Real Estate Crash of 2010.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not a Paul Erdman novel.
</P>
<P>
   In the gray world of housing economics, it is known simply as
McFadden's chart, although adjectives and analogies to Mount
Everest or the Matterhorn are sometimes attached _ and they are
certainly apt.
</P>
<P>
   The chart is the centerpiece of a report written in 1994 by
Professor Daniel McFadden, an economist. Simply put, McFadden
posited that home prices would peak in the mid-1990s, and slowly
fall to their inflation-adjusted 1911 level (no, that's no typo _
1911) through the first half of the 21st century, affecting not
only baby boomers but Generation X, Y, and Z, too.
</P>
<P>
   This work, ``Demographics, the Housing Market, and the Welfare
of the Elderly,'' is no dumbed-down press release, either.
McFadden, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley,
wrote it under the aegis of the National Bureau of Economic
Research for a book, ``Studies in the Economics of Aging,'' which
was published by the University of Chicago Press.
</P>
<P>
   His work, much of it indecipherable to anyone without a
knowledge of advanced mathematics, is based on decades of
information, and it attempts to balance an obvious demographic
problem (the wave of baby boomers entering retirement) with housing
demand (which he believes will increase in retirement locales but
decrease in work locations) and housing supply (which he believes
will increase in capacity, despite limited land in desirable
areas).
</P>
<P>
   And in the time since his study first appeared, he hasn't backed
off any of its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The McFadden chart, and its thesis, though downplayed or
dismissed by some economists, has its believers.
</P>
<P>
   John Tuccillo, the former chief economist for the National
Association of Realtors, shares some of McFadden's pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of layers at which this can be attacked,''
he says, ``but the bottom line is the same: After about 2022, the
housing market begins to fall off badly, and values probably suffer
badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will notice my date is later than McFadden's,'' Tuccillo
continues, ``and there are several reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older boomers, those born between 1945 and 1956, will be more
long-lived, more active, and more interested in the housing market
than their forbearers. It's not until the younger boomers start to
retire that the numbers begin to turn against the real-estate
market.''
</P>
<P>
   McFadden's thesis is also one of the central focuses of the book
``Boomernomics: The Future of Your Money in the Upcoming
Generational Warfare,'' written by William Sterling and Stephen
Waite, an investment strategist and a portfolio manager,
respectively, at Credit Suisse, and published in 1998 by the
Library of Contemporary Thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring war, pestilence, famine, or _ more likely, perhaps _
massive waves of immigration, the imbalance in size between the
baby boomers and the baby-bust generation suggests a buyers' market
for real estate ahead,'' says Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be especially true in many Northern suburban
residential markets when the baby boomers begin to retire in large
numbers beginning around 2010.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautions, too, that the demographic shifts occur gradually,
so it's not as if a bear market in real estate can be predicted
with pinpoint accuracy. And the vagaries of the business cycle also
make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more predictable,'' Sterling says, ``is that the
underlying trend in real estate prices will be generally
unfavorable, and that home prices may have trouble keeping up with
inflation after the boomers begin to retire in large numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the crash will come like a man going bald:
slowly, surely, painfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary for home prices to decline in nominal
dollars in coming years for homes to represent a terrible
investment for baby boomers,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McFadden chart implies, between 1995 and 2020, an annual
inflation-adjusted depreciation of about 0.8 percent per year,
which sounds rather harmless,'' Sterling says. ``But compounded
over 25 years, that results in an inflation-adjusted loss of 19
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Assume a rate of inflation that approximates recent experience _
say, 2 percent annually. In that case, McFadden's projections imply
that home prices rise modestly but fail to keep pace with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Using McFadden's profile for real home prices, today's $150,000
home would be worth $172,000 in 2010, $193,000 in 2020, and
$216,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't sound bad,'' Sterling says, ``until one realizes
that, to keep up with inflation of 2 percent annually, today's
$150,000 home would have to be worth $190,000 in 2010, $232,000 in
2020, and $283,000 in 2030.''
</P>
<P>
   That loss of value on an after-inflation basis will get worse as
more boomers move into retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   ``McFadden projects an average annual real depreciation per year
of about 1 percent over the 1995-to-2030 period, which would imply
a 30 percent decline in real values by 2030 from their 1995
level,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, a home that cost $150,000 in 1995 will have a
value of $136,000 in 2010, if inflation is zero, and $121,500 in
2020 and $105,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``If inflation settles in at about 1 percent per annum, then
today's $150,000 home can be expected to remain at around $150,000
into the 2010, 2020, and 2030 horizon. Even modest-sounding rates
of inflation, like 1 percent per annum, imply a substantial loss in
the purchasing power of the dollar over long periods.''
</P>
<P>
   The detractors to the McFadden chart are many, of course. Even
McFadden has his doubts about the collapse of real estate, noting
the difficulty and the track record of long-range forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm not shorting real estate,'' he says. Still the
evidence is strong that the inflation-fueled real-estate heyday
that many boomers and, in particular, their parents witnessed in
the 1970s and 1980s isn't going to be seen again. Ever. &QL;

<P>
   ``Senior boomers will be forced to accept the unpleasant choice
of selling at unattractive price levels or rethinking their plans
to move south or buy smaller homes,'' Sterling says, adding that
this could forestall a retirement real-estate boom in places like
Florida and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical characteristic of real-estate markets under
distress is that transactions simply dry up,'' Sterling says.
``Would-be sellers, when confronted with poor market conditions,
often just take their homes off the market, hoping to re-list later
on when things improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if demographic analysis is correct, boomers who are
waiting for things to improve may have a long wait indeed.'' &QL;

   HUNGARY-PAPRIKA (Zeged, Hungary) _ Driving south from Budapest
across the Alfold, the Great Hungarian Plain, you pass men walking
behind horses, guiding plows through earth the color of Hershey
Bars. The willows are wearing gauzy-green spring outfits, and the
forsythia is blooming. It is March, planting season in paprika
country. Paprika doesn't amount to much in the American kitchen.
But for the Hungarians, paprika is a way of life, a source of
flavor as indispensable to their cuisine as lemongrass is to the
Thais and basil is to the Neapolitans. Each Hungarian consumes a

diet dominated by what used to be called artery-cloggers, but in
the high-priced world of the occasional indulgence, where a dish is
valued most for its artistry, fat _ duck, goose, butter or olive
oil, even lard _ is the unspoken ingredient cooks rely on more than
most diners might ever imagine. By Melissa Clark.

<P>
   Your home soon will be worth less than it is now. And in a few
years, it will be worth even less. And in a few decades, it will be
worth a lot less. That's right _ less.
</P>
<P>
   Forget what real-estate brokers tell you. Forget what you read
in the real-estate section of your local newspaper. Forget your
dream about cashing out of that new split-level on steroids when
you retire and taking off for some sunny and cheaper clime.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it. You're doomed because of demographics. You're doomed
because of disinflation. You're doomed because home builders will
keep building homes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, your home _ unless you're one of the lucky few _ might
be losing value right now, as you sleep, as you mow the lawn, as
you fix the roof, as you write the mortgage check.
</P>
<P>
   You thought the real-estate recession was over? Just wait until
the Real Estate Crash of 2010.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not a Paul Erdman novel.
</P>
<P>
   In the gray world of housing economics, it is known simply as
McFadden's chart, although adjectives and analogies to Mount
Everest or the Matterhorn are sometimes attached _ and they are
certainly apt.
</P>
<P>
   The chart is the centerpiece of a report written in 1994 by
Professor Daniel McFadden, an economist. Simply put, McFadden
posited that home prices would peak in the mid-1990s, and slowly
fall to their inflation-adjusted 1911 level (no, that's no typo _
1911) through the first half of the 21st century, affecting not
only baby boomers but Generation X, Y, and Z, too.
</P>
<P>
   This work, ``Demographics, the Housing Market, and the Welfare
of the Elderly,'' is no dumbed-down press release, either.
McFadden, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley,
wrote it under the aegis of the National Bureau of Economic
Research for a book, ``Studies in the Economics of Aging,'' which
was published by the University of Chicago Press.
</P>
<P>
   His work, much of it indecipherable to anyone without a
knowledge of advanced mathematics, is based on decades of
information, and it attempts to balance an obvious demographic
problem (the wave of baby boomers entering retirement) with housing
demand (which he believes will increase in retirement locales but
decrease in work locations) and housing supply (which he believes
will increase in capacity, despite limited land in desirable
areas).
</P>
<P>
   And in the time since his study first appeared, he hasn't backed
off any of its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The McFadden chart, and its thesis, though downplayed or
dismissed by some economists, has its believers.
</P>
<P>
   John Tuccillo, the former chief economist for the National
Association of Realtors, shares some of McFadden's pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of layers at which this can be attacked,''
he says, ``but the bottom line is the same: After about 2022, the
housing market begins to fall off badly, and values probably suffer
badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will notice my date is later than McFadden's,'' Tuccillo
continues, ``and there are several reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older boomers, those born between 1945 and 1956, will be more
long-lived, more active, and more interested in the housing market
than their forbearers. It's not until the younger boomers start to
retire that the numbers begin to turn against the real-estate
market.''
</P>
<P>
   McFadden's thesis is also one of the central focuses of the book
``Boomernomics: The Future of Your Money in the Upcoming
Generational Warfare,'' written by William Sterling and Stephen
Waite, an investment strategist and a portfolio manager,
respectively, at Credit Suisse, and published in 1998 by the
Library of Contemporary Thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring war, pestilence, famine, or _ more likely, perhaps _
massive waves of immigration, the imbalance in size between the
baby boomers and the baby-bust generation suggests a buyers' market
for real estate ahead,'' says Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be especially true in many Northern suburban
residential markets when the baby boomers begin to retire in large
numbers beginning around 2010.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautions, too, that the demographic shifts occur gradually,
so it's not as if a bear market in real estate can be predicted
with pinpoint accuracy. And the vagaries of the business cycle also
make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more predictable,'' Sterling says, ``is that the
underlying trend in real estate prices will be generally
unfavorable, and that home prices may have trouble keeping up with
inflation after the boomers begin to retire in large numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the crash will come like a man going bald:
slowly, surely, painfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary for home prices to decline in nominal
dollars in coming years for homes to represent a terrible
investment for baby boomers,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McFadden chart implies, between 1995 and 2020, an annual
inflation-adjusted depreciation of about 0.8 percent per year,
which sounds rather harmless,'' Sterling says. ``But compounded
over 25 years, that results in an inflation-adjusted loss of 19
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Assume a rate of inflation that approximates recent experience _
say, 2 percent annually. In that case, McFadden's projections imply
that home prices rise modestly but fail to keep pace with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Using McFadden's profile for real home prices, today's $150,000
home would be worth $172,000 in 2010, $193,000 in 2020, and
$216,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't sound bad,'' Sterling says, ``until one realizes
that, to keep up with inflation of 2 percent annually, today's
$150,000 home would have to be worth $190,000 in 2010, $232,000 in
2020, and $283,000 in 2030.''
</P>
<P>
   That loss of value on an after-inflation basis will get worse as
more boomers move into retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   ``McFadden projects an average annual real depreciation per year
of about 1 percent over the 1995-to-2030 period, which would imply
a 30 percent decline in real values by 2030 from their 1995
level,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, a home that cost $150,000 in 1995 will have a
value of $136,000 in 2010, if inflation is zero, and $121,500 in
2020 and $105,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``If inflation settles in at about 1 percent per annum, then
today's $150,000 home can be expected to remain at around $150,000
into the 2010, 2020, and 2030 horizon. Even modest-sounding rates
of inflation, like 1 percent per annum, imply a substantial loss in
the purchasing power of the dollar over long periods.''
</P>
<P>
   The detractors to the McFadden chart are many, of course. Even
McFadden has his doubts about the collapse of real estate, noting
the difficulty and the track record of long-range forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm not shorting real estate,'' he says. Still the
evidence is strong that the inflation-fueled real-estate heyday
that many boomers and, in particular, their parents witnessed in
the 1970s and 1980s isn't going to be seen again. Ever. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   ``Senior boomers will be forced to accept the unpleasant choice
of selling at unattractive price levels or rethinking their plans
to move south or buy smaller homes,'' Sterling says, adding that
this could forestall a retirement real-estate boom in places like
Florida and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical characteristic of real-estate markets under
distress is that transactions simply dry up,'' Sterling says.
``Would-be sellers, when confronted with poor market conditions,
often just take their homes off the market, hoping to re-list later
on when things improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if demographic analysis is correct, boomers who are
waiting for things to improve may have a long wait indeed.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Leonora Rocca Phelan delights in talking about her
``darling little homes.'' She revels in the delicate antique French
lace on the curtains and the unique period portraits decorating the
walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got most of the lace in the flea market in Paris. I would
find bits of old lace and old material,'' she said. ``And I framed
every picture you see.''
</P>
<P>
   The houses _ four in all _ took Phelan more than 20 years to
fill with precious items she found all over the world _ each one
small enough to hold with two fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could still play with doll houses,'' said the
great-grandmother of eight. ``I still love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelan was honored last week for donating the doll houses to the
National Society Daughters of the American Revolution (NSDAR).
During a ceremony at the group's annual meeting, she received the
Unity award, including a gold medal that she proudly wore around
her neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a marvelous group of women. What an honor,'' she said,
after the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan resides in Sabillasville, Md., and Palm Beach, Fla.,
where she is an organizing member of the Henry Morrison Flagler
Chapter of NSDAR. She was accompanied at the event by her friend
and housekeeper of fifty years, Annie Stuart, who worked
extensively with Phelan decorating the houses.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan said Stuart's steady hands were vital as they added
pieces to the intricate rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is faultless,'' said Phelan. ``I just knocked things over
with my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   While collecting miniatures for about four decades, Phelan
didn't start decorating and furnishing doll houses until 1975 as a
diversion when caring for her aging mother.
</P>
<P>
   She bought her first doll house _ the American Country House _
from Thomas J. Iocono after seeing some of his work at a fair in
Lancaster, Pa. ``I fell in love with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The house opens from the front in two sections revealing a
removable wing, a vintage bathroom and a primitive American country
kitchen. On the front exterior, an open porch crosses the house.
The interior includes a separate upstairs hallway, bedrooms,
parlors and a dining room.
</P>
<P>
   The furnishings include some pieces marked with original price
tags on the label of Woodward &AMP; Lathrop, a Washington department
store. It also features furniture made in Germany by Schneegass for
FAO Schwartz in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   All four doll houses feature hundreds of pieces _ many of them
rare and valuable antiques. The Cape May doll house includes a
collection of Carol Boyd dolls and several painted Elizabeth
Andrews pieces with an emphasis on chinoiserie.
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas House, dense with charming details, features
miniature colored spools of thread in a sewing room and tiny tubes
of paint next to a miniature easel in an artist's studio. The
studio is a tribute to Phelan's late husband, Leo J. Rocca, in
whose memory the houses were donated.
</P>
<P>
   While Phelan has a hard time picking her favorite doll house,
she has a special attachment to the Georgetown House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the wedding house,'' she said. Phelan decorated the
house to match a special event in her own life, her granddaughter's
wedding. The 1880s house has an elegant bedroom where a bride is
getting ready for her ceremony. Downstairs in a dining room, a
banquet is set up for the celebration, while a baker in the kitchen
prepares dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ``See the little pie safe,'' said Phelan, her blue eyes
sparkling as she pointed to a tiny basket surrounding a miniature
pie. ``I forgot I had that,'' she said, with a giddy smile.
</P>
<P>
   The four houses are on permanent display at the NSDAR
headquarters in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1890, the NSDAR has nearly 3,000 chapters in all 50
states. The group also has chapters in Australia, Canada, France,
Mexico, Japan and the United Kingdom. NSDAR objectives include
``historic preservation, promotion of education and patriotic
endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelan said the well-visited headquarters is the perfect place
for her cherished doll houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an answer to a prayer,'' she said. ``They should be put
where everybody can see them.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Pooling my resources
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ My swimming pool made it through the winter in
fine shape.
</P>
<P>
   Drats.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, I was hoping the earth would open up and swallow
it.
</P>
<P>
   Serve it right, the way the swimming pool keeps swallowing my
money. I can't sleep at night for worrying what'll go wrong next.
</P>
<P>
   I've told you about my swimming pool before. I have a pet name
for it, Ol' Elephant Butt.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of the big crack in the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   In past winters, the water has mostly drained out, in drips and
dribbles. Not so this year, thank goodness.
</P>
<P>
   I'm relieved. All of the town should be relieved.
</P>
<P>
   It was just after I had to refill my pool last year that the
city had to mandate water rationing.
</P>
<P>
   Could have been coincidence. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it takes a lot of water to keep a leaky elephant
watered.
</P>
<P>
   I've since had the crack patched. It's holding, so far, so good.
But that's about as far as it goes.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that's OK with a swimming pool is temporary.
</P>
<P>
   There's always the pump. It's not for nothing that it has the
appearance of a bomb-like apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, sooner or later it'll go ka-blooey.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it burned its insides up. Odd, wouldn't you think,
that a water pump could burn itself up.
</P>
<P>
   Something to do with ball bearings, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I think it was the handle.
</P>
<P>
   The pump won't work cause the vandals took the handle? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Leastwise, I came by my swimming pool intelligently.
</P>
<P>
   It was already in the back yard when I bought the house.
</P>
<P>
   I have a friend who came by his swimming pool stupidly.
</P>
<P>
   He had it built, just last summer _ all the time, me telling him
not to.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, I tried to explain, you use a swimming pool only
three months out of the year _ a limited return on your investment
to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. He already had that part figured out.
</P>
<P>
   He was having his swimming pool heated.
</P>
<P>
   Good grief.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing worse than a swimming pool is a heated swimming
pool.
</P>
<P>
   Heated pools are dangerous. Heated pools will drown you. Heated
pools will drown you in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you how long my friend heated his swimming pool:
</P>
<P>
   Hardly until the water got hot.
</P>
<P>
   Until the first heating bill arrived in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a cold day in July _ and probably not even then _ when
he fires up his pool heater again.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that wasn't all his problems. Sure enough, his pool
has a crack in it.
</P>
<P>
   But not to worry, he says _ the warranty covers it.
</P>
<P>
   Must be a heck of a good warranty to cover something the size of
an elephant's butt.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I'm just joking about my swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   What with the grandchildren, it's something we enjoy more and
more every year. Heaven knows, I can't imagine enjoying anything
less.
</P>
<P>
   For a fact, I don't know what I'd do without it.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep better at night? Maybe.

SAN FRANCISCO OFFICIAL URGES ONE-DAY GAS BOYCOTT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A city supervisor has urged drivers not to buy
gasoline on Friday to protest the dramatic increase in prices at
the pump. San Francisco has the highest gas prices in the nation _
an average $1.74 per gallon for self-serve unleaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the 1999 version of highway robbery,'' Supervisor Michael
Yaki said Monday as he released estimates he made of how much money
oil companies made due to higher gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Gorell, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Chevron Corp.,
characterized Yaki's accusations of higher profits as ``bad math
times two,'' and said the city official ignored myriad production,
transportation and administrative costs, as well as a huge spike in
prices on the speculative markets where some of the fuel supply is
purchased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legitimate marketplace forces brought about these prices,''
Gorell said.
</P>
<P>
   Yaki, using figures from the California Energy Commission and
the American Automobile Association, calculated that oil company
profits over the past five weeks have increased $11 million in San
Francisco and $88 million in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Several surveys have indicated that the price of a gallon of
unleaded fuel has risen 40 cents in the past five weeks to $1.74
per gallon. The national average is about $1.10 per gallon of
self-serve gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The California Energy Commission and AAA figures ``shine a
glaring spotlight on the amount of money oil companies are raking
in due to the increase,'' Yaki said.
</P>
<P>
   Yaki is endorsing a gas boycott on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will have no economic impact on the oil companies, but
what I am hoping it will do is send a political message to
Sacramento and Washington, the only places where the playing field
can be changed for the oil companies,'' Yaki said.
</P>
<P>
   The oil companies attribute the higher prices at the pump to
rising prices on the world oil market and supply problems after two
recent fires at refineries in the San Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding Yaki's contention of profit-taking, Chevron, the
nation's fourth largest oil company, last week reported
first-quarter operating income fell 36 percent as oil prices
plunged 20 percent and natural gas prices tumbled 22 percent.

ARTICHOKES AND SQUID: A MATCHMAKING SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this time of year, many restaurants on the Mediterranean
offer a traditional combination that is outrageously good and
completely foreign to Americans: artichoke bottoms with cuttlefish,
squid or octopus. The best artichokes mature in cool weather, and
the long, gradual spring of southern France and northern Italy
gives them perfect growing conditions. The catch of cephalopods is
also good in spring, and the marriage of these seasonal foods is
probably as old as fishing and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   It's a union that is easily duplicated here with the plentiful
and relatively inexpensive artichokes from California and the
steady catch of squid in springtime. (Cuttlefish and octopus are
harder to find.)
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients are braised in a base of good olive oil, garlic
and anchovy. Both the squid and the artichoke bottoms cook in about
30 minutes, so the timing is straightforward. The result is tender
but still chewy squid and creamy, sweet artichokes.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy and France, markets sometimes offer trimmed artichoke
bottoms, sitting in water with lemon juice or vinegar that keeps
them from turning brown. This convenience cuts the preparation time
by more than half, since most of the work involved in this dish is
in cleaning the artichokes. Unfortunately, I've never seen
artichoke bottoms sold this way here. (Don't even think about
substituting frozen specimens; they simply don't make the grade.)
</P>
<P>
   To trim an artichoke, first remove all the large outer leaves by
snapping them off at the base. Then cut off only the bottom inch or
so of the stem; leave the rest, as it makes good eating. Use a
paring knife or a good vegetable peeler to peel the stem and remove
the remaining tough bits from all around the bottom. Cut off the
conical top of the artichoke, about an inch to an inch and a half
from the top, then cut the artichoke in half from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Use a spoon to completely dig out the choke, the tiny unformed
leaves in the center that may be tinged purple. These leaves will
stick in your throat, most unpleasantly, so be thorough. Whether
for this recipe or another, the bottoms should be immediately
plunged into acidulated water _ a bowlful with a half a lemon
squeezed in, or 10 parts water to one part vinegar _ to preserve
their color until cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning the artichokes is most of the work. You can buy cleaned
squid almost anywhere, even in supermarkets. All that's left to do
is to quickly color some garlic in oil, add the main ingredients
and cook.
</P>
<P>
   Although this dish is traditionally made with a little dry white
wine, squid contains so much water that additional liquid is
counterproductive. I've found that about halfway through the
cooking, you must uncover the simmering mixture and let most of the
liquid boil off.
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED SQUID WITH ARTICHOKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Total time: 1 hour &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   4 large artichokes, trimmed (see text)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 anchovy fillets, chopped (optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds cleaned squid, the bodies cut into rings
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Minced parsley for garnish.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut the lemon in half, squeeze the juice into a bowl of
water, and add the lemon halves. Cut the trimmed artichokes into 4
pieces each, and as they are done, add them to the lemon water.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place a large skillet or broad saucepan over medium heat and
add 2 tablespoons of the oil; a minute later, add the garlic and
anchovies. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the anchovies break
up and the garlic begins to color, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the squid
and the artichokes, stir, cover and turn the heat to medium.
</P>
<P>
   3. Uncover and stir the mixture every 5 minutes or so. When the
squid and artichokes begin to become tender, after 15 or 20
minutes, uncover and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated
and the squid and artichokes are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes
longer. Season with pepper. It's highly unlikely this dish will
need added salt, especially if you use anchovies, but taste and
see. Stir in the remaining olive oil, garnish with the parsley and
serve.

   Yield: 4 servings

COCONUT TAPIOCA 
</HEADLINE>
  This is the fifth of eight columns by Claudia Fleming, the pastry
chef at Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan. Her collaborator on these
columns is Melissa Clark. 
(jt) 
 By CLAUDIA FLEMING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In creating a new dish, chefs often strive for harmony among the
ingredients. In fact, that's the safest thing to do. When flavors
clash, you're taking a risk. For better and sometimes for worse, I
happen to be a risk-taker.
</P>
<P>
   I offer this dessert, an Asian-accented sorbet in a tapioca
soup, as evidence of that _ but of course, I wouldn't be telling
you about it if I didn't see it as a triumph of cooking
dangerously. It is, in the end, soft and sharp, familiar and
strange.
</P>
<P>
   The dessert sounds harder and more complex to prepare than it
is; bear with me. It begins with shimmering, translucent tapioca.
First, I simmer the tapioca in milk, and as it reduces, it becomes
a rich sauce containing tender tapioca pearls. I use both large-
and small-pearl tapioca; it gives the dish the look of a bowl full
of bubbles. Coconut milk, stirred in after cooking, lends a
tropical flavor and thins down the tapioca mixture so that it has
the texture of a light cream soup.
</P>
<P>
   Then I reach out not just for a counterpoint to its creamy
smoothness but sharp contrast in the sorbet: the bold flavor of
passion fruit.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest leap of faith is a cilantro syrup. Cilantro, as
popular as it may be in Asia and elsewhere, is just not your
ordinary dessert component. I transform the cilantro into a thin,
green-flecked syrup with a sharp, minty taste. In this quest for
contrasts, the cilantro works a miracle: it stands out against both
the milky tapioca and the acidic passion fruit. You only need a few
jewel-like drops of the syrup to make the point.
</P>
<P>
   Since every dessert needs a textural contrast, too, I reprise
the coconut in a caramelized, golden brown tuile, which becomes a
raft on which to float the sorbet. It's a practical presentation,
since the tuile keeps the sorbet from melting too quickly into the
tapioca. And it's beautiful, too, with its vivid layers of gold,
apricot, moon white and green.
</P>
<P>
   None of the components are particularly challenging to prepare.
All of them can be made ahead (the easiest shortcut is to buy a
high-quality passion fruit sorbet). The tapioca actually benefits
from a night in the refrigerator: the resting time causes it to
become even more supple and silky.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of serving, you just assemble the dish. It can be
done in a few minutes. The dessert may be risky in concept, but the
results are a sure thing. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COCONUT TAPIOCA  &QL; 
Time: 1 hour 15 minutes, plus 10 hours' chilling  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5{ cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   \ cup small-pearl tapioca
</P>
<P>
   \ cup large-pearl tapioca
</P>
<P>
   1 13{ ounce can coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   Cilantro syrup (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Coconut tuiles (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Passion fruit sorbet (see recipe).
</P>
<P>
   1. Place 2{ cups of the milk and { cup of the sugar in a medium
saucepan. Place remaining milk and remaining sugar in another
medium saucepan. Bring both mixtures to a simmer over high heat,
stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar. Add the small-pearl
tapioca to saucepan with 2{ cups milk and large-pearl tapioca to
the other saucepan. Reduce heat to low, and simmer mixtures,
stirring frequently, until tapioca pearls are soft. This will take
35 to 45 minutes for the small pearls and 50 to 60 minutes for the
large.
</P>
<P>
   2. When both tapioca mixtures are cooked, combine them in a
large bowl while they are still warm. Stir in the coconut milk. Let
the mixture cool completely, then cover and chill for at least 10
hours and up to 24.
</P>
<P>
   3. To serve, divide tapioca mixture among six soup bowls. Dot
each serving with { teaspoon of cilantro syrup. Float a coconut
tuile in the center of each bowl, and place a scoop of passion
fruit sorbet on the tuile. Top sorbet with another tuile. Serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COCONUT TUILES  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1{ hours, plus at least 8 hours' chilling  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1\ cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   2{ tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   7 egg whites, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 cups shredded unsweetened coconut
</P>
<P>
   \ cup all-purpose flour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In the bowl of an electric mixer set at medium speed, beat
sugar and butter until the mixture resembles wet sand, about 2
minutes. Gradually add egg whites, and continue to beat until well
mixed.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine coconut and flour, add to bowl, and mix well. Cover
and chill at least 8 hours or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Use nonstick baking sheets, or
regular baking sheets with nonstick liners or parchment paper on
top. For each tuile, drop a heaping teaspoon of batter onto the
baking sheet, leaving 3 inches in between. Dip a small offset
spatula or the back of a spoon into cold water to prevent sticking,
gently pat each mound of batter into a very thin, even 4-inch
round. Bake until golden, about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Using a plastic dough scraper or a spatula, remove tuiles
from pans, and cool on a wire rack. If they stick, they may have
cooled too much; return them to the oven for 1 minute. Cool the
baking sheets between batches.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 3{ dozen. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PASSION FRUIT SORBET  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes, plus chilling and freezing  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup peeled cubed pineapple
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   11/3 cups unsweetened passion fruit juice or puree.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place pineapple and 2 tablespoons of the sugar in a food
processor or blender, and puree until very smooth. Let mixture rest
for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine remaining sugar with
1 cup of water, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer
mixture, stirring, until sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes. Remove
from heat, and allow to cool.
</P>
<P>
   3. Strain pineapple mixture through a medium sieve (not a fine
sieve). Measure out 2/3 cup of pineapple puree, and discard the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a large bowl, whisk together the pineapple puree, passion
fruit juice, and sugar syrup. Cover and chill at least 3 hours or
overnight. Freeze in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 1 quart.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CILANTRO SYRUP  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   \ cup cilantro leaves, tightly packed
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup light corn syrup.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Fill a bowl with
ice cubes and water. Plunge the cilantro leaves first into the
boiling water for 15 seconds, then drain, and immediately plunge
them into the ice water. Remove from water, and pat dry.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine the corn syrup and cilantro in a blender or food
processor, and puree. Let the mixture rest for 30 minutes, then
strain, discarding the solids.

   Trefethen Vineyards Cabernet Franc 1996, Napa Valley, Calif.
About $20.
</P>
<P>
   A little less fruity, a little lighter-bodied than cabernet
sauvignon, cabernet franc has made a name for itself in the Loire
Valley and in St.-Emilion, where it is the major component in the
wine of Chateau Cheval Blanc.
</P>
<P>
   In the Medoc and in Northern California, it's often blended into
cabernet sauvignon to add complexity and structure. In Chinon and
Bourgueil, in the Loire, it produces a red that is both fruity and
lean at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The Trefethen displays some of that restraint, but the 10
percent merlot and 7 percent cabernet sauvignon that have been
added tend to soften it a bit. A good wine and a nice break from
cabernet sauvignon, but it would nice to taste the cabernet franc
strictly on its own.

normally buy it because of the holes. I prefer to eat the holes
than the chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he makes a little joke: ``If you are lucky, you get extra
protein from the bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are very few blemishes on the rows of chard and
lettuce, spinach and cabbage, even though chemicals are never
sprayed in this three-acre garden. Ceballos' work is guided by one
principle: ``In nature, all is in balance, and if you kill part of
that balance it damages the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   He also applies that belief in cultivating the olive and fruit
trees at the resort, and in tending its beehives. In summer, 90
percent to 95 percent of the fruits and vegetables served to Rancho
La Puerta's 150 guests have been grown by Ceballos and his staff;
in the winter, the proportion drops to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos, 44, a biologist from Tecate with a master's degree in
ecology from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, intended
to be a wildlife manager. But 14 years ago he was persuaded to work
at the ranch by Sarah Livia Brightwood, the daughter of its
founders. She wanted to restore the organic garden her father had
planted 50 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk about healthy living at the ranch, you should be
eating healthy food,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The garden had lain fallow for 25 years, abandoned when a
nematode problem overwhelmed the crops. The worms were still there
when work began, but new strategies have been developed for dealing
with them. For example, a crop of a species of marigold that is a
nematode suppressor was planted. The marigolds did their job so
well that other crops could be planted near them. The area of
heaviest nematode infestation is now planted with fruit trees that
are resistant to them, and with herbs and flowers the pests aren't
interested in.
</P>
<P>
   Being an organic farmer requires sensitivity, creativity and
observation to decide what is planted, and when, where and how; to
know such things as which weeds should be left and which pulled,
and what companion planting accomplishes. Following are some
lessons learned from a stroll in Ceballos' garden.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flowers are essential in a vegetable garden because they
attract beneficial insects like praying mantises and ladybugs,
which eat aphids.
</P>
<P>
   _ Basil and tomatoes are planted together because the herb
repels worms that love the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Plants in the onion family, like chives or garlic, are planted
with broccoli and cabbage because the alliums discourage aphids
from feasting on the cruciferous vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   _ Plants are placed close to one another, to conserve water.
Cabbage is planted with lettuce, which matures first; after the
lettuce is picked the cabbage fills in the spaces.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spinach that grows in the wild is transplanted to beds of
cultivated spinach; the wild spinach is more resistant to bugs and
gives the cultivated spinach more of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a form of crop rotation, celery is planted after tomatoes
because tomatoes take a lot of nitrogen from the soil and celery
needs very little.
</P>
<P>
   _ Weeds that are not too aggressive are allowed because their
roots help retain moisture in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos plans to make herbal teas from the new herb garden, and
soon there will be eggs from the organic chickens that have just
arrived. He also makes about 300 gallons of cold-pressed,
unfiltered olive oil from trees in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``This farming is a low-tech activity,'' he said. ``It depends
so much on the senses, knowing the cycles of the moon, the soil.''
</P>
<P>
   Many spa guests spend part of their stay weeding and planting.
``Some people who live in apartments never have had the opportunity
to feel soil,'' Ceballos said. ``They ask me about the trees
carrots grow on.''

TAXES HAVE BITTER TASTE FOR THE OLD AND YOUNG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I suppose it was the expression on his face that first alarmed
me.
</P>
<P>
   When he left me moments earlier, he had been smiling and
exuberant, but now his abrupt return to the car was punctuated by
those stormy eyes and pursed lips. He looked like his father does
whenever I return from one of my infrequent but highly productive
shopping sprees. He hasn't quite mastered the furrowed brow yet,
but I suppose that will come with time.
</P>
<P>
   My hands instinctively grasped the steering wheel a bit tighter.
I felt my heart beat faster as my adrenaline and estrogen began to
combine like vinegar and oil in one of those green bottles at the
Italian restaurant. I wonder how often they clean those things?
They always feel really slimy and have those strange particles
floating around in there.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I was alarmed because my son was clearly upset. I didn't
know what had happened in there, but I was prepared to defend him
to the death or until the videotape from the surveillance camera
proved that my death would be in vain.
</P>
<P>
   I reached over to turn down the radio as he opened the passenger
door. One of my favorite songs was playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' he said. ``I think this guy is trying to rip me off
because the sign said the comic book only costs 99 cents. He says
that I've got to pay $1.07 for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew! I let out a sigh of relief. This situation I could handle
from the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well give him $1.07. You've got to pay the taxes on it too.
Didn't we talk about this before?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You and Dad have been complaining about taxes for weeks, but I
didn't know you were talking about comic books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No son, not income taxes, sales taxes. You have to pay sales
tax on pretty much everything that you buy except food.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They use that money to build roads and schools, and to pay
teachers and police officers. They use the money for a bunch of
important stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He still looked skeptical, so I tried a new approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you remember the Boston Tea Party? Taxation without
representation?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When was this tea party? Were there any boys there?''
</P>
<P>
   I forget how young he is sometimes. I'm also pretty bad at
important historical dates so I said, ``Here, take this dime and go
pay the man. I promise you, it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he came back from making his purchase, I took the receipt
and pointed out the additional charge for the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to pay taxes every time I buy something?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep, that's pretty much the way it works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All because of some tea party in Boston?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I promise you that next week I will explain that taxation
dates back centuries and blah, blah, blah, but just about the time
he asked me about that Celine Dion came on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I hardly ever get to listen to my station so I said,
``Yep, it was that tea party that did it.''
</P>
<P>
   He nodded solemnly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate tea,'' he said.

POLICE BELIEVE THEY'RE CLOSE TO SOLVING 2 1/2-YEAR-OLD MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Texas _ The rancher was out that morning checking on
his cattle when buzzards caught his attention. Thinking one of his
cows had died, the rancher followed the birds to a pile of brush,
and that's where he found the body.
</P>
<P>
   The girl lay face down. She looked like she had tripped and
fallen, except she was naked, tangled in dead branches and miles
from the nearest paved road.
</P>
<P>
   Her purple face told the young deputy assigned to the case that
someone had strangled her. Her right arm, stretched out like a
swimmer taking a stroke, told him that someone dragged her into the
brush. Nothing told him her name.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy David Walker was 24 years old that day, the third of
October, 1996. It was his first case of a victim without a name, so
he gave her one. He called her ``brush girl.''
</P>
<P>
   He fed the national missing persons data base everything he
knew: She was white, between 5 feet 4 and 5 feet 6 inches tall,
between 110 and 130 pounds. She colored her brown hair blond. She
bit her nails. She had little hands, little feet and an overbite.
</P>
<P>
   The computer sent back 1,000 names. There were so many missing
girls who fit her description that the entire Wise County Sheriff's
Department, even secretaries, made calls to help identify her; so
many that Walker opened a file for every state in the country; so
many that Case U96-10-003 grew thick with dead ends, until a
sheriff's lieutenant called from Oklahoma 2 1/2 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant wondered if the unidentified body in Texas could
belong to a 14-year-old girl who was reported missing from a cheap
motel in Oklahoma City the same week in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Walker listened, but after crossing out the names of 250 other
missing girls, he didn't allow himself much hope _ only a little _
only enough to ask again. Could this be her?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The body had no tattoos, no scars, no broken bones. The first
few hundred matches were dismissed because they had tattoos or
scars or broken bones. The hundreds that did not required more
work.
</P>
<P>
   Walker chased leads alongside Lane Akin, a Texas Ranger who had
daughters the same age as the girl whose body they found.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rancher found the body near the small town of
Slidell in northern Wise County in North Texas, not far from the
Oklahoma border, the two men felt in their gut that the girl had
lived in Dallas or Fort Worth or Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   They could picture it: The killer driving on Interstate 35,
picking a two-lane road, looking for somewhere to hide her. Whoever
killed her must have found the dirt road, must have parked by the
metal gate, rumbled over the cattle guard, snuck around to the back
of the brush pile, then dumped her there.
</P>
<P>
   If it happened at night, the only light would have been from
stars or from the flat horizon, where the closest house was still a
mile away. The only witnesses would have been the night creatures
who lived in the brush.
</P>
<P>
   The metal gate was unlocked. It was dove-hunting season, and the
rancher let his friends come and go. He leased the pasture to an
oil company that had cleared the elm trees and shoved them into a
pile to dig their well.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 cloth scraps the deputies found were tossed aside by the
oilmen who used them to clean their hands. The empty beer can under
the rusted tractor was dropped there by a hunter. The tire track in
the cow patty might have been left by the killer, but Walker
couldn't chase a murderer until his victim had a name.
</P>
<P>
   His partner, the Texas Ranger, was sent to another murder case
after deputies near the Texas-Oklahoma border found the body of a
cheerleader and suspected a homecoming king was the killer. Walker,
meanwhile, had hundreds of missing person reports, dead ends and a
slowly developing picture of a lonely looking girl.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner studied her teeth and found a third set of
molars, wisdom teeth that told Walker she was 14, maybe 14 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The forensic entomologist at the University of North Texas told
Walker the girl's body had been in the brush for at least seven
days, maybe as long as three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   An artist who draws composites for ``America's Most Wanted''
sent Walker a black-and-white sketch of a girl who had
almond-shaped eyes, bad teeth and the look of someone older than
her years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first reports to match the picture came from
Oklahoma. It said a 14-year-old who fit the description vanished
from Oklahoma City, but the dates didn't add up.
</P>
<P>
   The girl disappeared Oct. 3. The rancher found the body Oct. 8.
The entomologist said she'd been there at least 7 days.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't be her. Walker moved on to another report.

IN SZEGED FOR PAPRIKA SEASON: HARVEST HUNGARY'S RED GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SZEGED, Hungary _ Driving south from Budapest across the Alfold,
the Great Hungarian Plain, you pass men walking behind horses,
guiding plows through earth the color of Hershey bars. The willows
are wearing gauzy-green spring outfits, and the forsythia is
blooming. It is March, planting season in paprika country.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, seeds go into the ground or into hothouse beds on
or shortly after St. Gregory's Day, which is March 12. And this is
a region where tradition continues to be served, although some of
the horses have been replaced by tractors.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Betsey, and I saw hundreds of long, low plastic tunnels
full of tiny, pampered pepper plants. Come Sept. 8, the Nativity of
the Holy Virgin, the paprika peppers will be ripe, ready to pick by
hand (tradition served once again).
</P>
<P>
   Some will be threaded into garlands, like the chili ristras of
Mexico, and hung on the eaves of houses or elsewhere to dry; more
will go into commercial ovens for the same purpose. After a month,
those on the strings will clack like castanets in the wind, and
their color will have turned a deep, lustrous scarlet.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the dry pods will be ground into the familiar
brick-red powder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The garlands are not just there for tourists,'' Dr. Gyorgy
Somogyi, a botanist who works for the State Paprika Research and
Development Department, told me. ``It's the same as with flue-cured
tobacco. Air-drying is slower but definitely better. Peppers are
still 50 percent sugar when they're harvested. Air-drying them
gives the sugar a chance to turn slowly into complicated flavors,
instead of turning into caramel.''
</P>
<P>
   Paprika doesn't amount to much in the American kitchen. Most of
us use it to brighten up pale, monochromatic foods like cottage
cheese, yogurt and deviled eggs. That, and maybe to spice a goulash
every two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, what we buy in the first place is coarse, second-rate
stuff from Hungary or elsewhere, lacking in depth and piquancy, and
almost always we leave it in an opened container to dry out in the
deep recesses of the spice cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Hungarians, paprika is a way of life, a source of
flavor as indispensable to their cuisine as lemongrass is to the
Thais and basil is to the Neapolitans. One of the greatest
Hungarians, Dr. Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, won the Nobel Prize for
discovering that paprika is a prime source of vitamin C, which he
named ascorbic acid.
</P>
<P>
   That explains the lustrous skin of Hungarian women, his
countrymen will tell you, and the very long lives of a people whose
diet is loaded with animal fats, starch and sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   Each Hungarian consumes a pound of the stuff a year.
</P>
<P>
   A thousand richly savory, richly reassuring Hungarian recipes
begin with onions sizzling in fat, followed into the pan by several
teaspoons of paprika. Paprika goes into the fisherman's soup and
gulyas (goulash) soup the Hungarians love, giving them both tang
and body.
</P>
<P>
   It is the essential ingredient in paprika chicken, a dish that
conquered the world after Escoffier served it in Monte Carlo in
1879. It goes into the famous Hungarian salami, giving it its
distinctive rosy color.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about comfort food. I can't imagine anything more
comforting than the szekelygulyas, an inspired blend of sauerkraut
and goulash, rich in paprika, that they serve at Kehli, a
red-tablecloth tavern near the Danube in Budapest. But maybe that's
just my Mittel-European roots showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Onions, paprika, garlic, lard,'' murmured Gyorgy Laszlo, the
executive chef at the Hotel Inter-Contintental in Budapest. ``The
holy quartet. I even use them in omelets at breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   For generations, Hungarian paprika was considered the world's
best, far superior to that produced in Spain, California and
Mexico. But the Communists gummed up the works. Today Hungary
controls only about 6 percent of the world market, down from 25
percent in the 1950s, and its paprika no longer automatically
commands a premium price.
</P>
<P>
   Things are starting to change. Small, private mills are opening,
like the Rubin company here. It was started six years ago in a
garage _ shades of Hewlett-Packard! _ by four partners, each from a
different profession. They have long since given up their day jobs,
and their new plant grinds paprika using traditional methods six
months a year, three shifts a day.
</P>
<P>
   Old plants are hustling to keep up. The Szegedi Paprika Co., the
successor to a former state monopoly, was recently taken over by
the company that makes Pick salami. Behind massive steel doors
inside the old factory, with its crumbling, gloomy stairwells, a
modern facility has been installed, all gleaming stainless steel
and immaculate white tile. It could be an emergency-room operating
theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Communists concentrated everything in a few big factories,
and they emphasized mass production,'' said Eszter Salamon, a
vivacious Szeged lawyer who is organizing a farmers' co-op in a bid
to restore standards and improve farmers' incomes. ``Price mattered
to them, not quality. So there was no incentive for the farmers to
take the pains needed to grow great peppers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The factories have been privatized, and attitudes are slowly
changing. The mill owners still want to buy cheaply, but there are
seven or eight of them here now, instead of one. Eventually, we
hope, competition will improve quality, and our farmers will be
paid more if they grow the best they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Paprika is planted in more than 13,000 Hungarian acres, and most
of the 4,000 families that till them are smallholders, as always.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow, cone-shaped pods from which paprika is made grow on
shrubs about two feet tall, turning from yellow-green to red when
ripe. They are thick-skinned and leathery, utterly unsuitable for
eating raw. The plant is a member of the Capsicum genus, Capsicum
annuum, var. longum. A cousin of tobacco, tomatoes and potatoes, it
is, like them, a native of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   (The nomenclature is a nightmare. In the rest of the world, the
word ``paprika'' means only the powder; in Hungary it is also the
word for all of the numerous fleshy varieties of peppers, including
the green bell pepper.)
</P>
<P>
   How paprika got to Hungary is the stuff of myth, legend and
controversy, but it seems likely that Columbus or one of his
sailors brought the first seeds across the Atlantic. From Spain the
trail led to Italy, Turkey and Bulgaria. Either the Ottomans or the
Bulgarians apparently introduced the plant to Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amid this welter of conflicting evidence,'' wrote the
Hungarian-born restaurateur George Lang in his exhaustive study,
``The Cuisine of Hungary'' (Atheneum, 1982), ``we are sure of only
one thing: before Columbus, paprika was unknown in Europe. For all
intents and purposes, therefore, let us consider paprika a
delightful fringe benefit of Columbus' discovery of America.''
</P>
<P>
   However it got here, it found a home in the flatlands around the
towns of Szeged, on the Tisza River, and Kalocsa, on the Danube,
both close to the Yugoslav border. These towns have more sunlight
than any others in Hungary, about 200 days a year, with plenty of
rain in May and June, plenty of hot weather in July and August.
</P>
<P>
   The Tisza, a lazy, meandering river like the Mississippi, is
just as prone to flooding _ some sections of Szeged have been under
water this spring. The flood waters enrich the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Paprika is paprika, you might think. But no. It is almost as
complex as the Hungarian language, which is related only to Finnish
and Basque, as far as anyone knows, and sounds like something
falling down stairs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Somogyi, the botanist, the best paprika comes from
plants that are started indoors, then bedded out in April or in
May. With that head start, he said, they ripen earlier, in August,
when the sun is hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives them 30 percent more pigment and flavor than the
later harvest,'' Somogyi explained. ``With paprika, the redder the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   But most emphatically not the redder the hotter. Hungarian
paprika is made in a number of styles, ranging from eros (fiery)
through feledes (semisweet) to edesnemes (premium sweet), which is
most commonly used in cooking. If Hungarians want their food spicy,
they often add dried, crumbled cherry peppers.
</P>
<P>
   At the city museum in Szeged, which has a collection of paprika
memorabilia, they show a film in which old women complain about
having to douse their hands in water to stop the stinging from
handling hot peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1859, it was worse: the seeds and veins of the peppers,
which contain the heat-producing substance called capsaicin, had to
be removed by hand. But in that year the Palffy brothers invented a
machine to do it. And starting with the early-20th-century work of
a scientist named Ferenc Horvath, the Hungarian breeders have
gradually bred the hot out.
</P>
<P>
   As things now stand, there is no premium-grade Hungarian paprika
available on the American market. Several Hungarian brands,
including Budapest's Best and Pride of Szeged, are sold in
fine-food shops and some supermarkets, and they are superior to
most of the products sold under familiar brand names or house
labels. But they don't have the deep, round flavor, with more than
a hint of the taste of fresh peppers, that you find in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you find here,'' says Lang, ``is mid-level commercial
quality _ acceptable, but nothing to write an ode about. As with
wine, as with other things, the best comes from small growers and
small mills, which produce small quantities of the finished
product, mostly consumed at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Most paprika, even in Hungary, is ground from the stems as well
as the shells of the peppers. That's one shortcut that lowers the
quality, and we saw it everywhere. Another, equally undesirable, is
using metal grinders instead of old-fashioned millstones.
</P>
<P>
   Bitterness is a constant danger with paprika, induced by too
much heat. In the milling process, a certain number of seeds are
crushed along with the pods. They yield oil, which keeps the
temperature down and keeps the color bright. Water is added, bit by
bit, to do the same. The miller must walk a line between slight
caramelization, which produces a malty aroma and a certain
sweetness, and overheating, which produces an acrid, unpleasant
aroma and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   A hint of that aroma clings to the paprika factories, especially
when grinding is under way. Both Betsey and I, unused to it, found
ourselves coughing and sneezing repeatedly, and the sharp smell
clung to our clothes and our hair for several hours after we had
left the premises.
</P>
<P>
   The battle against bitterness must continue in the kitchen.
Laszlo, the Inter-Continental chef, said he always adds a little
water to the pot when he adds the paprika. Kalman Kalla, the
executive chef at Gundel, the capital's leading restaurant, said he
sometimes puts the paprika in only after the meat has begun
cooking, if he wants to preserve the paprika's color and bite.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Paprika starts to deteriorate almost as soon as it has been
ground. Lajos Lakatos, one of the top officials of Kalocsa Paprika,
the biggest Hungarian producer, demonstrated that for us.
</P>
<P>
   At his sprawling factory in Kalocsa, a charming old town with a
cluster of pastel-colored Baroque buildings at its center, a table
was filled with dozens of saucers, each containing a sample of a
different grade of paprika. They had been sitting out overnight.
</P>
<P>
   When he gently scraped away the paprika on the surface, it was
obvious that it had begun oxidizing. The paprika beneath was ruddy
red. What had been exposed to the air was tan.
</P>
<P>
   There are no dates on paprika packages, but here are a few rules
to follow in buying and handling it in the United States. Buy it in
small quantities. Buy it in tins, if possible, rather than glass
(light is also an enemy). Close the tin tightly after use, and
store it in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarians, as must be evident by now, love their food; Joseph
Wechsberg, the much-travelled gastronome, envied them. Born in
Czechoslovakia, raised in Vienna, both close by, he once said that
``to be a Hungarian is a permanent delight.'' But they are picky
picky picky about their paprika. They have a saying, Lakatos
confessed to us: ``One paprika for the mother-in-law, another for
the mother, a third for the wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalla and Laszlo both said they preferred paprika from Kalocsa,
and Lakatos, eager to press a competitive point, said he thought
the alkaline soil around Kalocsa helped grow better peppers.
Lakatos also mentioned that Kalocsa peppers grew up, while Szeged
peppers grew down. But he conceded that the differences were hard
to distinguish, all other factors being roughly equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tasting blind, I can tell Hungarian from American,'' he said,
``but not Kalocsa from Szeged.'' &QL;

BAROLOS PUT ON A FRIENDLIER FACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have to confess it had been a long time since I'd had anything
to do with Barolo, a treasure of Italian wine-making. You know how
it is: so many wines, so little time.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there had always been an excuse to drink something
else. Barolo had something forbidding about it. The Italians call
it the king of wines and, in fact, there is a regal quality to it:
words like monumental and powerful are used to describe it. The
wine writer Hugh Johnson once complained that Barolo ``gives the
palate a wrestling match.''
</P>
<P>
   To me, Barolo was a powerful, astringent wine, like Hermitage
and some old-fashioned California cabernets, that required years of
tasting to understand. It was also one that was expensive and
needed aging, usually about 10 years, to be drinkable. All reasons
to put it on the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   Then recently I heard that one of the better-known Barolo wine
makers, Pio Boffa, was coming to New York from the Piedmont region
to be the host of a tasting of the Barolos produced by his family's
company, Pio Cesare. It seemed a good time for a reassessment.
</P>
<P>
   First things first: Barolo is named after a town in the hills
southwest of Alba. Turin, some 45 miles to the northwest, is the
nearest big city. The official Barolo district covers 3,000 acres
in and around Barolo and includes communes like La Morra,
Castiglione Falletto and Serralunga d'Alba, whose names will show
up on Barolos made within their borders.
</P>
<P>
   Barolo is made exclusively from nebbiolo, a Piedmontese grape of
ancient heritage. Once, Barolo was a sweet wine. In the 1840s, the
French wife of a local nobleman hired a French wine maker, Louis
Oudinot, to transform Barolo into a dry wine in the French style.
The new style soon became the only style.
</P>
<P>
   Pio Cesare started his wine business in Alba in 1881, making
Barolo, Barbaresco, barbera and dolcetto. Boffa, his grandson,
heads the firm now and considers Barolo his signature wine. While
respecting the traditional methods, he, like most other Barolo
producers, has introduced some major changes over the last 20 years
to make his wine somewhat easier to drink.
</P>
<P>
   The results were clearly evident in the wines he opened here
last week, which began with the 1955 vintage and included 1964,
1974, 1979, 1982, 1985, 1989 and 1990. There were also samples from
the yet unbottled 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998 vintages, plus four
examples of Ornato, his single-vineyard Barolo, from 1988, 1989,
1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, Barolo was made in large Yugoslavian oak casks,
some of them at least 40 years old. The grapes and their skins were
allowed to ferment in these casks for up to two months to extract
every bit of fruit, and tannin, which gives wines backbone. The
wines were aged in these casks for eight years then transferred to
large glass jugs to age further on the roof, in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting wines were inky-dark monsters. The wine makers
realized changes had to be made if they wanted to attract more
customers. By 1978, the Pio Cesare firm had begun installing
stainless steel fermentation tanks and cutting the amount of time
the juice and the skins were in contact, to reduce the amount of
tannin. Eventually, all the old Yugoslavian casks were replaced by
small French oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   In an article last year in International Wine Cellar, a consumer
newsletter, the wine broker Marc de Grazia said wine-making in
Barolo had improved so much in recent years that ``for the first
time, we can taste Barolos from 20 or 30 producers that are all
carefully crafted and taste radically different.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Boffa's wines varied considerably from the older to
the younger vintages. Both the 1955 and the 1964 showed a freshness
and vibrancy that few Bordeaux of the same age could ever muster.
They are exceptional wines. The control of tannins in the younger
ones produced richer, sweeter wines with none of the harshness once
associated with Barolo.
</P>
<P>
   Oak was evident in the Ornatos but it was hardly intrusive. In
fact, it helped fashion wines that combine unusual smoothness and
elegance with the dark, smoky character typical of good Barolos.
</P>
<P>
   De Grazia and other experts say that consumer interest has been
shifting away from Tuscany and the so-called super-Tuscan blends of
sangiovese with cabernet and merlot to the wine of the Piedmont. If
true, this is good for the Piedmont wine makers, but less so for
wine enthusiasts, because the Piedmont produces far less wine than
Tuscany: less than 600,000 cases of Barolo are produced in a good
year.
</P>
<P>
   Barolo may be more approachable than it once was, but don't be
fooled: it's still not a wine for casual drinking. Still, that
shouldn't scare you away from what could be a great experience.
</P>
<P>
   Other well-known Barolo producers to be found in the American
market include Aldo Conterno, with his magnificent Gran Bussia
Riserva; Bruno Giacosa, with his Falletto di Serralunga Riserva;
Angelo Gaja, with his Barolo Sperss, and Bruno Cerretto, known for
his Barolo Zonchera. There is also Elio Grasso, known for his
Barolo Vigna Casa Mate; Luciano Sandrone, for his Barolo Cannubi
Boschis, and Alfredo Prunotto, for his Barolo Monte Stefano, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Pio Cesare Barolos range in price from around $35 for the
regular 1993, now in stores, to around $90 for the 1993 Ornato.
Many of the best Barolos, made in tiny quantities, sell for well
over $100 a bottle, but for a newcomer to the wine it makes sense,
both economically and enologically, to start with a simple example,
like Grasso's Vigna Casa Mate 1993, at about $30.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Trying to imagine what war in Kosovo might be like, I've been
unable to resist images from the vivid battle epics of the past
season, ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The Thin Red Line.''
 &HT;    It may be sheerest coincidence that a real war has arrived right
in the midst of a nationwide vogue for a bygone war. But one way or
the other, the depiction of World War II in these two films, as
well as in Tom Brokaw's best-selling oral history, ``The Greatest
Generation,'' is subtly influencing the way I and most other
Americans think about the crisis in the Balkans.
 &HT;    Do these representations of war in the '40s make us more eager
to fight in the late '90s, or more reluctant? They do sober us to
the physical reality of war, but they are nonetheless deeply
nostalgic.
 &HT;    They recall combat in Europe and the Pacific as the proving
ground of manhood, an ultimate test of character, our last national
bonding experience. (In the case of the mystifying ``Thin Red
Line,'' which may otherwise simply be a nature documentary with
soldiers, I'm referring only to the battle sequences.)
 &HT;    Presenting the horrible adventure of war as the antithesis of
trivial contemporary life, the '90s version of World War II makes
combat a far more tolerable concept, evoking a sentiment that might
be called GI Envy. Given recent events, such feelings bring to mind
the old saw about being careful what you wish for.
 &HT;    The bluff has been called; our country finds itself enmeshed in
a rapidly escalating European conflict and faced with dire choices
about just how much sacrifice we are willing to make. Do we really
desire the moral cauldron of war? Or do we just like the way it
looks at the cineplex?
 &HT;    Even in its first days, the conflict presented itself as a
miniaturized and modernized version of what we've seen on the
screen. Early reports were peppered with distinctly Spielbergian
plot lines and references: the rescue mission behind enemy lines
that endangers many to save one, the lumbering B-52 bombers still
in service after all these years.
 &HT;    But the most significant connection may be the way World War II
creates a rationale for involvement in Kosovo. Many people, both
inside and outside the Clinton administration, have drawn the
parallel: Once again we're fighting alongside our allies to stop an
expansionist power and forestall the mass murder of a helpless
ethnic minority.
 &HT;    In the analogy, Milosevic is a low-rent Hitler; his ethnic
cleansing, a B-movie Holocaust.
 &HT;    Of course, the suggestion that America's main goal was to save
Jews from Hitler is the revisionist product of a post-Holocaust
consciousness. But the larger image is not irrelevant. Because in
many ways our involvement in Kosovo is an expression of the same
theme that informs Brokaw's book and Spielberg's movie.
 &HT;    Just beneath the surface, these works simmer with the self-doubt
of the children of the World War II vets, who never heard a simple
call for sacrifice, even when their turn came in Vietnam. As baby
boomers and as Democrats, Clinton and his contemporaries _
Spielberg among them _ are still looking for a chance to show their
bona fides, to prove that it was the Vietnam War that they objected
to, not the risk and sacrifice of war per se.
 &HT;    In this sense, nostalgia for World War II seems less an
expression of regret about the past than a yearning for the clear
moral imperative their generation never faced.
 &HT;    As powerful as these feelings are, however, it's important to
resist imagining Tom Hanks in Pristina or viewing Kosovo as the
antidote to Vietnam. Involvement in a war in the Balkans is not
likely to resemble the World War II either in the scale of the harm
it does to the United States or in the morally uplifting fringe
benefits it offers.
 &HT;    For one thing, America's Army has changed. Instead of a draft,
which distributes risk fairly, we have a volunteer force that hires
mainly minorities and working-class whites to bear the burden on
behalf of those with brighter prospects. Random sample: Two of
three soldiers captured on the Macedonian border last week had
Hispanic surnames.
 &HT;    For another thing, war itself has changed. Even fighting on the
ground can no longer be expected to involve the tests of courage
and endurance we recall from the movies. Ground wars are now
mechanized and anonymous, more likely to risk dozens of lives than
tens of thousands.
 &HT;    Finally, and most important, the country is a far different
place than it was in the '40s. After Vietnam, a nondefensive war
that costs many American lives is likely to be more socially
divisive than unifying.
 &HT;    These aren't arguments against intervention in the Balkans.
They're arguments against a sentimental intervention. Even more
than people Bill Clinton's age, those of us born after the 1950s
lack any kind of personal relationship to war.
 &HT;    My generation's knowledge of what war means comes mainly from
popular culture. And when you have no fixed point of experience and
plausible arguments are being made on all sides, popular narratives
take on an even greater persuasive power.
 &HT;    There's a saying that the generals always fight the previous
war. We erred in Vietnam by thinking of ourselves as the omnipotent
victors of World War II. After Vietnam, the military tried to avoid
exposing troops to danger under any circumstances.
 &HT;    We may already have misjudged the battle with Milosevic by
assuming his forces would immediately collapse under strategic
bombing, as in the gulf war. But lacking a firsthand sense of what
war could mean for our country may actually be an advantage when it
comes to trying to think clearly about Kosovo.
 &HT;    Americans for whom the experience of massive conflict is
increasingly remote just need to resist the temptation to fight the
last war movie.

 &HT;    I learned this in my years as a foreign correspondent in Africa.
It was my job to try to get you involved in the conflicts there, to
engage you in the way that you have now become so engaged in
Kosovo. Mostly, I failed.
 &HT;    The wars I covered were obscure. They were in places that did
not affect ``vital interests.'' The conflicts were devoid of the
high-tech footage taken by missile-mounted cameras; to outsiders
the people involved looked and sounded confusingly alike. Their
courage _ the kind of courage presented by a life with nothing left
to lose but itself _ was often mistaken for the myth of Third World
fatalism. Worst of all, in the atrocity ratings war, both the
casualties and the perpetrators were black.
 &HT;    And so I found you weren't particularly interested in an old
chief in Matabeleland, standing against a blood-orange sun and
defying a squad of murderous soldiers. ``I must speak the truth and
shame the devil,'' he pronounced.
 &HT;    Nor were you interested in Bongali Dube, a thin young man who
led me up a small hill to a pile of bones. ``This is my father,''
he said, as if introducing me to a living man. He had been warned
by soldiers not to bury the body, and it had been eaten by dogs.
 &HT;    Nor were you even interested in the Ugandan town of Mbale,
nestled beneath the towering green cone of Mount Elgon, where the
old Edwardian clock tower had been used as a backdrop for a firing
squad; corpses were still sprawled against it. When the clock
struck noon they shivered with each chime.
 &HT;    The hospital there was empty, except for those too ill to flee.
A rivulet of blood still flowing from under a door led us to a

 &HT;    How can anyone decide what, in this parade of Hogarthian horrors
all clamoring for attention, to zoom in on? Whose suffering do we
broadcast as representative? The family whose father was dispatched
in a particularly gory way? The one that speaks English? Of course,
the most telegenic win the audition.
 &HT;    The ``victims'' instinctively understand this. They are not
interested in hand-holding or in our bogus words of small comfort;
they have no use for our threadbare empathy. They know that come
nightfall we will be back in the Hotel Splendide, while they still
sleep in the open. They understand that we are simply there to
amplify their suffering to a far wider audience. I remember a man
in Matabeleland.
 &HT;    ``We hope you put our problems on the World Service,'' he said
in halting English. ``Otherwise our future will run out. Surely,
surely.'' He gave a solemn bow and shook my hand.
 &HT;    But this faith is often misplaced. What light we can shed on
refugees' plight usually falls too late. The slow and deliberate
shuffle toward the ethnic endgame in Kosovo, so obvious to all of
us who had been there, elbowed its way to the top of the evening
lineup only when it was already too late to prevent.
 &HT;    And the attention span of war correspondents is only as long as
that of our viewers. When your finger hits the remote, we must
leave and seek out a more entertaining tragedy.
 &HT;    The terrible reality is that the more visible the suffering, the
more we get on the air. We grow with the story. So we end up as
practitioners of the ``something must be done'' school of
journalism, automatic advocates of intervention _ as much out of
professional self-interest as genuine humanitarian concern.
 &HT;    Most of us are attracted to this job by the glamour of it. But
in the end, protracted exposure to violence and tragedy can be
highly corrosive. Even those who no longer deeply feel other
people's suffering become prisoners of their own harrowing
anecdotes. Like Scheherazade in ``The Arabian Nights,'' we live for
only as long as our stories engage you.
 &HT;    So is Kosovo a ``good'' war for the media? The viewing
experience can feel like a session with a Sony Play Station
followed by a Bombing Tactics 101 seminar. And there are only so
many times you can watch an F-16 take off from Aviano before you
reach for the remote.
 &HT;    But in their favor, the Albanians make empathy-positive
refugees, and there is the added frisson of Russian saber rattling
just out of theater.
 &HT;    Although it's hard to imagine that their situation could be any
worse, in one sense the Kosovars are a lucky people. An accident of
geography has ordained that their fate, unlike that of so many,
many others who suffer in media silence, is relevant to our vital

 FOR RELEASE: APRIL 25 or thereafter  
 By BLAINE HARDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Until Milo Djukanovic's new best friends in the United States
and Western Europe began to drop bombs on Montenegro in late March,
life had been going along swimmingly for the handsome young
president of this Yugoslav republic.
 &HT;    Just 37 years old, built like an NFL linebacker, packaged in
dark Italian suits, married to an attractive blonde and hailed by
voters as Milo the Blade, Djukanovic (djew-KAHN-oh-vich) has been
playing a deliciously wicked game of chicken with the Serbian
dictator Slobodan Milosevic.
 &HT;    Before bombs and cruise missiles began to rain on Yugoslavia,
the Montenegrin president even seemed to be winning.
 &HT;    For the first time since 1918, when Serbia annexed this
mountainous, Connecticut-size republic on the Adriatic Sea and
turned it into a perennial Yugoslav little brother, Montenegro was
moving toward an independent and democratic future linked to the
economies of Western Europe and the United States.
 &HT;    Milosevic, so tactically brilliant in using ethnic hate to
consolidate power, wasn't able to get a grip on the republic's
650,000 residents, even though he ruled 15 times as many people and
more than six times as much land and commanded the formidable
Yugoslav army.
 &HT;    The Montenegrin president has challenged Milosevic with an
impudent Balkan mix of populism, police muscle, cigarette smuggling
and wisecracks about Milosevic's wife. Instead of howling about
historical wrongs, whipping up nationalistic paranoia and ordering
ethnic cleansing, Milo the Blade has preached free-market
prosperity and eased ethnic tensions by securing the civil rights
of his republic's Muslim and Albanian minorities.
 &HT;    Although Djukanovic tested and taunted Milosevic, he took care
never to say or do anything anti-Serb. He never lost sight of who
had the tanks and stopped short of a direct confrontation that
could bring out the Yugoslav army.
 &HT;    Montenegro and Serbia are all that's left of the six republics
that once made up Yugoslavia. Under the federal Constitution, they
are supposedly equal, but larger Serbia has always dominated.
 &HT;    And Djukanovic has remained immune to Tin Pot Leader Syndrome, a
dizzying and endemic Balkan malady that infected his next-door
neighbor, Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, whose
nationalist swagger terrified the Serb minority and helped provoke
a war with Serbia.
 &HT;    Djukanovic is no choirboy. He started out in public life 10
years ago as a Communist enforcer for Milosevic. As one of the Serb
leader's handpicked henchmen in Montenegro, he developed a
state-sponsored air-and-sea smuggling operation that,
paradoxically, gave him the financial resources to slip free of
Milosevic's iron grip and evolve into a Balkan rarity _ a democrat.
 &HT;    The U.S. State Department says it believes Djukanovic's
conversion is real, and so do the handful of long-suffering
human-rights activists who have watched him rise to power. His
bully-boy past is unsavory, even criminal, they say, but he came of
age in a very bad Balkan neighborhood where smart democrats with
popular support and the guts (and police power) to stand up to
Milosevic are hard to find.
 &HT;    The region desperately needs a hero, and Djukanovic is perhaps
the one leader whom the West can rally around.
 &HT;    Yet NATO bombs have changed all that. They have belied
Djukanovic's promise to voters that a turn to the West would
produce peace and wealth. Instead, the bombs have emboldened his
enemies who, with Milosevic's conniving, have already tried to
overthrow his government by force.
 &HT;    Many Montenegrins now consider it cowardly and traitorous to
turn their backs on their embattled Serb neighbors. The bombs mean
that before this story is printed Djukanovic could be put in prison
or killed.
 &HT;    I met him in the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica late on a
night in early April. He was holed up inside the Presidency
Building, which was encircled by Special Forces police officers
wearing camouflage combat uniforms and Israeli-made body armor and
carrying Israeli-made automatic weapons.
 &HT;    After passing through the police gantlet, the metal detector and
the passport review, I was kept waiting for about half an hour in a
barren room with a single fluorescent tube that flicked on and off.
 &HT;    The president's office was nicer. The lights worked. The
curtains were heavy; the rug, plush. Out on the street, nearly all
of the police had been strikingly tall, dark and beefy. So was
Djukanovic. He was also immaculately turned out, considering the
hour and the circumstances, in a starched white shirt and dark blue
suit. His brown hair was freshly trimmed and just barely flecked
with gray.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, he spoke in the stiff bureaucratic locution of the
young Communist that he once was, larding his sentences with
references to ``interlocutors'' and ``democratic structures.'' But
after a few minutes of conversation I noticed that, unlike other
Balkan leaders, he answered questions directly, without taking off
on insufferably self-serving rants about how his people have been
wronged and misunderstood for centuries.
 &HT;    The NATO bombings, the West's campaign to force Milosevic to
halt his army's assault on ethnic Albanians in the Serb province of
Kosovo, had started 12 nights earlier. Some of the strikes have hit
Montenegro, where the Yugoslav army has outposts. Whatever effect
those bombings were having in Kosovo, they were an unqualified
disaster for the man standing in front of me.
 &HT;    Before the bombs, two elections had shown that, by a narrow
margin, Montenegrins approved of Djukanovic's shift to the West and
of his prickly criticism of Milosevic. Now, though, the president
did not bother pretending that he still had the support of his
people. The bombs have already remade politics here.
 &HT;    On the evening he received me, more than 20,000 Montenegrins had
gathered just four blocks from the president's office for a
``Muzicki Hepening'' in the city's central square. The rock
concert, the largest public gathering here in years, was organized
by the pro-Milosevic Socialist People's Party to protest the NATO
strikes.
 &HT;    The noisy crowd carried framed photographs of Milosevic and
posters that read, ``Monica Fell to Her Knees Before Clinton, But
We Won't!'' They applauded speeches that glorified the Yugoslav
army's campaign against the Kosovars. Many Montenegrins were
clamoring for the president's head.
 &HT;    ``Djukanovic is a traitor,'' said Dejan Cvijanovic, a
28-year-old computer technician. ``There are a great number of
people who voted for him who now have turned against him. I hope
there is a coup soon.'' Djukanovic had been hearing the same
belligerent stuff, he told me.
 &HT;    Hundreds of his police officers had watched the concert from the
edges of the square. He had monitored it from his office, and said
he was concerned about similar gatherings that were scheduled for
the coming week. I asked if he was afraid of Milosevic.
 &HT;    ``No,'' he said. ``But I have no illusions. As long as Slobodan
Milosevic is in the political life of Yugoslavia, he will do all he
can think of both against Montenegro and against myself.''
 &HT;    But predicting what Milosevic might or might not do has always
been a fool's game. If there were a confrontation in Montenegro,
where nearly every adult male owns a gun, it could easily escalate
into a dreadful civil war.
 &HT;    It was all so much simpler before the NATO bombs began falling,
Djukanovic kept telling me in his bunkered office. All he had to do
was outfox a dictator who, in the words of the last U.S. ambassador
to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmermann, is the ``slickest con man'' in
the Balkans.
 &HT;    The outfoxing began imperceptibly. Ten years ago, Djukanovic was
thought of _ if he was thought of at all _ as merely a young,
hard-line puppet of Milosevic. The Serb leader had plucked him from
the ranks of the League of Communists in Montenegro to help lead
something Milosevic called the ``antibureaucratic revolution.''
 &HT;    This was reform-sounding double talk for a power grab. Milosevic
pushed aside older Communists still loyal to Tito's version of
Yugoslavia, a place where Serb nationalism was crushed by the power
of the state. Djukanovic helped his Serbian mentor sweep away the
old gray cadres. In return, Milosevic crowned him in 1991 as prime
minister of Montenegro. Just 29, he was the youngest prime minister
in Europe.
 &HT;    The United Nations slapped economic sanctions on Yugoslavia in
1991 at the start of the Bosnian war. Djukanovic, an economist by
training and a pragmatist by nature, quickly figured out how to
profit from them. For a number of years, around 2 o'clock every
morning, several giant Russian-made transport planes landed at the
airport on the edge of the capital. The planes brought in American
and European cigarettes, which were trucked to the coast and
smuggled by boat to Italy.
 &HT;    Djukanovic's government imposed a ``transit fee,'' which,
according to Perovic, the foreign minister, added about $30 million
a year to the republic's coffers. That's not a lot of money by
European standards, but with an annual budget of just $270 million,
the Montenegro government was relying on smuggling for more than 10
percent of its revenue. (NATO bombing, of course, put an end to the
plane landings.)
 &HT;    Djukanovic funneled most of the money into government salaries
and pensions, which in the mid-1990s his government managed to pay
on time. At such budgetary games, he was more skilled than
Milosevic in Serbia, where pensions and salaries almost always ran
six to eight months late, despite equally rampant smuggling. While
Montenegrins widely believed that Djukanovic was creaming off some
of the profits, they didn't much care.
 &HT;    Unemployment was near 40 percent. A decade of war had ruined the
tourist industry. ``Everyone in Montenegro thought that finally
there was someone in government who knew how to create money,''
said Srdan Darmanovic, a former member of the Yugoslav Parliament
and a Montenegrin human-rights lawyer.
 &HT;    During these years, Djukanovic never said a disparaging word in
public about Milosevic, although he insisted in our interview that
he criticized him to his face in private meetings in Belgrade. Such
public loyalty, however, did not prevent members of the Milosevic
family from getting mad at Djukanovic, who was making money that he
wasn't sharing with them.
 &HT;    Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, attacked him in her weekly
newspaper column as the most notorious smuggler in Yugoslavia. It
was a bold and characteristically mendacious accusation. Her only
son, Marko, a gangster who carried a gun and routinely wrecked
expensive racing cars, ran a large cigarette, alcohol and fuel
smuggling operation in Serbia.
 &HT;    Playing to widespread resentment of Milosevic's wife, whom many
Montenegrins and Serbs regard as a low-wattage Stalinist shrew,
Djukanovic countered that she was an irrelevant woman whose
Chinese-oriented Marxist party, the Yugoslav United Left, was so
small that its entire membership could fit on a bus.
 &HT;    Djukanovic waited, however, until her husband seemed to be
losing power before announcing that he wasn't a fan of Milosevic.
In late 1996 and early 1997, when the Serbian leader was struggling
through three months of mass street demonstrations in Belgrade,
Djukanovic said that Milosevic was a politician of the past, that
he did not have a future in Yugoslavia and that Yugoslavia had no
future with him.
 &HT;    When I asked about the smuggling, Djukanovic vehemently denied
rising to power by illegality. Officials in his government, though,
openly concede that it was the only way to make ends meet under
sanctions. They said Djukanovic has tried to attract foreign
investment and legitimate business. Imitating post-Communist
leaders from Poland to Bulgaria, he has announced plans to sell off
state-owned industry. NATO bombings, of course, have put such
reforms on hold.
 &HT;    Besides building a financial power base, Djukanovic had to build
a political machine as well. He did this in a most un-Balkan way,
by advocating ethnic tolerance. The contrast with Milosevic was
nothing short of amazing.
 &HT;    As for Kosovo, Djukanovic has called Milosevic's campaign of
violent ethnic cleansing ``insane, autistic and autocratic.'' He
attributes the catastrophe there to what he has said were years of
neglect by the Serbian leader, during which he refused to negotiate
with moderate Kosovar politicians.
 &HT;    He told me that months before the NATO campaign began, he warned
Western governments that bombing would only make things far worse
for the Kosovars. He said he advised the West to support the
democratic opposition in Serbia and in Kosovo and to show some
patience.
 &HT;    Two nights after Djukanovic and I spoke, a few NATO bombs
exploded near Podgorica _ the first such attacks in Montenegro in a
week.
 &HT;    To find out why NATO was bombing there, I called Robert Gelbard,
the U.S. special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, in Washington, who
was eager to explain. Gelbard said he had already been on the phone
that morning with Djukanovic, reassuring him that the bombings were
merely a response to the Second Yugoslav Army, which had fired a
land-to-air missile at NATO planes flying over Montenegro on their
way to Serbia. The strike was not part of a new offensive campaign.
 &HT;    ``From the very beginning of the air campaign, we knew _ and we
let Djukanovic know _ that there were certain minimal army targets
that we were going to have to hit in Montenegro,'' he said.
 &HT;    Gelbard then shifted conversation away from the awkward matter
of bombing his friend and talked about what the Clinton
administration was doing to help Djukanovic. It had just decided to
give the Montenegro government $10 million to help pay for
pensions, salaries and social programs. American money, via the
United Nations, was also helping to pay for the care of the
estimated 35,000 Kosovar refugees who have poured into the
republic.
 &HT;    In addition, he said, Washington had exempted Montenegro from
economic sanctions growing out of the crisis and was urging
Congress to approve large business loans for the area. And it was
training Montenegrin diplomats and granting American landing rights
to Montenegrin Airlines.
 &HT;    ``We don't support secession or independence for Montenegro,''
he said, ``but we do support what Djukanovic is doing. He has
support at the highest levels in this administration. His politics
and his economic policies are a good model for all of Yugoslavia
and a particularly good model for the opposition inside Serbia.''
But Washington, he added, had cut no deal to bail out Montenegro in
case Milosevic's loyal Yugoslav army attacks.
 &HT;    Djukanovic's game of chicken was still on.

 FOR RELEASE: APRIL 25 or thereafter  
 By BLAINE HARDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Until Milo Djukanovic's new best friends in the United States
and Western Europe began to drop bombs on Montenegro in late March,
life had been going along swimmingly for the handsome young
president of this Yugoslav republic.
 &HT;    Just 37 years old, built like an NFL linebacker, packaged in
dark Italian suits, married to an attractive blonde and hailed by
voters as Milo the Blade, Djukanovic (djew-KAHN-oh-vich) has been
playing a deliciously wicked game of chicken with the Serbian
dictator Slobodan Milosevic.
 &HT;    Before bombs and cruise missiles began to rain on Yugoslavia,
the Montenegrin president even seemed to be winning.
 &HT;    For the first time since 1918, when Serbia annexed this
mountainous, Connecticut-size republic on the Adriatic Sea and
turned it into a perennial Yugoslav little brother, Montenegro was
moving toward an independent and democratic future linked to the
economies of Western Europe and the United States.
 &HT;    Milosevic, so tactically brilliant in using ethnic hate to
consolidate power, wasn't able to get a grip on the republic's
650,000 residents, even though he ruled 15 times as many people and
more than six times as much land and commanded the formidable
Yugoslav army.
 &HT;    The Montenegrin president has challenged Milosevic with an
impudent Balkan mix of populism, police muscle, cigarette smuggling
and wisecracks about Milosevic's wife. Instead of howling about
historical wrongs, whipping up nationalistic paranoia and ordering
ethnic cleansing, Milo the Blade has preached free-market
prosperity and eased ethnic tensions by securing the civil rights
of his republic's Muslim and Albanian minorities.
 &HT;    Although Djukanovic tested and taunted Milosevic, he took care
never to say or do anything anti-Serb. He never lost sight of who
had the tanks and stopped short of a direct confrontation that
could bring out the Yugoslav army.
 &HT;    Montenegro and Serbia are all that's left of the six republics
that once made up Yugoslavia. Under the federal Constitution, they
are supposedly equal, but larger Serbia has always dominated.
 &HT;    And Djukanovic has remained immune to Tin Pot Leader Syndrome, a
dizzying and endemic Balkan malady that infected his next-door
neighbor, Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, whose
nationalist swagger terrified the Serb minority and helped provoke
a war with Serbia.
 &HT;    Djukanovic is no choirboy. He started out in public life 10
years ago as a Communist enforcer for Milosevic. As one of the Serb
leader's handpicked henchmen in Montenegro, he developed a
state-sponsored air-and-sea smuggling operation that,
paradoxically, gave him the financial resources to slip free of
Milosevic's iron grip and evolve into a Balkan rarity _ a democrat.
 &HT;    The U.S. State Department says it believes Djukanovic's
conversion is real, and so do the handful of long-suffering
human-rights activists who have watched him rise to power. His
bully-boy past is unsavory, even criminal, they say, but he came of
age in a very bad Balkan neighborhood where smart democrats with
popular support and the guts (and police power) to stand up to
Milosevic are hard to find.
 &HT;    The region desperately needs a hero, and Djukanovic is perhaps
the one leader whom the West can rally around.
 &HT;    Yet NATO bombs have changed all that. They have belied
Djukanovic's promise to voters that a turn to the West would
produce peace and wealth. Instead, the bombs have emboldened his
enemies who, with Milosevic's conniving, have already tried to
overthrow his government by force.
 &HT;    Many Montenegrins now consider it cowardly and traitorous to
turn their backs on their embattled Serb neighbors. The bombs mean
that before this story is printed Djukanovic could be put in prison
or killed.
 &HT;    I met him in the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica late on a
night in early April. He was holed up inside the Presidency
Building, which was encircled by Special Forces police officers
wearing camouflage combat uniforms and Israeli-made body armor and
carrying Israeli-made automatic weapons.
 &HT;    After passing through the police gantlet, the metal detector and
the passport review, I was kept waiting for about half an hour in a
barren room with a single fluorescent tube that flicked on and off.
 &HT;    The president's office was nicer. The lights worked. The
curtains were heavy; the rug, plush. Out on the street, nearly all
of the police had been strikingly tall, dark and beefy. So was
Djukanovic. He was also immaculately turned out, considering the
hour and the circumstances, in a starched white shirt and dark blue
suit. His brown hair was freshly trimmed and just barely flecked
with gray.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, he spoke in the stiff bureaucratic locution of the
young Communist that he once was, larding his sentences with
references to ``interlocutors'' and ``democratic structures.'' But
after a few minutes of conversation I noticed that, unlike other
Balkan leaders, he answered questions directly, without taking off
on insufferably self-serving rants about how his people have been
wronged and misunderstood for centuries.
 &HT;    The NATO bombings, the West's campaign to force Milosevic to
halt his army's assault on ethnic Albanians in the Serb province of
Kosovo, had started 12 nights earlier. Some of the strikes have hit
Montenegro, where the Yugoslav army has outposts. Whatever effect
those bombings were having in Kosovo, they were an unqualified
disaster for the man standing in front of me.
 &HT;    Before the bombs, two elections had shown that, by a narrow
margin, Montenegrins approved of Djukanovic's shift to the West and
of his prickly criticism of Milosevic. Now, though, the president
did not bother pretending that he still had the support of his
people. The bombs have already remade politics here.
 &HT;    On the evening he received me, more than 20,000 Montenegrins had
gathered just four blocks from the president's office for a
``Muzicki Hepening'' in the city's central square. The rock
concert, the largest public gathering here in years, was organized
by the pro-Milosevic Socialist People's Party to protest the NATO
strikes.
 &HT;    The noisy crowd carried framed photographs of Milosevic and
posters that read, ``Monica Fell to Her Knees Before Clinton, But
We Won't!'' They applauded speeches that glorified the Yugoslav
army's campaign against the Kosovars. Many Montenegrins were
clamoring for the president's head.
 &HT;    ``Djukanovic is a traitor,'' said Dejan Cvijanovic, a
28-year-old computer technician. ``There are a great number of
people who voted for him who now have turned against him. I hope
there is a coup soon.'' Djukanovic had been hearing the same
belligerent stuff, he told me.
 &HT;    Hundreds of his police officers had watched the concert from the
edges of the square. He had monitored it from his office, and said
he was concerned about similar gatherings that were scheduled for
the coming week. I asked if he was afraid of Milosevic.
 &HT;    ``No,'' he said. ``But I have no illusions. As long as Slobodan
Milosevic is in the political life of Yugoslavia, he will do all he
can think of both against Montenegro and against myself.''
 &HT;    But predicting what Milosevic might or might not do has always
been a fool's game. If there were a confrontation in Montenegro,
where nearly every adult male owns a gun, it could easily escalate
into a dreadful civil war.
 &HT;    It was all so much simpler before the NATO bombs began falling,
Djukanovic kept telling me in his bunkered office. All he had to do
was outfox a dictator who, in the words of the last U.S. ambassador
to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmermann, is the ``slickest con man'' in
the Balkans.
 &HT;    The outfoxing began imperceptibly. Ten years ago, Djukanovic was
thought of _ if he was thought of at all _ as merely a young,
hard-line puppet of Milosevic. The Serb leader had plucked him from
the ranks of the League of Communists in Montenegro to help lead
something Milosevic called the ``antibureaucratic revolution.''
 &HT;    This was reform-sounding double talk for a power grab. Milosevic
pushed aside older Communists still loyal to Tito's version of
Yugoslavia, a place where Serb nationalism was crushed by the power
of the state. Djukanovic helped his Serbian mentor sweep away the
old gray cadres. In return, Milosevic crowned him in 1991 as prime
minister of Montenegro. Just 29, he was the youngest prime minister
in Europe.
 &HT;    The United Nations slapped economic sanctions on Yugoslavia in
1991 at the start of the Bosnian war. Djukanovic, an economist by
training and a pragmatist by nature, quickly figured out how to
profit from them. For a number of years, around 2 o'clock every
morning, several giant Russian-made transport planes landed at the
airport on the edge of the capital. The planes brought in American
and European cigarettes, which were trucked to the coast and
smuggled by boat to Italy.
 &HT;    Djukanovic's government imposed a ``transit fee,'' which,
according to Perovic, the foreign minister, added about $30 million
a year to the republic's coffers. That's not a lot of money by
European standards, but with an annual budget of just $270 million,
the Montenegro government was relying on smuggling for more than 10
percent of its revenue. (NATO bombing, of course, put an end to the
plane landings.)
 &HT;    Djukanovic funneled most of the money into government salaries
and pensions, which in the mid-1990s his government managed to pay
on time. At such budgetary games, he was more skilled than
Milosevic in Serbia, where pensions and salaries almost always ran
six to eight months late, despite equally rampant smuggling. While
Montenegrins widely believed that Djukanovic was creaming off some
of the profits, they didn't much care.
 &HT;    Unemployment was near 40 percent. A decade of war had ruined the
tourist industry. ``Everyone in Montenegro thought that finally
there was someone in government who knew how to create money,''
said Srdan Darmanovic, a former member of the Yugoslav Parliament
and a Montenegrin human-rights lawyer.
 &HT;    During these years, Djukanovic never said a disparaging word in
public about Milosevic, although he insisted in our interview that
he criticized him to his face in private meetings in Belgrade. Such
public loyalty, however, did not prevent members of the Milosevic
family from getting mad at Djukanovic, who was making money that he
wasn't sharing with them.
 &HT;    Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, attacked him in her weekly
newspaper column as the most notorious smuggler in Yugoslavia. It
was a bold and characteristically mendacious accusation. Her only
son, Marko, a gangster who carried a gun and routinely wrecked
expensive racing cars, ran a large cigarette, alcohol and fuel
smuggling operation in Serbia.
 &HT;    Playing to widespread resentment of Milosevic's wife, whom many
Montenegrins and Serbs regard as a low-wattage Stalinist shrew,
Djukanovic countered that she was an irrelevant woman whose
Chinese-oriented Marxist party, the Yugoslav United Left, was so
small that its entire membership could fit on a bus.
 &HT;    Djukanovic waited, however, until her husband seemed to be
losing power before announcing that he wasn't a fan of Milosevic.
In late 1996 and early 1997, when the Serbian leader was struggling
through three months of mass street demonstrations in Belgrade,
Djukanovic said that Milosevic was a politician of the past, that
he did not have a future in Yugoslavia and that Yugoslavia had no
future with him.
 &HT;    When I asked about the smuggling, Djukanovic vehemently denied
rising to power by illegality. Officials in his government, though,
openly concede that it was the only way to make ends meet under
sanctions. They said Djukanovic has tried to attract foreign
investment and legitimate business. Imitating post-Communist
leaders from Poland to Bulgaria, he has announced plans to sell off
state-owned industry. NATO bombings, of course, have put such
reforms on hold.
 &HT;    Besides building a financial power base, Djukanovic had to build
a political machine as well. He did this in a most un-Balkan way,
by advocating ethnic tolerance. The contrast with Milosevic was
nothing short of amazing.
 &HT;    As for Kosovo, Djukanovic has called Milosevic's campaign of
violent ethnic cleansing ``insane, autistic and autocratic.'' He
attributes the catastrophe there to what he has said were years of
neglect by the Serbian leader, during which he refused to negotiate
with moderate Kosovar politicians.
 &HT;    He told me that months before the NATO campaign began, he warned
Western governments that bombing would only make things far worse
for the Kosovars. He said he advised the West to support the
democratic opposition in Serbia and in Kosovo and to show some
patience.
 &HT;    Two nights after Djukanovic and I spoke, a few NATO bombs
exploded near Podgorica _ the first such attacks in Montenegro in a
week.
 &HT;    To find out why NATO was bombing there, I called Robert Gelbard,
the U.S. special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, in Washington, who
was eager to explain. Gelbard said he had already been on the phone
that morning with Djukanovic, reassuring him that the bombings were
merely a response to the Second Yugoslav Army, which had fired a
land-to-air missile at NATO planes flying over Montenegro on their

 &HT;    ``From the very beginning of the air campaign, we knew _ and we

and a particularly good model for the opposition inside Serbia.''
But Washington, he added, had cut no deal to bail out Montenegro in
case Milosevic's loyal Yugoslav army attacks.
 &HT;    Djukanovic's game of chicken was still on.

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It was a warm and sunny Saturday morning, the heart of the
Sabbath, and most of Jerusalem was shuttered _ except for a
second-floor corner suite in the King David Hotel, looking out over
the Jaffa Gate and the rough stone walls guarding the Old City.
 &HT;    Inside, the fax machine beeped, a cell phone trilled and Israeli
newspapers and campaign memos were scattered across the floor. An
easel displaying scribbled poll numbers was perched in a corner,
and dirty plates, half-filled coffee cups and wineglasses littered
the tables, the remnants of 12 hours of breakfast and dinner
meetings.
 &HT;    There was no sign on the door, but the suite served as the
headquarters for the re-election campaign of Benjamin Netanyahu,
the prime minister of Israel, if only for one reason: Arthur J.
Finkelstein, the Republican political consultant from the United
States, was in Jerusalem today, and this is where he was staying.
 &HT;    Finkelstein seemed tense and preoccupied as he opened the door
to his suite. Netanyahu's main opponent in the May 17 election, the
Labor Party candidate Ehud Barak, had recently announced on
television that, if elected, he would withdraw all Israeli troops
from Lebanon by the middle of 2000.
 &HT;    ``His secret plan to end the war in Lebanon _ it's absolutely
Nixon,'' Finkelstein says caustically as he pours a cup of coffee,
recalling Richard Nixon's 1972 promise to end the war in Vietnam.
Barak's pledge was sketchy, but coming at the end of an anxious
week in which three Israeli soldiers died in Lebanon, it had
captured the public's attention.
 &HT;    Even before he left the United States for Jerusalem, Finkelstein
had ordered the Likud campaign into action: It conducted a poll of
Israeli voters on Barak's pledge and his party's surprisingly vivid
suggestion that Netanyahu was ``stuck in the Lebanon mud.''
 &HT;    The results were waiting for Finkelstein when he checked into
the King David. By a margin of ``better than 2 to 1,'' Finkelstein
says, voters saw the Barak declaration as politics as usual. This
finding guided the response Netanyahu and Finkelstein scripted that
weekend.
 &HT;    The prime minister would not even pretend to address the issue
directly, but would instead attack the character of his opponent
for raising it, underscoring what Netanyahu wants to be the
campaign's central question: Which of these two men is tough and
steady enough to assure Israel's survival?
 &HT;    Over the course of the weekend they drafted the slogan, ``Ehud
Barak: Too Many Ambitions, Too Few Principles.'' By Monday morning
_ with Finkelstein back in the United States _ those words would be
posted on the wall of Netanyahu's party headquarters, published in
his newspaper advertisements and incorporated into the daily
talking points that guide his cabinet ministers' conversations with
Israeli reporters.
 &HT;    Finkelstein did not know it, but the attack he was responding to
that weekend was largely the handiwork of another American
political consultant, one he has never met and does not
particularly admire, but who is also working in Israel this spring
_ none other than James Carville.
 &HT;    Carville had flown to Tel Aviv two weeks earlier to join Bob
Shrum _ one of two other Washington consultants working for Barak _
to present the American recommendations on how the Labor Party
challenger could boost his struggling campaign.
 &HT;    Seize control of the daily debate, said the Americans _
Carville, Shrum and Stanley Greenberg, who was President Clinton's
pollster in 1992 and is Barak's pollster now. Speak in short,
declarative sentences and jettison the bulky arguments that had
been the quaint mainstay of Israeli political dialogue. Every
interview, every speech, must include a fundamental assault on
those parts of Netanyahu's record where three months of polling had
found voters' reservations to be most pronounced.
 &HT;    ``Netanyahu,'' said Carville, ``is stuck.'' He was stuck on the
economy, stuck on the peace process, stuck in how he ran his
government. And ... stuck in the Lebanon mud.
 &HT;    American consultants have been flying in and out of Israel since
Prime Minister Menachem Begin called in David Garth of New York in
1981, playing a low-key (and not particularly significant) role in
how campaigns are conducted. But this year's contest _ which many
politicians think will most likely be decided by no more than a
percentage point or two and seems sure to result in a June 1 runoff
_ is different.
 &HT;    Sound bites, rapid response, repetition, wedge issues, ethnic
exploitation, nightly polling, negative research, searing attack
advertisements on television _ the familiar tools of American
elections have now arrived in the Middle East. The 1999 contest for
prime minister of Israel is providing a stage for a struggle
between the seminal Democratic and Republican consultants of the
past 15 years, the principal architects of what has become the
signature American style of political discourse _ one that rewards
simplicity over complexity, shock over substance and Election Day
victory over governing and nearly everything else.
 &HT;    (The third major candidate in the Israeli race, Yitzhak
Mordechai of the new Center Party, has not retained his own
American consultant for one reason, an aide said: He can't afford
it.)
 &HT;    The evidence of the Americans' influence piles up with each
passing campaign day. An Israeli news cycle hardly ever goes by now
without Barak describing Netanyahu's government as ``stuck,'' as
Barak tries to anchor the election in domestic and economic issues.
Or without Netanyahu calling Barak a ``leftist'' or weak, as
Netanyahu for a second time presents himself as the candidate best
able to assure Israel's security.
 &HT;    Both sides' attacks are the products of exhaustive surveys and
focus groups. The orientation of Barak's campaign staff even
includes a viewing of ``The War Room,'' the 92-minute documentary
that glorified the tactical inner workings of the 1992 Clinton
campaign. Carville flew in to officiate after the Barak war room
opened in a nondescript office building in southern Tel Aviv.
 &HT;    Finkelstein, Carville, Shrum and Greenberg are treated as
something of celebrities in Israel, almost as likely to end up on
the front pages of the local newspapers as the candidates. In this
environment, should it really come as such a surprise to learn that
the less-than-telegenic Barak has started to bring a makeup artist
with him on his campaign trips? Or that in assailing Netanyahu,
Barak has invoked the line ``too many lies for too long'' _ the
very same slogan that Democrats in the United States used so
successfully last fall against another Finkelstein client, Alfonse
M. D'Amato?
 &HT;    In America, the notion of politics as spectacle may be
distasteful and dispiriting to watch, but it is hardly a threat to
the Republic. Israel, however, is a young and still somewhat
tentative nation _ Finkelstein was 2 years old when the independent
State of Israel was founded in 1948 _ and it is embarking on only
its second direct election of a prime minister.
 &HT;    It's a place where teachers snap a gun onto their waistbands for
protection before taking children on an outing in the country, and
where shoppers carrying knapsacks are routinely searched going into
a supermarket to make sure they're not about to deposit a bomb next
to the cereal boxes.
 &HT;    It's a place where citizens flick on the radio every hour to
hear if a soldier they know has been killed in Lebanon, and
animosity between Jew and Jew _ between the Sephardim and the
Ashkenazi, between the secular and the religious _ can be as raw as
that between Arab and Jew.
 &HT;    In Israel, the pace of the impending election can be measured by
the rise in random stabbings around the Jewish and Muslim quarters
of Jerusalem.
 &HT;    Israel is, in short, a nation that passes most of its days right
on the edge _ riding 4,000 years of religious, ethnic and tribal
turmoil. The American consultants describe this overstimulated and
chronically anxious environment as more intense than any they have
worked in before. Elections here are literally fought over
life-and-death issues, and so it is that many Israelis are coming
to believe that something disturbing is happening to their
political system this spring.
 &HT;    Yaron Ezrahi, a professor of political science at Hebrew
University, says the new style of campaigning has created ``a
distorted and irrelevant form of politics'' _ an unhappy and
increasingly prevalent view of the new Israeli political landscape
that would certainly sound familiar to anyone who has followed the
evolution of American elections.
 &HT;    ``Because of the Americanization of the campaign, it boils down
to slogans instead of to substance,'' says David Bar-Illan, a
former editor of The Jerusalem Post who is Netanyahu's director of
communications. ``And nothing is more typically American than
boiling down issues to slogans and really almost emptying them of
meaning.''
 &HT;    When Finkelstein arrived in Israel in 1996, his knowledge of the
country's politics amounted to ``what the average readers of The
New York Times would know in New York,'' says Eyal Arad, who was a
senior Netanyahu adviser at the time. It is an assessment that
Finkelstein neither disputes nor apologizes for. ``Look, it doesn't
matter if I get it or not,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``If I go to Iowa, they'll say: 'How can you understand Iowa?
You're from New York.' And I'll say: 'I don't need to understand
Iowa. That's not the point. That's not what I do.' You find the
intersections of interests _ you take a survey, you find out what
people care about, you find out what your candidate cares about,
you find the intersection of those two points, and that's what you
talk about. What difference does it make if I understand it or
not?''
 &HT;    That said, Finkelstein did spend five weeks of his 18th year
working on a kibbutz near Jerusalem and shares the emotional
identification many American Jews have with the country's struggle
for existence. ``I understood that being Jewish meant that we were
always at the edge of extinction as a people,'' Finkelstein says.
 &HT;    ``And survival was a fundamental quest in the Jewish person. The
reason that Israel was important was because it was a place for
Jews to survive. It was a place for Jews to go. And remember, I'm
very much a product of the postwar mentality, of the movie
'Exodus': There needs to be a place to go. And this was the
place.''
 &HT;    By contrast, Carville is Roman Catholic and has not, he says,
made any particular effort to tutor himself on Israel's history and
politics in preparation for this job. ``The Israelis understand
their history better than anyone else,'' Carville says, settling in
for a nightcap by the dying embers of a fire at his Virginia
farmhouse one January evening.
 &HT;    ``No one is going to say, 'Give me a 500-word essay on the
causes, the strategies and the long-range results of the '67 war,
the '73 war.' That's just not what's important. I mean, it's
important but it's not important to my role. They are not looking
to me for advice on Israel. They are looking to me for advice on
communications, on organizations, on how to set things up, on how
to respond.
 &HT;    ``You've got to be careful,'' Carville adds. ``I think in a
campaign or a situation like this, when everyone else knows so
much, I think there's a point in politics where knowledge becomes a
burden.''
 &HT;    The consultants also are not around all that much. Finkelstein
came to Israel about six times in 1996, usually staying for two or
three days on each visit, which amounts to barely twice the hours
he spent on his commute.
 &HT;    Carville has spent far less time in Israel than his Barak
employees would like, as he juggles a presidential race in
Argentina, a demanding television and speech schedule and rearing
two young children with his wife, Mary Matalin, the Republican
consultant _ who is, yes, a Netanyahu supporter.
 &HT;    Greenberg, meanwhile, is swimming in the transcontinental
demands of his political portfolio. ``I have the Scottish elections
on the sixth of May,'' he said over breakfast after arriving in Tel
Aviv from London in late February.
 &HT;    ``I've got this election on the 17th of May. I've got the South
African elections, whose date is not firm, but whose date is either
May 23 or May 29. In Britain, I've got the European elections and
local council elections on June 1. And I've got the runoff here.''
 &HT;    By American standards, the consultants are not paid a huge
amount of money considering the time it takes just to get to work.
In the United States, consultants typically get a percentage of
campaign money expended on television advertising, a figure that in
a big race can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
 &HT;    In Israel, Finkelstein says, he is paid $4,000 a month; Barak's
campaign manager, Tal Silberstein, says the three American
consultants will collect $400,000 among them for their work in
Israel.
 &HT;    The traveling-salesman image of these consultants shapes the way
they are perceived in Israel, and not necessarily for the better.
Yet no one would suggest that Israel is above the intellectual
compromises and ideological shortcuts that are arguably the price
for democratic elections.
 &HT;    And tactics such as sound bites on television obviously work,
according to Uri Dromi, who was the chief spokesman for the
governments of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. But, he adds, they
inevitably worsen the daily struggle to govern a nation ``where the
issues are so crucial, where everything is so serious, where
everything touches the existence of the country. It is bad for the
kind of discourse we have in this country.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Israel has crossed a threshold this spring, and it
is not likely to abandon the television screen to return to the
stuffy meetings and public harangues of a few years ago. ``I think
the market for American consultants will expand before it
contracts,'' Netanyahu says; it is a future that both he and Barak
say they applaud.
 &HT;    For now, anyone who finds this observation distressing can
console themselves with the thought that one way another, a
prominent American consultant will lose an election in Israel next
month.

<P>
   When my car overheated, the gas station guy pulled a big
gun-thing out of his tool chest, pointed it under the hood and
pulled the trigger. Obviously, he was putting the old '88 out of
its misery.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was reading the temperature of the engine parts with
an infrared thermometer. The trigger sent a laser dot to mark the
spot being read, and the temperature was displayed on a little
window on the back of the gun.
</P>
<P>
   I immediately arranged to borrow it for the weekend. I read the
temperature of everything. Cold hands and cold feet. Ice. Stoves.
Coffee machines.
</P>
<P>
   I took this little point-and-shoot thermometer out to dinner to
show friends, and the chef came over, snatched it and ran off to
the kitchen. After a long time, he came back and said it was
perfect for reading baking bread, the freezer, prepared foods and
the grill. He wanted one. And he thought other food professionals
would, too.
</P>
<P>
   The company that makes it, the Raytek Corp. in Santa Cruz,
Calif., has recognized that potential. Raytek makes larger models
(pit crews at the Indy 500 point them at the asphalt to determine
which tires to use; heating and air-conditioning technicians check
pipes with them).
</P>
<P>
   But now the company has begun shipping two pocket-sized Minitemp
models that are perfect for a kitchen. They can outperform a
standard instant-read thermometer at everything but reading
internal temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   While other thermometers need to actually touch the item being
measured _ which is difficult with a whirling fan belts or hot
grill or boiling sugar _ infrared thermometers measure the energy
flowing out of any object and display its heat as Celsius or
Fahrenheit degrees. (Raytek says they will measure from 0 to 500
degrees Fahrenheit, but actually, mine went from minus 9 to a top
of 539.)
</P>
<P>
   The new models are about six inches long, light and small enough
for a shirt pocket. They work best from a couple of feet to a
couple of inches; at a foot away, they read the temperature of
two-inch circle.
</P>
<P>
   I was having fun with the thermometer, but chefs see its
usefulness. Jason Superczynski, a chef at the Black Olive in
Baltimore, told me he likes the quick-zap approach for searching
out the hot spots on his grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only drawback is that it doesn't read internal
temperatures,'' he said. There is no way, for instance, that it can
tell when a steak is rare or well done.
</P>
<P>
   But the infrared thermometer has other merits for home cooks.
For example, a griddle is deemed ready for pancakes when a drop of
water skitters across its surface, but my test with Raytek's
Minitemp showed water does this at a wide temperature range, from
about 320 to 420 degrees. Most cooking experts say the ideal
temperature is 350 to 370, which is where the Minitemp's accuracy
comes in handy.
</P>
<P>
   Another moment of truth is determining when a stove-top grill or
pan is hot enough to sear meat without sticking. That requires a
temperature of 450 to 500 degrees _ something many cooks find
difficult to gauge by eye.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Simpson, the director of education at Peter Kump's
Cooking School in New York, said: ``Some foods are ruined by a
too-cool pan _ 350 to 370 is ideal for frying,'' he said. ``As you
pass 400, you damage the oil because it breaks down. From 400 to
450, it may begin to smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said temperature is also critical in cooking with sugar.
``At 220, sugar relaxes to the soft-ball stage used in meringues
and icings, at 320, you reach the caramel stage for flavoring and
decorating, such as forming spun sugar. At 350, the caramel
darkens.'' But measuring with a candy thermometer is messy at best
and can actually cause the sugar to crystallize.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grimes, the corporate chef for Disney's new chain of
ESPNZone restaurants opening across the country, has his chefs
checking foods and storage conditions with the mechanic-sized
thermometers. Four times a day, they quickly read the temperatures
of a checklist of 60 items, from the walk-in refrigerator to the
salad greens.
</P>
<P>
   Raytek's Minitemp MT4, with laser for aiming, is $139. The
laserless MT2 is $99. They are in car parts and tool stores now but
could eventually begin appearing in cookware shops, said Bob Baden,
Raytek's national sales manager. (Meanwhile, Raytek can direct
customers to retailers: 800-866-5478).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the companies that carry the Minitemp and similar models
are the Cole-Parmer Instrument Co. (800-323-4340), Davis
Instruments (800-368-2516) and EPD Technology (800-892-8926).
</P>
<P>
   Other models that look a remote control are available, but they
are about an inch longer than the Minitemp and may not fit the hand
as well. And in my own side-by-side comparison, they were not as
much fun.

THE FINE ART OF COOKING WITH FAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With FAT-COOKING) 
(mk) 
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chefs know instinctively what to do with fat in any
form. But home cooks who have absorbed the idea that butter is bad
may need a refresher course in the fine art of cooking with fat,
especially with the kinds of fat chefs are using lately.
</P>
<P>
   These fats have serious flavor, but more important, like all
fats they convey the other flavors in a dish. The richness actually
helps you taste more of what you are eating by melding with other
ingredients and counterbalancing salty, sharp or acid notes.
</P>
<P>
   The foie gras fat turning up in restaurants all over town is
hard for home cooks to find, but duck fat is now sold in many
supermarkets and is easy to make yourself. The diced skin and fat
of the bird are cooked very slowly with water until the fat is
completely rendered and the skin crisps into cracklings that can be
strained out and eaten with salt. The fat keeps indefinitely in the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Duck fat (or goose fat, for that matter) can be used just like
butter or olive oil for frying or roasting potatoes or sauteing
meats or shellfish as chefs do in France. It can even be melted and
poured over steamed vegetables. And it has a much headier flavor
than even the best butter.
</P>
<P>
   Duck fat is also used to make traditional confit, the leg of the
bird cooked slowly in its own fat, with more fat added. It can also
be used in a hot vinaigrette over a salad of sturdy greens with
duck cracklings as a garnish.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken fat (a k a schmaltz) is rendered the same way as duck
fat and also sold in some markets. It's good for making chopped
liver and pates and for frying potato pancakes or frying onions to
top a steak.
</P>
<P>
   Butter seems tame by comparison, but many cooks are out of the
habit of using more than a teaspoon or so at a time. It can be the
base of any number of sauces, but you can't skimp.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best and quickest sauces for meat, fowl or fish is
made by simply deglazing the cooking pan with wine, water, beer or
broth, then whisking in a nugget of butter to add flavor, body and
shine. Brown butter is faster: Heat fresh butter gently until it
turns golden, with nutty-tasting browned bits, and pour it over
meat, chicken or fish.
</P>
<P>
   A beurre blanc is the kind of sauce that looks light on a plate
but is actually almost pure butter. Vinegar or wine is boiled with
shallots until the liquid is just a glaze, and then slices of
butter are whisked in until a thick sauce forms.
</P>
<P>
   An even easier trick is to make a compound butter: Soften a
stick, mix in fresh herbs and seasonings, then roll it into a log
and chill or freeze it for future use. Sliced and laid over hot
steak, chicken, fish, veal or vegetables, the aromatic butter melts
and spreads its flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is olive oil. Even the food police never banned
this time-honored fat. And even a nonstick saute pan needs a
little. But it can also be the finishing touch that transforms
something simple into something irresistible. Sprinkle a little
over a just-baked frittata or Spanish tortilla; as it warms on
contact it softens any hard edges and concentrates the good,
browned flavor of the eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Herb-infused olive oils (either homemade or store-bought) are
even more powerful. They can be tossed with pasta and more herbs to
make the easiest sauce, and they can be drizzled over foccacia or
bruschetta to enhance the flavor. Just made, they add new depth to
plain soups and pureed vegetables.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fat. For years, it's been a four-letter word. And yet
the best chefs know they can't be great without it. Sometimes they
use a lot, sometimes a little. Sometimes it's actually splashed on
by the ladleful, as just about any dish _ from fish to vegetables
to beef _ gets ready to emerge through the swinging doors.
</P>
<P>
   It often takes the form of butter, of course, a key ingredient
in some of the seemingly lightest dishes and sauces, like those
righteous vegetable-juice reductions created by Jean-Georges
Vongerichten and imitated all over. (And the seductive smoothness
in many a mashed potato dish comes from a remarkable ratio: two
parts potato, one part butter.)
</P>
<P>
   But there's a lot of poultry fat and lard around, too, as well
as the olive and canola oils that are the saints among the sinners.
</P>
<P>
   No one is campaigning for a diet dominated by artery cloggers,
but in the high-priced world of the occasional indulgence, where a
dish is valued most for its artistry, fat is the unspoken
ingredient cooks rely on more than most diners might ever imagine.
</P>
<P>
   In today's less repressive culinary climate, some restaurants
and their chefs are ready to be open about it. For instance,
Christian Delouvrier of Lespinasse is candid in conversation but
wary on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want good-tasting food you need to use a good amount of
fat,'' he said. ``It nourishes meats and seafood. It makes them
much more silky. I use duck fat to sear scallops and lobster since
it has a nice rich flavor. We don't advertise it on the menu,
because unfortunately people get nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   The poached halibut with Swiss chard and young ginger at Union
Pacific may sound abstemious, but it is actually submerged in a
quart of hot goose fat for 13 minutes. The menu doesn't mention the
poaching medium. ``People are afraid of fat,'' said Rocco
DiSpirito, the chef there. Nevertheless, he said, he wants them to
try different things. Poaching the fish in goose fat, he said, is
simply a way to protect its creaminess and texture, adding that the
fish ends up absorbing the same amount of fat as it would if it
were seared or pan-fried.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 Madison Park, Kerry Heffernan sautes his Gascon potatoes
in the fragrant fat exuded by a foie gras terrine. At JoJo, Chris
Beischer braises red cabbage and chestnuts in goose fat until they
become meltingly tender, then garnishes roast goose with the
mixture.
</P>
<P>
   At Alison on Dominick, Dan Silverman uses a variety of fats for
their individual characteristics. ``I can't cook without fat,'' he
said. ``Duck fat is intense, olive oil is peppery and fruity, and
butter adds a grassy nuttiness. People love fat. But they just
don't want it waved in their face.''
</P>
<P>
   The most skillful cooks are capitalizing not only on the
distinctive characteristics of their palette of fats but also the
singular ability of those fats to blend and carry the many flavors
in a dish so they permeate each mouthful.
</P>
<P>
   What separates the skilled cook from the short-order hack is the
ability to impart silkiness and essential moistness rather than
greasiness. The line between those characteristics is thin. Partly
it's a matter of technique: adding the fat correctly so that a
sauce emulsifies into a uniform creaminess, or cooking at the right
temperature so that the surface of the food is sealed by the heat
before the oil can be absorbed. It's also a matter of using the
right amount of fat: enough so that it complements the flavors and
textures in a dish but not so much that it dulls them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, every chef worth his Plugras (an extra-fat butter)
knows that the more fat used, generally the better the final dish,
since fat is a excellent carrier of flavor. If the chef is skillful
in balancing the fat with the right amounts of acid and salt,
there's room for a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much is a lot? That's something chefs are still
reluctant to go on the record about. One, a former sous-chef at
Bouley Bakery, gave a typical example. ``Whenever we served a
vegetable,'' he said, ``it got reheated in about a tablespoon of
butter. So when someone ordered a vegetable plate, which had six
different vegetables on it, there was about six tablespoons of
butter on that plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the manager of a popular French restaurant in
Manhattan confided: ``People ask us all the time why our seared
fish tastes so much better than the fish they make at home. I tell
them it's because we can get the pan so much hotter than they can,
but the real reason is because we cook it with heaps of butter.''
</P>
<P>
   David Waltuck, the chef at Chanterelle, who never goes off the
record about his use of fat, put it this way: ``My food is
perceived as being lighter than it really is.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical restaurant meal, many chefs agreed, could easily
contain more than eight tablespoons of fat. That's more than an
entire stick of butter. Given that the recommended daily allowance
of fat for a 2,000-calorie diet is about four and half tablespoons,
that's about twice a day's worth.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds frightening. But assuming meals like this aren't a
nightly occurrence, it isn't the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't go out to rich meals all the time,'' said Penny
Kris-Etherton, the Distinguished Professor of Nutrition at
Pennsylvania State University. ``High-fat restaurant food should be
the exception in people's diets and not the norm. I think it's
important to have a varied diet and to enjoy the food you do eat. I
believe in moderation, but on both sides of the fat question.''
</P>
<P>
   The fat with an image worse than Saddam Hussein's is lard. And
yet it is revered in some parts of the world known for their
beautifully wrought cuisine. Tuscany, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Every winter in Tuscany, pig fat is stacked in marble tubs and
marinated with salt, herbs, aromatics and wine. It might emerge as
a cooking medium or even as a warm little canape in the form of
slices of lard on toast.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, at Osteria del Circo, chef Alessandro Guintoli
serves his version of lardo drizzled with yet more fat: white
truffle oil. It is one of the most deliciously perfumed tidbits you
could ever hope to encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Lard also shows up in French restaurants. At Daniel, Daniel
Boulud uses bacon fat to flavor vegetable soup. In the restaurant
Serenade in Chatham, N.J., James Laird offers a traditional
Provencal pasta made with lard in place of eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the pasta incredibly supple,'' he said. This secret
ingredient, however, isn't on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's suet. At Avenue, Scott Campbell makes a
traditional holiday plum pudding seasoned with suet _ beef kidney
fat.
</P>
<P>
   During the rest of the year, he uses the fat scraped from marrow
bones to finish sauces for steak and fish (garnishing them with the
poached marrow). At the Dining Room, John Tesar wraps a
sophisticated dish of chicken breast and sweetbreads into a neat
little package using sheets of weblike caul fat, from beef
intestines. It's a traditional French technique that keeps the
chicken moist and holds the sweetbreads in place, then melts away
while cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one would ever know it was there,'' Tesar said.
</P>
<P>
   And since the waiters don't mention it when describing this
occasional special, no one ever does.

   Touring National Parks
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I would like to do a tour of national parks,
including Yellowstone, Arches, Bryce Canyon and Grand Canyon. Can
you help? _ Sy Hakim, Philadelphia &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Tour operators that combine in a single tour all four parks
you mention are the exception. A look at the map explains why:
Yellowstone and Grand Teton, with which it is often paired, are in
the northwestern corner of Wyoming. And that's a considerable
distance from Arches, Bryce and Zion, which are in the southern
half of Utah not far from Grand Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   When selecting a tour, it's a good idea to review the itinerary
to be sure that the places you really want to see aren't being
scanted; more can sometimes be less. Here is a sampling of bus
tours _ the first two of which cover the four parks you mention _
with some highlights. All prices are per person, double occupancy;
air fare is extra.

   Laptops at Airports
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you provide the definitive answer as to whether or not I
am injuring my laptop computer by sending it through airport
security scanners? _ James E. Tierney, Lisbon Falls, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   A. No one can give a definitive answer on anything concerning
computers, according to Stephen C. Miller, assistant to the
technology editor of The New York Times. Even so, he said,
significant anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that airport
scanners do not harm laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that in a recent three-month period he had been
through five airports (meaning 10 trips through the scanners) and
that he had not run into a problem at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I write a column about traveling with technology, I'm
always sending all kinds of electronic gadgets through the
scanners,'' he said. ``The vast majority of my fellow business
travelers carry laptops and I've never heard one of them complain
about the scanners' harming the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who are really concerned, Miller suggests, should hand
the unit to the security guard and insist that it be inspected
manually. If you do this, he said, make sure your battery is
charged because they are going to ask you to turn on the computer.
Dead batteries will delay you.
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg Cruises
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there any short tours _ possibly even a three-day cruise
_ to St. Petersburg from Stockholm? _ John Moak, Somers, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. If you're taking a boat, the only way to get from Stockholm
to St. Petersburg is via Helsinki. That means an overnight trip in
both directions between those two ports plus four days of cruising
between Helsinki and St. Petersburg _ all of which adds up to six
days.
</P>
<P>
   You can whittle away at travel time by taking a one-hour flight
between Stockholm to Helsinki. The round trip air fare is about
$160 to $325 for a restricted ticket; an unrestricted ticket is
$326 and up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Viking Line vessel links Stockholm and Helsinki; outbound, she
leaves at 6 p.m. and arrives at 9 a.m. The fare one way is $131 to
$216 per person double occupancy, including dinner, breakfast and
port charges. With a whole day in Helsinki, you may want to take a
two-and-a-half-hour sightseeing tour of the city from the Viking
Line terminal. Tickets are $20 and can be bought aboard ship. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Between Helsinki and St. Petersburg, you will be aboard the
Kristina Regina, the only passenger liner linking the two cities,
according to B.J. Mikkelsen, owner and president of Eurocruises, a
cruise tour operator representing several European cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Kristina Regina, a Kristina Cruises ship, leaves Helsinki at
5:30 p.m. and arrives in St. Petersburg at 8:30 the next morning.
The round trip fare is $390 to $930, including all meals (dinner,
three meals each on the following two days and breakfast before
getting off) as well as port charges. The number of passengers is
limited to 200, Mikkelsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers do not need a visa and they get a half-day tour of
St. Petersburg. There are also tours that last about four hours,
cost $35 to $45 and include visits to the Hermitage, the Peterhof
(summer capital of the czars), the Kirov Ballet and Pushkin Palace
and such activities as singing and dancing. A shopping tour in St.
Petersburg is $10.
</P>
<P>
   The departure from St. Petersburg is not until 10:30 p.m., and
arrival in Helsinki is at 11:30 a.m. the next day. The boat leaves
Helsinki at 6 p.m., arriving in Stockholm at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Kristina Regina's departure dates this year are June 1 and
4, July 21 and 27 and Aug. 2, 8, 11 and 14.

AN OLD RELIABLE

 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's BAAAACK!
</P>
<P>
   That hardy perennial, the minimum wage, is once again on the
congressional agenda. In truth, it never really went away.
</P>
<P>
   On the scale of grand national issues, this is barely visible.
But measured by its potential for political symbolism, it's a hot
one.
</P>
<P>
   A House committee rehashed the issue Tuesday, with business
still opposed to another increase and labor unions demanding a
higher minimum than the current $5.15 an hour. We have heard it all
before.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage level, although only one legislative tool in
the federal arsenal for fighting poverty, has always been an easily
defined political issue. That is part of its persevering charm.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a low-paid worker, you are naturally for a salary
increase. The minimum wage is believed to push up the incomes of
those who already earn slightly above that floor. If you are a
small-business owner with a narrow profit margin, you are naturally
opposed to having the government tell you how much you are required
to pay the unskilled workers you prefer to get on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 presidential campaign, Congress passed a
two-year 90-cent increase in the minimum wage, the first since
1991. Democrats in the House and Senate pushed it through with the
help of moderate Republicans worried about the negative impact of
House Speaker Newt Gingrich's pompous extremism and their party's
conservative, anti-government tilt.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed that 81 percent of those surveyed supported the
increase, which directly affected an estimated 6.4 million workers
then getting by on smaller salaries.
</P>
<P>
   That was supposed to settle the matter for a while. But the
increase was so politically popular that it promptly stimulated
congressional appetites for a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Dire predictions from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other
business advocates that a higher minimum wage would add to
inflation, force some employers to close their doors and reduce the
number of unskilled jobs available have not proved accurate.
</P>
<P>
   There is some anecdotal evidence that a few jobs in restaurants
and other labor-intensive industries may have been lost. But the
economy is prospering, jobs overall have continued to grow and the
unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent is the lowest in almost three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., for several decades a
reliable champion of the minimum wage, tried to slip an increase to
$6.15 an hour into a Senate consumer bankruptcy bill. The Senate
quietly tabled the amendment on a party-line vote, with Democrats
for and Republicans against.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation proposed last year by House Minority Whip
David Bonior, D-Mich., a liberal from a union-dominated district,
never got out of a GOP-controlled committee.
</P>
<P>
   But here we go again. This issue is too good for Democrats and
moderate Republicans to pass up as we move toward another
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The narrowly divided House may well pass an increase, perhaps
larded with pro-business compensations like new tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, however, plays by different internal rules, and
conservative pro-business Republicans have firmer control. Senate
Whip Don Nickles of Oklahoma recently said, ``I don't plan on
letting it pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are unlikely to mind much if Senate Republicans are
willing to be tabbed as captives of wealthy employers reluctant to
pay a living wage to the nation's lowest-paid workers. This is
considerably more useful on the campaign trail as a continuing
issue than as a record of achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has the virtue of simplicity and clarity, unlike the
complicated arguments over other, larger questions that affect our
lives like Social Security, Medicare and tax cuts. It reinforces
the Democratic image as the party of compassion for the little guy
and the GOP image as the party of selfish vested interests.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds voters that some GOP spokesmen, such as House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, not only oppose increasing the
minimum wage but would like to do away with the concept altogether.
If poor folks can't afford bread, let 'em eat cake. What a theme to
run on in a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   I confess a personal fondness for the minimum wage, which has
been periodically increased over the 60 years of its existence.
When I was a young Nebraska journalist working for pennies, such a
hike to $1 an hour gave me my first salary increase.

`THE MARQUIS DE SADE': FINDING THE BRIGHT SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Good Friday, April 2, 1790, when the 50-year-old Marquis de
Sade was released from the Charenton insane asylum after nearly 12
years in three French prisons, he vowed in a letter to his lawyer
that he would forever sanctify that day with ``moaning and
weeping.'' Every Good Friday, he wrote, ``I will get down on my
knees, I will pray, I will offer up thanks. ... I will make a
resolution to mend my ways, and I will keep to my word.''
</P>
<P>
   Sade, who gave his name to such words as sadistic and
sadomasochism, is not known for feelings of contrition or for
religious sentiment. And of course, there is the possibility that
he was speaking in bitter irony on the day of his release. Indeed,
far from mending his ways, he resumed his libertine's life as well
as the writing of the scandalous novels of human degradation that
would land him back in prison, where he died in 1814.
</P>
<P>
   And yet that scene on April 2 has a poignancy to it, a genuine
feeling of the tragic. It enables one to see Sade not only as
something close to an archetype, a kind of grotesque cardboard
figure, but as a man who is both contemptible and, in his way,
admirable. That complexity is one of the virtues of this new and
lengthy biography, ``The Marquis de Sade: A Life,'' by Neil
Schaeffer, a professor of English literature at Brooklyn College.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly possible to ask, as one sits down to read
Schaeffer's treatment of Sade, why another biography of this
notorious and already well-researched figure is needed. But
Schaeffer's book is a welcome addition to the literature. It is
both sophisticated and hardheaded about Sade; it has a definitive
quality to it.
</P>
<P>
   Central to Schaeffer's portrait is the idea of a strange,
stubborn greatness to Sade, both as a literary adventurer into
territory that no other writer had dared explore and as a champion
of an extreme libertarian philosophy. In Schaeffer's view, Sade's
life was a contest with authority in which sex was a kind of
argument, a provocation for ``a debate on individual freedom and
the limitations imposed by religion and government.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Sade, Schaeffer continues, was this: ``If Sade
meant his acts as a symbolic defiance of abstract authority, it was
real-world, actual authority (embodied in the police and in judges)
that would punish him, and quite severely.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer's new book continues a steady expansion of studies of
Sade, who does not lose his power to attract interest and
controversy as time goes by. Two other books have been published on
him in recent months _ ``At Home With the Marquis de Sade: A Life''
by Francine du Plessix Gray and ``Sade: A Biographical Essay'' by
Laurence L. Bongie. These books _ Ms. Gray's more or less
sympathetic to Sade, Bongie's morally hostile _ concentrated on
Sade's relations with the women in his life. Schaeffer has written
a more inclusive biography, one that does not stint on Sade's
almost amazing egotism, his monstrous and self-destructive
heedlessness of others, even as it highlights his stubborn courage.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, you may feel, as I did, that Schaeffer magnifies
Sade's importance; he calls ``120 Days of Sodom'' ``one of the most
important novels ever written.'' But he lays out the facts of
Sade's fascinating life and character and leaves it up to the
reader to judge.
</P>
<P>
   Sade's biographers agree that the Sade of real life may have
been sexually adventurous and perverse but that his behavior was
not all that unusual by the standards of the 18th-century French
aristocracy. Certainly the acts of murder, incest, coprophilia,
torture and mutilation that are the stuff of his books were not the
stuff of his real life. Schaeffer subjects both the books and the
life to close scrutiny, complete with psychological and literary
analysis. He recounts in elaborate detail the episodes that gave
Sade his first bout of notoriety: his debaucheries with prostitutes
who later complained to police of various acts of blasphemy and
sexual violence. He retells the strange story of Sade's redoubtable
mother-in-law, Marie-Madeleine de Montreuil, who persuaded the king
to throw Sade into the dungeon of Vincennes even after he was
acquitted of the prostitutes' charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Sade the monomaniacal sex fiend of myth, merely writing
down his own masturbatory fantasies in the Bastille?'' Schaeffer
asks, as he turns to an examination of his first major novel, ``120
Days of Sodom.'' ``Or is he bravely and purposefully attempting to
write the only book that will show the mind of man as no one
acknowledges it to be but as it really is? The answer must be yes
to both questions.''
</P>
<P>
   It needs to be remembered in this that ``120 Days of Sodom'' is
about a group of wealthy and unspeakably corrupt men who organize a
prolonged experiment in what Schaeffer calls ``truly horrifying
bloodshed and savage murder.'' Is there really greatness in such
literature? Schaeffer clearly believes that there is, and he makes
his case both bravely and intelligently, concluding that ``120 Days
of Sodom'' ``is a transcendent, darkly sublime novel, the most
extreme evocation of disillusionment and disappointment, the most
unconsoling exploration of the most irredeemable aspects of human
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is true; perhaps, as other critics have argued,
Sade's descent into imaginative degradation is less an exploration
of the hidden aspects of human nature and more an act of unredeemed
and therefore pointless ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, the vision that Schaeffer creates is of Sade
pouring out what was for him a philosophical and political
testament while lying on the stone floor of a medieval prison,
writing on a secret, handmade paper scroll.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Sade spent 29 years in prison. There is something
powerful and moving in that fact alone, and it is the strength of
Schaeffer's biography that it makes Sade not just a notorious
figure but a credibly heroic one as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concerned that America's military might is
stretched too thin, many lawmakers are looking to beef up defense
spending beyond what President Clinton says is necessary to pay for
the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already asked Congress to pass an emergency $6
billion supplemental spending bill to pay for the military
operations and humanitarian aid in the Balkans. Republicans want to
boost that figure by at least $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply paying to recoup the direct costs of operating the
force and for expended ammunition is necessary, but far from
sufficient,'' said Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee. ``It does nothing to address our
vulnerabilities and shortfalls in other critically important and
dangerous regions of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence's comments are typical of many Republicans, who have long
complained that Clinton neglects the military. Defense spending has
indeed fallen under Clinton, but that dip began under President
George Bush and was precipitated by the decline of the Cold War and
the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   As far as money is concerned, the military's golden years were
under President Ronald Reagan. At the height of the Reagan military
buildup, defense spending, when adjusted for inflation, reached
$424 billion, accounting for roughly 27 percent of the federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
   This year, President Clinton plans to spend $268 billion on
defense needs, roughly 15 percent of the federal budget. Spending
on defense will likely rise because of the NATO war against
Yugoslavia. Overall, defense spending has declined approximately 30
percent since the Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   Some defense experts say that it's too simplistic and misleading
to look at the budget numbers and conclude that Clinton is
shortchanging the military. They point to the fall of the Berlin
Wall and the breakup of the Soviet Union as evidence that America's
traditional foes have weakened, thus undercutting the need for a
continued buildup of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the end of the Cold War meant America had to
re-evaluate,'' said Steven Kosiak, director of budget studies at
the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, an independent
think tank devoted to defense issues. ``It was prudent to make
reductions in the size of the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosiak and others also said that the decline in military
spending is also tied to the fact that programs such as Medicare
and Social Security are growing fast, grabbing a larger share of
the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kosiak said the military may have some
shortfalls that the Clinton administration has only recently begun
to acknowledge. At hearings on Capitol Hill, various military
leaders have talked about problems in recruiting and retaining
skilled men and women, particularly pilots. They've also described
difficulty in maintaining the readiness of some equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In February, when Defense Secretary William Cohen unveiled the
administration's proposed $267 billion military budget for next
year, he talked about ``warning signs of potential problems,'' but
he said that the president's plan would address them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiting and retention are increasingly difficult, readiness
harder to maintain, and weapons modernization tougher to fund
sufficiently,'' Cohen said. ``This budget will address these
warnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, are skeptical. They want to raise military
pay more than Clinton, believing it will alleviate the retention
problem. They say the crisis in Kosovo has underscored the Clinton
administration's willingness to deploy U.S. armed forces to
conflicts abroad without considering whether such actions weaken
this country's own defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a large and growing military commitment in the Balkans,
what happens if war breaks out in those regions of the world where
there is no question as to our national interest?'' Spence asked.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all their rhetoric about military needs, Republicans
rarely, if ever, detail where they would cut spending to pay for
the defense increases. In fact, most lawmakers are loathe to even
talk about cuts to Social Security and Medicare, which are among
the costliest programs in government.
</P>
<P>
   Kosiak said policy experts need to consider what kind of role
America's military should play in the world before anyone can
reasonably conclude how much to spend on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you have that kind of debate, you can't decide on
weapons systems or force structures,'' he said. But he's not
optimistic that will happen anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense budget is a heavily politicized issue,'' Kosiak
said. ``With a presidential election coming up, sometimes that's
not the most opportune time for thoughtful debate on anything.''

   Depictions of Lincoln Shown in Indiana
</P>
<P>
   Fort Wayne, Ind., is off the usual tourist track, but history
buffs and political junkies may just want to put it on their
itineraries this year. ``Lincoln From Life: As the Artists Saw
Him,'' at the Lincoln Museum there through Oct. 17, brings together
46 paintings, sculptures, photographs and sketches that Lincoln
posed for between 1860, when he was elected president, until his
assassination in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   Several works, which come from more than a dozen public and
private collections as well as the Lincoln Museum, have never been
lent before.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is designed to show how Lincoln pioneered the use
of the arts to enhance his public persona long before photography
and television made image-making a campaign necessity. He was a
willing subject, posing more often than has been previously
acknowledged, and he encouraged artists to make flattering
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Among the works on display are three important paintings that
have never been shown together before _ Alban James Conant's
``Smiling Lincoln'' from 1860; George Frederick Wright's campaign
portrait from 1860, the first portrait purchased by Lincoln
himself; and Edward D. Marchant's ``Great Emancipator,'' depicting
Lincoln in white tie, with symbolic broken chains beneath the feet
of the Liberty statue in the background. Lincoln's last portrait
from life, which Matthew Henry Wilson completed 11 days before the
assassination, is also on view.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln Museum, 200 East Berry Street, has scheduled several
events with the exhibition, including a ball in October with period
music and costumes. Open daily except Monday. Admission is $2.99;
(219) 455-3864 or www.thelincolnmuseum-.org.

   Belugas and Seals Move In at Mystic
</P>
<P>
   The Mystic Aquarium will continue its expansion this spring with
the opening of a new outdoor marine mammal habitat in mid-May.
Called the Alaskan Coast, the one-acre exhibit will be home to the
Aquarium's beluga whales and harbor seals.
</P>
<P>
   Rocks, plants and trees characteristic of south-central Alaska
surround the 750,000-gallon pool. Viewing stations offer the chance
to see the animals above and below the water's surface.
</P>
<P>
   In the shallow-water beach, visitors may get close to the whales
as they rub themselves on the cobble-covered bottom. The exhibit is
dedicated to beluga research and breeding as part of an
international conservation program.
</P>
<P>
   The aquarium, at 55 Coogan Boulevard, Mystic, Conn., is about
125 miles from New York on I-95 (take Exit 90). Open 9 a.m. to 5
p.m.; until 6 p.m. July 1 through Labor Day. Visitors may remain in
the aquarium for an hour after closing. Admission is $15, $10 ages
3 to 12. Information: (860) 572-5955 or www.mysticaquarium.org.

<P>
   For the Eco-Conscious, Tours in Canada's Parks
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Canada's national parks can collect water samples in
streams and study breeding birds alongside professional researchers
in a program called Parks Canada Research Adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Operated by Good Earth Travel Adventures in Canmore, Alberta, in
conjunction with Parks Canada, the program is in its fourth year
and has been growing steadily. This year eight trips, from three to
seven days, are being offered through September. Groups are limited
to 10, and each trip will be led by at least one expert researcher.
</P>
<P>
   In Spring Bird Survey, June 25 to 29 and June 30 to July 4,
participants will listen for and identify breeding birds in
Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta. Basic birding skills, such
as using binoculars and familiarity with common species, are
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The price is $383 a person, which covers only the educational
program. Accommodations, food and transportation to the starting
point are extra, and packages for these are available.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs include Wildcats and Wildwater, focusing on
protecting water quality for the lynx in Yoho and Banff National
Parks, on Aug. 16 to 22, and Bears and Biodiversity, studying the
ecology of the two same parks, July 5 to 8, Aug. 9 to 15 and Sept.
13 to 16.

   Tourist Help Line Set Up in Portugal
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese government has set up a new help line for
tourists in Portugal. Called the Green Line, the number is (800)
296-296.
</P>
<P>
   Operators furnish information about hotels, restaurants,
transportation, museums and special events, and in an emergency,
they can help with hospitals and the police. The Green Line is
available in four languages _ English, Portuguese, French and
Spanish _ Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to midnight and on Sunday
9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The toll-free number is good anywhere in the country using
either a regular or a cellular phone. Tourist offices throughout
Portugal offer direct phones to the Green Line. It cannot be
reached from outside Portugal.  &QL;

   Golfing in Italy, With Culture Thrown In &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new resort south of Verona, midway between Venice and Milan,
adds golfing in luxury to the pleasures of the Lake Garda region.
</P>
<P>
   Palazzo Arzaga, which opened March 21, includes a 15th-century
monastery and chapel with original frescoes in three rooms and
common areas. Besides two championship golf courses totaling 27
holes, designed by Jack Nicklaus II and Gary Player, and a golf
academy, the resort offers a Saturnia spa, with a holistic approach
to health, three restuarants and proximity to cultural outposts
like Cremona, where Stradivarius stringed instruments were made.
Classical music concerts are planned for the chapel, and the Verona
opera is a half-hour's drive away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The palazzo's 84 rooms include five suites. They are decorated
with 18th-century Venetian and 19th-century Lombardy furnishings.
Suites have fireplaces and marble bathrooms. All the rooms have
air-conditioning, satellite television, hair dryers and computer
jacks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other amenities include two tennis courts, a fitness center, a
driving range, outdoor and indoor pools, hiking trails and a
jogging track. Sailing is available on Lake Garda. Cooking classes
will be offered periodically.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The golf academy, which opened Saturday, offers three- and
five-night packages. They include three hours of lessons, unlimited
greens fees, an afternoon at the spa, and a single or double room
with breakfast for $725 to $1,470. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Arzaga's room rates for the first year start at $310 a night
for doubles and $665 for suites, including breakfast, taxes and
tips. Reservations: (800) 323-7500. &QL;

DECATUR, Texas: to another report. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The girl in Room 102 at the Drover's Inn Motel lived with her
mother. They moved into the motel after her mother, who did
cocaine, and her father, who drank too many beers, got into a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   The girl and her mother shared a room on the corner, across the
parking lot from the office, around the hall from a Dr Pepper
machine. They moved there because it cost $19 a week.
</P>
<P>
   They had lived in worse places. Before the welfare people took
away her little brother, they lived in unclean places where
relatives gave them money for food because the refrigerator was
empty.
</P>
<P>
   April Dawn Lacy was born to Dale and Jacqueline Lacy on July 2,
1982, in a suburb of Oklahoma City. The life they gave her was the
only life she knew.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother taught her which city agencies handed out food and
which gave away clothes. Her father taught her how to swing a bat,
and the time she played T-ball for the city's Optimist League was
the happiest time of her life.
</P>
<P>
   April didn't go to school because the school counselor
threatened to put her in a group home. One school night, she and
her mother stayed up late in the one big bed watching cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, April's mother stood in the parking lot,
leaning on the passenger-side door of a car while someone waited
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to talk to you,'' April said.
</P>
<P>
   She stood in the doorway, dressed in jeans, her bangs
hair-sprayed, her nails painted maroon. April and her mother had
walked to Wal-Mart the night before to buy her press-on nails,
because April chewed hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk when I get back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' April said. ``I need to talk to you now.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother stepped into the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you leave, you'll never see me again.''
</P>
<P>
   April flipped her mother the finger as the car drove away.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Lacy returned to the room 45 minutes later _ it was
11:30 in the morning _ but April was gone. She had left behind her
new purse, her makeup and a pack of Marlboro cigarettes she shared
with her mom.
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-a-half years later, an Oklahoma City lieutenant offered
April's mother a cup of coffee while they waited for her husband to
meet them in his office at the jail.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant told them about the body, and though it wasn't
the first time lawmen thought they might have found April, this
time, the lieutenant slid across the desk a black-and-white drawing
of a sad-eyed girl with bad teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Lacy nearly collapsed; Dale Lacy wanted a drink. They
saw similarities they didn't want to see.
</P>
<P>
   Did your daughter bite her nails?
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Did she have an overbite?
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be her?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   The chin is too round. The hair is too long. The nose is too
big.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't her.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant separated them. He asked the mother if she could
be wrong about the date April vanished. He asked the father if the
mother could have been so strung out on drugs she killed their
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   No, he said. No, absolutely not.
</P>
<P>
   The Lacys took home the drawing, and they looked at it so often
that they eventually put it away, in a night stand drawer. April's
aunt left hers on her coffee table, and April's grandmother left
hers on her mantel, then someone remembered the accident.
</P>
<P>
   April was 12 when she fell off a bicycle. The doctor sewed three
stitches above her eye, and he took X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, 2 1/2 years after April disappeared, Walker and Akin
drove across the Oklahoma border to pick up the X-rays. They turned
back down I-35 and drove through Wise County, to Fort Worth, where
a forensic dental expert made identical X-rays of the unidentified
girl's skull.
</P>
<P>
   The expert returned an hour later and hung the X-rays on a
back-lit wall. He explained: The incisors matched. The overbite
matched. Many of the teeth were the same.
</P>
<P>
   A forensic anthropologist pointed out the sinus cavities,
explaining how they are unique to every human, and how these
matched. The chief medical examiner reviewed the case Wednesday
morning and he came to the same conclusion. The dead girl is April
Lacy.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents don't believe it. They want to see DNA proof.
</P>
<P>
   Walker and Akin know in their gut it's her. They started the
murder investigation the minute they knew. They're going back to
Oklahoma City, back to the cheap motel, to the corner room, to the
only life April Dawn Lacy ever knew.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they'll call her by her name.

WHO WILL STOP OUR GROUND WAR?

<P>
   The day of the killings in Littleton, Colo., a friend at work
couldn't rest until she called her teen-age daughter. ``I know
she'll say, `Oh, mom,' but I just have to,'' she explained, even
though her daughter was just across town at her high school in
Santa Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   I thought it was perfectly natural. When something this horrible
happens you need to touch your own, reassure yourself that their
world is still safe and intact.
</P>
<P>
   A Littleton father of triplets, freshmen at Columbine High
School, was waiting at the airport in Washington to take off for
Denver that day when the pilot announced there had been a shooting
at a Denver school.
</P>
<P>
   He got to a phone, called home and his older son, a college
student, answered. ``There were two things wrong. He wasn't
supposed to be home, and he started crying when he heard my voice.
But then he said, `Dad, the kids are fine.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from the lowest low to the highest high in a matter of
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   One child was at the opposite end of the school from the gunmen
and got out early. Another was helped to safety by a janitor who
said ``follow me and run for your life.'' The third was running
from the shooters when he turned and saw his friend shot point
blank, ``killed in the most vicious way,'' said the father.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman I know used to live in Littleton and that's where
her kids went to school, although it was the other high school from
where the massacre took place. Her kids are long out of school and
she now lives in Denver, but the reason they chose Littleton was
for the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wanted your kids to go to school in Jefferson County.
These schools are award winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Had it happened in Denver, she wouldn't have been as shocked.
She knows someone who quit teaching in Denver because the kids were
so abusive. He had a panic button under his desk to push if he felt
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   There goes another stereotype. Your nice, comfortable
neighborhood will not protect you. A superior school district will
not protect you. Kids with guns have become the great equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   We're running out of ways to rationalize these things, and
that's good. We tend to look for differences after this kind of
tragedy. What can we come up with to distance our community from
that one? Those kids from our kids?
</P>
<P>
   I don't like people turning kids in weird costumes into the
enemy. I know a ``Goth'' kid, maybe she's now an ex-Goth, since her
hair is lately close to natural and her fingernail polish more
glittery than black. She is definitely out of the mainstream, but
she is sweet and smart. The father of the triplets said his kids
had never mentioned any ``trench coat mafia,'' but he, too, is wary
of labeling a group.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's too easy, and what does that lead to? Outlawing cults?
And then, what's a cult? Is the Lions Club a cult?''
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators have even tried to single out Colorado as
being gun-happy, calling it a hunter's paradise. That's too easy,
too, even though the governor was, until this week, all for
allowing everyone to carry concealed weapons. But I don't think we
can blame this on Colorado. Or on kids who wear black trench coats.
We can't even blame it on troubled children or our culture, as if
we were somehow not responsible for either.
</P>
<P>
   This is our national tragedy. Our Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the world now looks at our dead children and
our disbelieving faces and shudders. Foreign newspaper headlines
talk about gun-sick America.
</P>
<P>
   We have a ground war going on right here at home and we have to
intervene because we're the adults. I think we do whatever we can
to take away the guns and take away the message that violence is a
way to solve problems. If the NRA says it's not its fault and the
people who make murder/slasher/serial killer movies say it isn't
theirs, we bring them along to the negotiation table where we sit
down with kids and parents and teachers and find out what we can do
to stop the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Then we try to get to the root of the trouble that produces a
troubled kid by using all our school psychologists and family
dynamic experts. We find out what causes the rage, anger, despair,
resentment, boredom or self-loathing that moves a kid to shoot
another kid in the face because he doesn't like the color of his
skin or his hat or that he's on the football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were blowing them away,'' a Littleton survivor said.
</P>
<P>
   No, they weren't blowing them away. That's movie talk. They were
killing them without batting an eye.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks we've been looking at those terrible scenes in
Yugoslavia, asking how can human beings cause such misery and not
give a damn. This week's question is what makes a child run through
a school, laughing and shouting, ``It's a good day to die.''

 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ah, the sounds of the Irish countryside: the patter
of rain, the lowing of cattle, the gentle hiss of scalding human
flesh. Welcome back to Leenane, that quaint rural town where the
skies are always gray, the people are always angry, and domestic
homicide and mutilation are the No. 1 recreational activities.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place where, according to the local priest, he would
``have to have killed half me ... relatives'' to fit in. This being
Leenane, or at least Leenane as envisioned by the young playwright
Martin McDonagh in his formulaic comic drama ``The Lonesome West,''
the good father modifies ``relatives'' with an adjective that, even
in western Irish dialect, is unprintable here. Leenane inspires
people to strong and surly language.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway audiences were first introduced to this gleefully
macabre landscape only last season, when McDonagh's gripping
``Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' with its original Irish cast, director
and production team, came to the Walter Kerr Theater to reap Tony
awards for three of its actors and for its director, Garry Hynes.
</P>
<P>
   That production shut down in March (to make way for another
Irish play, Conor McPherson's ``Weir''). And now, before we've had
a chance to mourn it properly, here is ``The Lonesome West,'' which
opened Tuesday night at the Lyceum Theater, with Ms. Hynes again
directing, and which suggests ``Beauty Queen'' as reinterpreted by
Beavis and Butt-head.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in ``West'' with such haste was not a great idea. Part
of a trilogy of Leenane plays by McDonagh (``A Skull in Connemara''
is the third), the work offers many of the contempt-making aspects
of familiarity and few of the comforts. Seen in repertory with its
sibling plays, as it was at the Druid Theater in Galway, where it
originated, and at the Royal Court in London, ``West'' might
register as part of an enriching marathon experience.
</P>
<P>
   On its own, however, with the memory of ``Beauty Queen'' still
warm, comparisons are not in its favor. It is directed and acted
with comic precision and flair, and it is occasionally quite funny.
But it lacks the narrative intricacy of ``Beauty Queen'' and the
attendant suspense and psychological mystery. What you see at the
start is what you get for the rest of the evening, and it all
starts to seem as repetitive as a Tom and Jerry cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   A feeling of deja vu descends as soon as you set eyes on Francis
O'Connor's set, which looks a lot like the shabby, claustrophobic
living room-kitchen in which ``Beauty Queen'' took place. Whereas
``Beauty Queen'' was a four-character work that portrayed a mother
and her middle-aged daughter locked in hostile interdependence,
``West'' is a four-character work that portrays two middle-aged
brothers locked in hostile interdependence.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the O'Connors, Coleman (Maeliosa Stafford) and Valene
(Brian F. O'Byrne), who have just buried their father when the play
begins. Dad, it seems, was blasted with a shotgun by Coleman, an
occurrence officially described as an accident, although no one
seems to believe that except for Father Welsh (David Ganly), the
naive young parish priest who has understandably developed a
powerful thirst for alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The violent deaths that are central to ``Beauty Queen'' and
``Skull'' are alluded to here, just as references to some mayhem
around the O'Connor brothers, involving the fatal severing of a
dog's ears, worked their way into ``Beauty Queen.'' But for body
count ``West'' handily tops the trilogy, with two deaths by
drowning in addition to the plot-propelling patricide. There is
also a rather grisly mortification of the flesh that concludes the
first act and brings to mind a similar scene in ``Beauty Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   The small-town despair, restlessness and plain old boredom that
inspire such behavior are again conjured by McDonagh, though in
such broad terms that it rarely arouses emotions other than mild
laughter. It seems clear that the dramatist was aspiring, as in
``Beauty Queen,'' to a more nebulous mixture of elements. The
scene-setting music by Paddy Cunneen is like a Gaelic instrumental
answer to ``Gloomy Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   The play features several lovely tragicomic speeches for Welsh,
played with an affecting blend of ingenuousness and bleakness by
the strapping Ganly, that suggest vernacular variations on Hamlet's
suicide soliloquy. And there's a wryly bittersweet discussion of
ghosts by Welsh and Girleen Kelleher (Dawn Bradfield), a comely,
foul-mouthed local lass with a crush on the priest.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, the show is devoted to the ways in which
Coleman and Valene, who exist in a moldy state of suspended
adolescence, needle each other with endless insults and
recriminations, which every so often degenerate into fisticuffs,
with the occasional appearance of a knife or firearm. O'Byrne, who
was wonderful as the awkward suitor in ``Beauty Queen,'' and the
excellent Stafford have created a mutually dependent, festering yin
and yang relationship not unlike that of Laurel and Hardy or Oscar
and Felix in ``The Odd Couple.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Byrne's Valene, who controls the family purse strings for
reasons that quickly become apparent, is all goony, exaggerated
primness as he struts through the house marking his possessions
with giant V's and arranging his collection of figures of saints.
Dressed by O'Connor in undersize clothes that bring out the
ungainliness of his height and leanness, he ingeniously folds and
unfolds his limbs as though they were collapsible telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford, who is the doughy circle to O'Byrne's ruler-straight
line, is gruffer and more self-contained and makes efficient use of
a more deliberately limited body language. Ms. Hynes exploits these
geometric differences with some astute physical comedy. And the
actors do generate a sense of siblings to whom animosity and
affection are the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that this is implicit from the first sight of the
brothers, and there is minimal room for development and none for
real revelation. By the time Valene and Coleman engage in a
competitive round of confessions of past sins, the whole thing has
started to feel like an old ``I Love Lucy'' episode in Irish Gothic
drag. One can't help thinking of Sam Shepard's slyer, more
engagingly sustained take on battling brothers in a play with a
similar title, ``True West.''
</P>
<P>
   The fey, barbaric charm of the O'Connors' eccentricities, as
well as those of Leenane itself, cumulatively reach a level of
self-parody that evokes the satiric skit in the revue ``Forbidden
Broadway,'' which presents ``Beauty Queen'' as a lugubrious Punch
and Judy show. ``How are things in Irish drama?'' is the musical
question (set to the tune of ``How Are Things in Gloccamora?'')
asked in that sketch.

   Along with McPherson, McDonagh has already made a convincing
argument that Irish drama is quite healthy, thank you. Even in
``The Lonesome West'' there is evidence of an exhilaratingly
original voice. It has just gone hoarse in this outing. Repetition
and strain can do that.

MISSISSIPPI LINKS UP WITH BIG-TIME GOLF

   WEST POINT, Miss. _ The course is lush and lovely, the
facilities luxuriant. Everything about the Old Waverly Golf Club
suggests that it will be a challenging course for the U.S. Women's
Open when it arrives on June 3-7.
</P>
<P>
   There is an obvious question, though, as even Mary Capouch,
chairwoman of the USGA Women's Committee, acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Mississippi? Why Old Waverly?'' Capouch said. ``To tell
the truth, we've been asked that a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Se Ri Pak, who was also on hand at the course
this week, summed up the perception problems.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, a native of Korea, wasn't familiar with Mississippi until a
few months ago. A friend gave Pak a succinct description.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said `very hot,''' Pak said. ``Hot and boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Added to that was the fact that West Point, a town of about
30,000 at the northern tip of the so-called ''Golden Triangle,''
isn't the biggest or the busiest town in Mississippi, lacking the
size of Jackson or the casino glitz of the Gulf Coast towns.
</P>
<P>
   George Bryan, the Bryan Foods heir who built Old Waverly in the
late '80s and almost single-handedly persuaded the USGA to bring
their marquee women's event to town, doesn't look at the setting as
a disadvantage. Instead, he thinks it will add to the growing
popularity of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we made the original proposal, we had some naysayers,''
Bryan said. ``There will always be people who think that you can't
make something work in a rural setting. But we didn't think we were
tackling something we couldn't handle. We researched this very
carefully. We saw that people will travel for an event like this.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the example of the area support given to last year's
tournament in the small town of Kohler, Wisc., more than an hour's
drive from Chicago and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like an event of this magnitude, a national
championship, was something that doesn't happen in this area very
often and that people would come to support it,'' Bryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Old Waverly had the resources, and motivated by a
promise to his late father that he would pursue a championship
event, Bryan made his presentation to the USGA in 1995. Capouch
described Bryan's pitch as a ``wonderful presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten or fifteen years ago, you would not have seen a
presentation like that, which is a reflection of the tremendous
growth in the popularity of women's golf,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   USGA officials came to Old Waverly and green-lighted the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The time was right for this region. Capouch said that ``one of
the missions of the USGA is to take our championships to as many
geographical regions as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one major USGA event _ the 1976 U.S. Open in Atlanta _ has
been played in the Deep South. That event was won by Jerry Pate,
who coincidentally designed Old Waverly.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bryan's faith in the region has been borne out. An army
of volunteers has been raised from across eastern Mississippi.
Players have spoken glowingly of the course. Attendance projections
are good, though Bryan is pushing for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we've sold 85,000 tickets and we'd like to have
100,000 or 105,000,'' Bryan said. He said he expects to draw 3,000
to 4,000 at practice rounds early in the week and by the weekend
hopes to hit 30,000 or even 35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Local hotels are filled but rooms are available in Tupelo and
Tuscaloosa, Bryan said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Women's Open is enjoying a surge of popularity. Last
year's tournament, which ended in a 20-hole playoff between Pak,
the 20-year old sensation, and amateur Jenny Chuasiriporn, was the
most-watched event in women's golf. This year's event will be
televised by ESPN and, in the final two rounds, by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Glenn, the USGA manager of communications, said that last
year's tournament gave viewers ``a front row seat for history.'' By
moving the tournament to Mississippi, the USGA is guaranteed of
history again, regardless of the final results.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Womens Open is one of 13 national championships
conducted annually by the USGA. Other championships include the
U.S. Open, the U.S. Senior Open and 10 national amateur
competitions.

or exhibited low standards. She had a fiery temper and a penchant
for defying authority. ``She's got an attitude a mile long,'' Steve
MacWhirter said over the weekend, joking with pride about his
daughter, now 26. ``Anybody that knows her knows she'd give you the
shirt off her back, but she'll tell you off in a heartbeat. That's
the kind of attitude that makes a helicopter pilot,'' he said.

A TOUCH OF CAPRI OFF LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 2) 
(jt) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the clearest days it rises, as the old song says, ``26 miles
across the sea,'' an apparition barely visible from the beachfronts
of greater Los Angeles _ if not quite Bali Ha'i, certainly an
``island of romance.'' From the bubble of a speedy jet helicopter
bearing down on the picturesque harbor of Avalon, the crags of
Catalina Island rise more dramatically, like some Amalfi town
plopped into the Pacific off the coastal plain of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   When my wife, Dee Dee, and I stole away for Easter weekend this
year, we decided to try to make getting there half the fun,
eschewing the hourlong boat ride across an often choppy channel for
the 14-minute ease of Island Express Helicopter Service, which
leaves from Long Beach harbor, where the Queen Mary now floats as a
hotel, its red smokestacks intimating grander journeys.
</P>
<P>
   The vertiginous chopper ascent is a thrill all its own. Our ride
seemed to have barely begun on that windy Saturday afternoon when
the island came sharply into view and the pilot warned us we would
feel some bumps approaching the landing zone at Pebbly Beach, just
down the shore from Avalon, Catalina's only real town. As it turned
out, it was a good thing we flew; unusually high winds and waves
prompted gale warnings, and the red flags in the harbor meant the
day's last ferries would be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Because our pilot had radioed ahead for a taxi, one was there to
meet us for the five-minute drive to our room at the Hotel
Metropole, built about a decade ago amid a shopping courtyard in
the heart of town, a block back from the beach. And from the minute
we set foot on the broad, pedestrian mall of Crescent Avenue, the
main thoroughfare that curves around the small harbor, I felt a
continent away from the thrum and traffic of Los Angeles, almost as
if I were in an Italian coastal town. Dee Dee spent several summers
on the island as a Girl Scout camp counselor at nearby White's
Landing, and so couldn't quite share my momentary Mediterranean
reverie, but she generously indulged it all the same, and smiled at
familiar landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Catalina's great charm is its unusual blend of built-up pleasure
port and unspoiled, wild interior. It has been a resort destination
for more than a century, first as a virtual tent city of striped
canvas and genteel rocking chairs, and beginning in 1919 as the
more cosmopolitan preserve of William Wrigley Jr., the chewing gum
magnate who bought the controlling interest in the company that
owned the island. Wrigley built a splendid Art Deco ballroom and
movie palace on a point at the end of the harbor, and a sprawling
white mansion for himself on a promontory above it. For years
Catalina was the spring-training home of the Wrigley family's other
pastime, the Chicago Cubs, and the biggest bands of the '30s and
'40s played the circular Casino, as the oceanfront ballroom is
called. It is still the site of dances, weddings and concerts.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1975, the Wrigley family transferred ownership of nearly
90 percent of the 76-square-mile island to the Santa Catalina
Island Conservancy, which maintains the inland roads, a general
aviation airport and acres of back country, where boars and
descendants of bison brought for a movie shoot still roam. Cars are
banned for all but longtime residents (the year-round population is
3,200), and there is now about a 10-year waiting list. Custom golf
carts, with plastic wind curtains, are the transport of choice; the
only visitor vehicles allowed inland are sightseeing buses and
trams. Crammed in summer with blissed-out beachcombers, the island,
with its mild weather, is a year-round getaway for Southern
Californians, especially boaters.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Avalon, the only appreciable speck of civilization on
the island is Two Harbors, a rustic yachting port on a narrow
isthmus on the island's west end. All this careful management means
that Catalina still feels very much as it must have when Humphrey
Bogart sailed over in his yacht Santana, singing ``September Song''
with the likes of Frank Sinatra, or John Wayne arrived in his
converted minesweeper.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropole, a gray-and-white clapboard building with tiers of
balconies, is one of the newer hotels in Avalon and among the
nicest, and made a great jumping off point for our two-day visit.
It is named for the island's original grand hotel, which burned
down in a fire believed to have started in its kitchen, taking half
the town down in flames with it in 1915. The only fire we found was
the one in the gas fireplace in our clean, comfy, if unremarkable
king-bed room, and the tempting aroma of fried calamari wafting up
through the courtyard from the adjoining Channel House restaurant
seemed a danger of the purely caloric kind. Because of the wind and
weather, maritime amusements, like snorkeling, scuba diving, a
cruise on glass-bottom boat or a spin in a sea kayak, were out of
the question, so we contented ourselves with a walk around town,
strolling the side streets where frame bungalows were built row on
row atop the old tent pads, and shopping on Crescent Avenue. Dee
Dee found a sundress (for warmer days) at C.C. Gallagher, a
charming boutique with an espresso bar, sandwich counter and books
on meditation and healthy cooking, while I couldn't resist Lloyd's,
the island's venerable confectioner, for the first of two bags of
soft homemade saltwater taffy in assorted citrus flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Combining research and diversion, we decided to catch a 7
o'clock movie at the gorgeous 1,000-seat Avalon, an Art Deco movie
palace underneath the vintage 1929 Casino. The theater has been
lovingly preserved, and we were delighted by the giant outdoor tile
murals of underwater scenes that cover its loggia, and the painted
ones of California history and landscapes that spread around its
vaulting interior, complemented with rich wood trim and velvet
drapes. The movie, ``Cruel Intentions,'' was lamentable, but the
pre-curtain concert on the Page pipe organ originally installed to
accompany silent films was terrific. The organist pulled out every
stop, from ``Chattanooga Choo-Choo'' with wailing train whistle, to
``Lilli Marlene'' with muffled drums, while star-sized lights
twinkled in the ceiling. Finally, just before the red and green
houselights dimmed, came a majestic, thundering version of the Al
Jolson chestnut ``Avalon.''
</P>
<P>
   After the show, we repaired to Armstrong's Seafood, one of the
most popular waterfront restaurants, with its simple blue and white
checked cloths, harbor view and in-house fish market. It is run by
a local salt and sport-fisherman named Russ Armstrong, whose
mother, Hazel, presides at the front desk and bakes the delicious
homemade carrot cake (``no raisins, extra walnuts''). After a bit
of a wait amid the Saturday crowds, we had martinis and appetizers
of cracked crab claws and chunks of superb smoked albacore tuna,
but the real treat was the fresh sand dabs, caught a mile from
shore at 5:30 that afternoon. This small, succulent fish _ a
beloved local specialty _ tastes a bit like flounder and cleans out
to something about the size of a thin bar of soap; our waitress
expertly filleted each delicious, sauteed piece tableside.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Too lazy and cold to brave a sunrise Easter service in the hills
above town the next morning, but too conditioned to skip church on
that day, we joined Dee Dee's fellow Catholics at St. Catherine's
Church for a peaceful Mass at 9 a.m., and promptly returned to sin
with an artery-clogging stop at Sally's Waffle Shop. We both had
the specialty of the house, Dee Dee with pecans and I straight up,
plus a perfectly basted fried egg, bacon and plenty of good coffee
in a simple storefront where booths surround a square counter with
stools.
</P>
<P>
   Since the wind was still stiff and boating impossible, we took a
gentle mile-and-a-half walk up Avalon Canyon Road, which stretches
behind the town, to the Wrigley Memorial and Botanical Garden. The
130-foot-high Spanish style memorial to William Wrigley Jr., built
almost entirely of native materials in 1934, affords a commanding
view of the ocean and the garden. The 37-acre grounds were the
project of Wrigley's widow, Ada, and its plants include succulents,
native cherry trees that once fed the Indian inhabitants and the
deadly wild tomato, whose purple-black berries are highly
poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   As the day became gloriously sunny, we determined to strike out
on our own off-road adventure. We turned left on our way out of the
garden at the Hermit Gulch campground and took a well-marked trail
leading into the hills above town for what we thought would be an
easy six- or seven-mile hike. All went well enough as we climbed
switchbacks, finally reaching a ridgeline that gave panoramic views
of both sides of the island and the ocean beyond, and a sense of
how it all must have looked to the Gabrieleno Indians who lived
here in pre-colonial times.
</P>
<P>
   But we had only a sketchy map, and when we sought a junction
that would bring us back around the hills to Avalon _ a route we
later saw marked as ``Indian Trail''_ we found ourselves on a
suddenly steep, slippery, shale-covered trace that skittered down
ridges uncomfortably close to high-voltage power lines. At last,
relieved, we stumbled onto a old dirt road leading into town, and
only later realized that our entire expedition had probably been
illegal: we never stopped for the free permit from the Santa
Catalina Island Conservancy required for hiking outside Avalon. By
this point, the wind had died down enough to allow for steamed
mussels and more smoked albacore with Virgin Marys on the outdoor
deck at Armstrong's and a sunset spin in a gas-powered golf cart
from the fleet at Island Car Rentals near the ferry dock.
</P>
<P>
   The etiquette of these conveyances is complex, and a good sign
of island byways and priorities. Visitors are not permitted to rent
them for longer than an hour or two at a time, though some rental
houses come with the use of one, as does a stay at the Inn on Mount
Ada, the former Wrigley mansion, now a deluxe bed and breakfast,
its white facade overlooking the town the way a castle must have
hung above a medieval village. We drove past its gated driveway,
and around the upper rim of the town, admiring a chime tower also
built by Mrs. Wrigley, and Zane Grey's former home, a pueblo-style
building that's now a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   As we looped back into town above the Casino, we spied the
beautiful parklike stretch of Descanso Beach, on the northwest edge
of town, a perfect spot for renting a sea kayak had the weather
been better. Another grand old hotel once stood on this spot, but
it fell on hard times and was torn down in the mid-'60s, leaving a
wide greensward for picnics, games and seaside weddings. We hustled
back just as the rental shop closed, and soothed our aching hips
and calves in the hot tub on the Metropole's rooftop deck as the
sun set.
</P>
<P>
   For our last dinner, we turned to the Ristorante Villa
Portofino, in the waterfront hotel of the same name, which locals
assured us was the island's most ambitious restaurant, with
mainland prices and Italian specialties. We dined well, in part
because bad weather had kept away expected holiday crowds and, the
waiter confided, had left a surplus of seafood. Dee Dee's cioppino
and my linguine al frutti di mare were both bursting with clams,
green-lipped New Zealand mussels, sea bass, salmon and calamari.
</P>
<P>
   Monday dawned sunny and still, inviting us to stay. It helped to
remember that when we long for an island, there's one close by
where we know we'd like to be.

`THE KING OF MASKS': BRIDGING LONELINESS DESPITE THE DISGUISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The King of Masks'' is a Chinese film with pageantry, a magic
act and adorable children to recommend it. And the pet monkey
doesn't hurt, either. Its story is told gently and without excess
sentimentality, even if that story proves less exotic than the
setting (provincial Sichuan in 1930) suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The film, a winner of multiple Oscar-like Golden Roosters in
China, works nicely as the simple tale of a lonely old man, the
child he befriends and the cross-dressing that affects everyone in
various ways.
</P>
<P>
   This film by Wu Tianming presents an old man named Wang (Zhu Xu)
who earns the title nickname for his magician's skill. He appears
able to switch facial masks with lightning speed, a talent that has
made him a popular street performer.
</P>
<P>
   He is so good, in fact, that a male opera star who specializes
in women's roles tries to hire him. But Wang comes from a long
tradition of street performers and he doesn't want to change.
</P>
<P>
   What he does want is an heir, which brings the film to its
indignation over sexual discrimination in the China of this era. It
goes without saying, at least in Wang's mind, that the only fit
protege for him must be a little boy. And in a startling scene, he
buys one who is offered to him on the black market. The child is 8,
and is held by the seller on a leash.
</P>
<P>
   Wang is much kinder than that, of course. (The film's attitudes
are familiar enough to be predictable, in ways perhaps linked to
the filmmaker's four and a half years in the United States.) He is
kindly to the child, though the relationship is such that they call
each other ``Boss'' and ``Doggie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor little melon, tossed in with a black-hearted turnip!''
Wang says, in the film's colorful idiom, when talking about the
cruel way in which Doggie was sold. Wang is reasonably sympathetic
even when he learns, to his vast disappointment, that Doggie is a
girl.
</P>
<P>
   The child's role is played charmingly by Zhou Ren-ying, who
herself was sent away by her impoverished family to join an
acrobatic troupe at age 3. And her rapport with Zhu is the film's
strongest ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The King of Masks'' watches them form a close friendship only
to be plagued by hardship once an accident destroys Wang's career.
The movie is foremost about kindness, and so warm and understated
that that's enough.
</P>

 SANTA BARBARA, CALIF., NEWS-PRESS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ What if you had to climb a 50-foot-high
hill every time you wanted a quart of milk? Or navigate a
treacherous plywood bridge just to pick up your mail?
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Ranchito Vista Road in the Sycamore Canyon area of
Santa Barbara County surmount a staggering obstacle every time they
leave their homes _ a massive, active landslide that has been
inching forward daily since the heavy El Nino rains of February
1998 first sent the mass of mud slipping down the hillside.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow, dead-end road once led to nine homes with
breathtaking views of Sycamore Canyon; at least one sold about two
years ago for nearly $1 million. But since October, the road has
been buried under a pile of dirt 50 feet high, 200 feet wide and
1,000 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to drive in or out of the neighborhood, homeowners must
hike as far as a quarter of a mile uphill from the bottom of the
slide to their front doors, often carrying groceries, dry cleaning
or office paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no end in sight. Since Ranchito Vista Road is
privately owned by its residents, the county is under no obligation
to help, and county supervisors have signaled they won't get
involved. The homeowners themselves can't afford the exorbitant
costs of removing the slide. So, for now, they are simply waiting,
and trying to stay above the emotional quicksand of despair.
</P>
<P>
   The mud engulfed and destroyed one home in March 1998, and
recently has crept to the edge of another. The slide moves about 2
inches a day. The residents of the dwelling most recently
threatened, George and Carol Goebel, abandoned their home three
weeks ago after the building was declared unsafe. A county
inspector said that when the slide had come to within 30 feet of
the Goebels' house, the foundation began to show signs of stress.
</P>
<P>
   No big surprise. Signs of stress abound in the quiet enclave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I go outside and I look
at this and I just burst into tears,'' said Gerrie Shapiro, an
artist.
</P>
<P>
   She and other residents rarely leave their homes these days
because of the incredible effort it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the lucky ones because I can physically withstand
it,'' said Shapiro, 42. ``But there are other people up this road,
my heart breaks for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro wonders, with fire season approaching, whether emergency
vehicles could reach her property. She frets that underground water
lines could snap as the ground moves. She fears that her dream
house, purchased three years ago, is worth almost nothing now. She
hates that even if she wanted to move, she couldn't get her things
out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, she and neighbors worry about their future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what to do,'' she said. ``It just seems like
nobody cares.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some folks care plenty. Utility companies have rerouted
power lines, and the Montecito Fire Department has made special
plans to get access in case of fire.
</P>
<P>
   But county officials have been less helpful, noting that they
aren't liable for the private road.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Breckenridge, a building official with the county, said
geology and stability reports are now required in order to build on
steep slopes. But he guessed that most of the homes on Ranchito
Vista Road were built before that requirement was instituted.
</P>
<P>
   The county had an opportunity to help the Ranchito Vista
residents in September, but declined when the board of supervisors
voted not to apply for federal money to buy the homes from their
owners and then demolish them. The supervisors said the application
process was too expensive, homeowners would receive very little for
their properties and the county didn't want to be liable for the
unstable land.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the residents of Ranchito Vista are left to deal with
the slide. If it reaches Sycamore Canyon Road, the state and the
city of Santa Barbara will have to manage the mess. And if it
eventually crosses the road into Sycamore Creek, it could become
the county flood-control division's problem.
</P>
<P>
   County geologist Brian Baca calls the landslide a ``massive wall
of goo.'' Trying to stop it, he said, would be like trying to stop
flowing lava.
</P>
<P>
   While not accepting responsibility for the problem, county
officials have suggested a few courses of action for the residents.
They could have the slide removed, but it would cost the homeowners
an estimated $1 million and take at least nine months, with 50
truckloads hauling dirt away every day.
</P>
<P>
   They could also buttress the slide for hundreds of thousands of
dollars. Or they could grade it and install drainage systems for
around $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   But even if they could come up with that kind of cash _ which
residents said is unlikely _ there's no guarantee that such methods
would create a safe, stable slope for the remaining homes.

 &HT;    Stir-frying goes way beyond Chinese
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Thursday, April 29.
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a winter of stews, roasts and heavy soups, this may be the
perfect time to dust off that wok and get into some serious
stir-fry. Piles of crunchy, colorful vegetables paired with savory
bits of marinated meat or fish can be just the thing to brighten a
tired culinary routine and segue into the salad days of summer.
</P>
<P>
   The wok was part of Chinese cooking for 3,000 years before it
managed to show up as something ``new'' in American kitchens just a
few decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans recognized stir-frying and the wok as an ideal
way to deliver fast, low-fat, economical and tasty meals and
embraced it as a regular part of their at-home menus. For others,
it never quite took hold.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you don't need a wok to produce great stir-fry; a
large frying pan will do. But using a wok adds greatly to the
esthetics of the process, and it comes down to being just plain
fun. There is, however, some basic information you need to know for
successfully using a wok and stir-frying.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never used a wok or want to add to what you already
know, a few minutes on the Internet can go a long way toward a
great season of stir-frying.

   ``A well-prepared Chinese dish should taste rich to those who
like strong flavors, but not overspiced to those who seek a milder
taste. It should seem sweet to anyone who has a sweet-tooth and hot
to those who like a piquant flavor. A dish that is all of these
things to all of these people is a truly successful dish.''

 &HT;    A slow and steady simmer signals delicate flavor of meat to
emerge from a pot of water, aromatic herbs and spices
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Thursday, April 29.
 &HT;    By John Kessler

   ATLANTA _ There are preparations that make mouths water in
anticipation. Fried potatoes. Caramelized onions. Roast chicken.
</P>
<P>
   And there are those that don't. Boiled potatoes. Creamed onions.
Poached chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a Pavlovian response. After all, we live in the age
of big flavors and heat-browned food. Cooking magazines love to
show flames licking chile-rubbed chicken breasts on the high-tech
patio grill. Trendy restaurants set burnished roast chicken halves
on beds of truffled mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says take out an old pot, fill it with water, and in no
time at all you'll have a juicy, perfectly cooked bird.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't considered poaching a chicken since the days of
mom's Bisquick dumplings, now's the time.
</P>
<P>
   Any cut of bone-in or boneless meat benefits from a good simmer.
One stay-at-home dad who posts his day's activities on the Internet
is a veteran poacher. Since supermarket fryers don't have much
flavor, he routinely poaches whole birds to keep the meat around
for stews, pot pies, sandwiches and salads. When he wants a
flavorful roast chicken, he gets a farm-raised bird from a butcher.
</P>
<P>
   Diet-conscious cookbook writers, like Viana la Place and Martha
Stewart, have found that boneless, skinless chicken breast poached
in a pungent liquid absorbs the flavors and gives more bang for the
low-cal buck.
</P>
<P>
   We also like poaching chicken in a court bouillon. Water
acidulated with wine and lemon juice and scented with aromatic
herbs and spices gives the chicken a delicate, just-barely-there
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   As much as we prefer poaching whole chickens, we found that
bone-in chicken breast quarters tasted no different from boneless,
skinless breasts, so we went with the latter for convenience.
</P>
<P>
   We did, however, find something interesting. Hot poached
chicken, fresh from the pot, can seem a bit mealy, but the texture
keeps improving the closer it gets to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   And then we found that velvety slices of white chicken poached
with herbs from the garden, onions and spices had a gentle,
permeating flavor that was just right with a fresh parsley sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Is your mouth watering yet?
</P>
<P>
   MORE INSIDE:
</P>
<P>
   Poached chicken is the centerpiece of a popular
Chinese/Singaporean quick meal served with rice made from the
poaching liquid and a wicked chile sauce. We've tested and
rewritten this recipe with home cooks in mind. That's just one
poaching technique we played around with.

</P>
<P>
   Cold Poached Chicken With Green Sauce
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 10
minutes
</P>
<P>
   We admit it. This is little-old-lady food. No trendy restaurant
would be caught dead serving something this fussy and potentially
flavorless.
</P>
<P>
   But as generations of lunching ladies can attest, there are
myriad pleasures to cold poached chicken. It is velvety on the
tongue. It tastes faintly of the aromatics in the poaching liquid.
Its pale ivory color fairly demands your best bone china.
</P>
<P>
   And with an herbal drizzle of green sauce, it tastes of spring.
</P>
<P>
   For the chicken:
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 quarts water
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   3 sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, peeled and quartered
</P>
<P>
   3 sprigs parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   2 whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts (12 ounces each)
</P>
<P>
   For the green sauce:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup packed flat-leaf parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup packed fresh basil
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon drained capers
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   In a large pot, bring water, wine, bay leaves, thyme, onion,
parsley, peppercorns and lemon juice to boil. Submerge chicken
breasts, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered until
chicken is done, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove and wrap tightly in plastic film. Chill. Slice just
before serving and serve with a drizzle of green sauce.
</P>
<P>
   For the green sauce: Combine parsley, basil, garlic and capers
in food processor. With motor running, add olive oil in a thin
stream. Scrape down bowl and add vinegar, lemon juice and salt.
Chill well.

   We know you have 365 ways to cook boneless, skinless chicken
breasts. But we bet you never thought to butterfly it, stuff it
with a deconstructed jambalaya and roll it in plastic to poach. We
did, and can vouch that this rolled chicken is: a) perfectly
suitable for company you want to impress with a cool kitchen
technique; b) easy on the budget; and c) slightly time-consuming
but easy enough to get the hang of.
</P>
<P>
   If you get the chicken rolls and garnishes prepared, you can
poach them in 10 minutes just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with Spanish rice and a thick tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons butter or oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 medium onion, diced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 green bell pepper, cored, seeded and diced
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 andouille sausage, diced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   A few grindings of pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound cooked, peeled crawfish tails
</P>
<P>
   2 whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   In a skillet over medium heat, warm butter or oil. Add onion,
pepper and garlic and saute until soft. Add sausage and fry for 2
to 3 minutes, until fragrant. Add salt, pepper, oregano, thyme and
crawfish tails; stir to combine. Transfer to large metal mixing
bowl to cool. Cut chicken breasts in halves and remove small filets
from the middle of the undersides. With small knife, scrape out
white tendons from center of the filets and discard. Place small
chicken filets in food processor and pulse to chop. Scrape down
sides of bowl. With motor running, add cream in a steady stream to
make chicken mousse. When crawfish/sausage mixture is cool, add
mousse and mix well. Carefully butterfly breasts lengthwise with
sharp knife and open up like books. Place one in center of an
18-inch length of plastic wrap (not Saran Wrap, which tears too
easily). Spoon enough stuffing into center to fill amply. Roll up
chicken around filling and roll tightly in plastic film. Twist ends
like taffy wrappers to make a taut 6-inch roll with 6-inch lengths
of film on either side. Bring together ends and tie them in knot so
roll holds its shape. Repeat process with remaining breast. In
5-quart pot, poach rolls in 2 quarts of gently simmering water for
12-15 minutes. Allow to rest at room temperature for 5 minutes
before unwrapping and slicing. Serve hot with a cream sauce or
tomato sauce; or chill and serve with a mayonnaise-based sauce and
salad.

</P>
<P>
   4 whole chicken breasts, skinned, split, boned, and fat trimmed
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup fruity white wine, or water
</P>
<P>
   Parchment or wax paper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup fruity olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 sprigs fresh tarragon, or 1 teaspoon dried tarragon leaves,
crumbled
</P>
<P>
   Zest of 1 small lemon, removed with a vegetable peeler
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons raisins, plumped in hot water for 15 minutes and
drained
</P>
<P>
   Arugula leaves for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Slightly flatten the chicken
breasts with the palm of your hand. Place in a lightly oiled,
shallow roasting pan. Lightly salt and pepper. Add the wine or
water to the pan. Cover with lightly oiled parchment paper or wax
paper cut to just fit the pan. Bake for about 10 minutes or until
cooked through. Let the chicken cool in the pan. Whisk together the
vinegar and olive oil in a bowl. Add the tarragon, lemon zest and
raisins. Arrange the chicken breasts in 1 layer in a shallow dish
just large enough to hold them. Pour the dressing over the chicken.
Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator at least
12 hours, turning the chicken occasionally. Before serving, return
to room temperature. Place the arugula leaves on individual plates
or on a platter and arrange the chicken on the leaves. Garnish with
the raisins and lemon zest, and drizzle a little of the marinade
over the chicken. _ From ``Cucina Fresca'' by Viana LaPlace and

 &HT;    Poaching makes for tender, juicy chicken
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Thursday, April 29.
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All over Singapore and Malaysia are restaurants that
specialize in quick meals of chicken and rice. As soon as you slide
in front of a Formica tabletop, the server brings a platter of
tender poached chicken and a bowl of magnificent, pale brown rice
that gets its color from chicken broth and gobs of shallots. Help
yourself to a spoonful of the sweet but hotter-than-hell chile
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   We played around with published recipes until we devised one
suitable to American home cooks. Our surefire way to poach chicken
without overcooking is to bring the poaching liquid to a boil,
immerse the chicken, bring it back to a boil, turn heat off and let
it sit for one hour in the pot with a tight-fitting lid. No
peeking. Make sure to choose a small fryer (no more than 3 1/2
pounds), and don't be alarmed if the chicken is still a little pink
at the bone. The meat is safely cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Since this method produces a weak broth _ too weak to make the
rice interesting _ we added some prepared broth to the poaching
water. We also changed the rice preparation into a straightaway
pilaf. Traditionally, the raw rice is wok-fried, then cooked
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the chile sauce is easy to whip up, but you can find a
bottled version in Asian markets (called ``sauce for chicken'' and
packaged in bottles that look like they should hold fifths of Jack
Daniel's). Or you can use your favorite prepared sauce. This tender
poached chicken will taste just fine in anything you care to dip it
in.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the three-part recipe, along with several others in
which poached chicken is the central ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Hainanese Chicken and Rice
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 80 minutes
</P>
<P>
   For the chicken:
</P>
<P>
   1 small fryer (about 3 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
</P>
<P>
   1 (1-inch) length ginger, peeled and smashed with a heavy knife
</P>
<P>
   1 green onion, washed and tied into a knot
</P>
<P>
   2 (14 1/2-ounce) cans chicken broth, plus about 3 quarts water,
to cover chicken
</P>
<P>
   1 or 2 tablespoons sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   Sliced cucumber, sliced tomato and cilantro sprigs for garnish
</P>
<P>
   For the rice:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   1 heaping tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 cups jasmine rice
</P>
<P>
   4 cups broth reserved from poaching chicken
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   For the chile sauce:
</P>
<P>
   8 small dried red chile pods, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 large shallot, chopped (about 1/4 cup)
</P>
<P>
   3 large garlic cloves, chopped (about 2 tablespoons)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons peeled, minced ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup hot chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lime or lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Wash chicken and remove knobs of tail fat. Sprinkle inside of
chicken with salt, and insert garlic, ginger and green onion.
</P>
<P>
   In a large pot (8-quart is best, but one that's at least 5
quarts will do) bring broth and water to a boil. Add chicken,
breast side down, submerging completely, adding more water to
submerge if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Bring water back to a rollicking boil. Remove the pot from heat
and cover with a tight-fitting lid.
</P>
<P>
   Leave undisturbed for one hour. Do not peek. We mean it. After
one hour, remove chicken and drain broth from the body cavity. Keep
broth for later use.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse chicken under tap water for 2 minutes to stop the cooking
process and to tighten the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Drain, rub some sesame oil over skin and let the chicken cool to
room temperature. Meanwhile, prepare rice as directed below.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the chicken into pieces. The best way is like this: Cut down
through the breastbone. Cut along both sides of the backbone and
discard. Cut into breast and leg quarters. Remove rib bones and
wing tips from breast. Cut through the meat into inch-thick chunks.
Cut the leg quarters into thighs and drumsticks. Remove chicken
skin as you see fit.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange pieces of chicken on platter and garnish with sliced
cucumbers and tomatoes. Decorate the top with cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with rice and chile sauce.
</P>
<P>
   For the rice: Heat vegetable oil over medium heat in a medium
pot with a tight-fitting lid. Add shallots and stir-fry for 1
minute till fragrant. Add garlic and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the
rice grains and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes, until shallots begin
to darken. Add the chicken broth and salt. Bring to a boil over
high heat; lower heat to medium-low and cover. After 8 minutes,
lower heat to low. After another 10 minutes, turn off heat, leaving
pot covered to continue steaming. After another 10 minutes, uncover
and fluff with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   For the chile sauce: Pulse chiles, shallot, garlic and ginger in
food processor to grind. With motor running, add the hot chicken
broth in a thin stream. Add remaining ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Cool and let sit at least one hour before serving. Sauce can be
stored in the refrigerator for 4 to 5 days.

   MAIN DISH SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Tender, White-Meat Chicken Salad
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Here's a trick they do teach in cooking school: For soft,
deli-style chicken salad, immerse still-hot poached chicken in the
dressing. As the salad cools to room temperature, the dressing
swells into the cooked meat and leaves it utterly tender. Tasty,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Here, we use all white meat, dice it into small cubes and fold
it into a minimum of mayo. We season it with some good mustard,
Asian sesame oil, green onions and capers. You might wish to omit
the capers and add some toasted, sliced almonds. Or perhaps stir a
little curry powder into the mayonnaise and toss in some halved
seedless red grapes. If you do add raw veggies or fruit, wait until
the salad cools before folding them in.
</P>
<P>
   2 (14 1/2-ounce) cans chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 12 ounces
each)
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup mayonnaise (plus more if needed)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   2 green onions, slivered
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers, drained
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   A few grinds black pepper
</P>
<P>
   In a large pot, bring broth to boil. Submerge chicken breasts in
broth, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered until chicken
is done, 10-12 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine
mayonnaise, mustard, sesame oil, green onions, capers, salt and
pepper. When chicken is ready, remove to a cutting board and dice,
using a fork to steady it as you cut. (Reserve broth for another
use.) Combine hot chicken with mayonnaise mixture and stir to
combine. If salad looks dry, add a spoonful of additional
mayonnaise. Let cool to room temperature before refrigerating.

 &HT;    Atlantan's fudge has withstood the test of time

   Mildred Peppers of Atlanta sent an old family recipe in response
to Lithonian Samantha Svensson's plea for Buttermilk Fudge, an
unusual blend of buttermilk and all the usual fudge ingredients _
except chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Peppers said she and her brother used the more than 80-year-old
recipe to make the fudge when they were teenagers. From experience,
she warns cooks to be careful not to let the pot boil over.

over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes
to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to stir until it
reaches soft ball stage (a drop forms a soft ball when dropped into
a small glass of cold water). This should take 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove from heat. Stir in nuts, vanilla extract and butter. Beat
with an electric mixer until creamy, about 10 minutes. Pour or
spoon evenly into buttered oblong dish, such as a large loaf pan.
Cool at least 2 hours, then cut in 1-inch squares.

   The moving man was tallying my possessions as I led him through
my Upper West Side apartment _ ``this bookcase, that bookcase,
sofa, four chairs, table, that bookcase ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``So what's your new address?'' he asked, pencil poised.
</P>
<P>
   I named an Upper East Side building and he cocked a skeptical
eyebrow. ``You won't live there long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This observation from a stranger took me aback and I asked him
what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're obviously a West Sider _ you've got more books than
clothes,'' he said. ``East Siders have more clothes than books.''
</P>
<P>
   That was two years ago. This month I hired him again to move me
back to the West Side.

   All the construction going on in Manhattan jogged Nadia
Koutzen's memory of an incident when an old Columbia University
building on West 60th Street was being demolished. She stopped to
watch as the crew was removing doors and windows before swinging
the wrecking ball. A man leaning against a nearby fence called out,
``Why don't they take the bottom out first, and then the whole
thing'll go down.''
</P>
<P>
   I was at Pennsylvania Station to catch a train to Long Island on
a recent Sunday when I saw a police officer approach a musician who
had a guitar, microphone and speakers. I thought I was going to
witness a ``quality of life'' arrest but instead, the officer
pointed to the microphone and with a nod from the musician, picked
it up and started to sing. Unaccompanied, but perfectly in tune, he
sang an Elvis Presley ballad.
</P>
<P>
   My fellow passengers had also stopped to listen and, like me,
were smiling. It was a real boost to the spirit.

   The two very chic women, who apparently had not seen each other
in some time, exchanged effusive salutations. One of the women had
a small poodle. Camilla Harris was nearby as the friend bent down
to pet the dog and gushed, in typical doggy and baby language,
``What a sweet little doggy you are _ how old are you now?'' There
was, of course, no reply, but the dog owner felt she should explain
why. ``You'll have to speak up,'' she said. ``She's hard of
hearing.''

   A couple in Astoria, Queens, who wish to remain anonymous moved
a backyard grape vine to a new spot and started a compost pile to
help it along. Last fall, they had a bumper crop of grapes. When
the wife was turning over the compost recently, she found a bottle
of Viagra that had disappeared. The bottle had fallen out of a
cabinet into the container where the compost was collected. The
bottle was still capped but the two are convinced that its very
presence _ and osmosis _ account for the vine's stunning result. It
proves, the husband said, that ``even Father Nature needs help.''

   The other day, while in the Park Avenue offices of Bloomberg
Financial Markets, I went to the men's room.
</P>
<P>
   Standing right next to me was another man who, out of the blue,
said, ``What did you say?''
</P>
<P>
   Surprised, I turned slightly and asked, ``What did you say?''
</P>
<P>
   There was no response for a couple of seconds and then he said,
turning farther away from me: ``Listen, I've got to go. I'll call
you back.''
</P>
<P>
   Then I heard the beep of a cell phone being turned off.
</P>
<P>
   I know we are all more pressed for time these days and it's
pretty hectic at Bloomberg, but I had to laugh.

   I was on a northbound M104 bus recently, seated in the back row
next to the window. As I was gathering my things to get off, I
heard a clink _ my house key had fallen into the slot under the
seat. My attempts to retrieve it were unsuccessful. I informed the
driver and he told me he would stop at 96th Street to inform his
dispatcher. The dispatcher advised him to take me to the garage at
the last stop where he thought the seat could be taken up by
maintenance workers.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatcher had radioed in by the time we got to the garage
and the maintenance crew was waiting. They retrieved the key and
the driver delivered me back to my stop. It made me proud to be a
New Yorker.

   Joyce Greenfield takes no credit for this poem. The words boomed
through a microphone held by a young preacher at 42nd Street and

   Deborah Krasnow enjoyed this sign in the window of a SoHo shop:

   Recently, Judith Zabar was visited at her studio by Jackie Gray,
of Key West, and two of her friends who were spending a few days in
New York. In the course of conversation, they asked about getting
theater tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zabar told them about TKTS, the ticket booth at 47th Street
and Broadway, and advised them to get on line at 11 a.m. for a
matinee and 4 P.M. for an evening performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have my computer with me,'' Ms. Gray replied.

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL TAMMEUS &LR;  &QC;  Have you noticed? A lot of the news nowadays
seems to be about who's doing what to prevent what's already
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace and humanity will prevail in Kosovo,'' Mr. Clinton says.
Even if no one is left there to enjoy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in Kosovo,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``because we want to
replace ethnic cleansing with tolerance and decency.'' And because
we didn't know what else to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of Europe,'' the president says, ``is coming together
today.'' Except, of course, for those places being blown apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although the weather in the nation's Heartland has been rainy
and overcast for days, the good news is that it makes us safe from
NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' says Al Gore, ``is a good and decent place.'' Yes,
but sometimes it seems as if it could use a few more bouncers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No society,'' Gore says, ``will ever be perfect.'' The
freshness of this news is on a parallel with the discovery that
most of the ocean is wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why human beings do evil,'' says Gore, ``I do not understand''
_ despite being in an office where he observes a fair amount of it
up close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure your children know you care about what they're
doing,'' Mr. Clinton says. Even if you prefer they not know about
some of what you're doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``We must pledge ourselves to the task of putting an end to the
culture of violence,'' says Mr. Clinton. Dark days ahead for
defense contractors?
</P>
<P>
   Here's another bad idea for how to reform Social Security: Allow
people to start drawing checks when their pets hit 65 in dog years.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore says parents have ``got to talk to our children.'' Or at
least leave occasional messages on their answering machines.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton is proposing new gun-control legislation. That's a
relief. We worried that he was crossing the church-state line with
a nun-control law.
</P>
<P>
   The new Clinton gun law would require child safety locks on
weapons. If they work like child-proof caps on drugs, only kids
could unlock them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that God's hand has touched the United States of
America,'' Al Gore says, but he didn't specify whether with a
gentle palm or the back of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts think Gore is vulnerable and Bill Bradley has a
chance to beat him. It doesn't hurt to be known as a Bill who can
keep his pants on.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky, feeling ``emotionally drained,'' will do no
more interviews in the U.S., her publisher says. Finally, this
scandal produces good news.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has named its headquarters the George Bush Center for
Intelligence. There was no chance the name would be applied to Dan
Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have found the fossils of two previously unknown
species of dinosaurs in Utah. No, neither used to play for the
Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in Massachusetts have cloned three goats. Goats?
Enough of this waste of time. Let's get cracking on cloning
chocolate cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have cloned both sheep and goats. Will the Bible now
have the Lord putting ``the cloned sheep on his right and the
cloned goats on his left''?

GENERAL ONCE IN CHARGE OF NUKES HAS BECOME WARRIOR FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By BEN HELLWARTH   
 Santa Barbara News-Press   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ In the past 15 years, the Nuclear Age
Peace Foundation has presented many of its annual peace awards to
leaders with household names, including Ted Turner, Jacques-Yves
Cousteau, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama, Helen Caldicott
and Carl Sagan.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer people will recognize the name of retired Air Force Gen.
Lee Butler, who will receive the Santa Barbara-based foundation's
1999 Distinguished Peace Leadership Award on Friday. Butler, who
once oversaw the nation's nuclear arsenal, has never sought the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   After attaining the rank of general in 1991, during the waning
days of the Cold War, Butler became commander-in-chief of the
Strategic Air Command, which put him in charge of the Air Force's
nuclear weapons. He then rose to commander-in-chief of the U.S.
Strategic Command, a post that brought all of the nation's nuclear
weaponry under his supervision and made him a principal adviser to
the president.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1994, after 33 years in the military. Two years
later, Butler stated publicly that nuclear weapons should be
abolished, which also happens to be a central goal of the Nuclear
Age Peace Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Butler is a man who believes in security, and he has
come to believe that nuclear weapons, in any form, cannot provide
that security. It takes courage, given his background, to speak out
in this way,'' said David Krieger, president of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit foundation will honor Butler on Friday at its 16th
annual peace award dinner. The award will be presented by actor
Michael Douglas, who has become a United Nations peace messenger
and has joined the movement to abolish nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who lives in Omaha, Neb., does not frequently give
interviews. He declined to speak prior to the speech he will give
upon accepting his award, but when the retired general has spoken,
he has not mince words about his anti-nuclear stance.
</P>
<P>
   On a philosophical note, Butler has said in the past: ``Nuclear
weapons play on our deepest fears and pander to our darkest
instincts. They corrode our sense of humanity, numb our capacity
for moral outrage, and make thinkable the unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   About the transformation of his own thinking, he has said:
``Much of what I took on faith was either wrong, enormously
simplistic, extraordinarily fragile, or simply morally intolerable.
What I have come to believe is that the amassing of nuclear
capability to the level of such grotesque excess as we witnessed
between the United States and the Soviet Union over the period of
the 50 years of the Cold War, was as much a product of fear, and
ignorance and greed, and ego and power, and turf and dollars, as it
was about the seemingly elegant theories of deterrence.''
</P>
<P>
   And on a spiritual note: ``We escaped the Cold War without a
nuclear holocaust by some combination of skill, luck and divine
intervention, and I suspect the latter in greatest proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler began to make such bold statements after joining the
Canberra Commission, an elite group of world leaders assembled by
the Australian government to ponder nuclear policies and issues
related to fostering peace.
</P>
<P>
   Krieger first met Butler and heard him speak out against nuclear
weapons alongside former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, at the
State of the World Forum in 1996. That San Francisco-based
organization, also intent upon eliminating nuclear weapons, is
headed by former Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who will be among
the anti-nuclear dignitaries seeing Butler receive his award and
taking part in the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation's daylong strategy
meeting that will precede the awards.
</P>
<P>
   During his military career, Butler was a classic Cold Warrior,
and a firm believer in the cat-and-mouse game of nuclear
deterrence, said Cranston. When the Cold War ended with the
dissolution of the Soviet Union, the general hoped to see
substantive changes with regard to nuclear weaponry, ``but he
became alarmed that there was no change in nuclear policy, either
by us or by the Russians,'' Cranston said.
</P>
<P>
   By December 1996, Butler had taken his stand in favor of
eliminating nuclear weapons with a high-profile speech to the
National Press Club, which came as he and 60 retired generals and
admirals from the United States, Russia, Britain, France and 12
other countries issued a joint statement calling for a permanent
global ban on nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Butler's military peers were quick to question his new
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the announcement went public, they were pretty critical
of it, and did the patronizing thing of saying, `He means well but
he doesn't understand the problem,''' said Adm. Eugene Carroll, who
oversaw 7,000 nuclear weapons in Europe while serving under Gen.
Alexander Haig and was among the retired officials to sign the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a man who committed his life's work, as it were, to
preparing for war and was responsible for the United States'
nuclear war plans and the execution of those plans,'' said Carroll,
who retired in 1980 and is now with the Center for Defense
Information. ``And the process convinced him that he had to speak
out against it. That takes intellectual honesty and personal
courage to do that.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Golf ball-sized hail fell near Columbia, S.C., on Tuesday as a
front draped over the area acted as a focus for showers and
thunderstorms. Additional strong to locally severe storms are
likely Wednesday near the front over east Georgia and South
Carolina. Gusty winds and large hail are again possible, especially
in the afternoon as a jet stream disturbance passes overhead.
</P>
<P>
   A more tranquil rain with embedded rumbles of thunder will fall
to the north of the front from southern Virginia to Missouri. Since
the rain will be falling on already saturated ground, minor
flooding is possible, mainly in southern Illinois and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and isolated strong thunderstorms will percolate in the
afternoon heat over Florida. The showers will not be widespread
enough, however, to provide relief from the drought plaguing the
state.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, fair weather will dominate over much of the Great
Lakes States and the Northeast. Ample sunshine will mix with only a
few clouds, though it will be chilly in the Northeast as a
persistent flow of cool air from Canada persists. Some showers will
dampen eastern Maine as a sluggish ocean storm circulates moisture
and clouds westward.
</P>
<P>
   Developing low pressure will instigate showers and potent
thundershowers in the valleys of the interior West. Heavy snow will
fall in the Bitterroots and Tetons this afternoon as low pressure
aloft passes overhead. Very gusty winds will blow in California and
Nevada in the low's wake, though widespread sunshine will grace
areas west of the Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Derecho
</P>
<P>
   Violent winds of up to 90 mph tore across east Texas and the
southern Mississippi Valley Tuesday. The strong winds resulted from
a cluster of thunderstorms that produced what meteorologists call a
derecho. The word ``derecho'' is Spanish and its literal
translation means ``straight ahead''. Powerful straight-line wind
gusts, not the twisting currents of tornadoes, are the derecho's
primary arsenal for damage. The turbulent gusts develop as
downdrafts within the thunderstorms accelerate rapidly toward
earth, spreading out in a destructive barrage upon reaching the
surface.

`LET IT COME DOWN': CASTING NIHILISTIC PEARLS FROM HIS LOFTY
PERCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   His cold, hooded eyes gazing calmly into the void, traces of a
bitter smile flickering around his withered lips, the author Paul
Bowles, in Jennifer Baichwal's compelling documentary portrait,
dispenses pearls of nihilistic observation like a sadistic oracle
whose purpose is to extinguish fleeting hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people are planets, floating spheres,'' he
declares in a patrician New England drawl dripping with hauteur.
``If they touch, they just touch at one tiny point. In general they
don't touch at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there's a glint of gallows humor. ``It's impossible to
be dead, because to be is the opposite of death,'' he cracks.
``Whatever is alive has to die. Maybe that's the meaning of life.
The meaning of life is inevitable death.''
</P>
<P>
   These remarks, offered at the end of the film ``Let It Come
Down: The Life of Paul Bowles,'' underscore the dispassionate,
Darwinian vision of a universe of predators and prey that the
author, now 88, has distilled in novels like his 1949 masterwork,
``The Sheltering Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary, which opens Wednesday in New York City, is
interspersed with grim little slivers from Bowles' fiction read by
the Canadian actor Tom McCamus, often accompanied by gorgeous shots
of the arid desert landscape around Tangier where Bowles has lived
for most of the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   His lean, dry, elegant prose from which emotion has been drained
away looks at human experience from a perspective that suggests a
scientist examining tiny poisonous reptiles under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles says most of his tales are ``varieties of detective story
in which the reader is the detective.'' He is quietly outspoken in
his loathing of the Bernardo Bertolucci film adaptation of ``The
Sheltering Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   The portrait that emerges is of a man who grew up estranged from
cold, pleasure-denying parents and fled his background to become a
world traveler. After making a modest name for himself as a theater
composer in the 1940s, he forsook composition for writing.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, he bought a house in Tangier that became a
bohemian mecca visited by the Beats, Tennessee Williams, Truman
Capote, Ned Rorem, Francis Bacon and many others.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Jane Auer, a fellow writer, in 1938 lasted until
her death from a lingering illness in 1973. Their complicated
marriage was more of a collaborative friendship (Jane Bowles'
fiction has as many admirers as her husband's) than a romantic
union.
</P>
<P>
   After 1950 Bowles' primary love was Ahmed Yacoubi, a Moroccan
artist with whom he had ``a romantic mad love affair,'' recalls one
observer. Bowles would disagree. He dismisses romantic love as ``an
obsession'' and calls it ``abnormal.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few moments in the film when Bowles bristles is at
accepting the label homosexual. In rejecting it, he quotes Gore
Vidal's insistence on distinguishing between what you are and what
you do.
</P>
<P>
   After Bowles became attached to Yacoubi, his wife began a
lifelong lesbian relationship with Amina Bakalia, a Moroccan woman
also known as Cherifa, who was rumored to have poisoned Jane to
death. Cherifa laughingly denies the rumor.
</P>
<P>
   One of the coups of ``Let It Come Down'' is a reunion of Bowles
with William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg filmed in 1995 when
Bowles visited New York (for the first time in 35 years) to attend
a concert of his music at Lincoln Center. Burroughs, despite his
respect for the author, has some needling criticisms of his sexual
subterfuge and suggests that Bowles' 1972 autobiography, ``Without
Stopping,'' would have been more accurately titled ``Without
Telling.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their differences, Burroughs (who died in 1997) and
Bowles emerge as kindred spirits: grand old bohemian men of
letters, touched with paranoia, loftily looking down at the human
race and its pathetic illusions of religion and romantic love with
a sepulchral contempt.

the disintegrating Ottoman Empire. He was 3 years old when the
soldiers came first to take the young men, including his father,
and then returned for all the other Armenians. The pattern was
repeated in village after village. The ensuing slaughter was
eventually given a formal name: The Armenian Genocide. The ghostly
survivors became almost as familiar to newspaper readers of their
time as the refugees from Kosovo are today. The starving Armenians,
as they were widely known, became an international cause. And then
they were forgotten so completely that the people who rule their
land today can blandly deny that anything so awful ever happened.

 &HT;    PALESTINIANS SEE STATEHOOD AS A MATTER OF TIMING
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip While Yasser Arafat and leaders of the PLO
Tuesday debated whether to declare Palestinian statehood, a mother
a few miles away held the answer in her hands.
</P>
<P>
   Zakia Abbas clutched two Palestinian passports for her children
that had been issued by the Interior Ministry of the temporary
Palestinian government. While they allow travel, the passports are
for people without a country. But Abbas and her husband see them as
signs of progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The establishment of the state is inevitable,'' said the
husband, 40-year-old Mohammed Abu Bari. ``But, we have to be
prepared (first) and there are political pressures on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those pressures surfaced Tuesday in a closed-door meeting at
Arafat's seaside offices, where leaders of the PLO began
discussions on the inflammatory question of whether Arafat should
declare statehood on May 4, or accede to U.S. requests to delay the
announcement and settle for accelerated peace talks with Israel.
The decision could affect the outcome of Israeli elections on May
17.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat told the 124-member PLO Central Council that they should
delay the call for statehood. ``We are going through a very
delicate period in the history of our people, a period during which
we cannot afford making any mistakes,'' Arafat said, according to
the official Palestinian news agency WAFA.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting will resume Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   May 4th is the original target date for a permanent peace
agreement with Israel, as set out in the Oslo Peace Accords, signed
by the Palestinians and Israel in 1993. The Palestinians feel they
have received much less land from Israel than they expected under
the accords, and therefore claim the right to declare a state on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israelis assert that the May 4 deadline was merely a goal
and that the process should continue. Any statehood for
Palestinians, they say, should be negotiated and include limits on
any prospective Palestinian military and Israeli control over who
enters the area.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has threatened military action to retake areas already
given to Palestinians and threatened to incorporate into Israel
large disputed portions of land in the West Bank. U.S. officials
want Arafat to delay a statehood announcement in order to avoid a
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Arafat's aides have tried to build political cover by
stating that the world community largely recognizes Palestinian
rights to statehood. They say the question of statehood, similar to
how Zakia Abbas felt holding her passports, has moved from ``if''
to ``when.''
</P>
<P>
   But, members of the Central Council on Tuesday were more
strident, indicating they might defy the world community and their
own leader's apparent wishes and go ahead with the declaration on
May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they were dissatisfied with the mild promises of
support offered by the United States and other officials seeking
delay. They also seemed unconcerned that a declaration might work
to the favor of Israel's hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in his May 17 re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to declare statehood on May 4th,'' said council member
Marwan Barghouti, leaving the meeting during a break. ``(The
council) is frustrated. We heard there were going to be many
guarantees (from foreign countries). There are no guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of the council, stacked with Arafat supporters,
could run for days or weeks. One major topic is sure to be a letter
that President Clinton sent to Arafat Monday, offering to speed up
the peace process and criticizing Israeli housing construction on
disputed lands.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders Tuesday said it did not go far enough in
backing their desires for statehood. Even some Arafat supporters
back the May 4 call for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But opinion in Palestinian streets seems divided. A poll
conducted last week by the Palestinian-run Center for Palestine
Research and Studies showed 48 percent favoring a postponement in
the statehood declaration and 43 percent favoring a declaration May
4.
</P>
<P>
   What many Palestinians note when opposing statehood now is that
their actual powers are still very limited. Their borders are still
controlled by Israel, for example.
</P>
<P>
   While Arafat's leaders met by the shore, scruffy teenage
tacticians on the streets of the sprawling Beach Refugee Camp held
their own deliberations on statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Several boys in tattered pants huddled together while their
younger bare-footed siblings stood by, literally learning
Palestinian strategy in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in a hurry for (statehood), but it is better to do things
through peaceful ways,'' said Mahmoud Abu Shagfeh, 14. He added an
important question, ``How can we have a state without Jerusalem?''
Palestinians claim the Israeli capital as their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to build our own institutions,'' said 12-year-old Noor
Sallah Abu Shagfeh, no relation to Mahmoud, who wants to be a
lawyer. ``But we cannot give Israel a reason to attack us.''

 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Opening its season at the Metropolitan Opera House on
Monday night, American Ballet Theater tried out a festive novelty:
a hero and heroine in ``Don Quixote'' multiplied by three.
</P>
<P>
   Paloma Herrera and Angel Corella, as the ballet's young lovers,
led off in Act I and were suddenly transformed into Susan Jaffe and
Jose Manuel Carreno in Act II, while Act III had Nina Ananiashvili
and Julio Bocca, in the same roles, delivering the goods in the
celebrated final pas de deux.
</P>
<P>
   It was a glittering showcase for virtuosic dancing even if
dramatic coherence was not on the table. Rather short on
continuity, this gala gimmick reminded one of the old joke about
the genre of experimental French novel known as the nouveau roman;
namely, that you could shuffle the pages in the narrative without
anyone knowing the difference.
</P>
<P>
   A different pair of principals in each act rather than one pair
in three acts is not an idea whose time has come. Every act seemed
interchangeable with another. Nonetheless, Ballet Theater artistic
director Kevin McKenzie succeeded with his one-time event in
showing off his own dancers rather than guests, and he managed
marvelously to put most of the company onstage.
</P>
<P>
   The performance was preceded by onstage remarks by McKenzie,
Caroline Kennedy and Tipper Gore, the wife of the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   As Hillary Rodham Clinton did last year, Mrs. Gore urged support
of the arts and singled out Ballet Theater for its ``standard of
excellence.'' ``I'm honored to be here,'' she said after praising
the company's educational and outreach activities.
</P>
<P>
   The gala benefit, which opened a season that runs through June
19, had Ms. Kennedy and Blaine Trump as co-chairwomen. Ms. Kennedy
urged all to bring a child or a young friend to Ballet Theater to
instill a love of the arts. ``I grew up on the company,'' she said,
recalling that she had seen it as a child at a performance at the
White House in 1962 and that she had watched rehearsals with her
mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who was a company trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Once the curtain rose, it was clear that McKenzie, who has
previously presented gala programs of bits and pieces, had chosen
the right production for his new formula. As the most raucous comic
ballet to come out of Russia in the 19th century, ``Don Quixote''
is first and foremost a machine for dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The current production, staged in 1995 by McKenzie and Susan
Jones, is on the tame side, especially in its crowd scenes, but it
preserves the set pieces that have kept the work alive.
Choreographed originally by Marius Petipa in 1869 and revised by
Alexander Gorsky in 1900, 1902 and 1906, ``Don Quixote'' has
survived through sheer dance power.
</P>
<P>
   This was especially true when the Bolshoi Ballet came to town in
the 1960s. Plot was not that important, but stars like Yekaterina
Maksimova and Vladimir Vasilyev could make us care about Basil, an
impoverished Spanish barber, and Kitri, his sweetheart, as they
outwitted Kitri's father when he tried to marry her off to a rich
fop, Gamache. Minor characters in ``Don Quixote,'' Cervantes'
novel, Kitri and Basil came to the fore in the ballet. The Don, in
a walk-on role and in love with love, helps the young couple out.
Victor Barbee as the Don and Gil Boggs as Sancho Panza were,
incidentally, anything but negligible in these roles Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless it is bravura rather than characterization that
colors any ``Don Quixote'' today. Too many dramatic details have
either eroded or are played to broad effect to make for a stylish
whole. Act I, full of Spanish character dances, introduces the
lovers and Espada, the bullfighter, and Mercedes, the street
dancer, depicted with winning exuberance here by Maxim
Belotserkovsky and Irina Dvorovenko. Act II includes an
introductory scene in a gypsy camp but also a classical
divertissement in the Don's vision scene.
</P>
<P>
   In this special tripartite performance, McKenzie cast his
different couples appropriately. Corella's astounding virtuosity
could not get full play from the choreography in this act, but his
trademark multiple pirouettes gave a hint of the full-length
performance he will give this week. Ms. Herrera's energy level was
low at the start, but by the end of the act she executed a perfect
diagonal of pirouettes and the thrilling leap made famous by Maya
Plisetskaya of the Bolshoi (back leg bent up to the head).
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie rightly chose the company's three most classical
ballerinas for the vision scene. Ms. Jaffe's form in her solo was
exemplary in its purity, especially in her sudden and difficult
plunges into arabesque. Ashley Tuttle, as the cupid figure, married
pertness and precision, not least in her delicious scurries on toe.
As the Queen of the Dryads, the nymphs in this dream kingdom, Julie
Kent made a quick recovery after her ankle gave out in a releve
(rising on toe) and she did wonders with the solo sometimes seen as
part of ``Le Corsair.'' Carreno, earlier in the same act, was his
noble self.
</P>
<P>
   As for Act III, it all built up to the pas de deux that Ms.
Ananiashvili, vivacious as usual, and Bocca, toning down his usual
flash but dazzling nonetheless, performed with their usual
professionalism and virtuosity. Ermanno Florio conducted Jack
Everly's arrangement of the Minkus score.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Attention must be paid.'' Linda Loman's plea
resounds through ``Death of a Salesman,'' but in fact attention has
long been paid to America's salesmen. The problem for them is not
being ignored but being kidded or put down.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the attention comes from academics or journalists or a
playwright or two, the salesman is most commonly a figure of
mockery, particularly if he is a traveling man (did you hear the
one about Hickey's wife and the iceman?), or he may be a peddler of
all that is most tawdry about the free market. Or perhaps he's just
a desperate case, on the psychological edge, but never _ except
maybe at trade banquets, where worth is measured by the bottom line
_ is his calling held up as an exemplar of high aspirations or
edifying values.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the presence on Broadway stages of American drama's two most
powerfully drawn salesmen once again compels attention. Is Willy
Loman a victim of the system or of his own weak character? Is
Hickey mad or is he an all-American prophet?
</P>
<P>
   Critics down the years have agreed on one thing: the salesman's
goods, whether his valise holds hardware or underwear, turn out to
be cheap stuff, with sorry consequences for himself and the
synthetic faith he epitomizes.
</P>
<P>
   Even in good economic times, as Frederick Lewis Allen reminded
us in ``Only Yesterday,'' his amiable chronicle of the 1920s, when
salesmen, those ``angels and evangels'' of business, reveled in the
Coolidge prosperity, they were under relentless pressure to
perform. Their lot was always precarious. They were at once
exhorted and threatened by quotas and other humiliating management
spurs and whips. Never could they be their own men.
</P>
<P>
   Allen reported on a method of goading salesmen, ``which for
sheer inhumanity probably set a record'': A company ``gave a
banquet at which the man with the best score was served with
oysters, roast turkey and a most elaborate ice; the man with the
second best score had the same dinner but without the oysters; and
so on down to the man with the worst score, before whom was laid a
small plate of boiled beans and a couple of crackers.'' For anyone
who judged himself by the way others rated him, a definition of
salesmanship, it was an exquisite form of cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, when ``The Iceman Cometh'' and ``Death of a
Salesman'' were first produced, the salesman was a punching bag for
the intellectual set. When we meet Willy Loman, he is already
feeding emotionally on boiled beans and crackers. By the play's
end, his friend, Charley, is delivering the salesman's eulogy: ``He
don't put a bolt to a nut, he don't tell you the law or give you
medicine. . . . a couple of spots on your hat, and you're
finished.'' Willy has been beaten down by a system he thought he
had mastered. He and Hickey, the hardware drummer, are both
dreamers without usable skills, struggling with ultimately
destructive dreams.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that critics of capitalism or
consumerism should proclaim the salesman as exhibit No. 1 of what
the authors of ``The Lonely Crowd,'' published in 1950, described
as the ``other-directed'' character type. Erich Fromm had already
drawn a picture of the ``marketer'' and C. Wright Mills of the
``fixer,'' but it remained for David Riesman, Nathan Glazer and
Reuel Denney to put a catchy name to a growing class distinguished
and demeaned by ``an exceptional sensitivity to the actions and
wishes of others.'' These corporate servitors, in the authors'
view, were empty vessels for the opinions and attitudes of their
bosses and their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Riesman and company took care not to overstate their case. They
noted that with the increased importance of technical skills in
companies like IBM, glad-handing alone could not sell a line. Yet
the salesman remained the prototypical glad-hander, the most
visible exponent, along with advertisers, of consumerism. The word
``salesman'' is still shorthand for the other-directed person, the
fellow who doesn't know what he thinks until he figures out what
others expect him to think.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the appearance of ``The Lonely Crowd,''
psychologists had diagnosed the emotional cost of
``other-directedness,'' which deprives a Willy Loman of any footing
when things turn bad. He keeps grasping for a faith or a fantasy
that is bound to fail.
</P>
<P>
   But Hickey is a different, harder case, a man battling at a
profound level to awaken from the dreams that have kept him afloat.
Where Miller, with his whiff of Marxism, attacks the cruel grip of
society, O'Neill probes a soul in extremis. To try to place the
characters in ``The Iceman Cometh'' in sociological categories is
as reductive as applying Freudian or Marxist formulas to a
metaphysical predicament.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey remains a salesman to the end, only his product is no
longer hardware, but peace. His condition is out of the
sociologists' depth. When Willy's son Biff, says that Willy ``had
the wrong dreams, all all wrong,'' he implies that there is some
sort of right dream for Willy, maybe tending his garden or moving
out West.
</P>
<P>
   But what the discerning Larry, Hickey's pal, learns is that for
him and for all the other sodden losers in Harry Hope's saloon
there is no right dream, certainly not the revolutionary gabble of
a few of the old-timers. ``Be God,'' Larry concludes, ``I'm the
only real convert to death Hickey made here.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s are an oddly upbeat time for two such downbeat works,
shadowed by doom and death, to make it as Broadway hits. Today,
America is a nation of winners. Salesmen are doing smashingly well;
the ever-rising stock market is their answer to the naysayers. Yet
as their Broadway reception confirms, Willy and Hickey still reach
us with a despair that cannot be measured on the NASDAQ.

   Finding Drama in Basketball &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson have found groundbreaking
television drama inside a Baltimore homicide squad in NBC's
``Homicide,'' and a maximum-security prison in HBO's ``Oz''; but
when they went looking for a new arena for drama they took
``arena'' rather literally.
</P>
<P>
   As in basketball arena. Starting in July, ``Hoop Life,'' the new
drama series from the Levinson/Fontana Co., to be presented on
Showtime, will take a hard-edged, tough-talking, behind-the-court
look at the life of professional basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   The league mentioned in the show will not actually be called the
National Basketball Association. To avoid any legal entanglements,
the league will be called the UBA. But the connection is not likely
to be missed by viewers, especially with real NBA players like
Eddie Jones of Charlotte and Brevin Knight of Cleveland showing up
regularly for cameos.
</P>
<P>
   Fontana said he and Levinson developed the series from an
original script by Sean Jablonski. ``It started out as a two-hour
movie for Showtime,'' Fontana said, ``and it's grown into a order
for 22 episodes.'' The series is to begin on July 4 and is expected
to be on every Sunday night after that.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Cacaci, a longtime friend of Fontana, who is the show's
executive producer, said the show would ``get into the lives of the
players in a serious way, though there will also be a heavy dose of
dark comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   If that description sounds like HBO's breakthrough drama ``The
Sopranos,'' Showtime surely won't object. The other pay cable
channel is also looking to get into weekly drama, and it has the
same advantages HBO has: freedom with both language and sexual
situations as well as an approach to series television that allows
writers to pursue their own vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Showtime and HBO trust you,'' Fontana said. ``Their support
for your original idea never varies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Hoop Life,'' Cacaci said the series will not
flinch from examining what he called the ``over the top behavior''
of some basketball stars. The main characters include a married
player who is an uncontrolled womanizer, a young hotshot player who
loses himself in the big easy money he begins to make, a female
team owner, even, in the most ``Soprano''-like touch, a female
sports psychologist who is called on to do therapy with some of the
players.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Dan Lauria as the coach and Mykelti Williamson
as the star player. Fontana and Cacaci said casting was less a
problem than they expected, even though basketball skill was a
requirement. ``A lot of these guys can really play,'' Cacaci said. &UR;

<P>
   The `Meeting' Format &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Littleton, Colo., high school killings last week got far
more attention from the major television networks than previous
school killings, and more than twice as many minutes (144) on the
6:30 evening newscasts than coverage of the crisis in Yugoslavia
(63) that week.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy also prompted a new round of televised ``town
meetings,'' a format that has become almost a reflexive response in
coverage of troubling news stories. ABC's ``Nightline'' anchor Ted
Koppel conducted a town meeting on Thursday in Jonesboro, Ark., the
site of a middle-school shooting that left five dead last year, and
had parents there talking to parents in Littleton; Tom Brokaw and
Jane Pauley are to lead a town meeting in Westfield, N.J.,
Wednesday night on the MSNBC cable network (10 p.m.), and CNN's
Jeff Greenfield will lead one Thursday night in Champaign-Urbana,
Ill. (7:30 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what television can do, act as a large electronic
living room for the country,'' Brokaw said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   His town meeting will include panelists ranging from a prominent
psychiatrist to an expert on teen-agers' Internet use to Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and Vice President Al Gore
(via satellite). CNN's town meeting will eschew experts but will
feature interviews of high school students in 15 states by peers
who are journalists in CNN's Student Bureau. Both will have
participation by a ``just folks'' audience on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Do such large-group discussions really provide any new
information or insights on such complicated stories?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the value is that you can get smart, reasonable people
talking to each other,'' Brokaw said. ``The experts will learn from
the audience as much as audience will learn from the experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Koppel's town meeting on the subject did poorly in the Nielsen
ratings last week, but Brokaw said that should not deter networks
from doing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought since well before Littleton that there is too
little connective tissue in the country anymore,'' he said.
``Everyone's shouting at each other; there's too little attempt to
find common ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing I believe,'' he added, ``is that this subject,
Littleton and what happened there, is in the fabric of America
right now and it's what people are talking about. There are so few
answers, but maybe we can move it forward some, give people
something else to think about.'' &QL;

   Striving for Sensitivity &QL;

</P>
<P>
   NBC found itself in something of a predicament last week after
the school shootings in Colorado. The network's big mini-series for
the May sweep, a two-part movie called ``Atomic Train,'' revolved
around a threat that the city of Denver would be blown up by a
nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Several networks changed series episodes or news segments last
week because of concerns about offending viewers in the aftermath
of the Littleton catastrophe. But ``Atomic Train'' posed some
special problems.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb references were a worry for NBC because bombs were
involved in the school attack. But the main issue was the
connection to Denver. NBC was worried enough that several
executives viewed the film last week to see if it would be possible
to change all the references in the film from Denver to Salt Lake
City. They decided that it was impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The network finally concluded that enough time will have elapsed
by May 16, the movie's broadcast date, that no one will find the
references to bombs and Denver insensitive.

BIG DREAMS AND SHORT SHORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Let's administer a test. In the spring and summer,
major record companies roll out records by their latest pop
contenders, hoping that by Christmas they can turn a newcomer into
a superstar. Below are a few such up-and-coming acts executives say
they are banking on this year, investing from hundreds of thousands
to millions of dollars in promotional campaigns in hopes that
record buyers will take notice.
</P>
<P>
   Some are record-label priorities because of their success abroad
(Texas, Robbie Williams); others already have strong followings in
the United States that executives feel can be greatly expanded
(Insane Clown Posse, Limp Bizkit); a few are new to American pop
fans (Billie, Macy Gray), and a couple are already so famous that
it would be a shock if their albums weren't smashes (Ricky Martin,
Jennifer Lopez).
</P>
<P>
   So, let's see just how good the labels are at gauging the taste
of record buyers. Hold onto this list until Christmas, then examine
it again to see who has become a pop star and who can't get their
record companies to answer their phone calls. If the labels are
right, the pop scene will be even more dominated by Hispanic pop
singers, English media darlings, obnoxious white rappers and perky
teen-agers than it is already. If they're wrong, they'll have
scores more pop contenders waiting in the wings for next spring.
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL FREDO, ``Introducing'' (Warner Brothers, in stores late
summer) and C NOTE, ``Different Kind of Love'' (Epic, May 18): Here
are two new teenybopper pinups from Louis J. Pearlman, the former
blimp-company executive who brought you the Backstreet Boys,
Britney Spears and 'N Sync. Michael Fredo is a 19-year-old popster
who looks 12 and is the opening act for Ms. Spears; C Note is New
Kids on the Block version 3.1. This Hispanic boy quartet is all
cheesy come-ons and recycled pop hooks with Latin flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   INSANE CLOWN POSSE, ``The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' (Island, in
stores May 11): It's stupid, immature and strewn with profanity. In
other words, it has all the makings of a hit. Full of gleeful
misogyny and grisly murder scenarios, this new record by two masked
rappers from America's new white rap capital, Detroit (home to
Eminem and Kid Rock), is music to upset parents by.
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER LOPEZ, ``On the Six'' (Work, June 1): The transition
from film to pop is a difficult, but executives are betting that
the star of ``Out of Sight'' has the right ingredients: slick
production, smooth diva vocals, a mix of bedroom ballads and
dance-floor churners, Latin spice, a collaboration with Puff Daddy
and short shorts.
</P>
<P>
   BILLIE, ``Honey 2 the B'' (Virgin, May 18): Signed simply
because she ``looks like a star,'' 16-year-old Billie Piper is an
English Britney Spears with early Madonna dance moves and several
No. 1 hits in her home country. And she's naughty: she says
``damn'' in her single ``She Wants You.''
</P>
<P>
   JT MONEY, ``Pimpin' on Wax'' (Priority, May 25) and Ja Rule,
``Venni, Vetti, Vecci'' (Def Jam, May 4): Between the former Poison
Clan member JT Money's shout-along single ``Who Dat'' and Ja Rule's
too-catchy ``Holla Holla'' (plus his appearance on Jay-Z's hit
``Can I Get a . . .''), here are two rap debuts that couldn't be
better set up.
</P>
<P>
   ROBBIE WILLIAMS, ``The Ego Has Landed'' (Capitol, May 4): The
former singer in Take That is very witty and very successful
abroad; he performs very good pop and is being very intensively
promoted. But his singing, his style and his humor are also very,
very British. So add it all up, and you have a very big question
mark.
</P>
<P>
   MACY GRAY, ``On How Life Is'' (Epic, July 20): With a voice like
Rod Stewart on helium, Ms. Gray may seem like one of the most
unlikely aspirants being touted by the labels. But with a terrific
debut full of spirited, free-flowing funk and soul, she may find
success as well as a career ahead of her.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS, ``Hush'' (Universal, May 18): Unlike the other superstars
trying to cross the Atlantic, the Scottish group Texas has already
released four albums. On its fifth, the personable singer Sharleen
Spiteri finds common ground between classic American
rhythm-and-blues and gliding Europop.
</P>
<P>
   BUCKCHERRY, ``Buckcherry'' (Dreamworks, available now): Sure,
this album has been stuck at the bottom of the charts since its
release a few weeks ago, but executives are still hoping that these
tattoo-covered hard-rockers and their lyrics about fast cars, easy
girls, bountiful cocaine and the kind of self-destruction that
looks very good in the mirror will make bring back the glory days
of Los Angeles glam-metal.
</P>
<P>
   RICKY MARTIN, ``Ricky Martin'' (Columbia, May 11): It doesn't
take a genius to predict huge success for the first
English-language album from this former Menudo singer in light of
his spectacular Grammy performance, his chiseled looks and a hit,
``Livin' la Vida Loca,'' that makes everyone in the vicinity feel
as if they have a fire in their pants. Columbia is betting that he
will sell 300,000 to 400,000 copies of his album in the first week
and that he will also pave the way for dozens of other Latin pop
crossovers.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOFFATTS, ``Chapter 1: A New Beginning'' (Capitol, June 8):
At ages 15 and 16 _ and in the wake of Hanson _ this Canadian band
of triplets plus one older brother has decided on a career change,
switching their style from country music to classic pop-rock and
enlisting the help of Alanis Morissette collaborator Glen Ballard.
</P>
<P>
   LIMP BIZKIT, ``Significant Other'' (Interscope, June 22): Full
of hip-hop-inflected monster rock, a few songs toned down for radio
and atrocious rapping, this album is a giant step up for an already
successful band. Even music industry executives not affiliated with
Limp Bizkit say that it could outdo Korn.
</P>
<P>
   Other Hopefuls:
</P>
<P>
   Canadian pop diva Lara Fabian, salsa superstar Marc Anthony,
Colombian pop-rock ingenue Shakira, solo Spice Girl Geri Halliwell,
trip-pop songwriter Dido, Nine Inch Nails spinoff Filter, ``Mulan''
singer Christina Aguilera, persevering rap metalheads Shootyz
Groove, gospel-cum-country singer Susan Ashton, English popsters
Boyzone and rockers Muse and rap supergroups Ruff Ryders and 504.
</P>
<P>
   Grrrl Powers
</P>
<P>
   The all-female Lilith Fair announced the dates and performers
Tuesday for its final tour. Appearing on various dates will be the
tour's founder, Sarah McLachlan, as well as the Dixie Chicks,
Sheryl Crow, Indigo Girls, Monica, Cherokee, Shawn Colvin, Cibo
Matto, Pretenders, Beth Orton, Cree Summers, Kelly Willis, Me'shell
Ndegeocello and dozens more. The tour begins July 8 in Vancouver
and will reach the New York area via shows at Jones Beach in
Wantagh, N.Y., on Aug. 6 and at the PNC Bank Arts Center in
Holmdel, N.J., on Aug. 7 and 8.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A month has passed since the allied air forces of NATO members
began bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the intention of the Clinton administration and its
NATO allies to force the Serbian government to quickly end the
massacre of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the bombing so far has only
resulted in the exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have already suggested that the bombing will
continue well into the summer unless the Serbian government gives
in.
</P>
<P>
   Some people such as Henry A. Kissinger, who had criticized the
Rambouillet agreement as unsustainable, now unwillingly suggest
that NATO countries will have to introduce ground forces to settle
the Kosovo issue and maintain NATO credibility.
</P>
<P>
   He also warns that the disappearance of Serbia from the Balkan
equilibrium may risk a wider Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, there is a high likelihood that the war will drag
on much longer than anticipated until a sustainable political
solution is worked out and imposed.
</P>
<P>
   This prospect calls for an examination of the economic
implications of the Balkan crisis if a sustainable political and
military solution requires substantial economic resources from the
United States and its NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, wars and business cycles have been very closely
interrelated.
</P>
<P>
   The downward phases of business cycles have caused economic
dislocation of peoples and ruptures within society. In particular,
in the downward phase of a long business cycle, or the period known
as depression years, economic dislocation has been severe enough to
cause ruptures and ultimately wars between nations and states.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century depression years (1873-1895) coincided with the
rapid colonization of Asia and Africa by European powers to gain
``markets'' for their surplus products and secure a supply of raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and the United States as latecomers followed the European
powers to claim their shares of the pie in Asia around the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate consequence of the rivalry among the great powers
was World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th-century Great Depression of the 1930s led to exclusive
economic blocs by the British and the French, as well as Germany's
pursuit of the Lebensraum (political and economic expansion) and
Japan's Great Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate consequence was the unprecedented devastation of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. economy, far from the war front, could emerge
from the Great Depression because of wartime demand, its citizens
were obliged to shed their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Wars have turned economic depressions and deflation into booms
and inflation, or have solved economic depressions in a brutal way.
</P>
<P>
   The victor and the bystander (or the neutral) have gained
economically. And the defeated countries have often suffered
economic devastation and hyperinflation: Germany after the two
world wars and Japan after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, wars fought during the upward phase of
business cycles had quite different economic implications.
</P>
<P>
   A typical example is the Vietnam War. For the first half of the
1960s preceding the escalation of the war, the U.S. economy was
booming, with an unemployment rate of just around 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mobilization of more economic resources for the
escalating war in the second half of the 1960s, the Johnson
administration, which had campaigned for the ``Great Society,''
sought a policy of guns and butter at the same time. The shortage
of economic resources was filled by increasing imports in exchange
for paper dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of such a policy were the sharp deterioration
of the U.S. external balance of payments and the abandonment of the
gold standard by the Nixon administration in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying more paper dollars to finance the Vietnam War was the
root cause of the escalation of worldwide inflation in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike during the Persian Gulf War period (1990-1991) when the
U.S. economy was in recession, the U.S. economy for almost a decade
has been near full employment with record high stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   This record boom, however, has also resulted in a sharp
deterioration of U.S. external balance of payments, or a record
level of external deficits. In short, the boom has been financed by
huge borrowing from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the economic crisis in the rest of the world for the
past two years, especially in Asia, Latin America and Russia, has
helped prolong U.S. growth with subdued inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The depreciation of currencies in economically depressed regions
has worked to provide the U.S. economy with imports at much cheaper
prices than before.
</P>
<P>
   The unstable European political situation has already resulted
in a sharp weakness of the euro against the dollar. It will work
further to widen the external imbalance of the U.S. economy and the
exodus of capital from Europe to the United States to push up the
New York stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of much cheaper imports, however, will be detrimental
to the earnings of U.S. corporations in the home market. The rising
stock prices and subdued corporate earnings will be an incompatible
proposition before long.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Yugoslavia, if escalated into a muddy ground battle,
will be a very costly proposition for the U.S. economy already
working at full capacity, not to mention the cost to reconstruct
the afflicted region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, policymakers and investors worldwide need to keep a
close watch on the development in the Balkans. An escalation of the
war in the region could be the last straw for the U.S. economy,
which appears to have been overstretched for some time. &QL;

<P>
   A month has passed since the allied air forces of NATO members
began bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the intention of the Clinton administration and its
NATO allies to force the Serbian government to quickly end the
massacre of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the bombing so far has only
resulted in the exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have already suggested that the bombing will
continue well into the summer unless the Serbian government gives
in.
</P>
<P>
   Some people such as Henry A. Kissinger, who had criticized the
Rambouillet agreement as unsustainable, now unwillingly suggest
that NATO countries will have to introduce ground forces to settle
the Kosovo issue and maintain NATO credibility.
</P>
<P>
   He also warns that the disappearance of Serbia from the Balkan
equilibrium may risk a wider Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, there is a high likelihood that the war will drag
on much longer than anticipated until a sustainable political
solution is worked out and imposed.
</P>
<P>
   This prospect calls for an examination of the economic
implications of the Balkan crisis if a sustainable political and
military solution requires substantial economic resources from the
United States and its NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, wars and business cycles have been very closely
interrelated.
</P>
<P>
   The downward phases of business cycles have caused economic
dislocation of peoples and ruptures within society. In particular,
in the downward phase of a long business cycle, or the period known
as depression years, economic dislocation has been severe enough to
cause ruptures and ultimately wars between nations and states.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century depression years (1873-1895) coincided with the
rapid colonization of Asia and Africa by European powers to gain
``markets'' for their surplus products and secure a supply of raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and the United States as latecomers followed the European
powers to claim their shares of the pie in Asia around the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate consequence of the rivalry among the great powers
was World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th-century Great Depression of the 1930s led to exclusive
economic blocs by the British and the French, as well as Germany's
pursuit of the Lebensraum (political and economic expansion) and
Japan's Great Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate consequence was the unprecedented devastation of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. economy, far from the war front, could emerge
from the Great Depression because of wartime demand, its citizens
were obliged to shed their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Wars have turned economic depressions and deflation into booms
and inflation, or have solved economic depressions in a brutal way.
</P>
<P>
   The victor and the bystander (or the neutral) have gained
economically. And the defeated countries have often suffered
economic devastation and hyperinflation: Germany after the two
world wars and Japan after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, wars fought during the upward phase of
business cycles had quite different economic implications.
</P>
<P>
   A typical example is the Vietnam War. For the first half of the
1960s preceding the escalation of the war, the U.S. economy was
booming, with an unemployment rate of just around 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mobilization of more economic resources for the
escalating war in the second half of the 1960s, the Johnson
administration, which had campaigned for the ``Great Society,''
sought a policy of guns and butter at the same time. The shortage
of economic resources was filled by increasing imports in exchange
for paper dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of such a policy were the sharp deterioration
of the U.S. external balance of payments and the abandonment of the
gold standard by the Nixon administration in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying more paper dollars to finance the Vietnam War was the
root cause of the escalation of worldwide inflation in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike during the Persian Gulf War period (1990-1991) when the
U.S. economy was in recession, the U.S. economy for almost a decade
has been near full employment with record high stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   This record boom, however, has also resulted in a sharp
deterioration of U.S. external balance of payments, or a record
level of external deficits. In short, the boom has been financed by
huge borrowing from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the economic crisis in the rest of the world for the
past two years, especially in Asia, Latin America and Russia, has
helped prolong U.S. growth with subdued inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The depreciation of currencies in economically depressed regions
has worked to provide the U.S. economy with imports at much cheaper
prices than before.
</P>
<P>
   The unstable European political situation has already resulted
in a sharp weakness of the euro against the dollar. It will work
further to widen the external imbalance of the U.S. economy and the
exodus of capital from Europe to the United States to push up the
New York stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of much cheaper imports, however, will be detrimental
to the earnings of U.S. corporations in the home market. The rising
stock prices and subdued corporate earnings will be an incompatible
proposition before long.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Yugoslavia, if escalated into a muddy ground battle,
will be a very costly proposition for the U.S. economy already
working at full capacity, not to mention the cost to reconstruct
the afflicted region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, policymakers and investors worldwide need to keep a
close watch on the development in the Balkans. An escalation of the
war in the region could be the last straw for the U.S. economy,
which appears to have been overstretched for some time. &QL;

 &HT;    ARMY OFFICIALS SUSPECT UNSEEN POWER LINE IN APACHE CRASH
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-CLINTON-0428.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania _ U.S. Army officials speculated
Tuesday that an Apache attack helicopter that crashed suddenly
while on a training exercise Monday night may have first hit an
unseen power line.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Army accident investigators flew to the scene of the
crash to launch their probe., which some fear could delay the first
Apache strikes until all commanders up through President Bill
Clinton are satisfied about what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Also of concern is that the crash amounts to a public relations
fiasco that may breath new hope into Yugoslavia's Serb military
forces. The crash was the second mishap since the attack
helicopters, which was used heavily in the 1991 Gulf War to knock
out Iraqi tanks, began their journey to Albania last week. One of
the helicopters was forced down by engine trouble over Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army allowed several American news organizations to
record the secret dry-run mission and caught the $16 million
helicopter going up in an appalling fireball on video-tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have folks out on the ground looking at it,'' said Army Lt.
Col. Garrie Dornan, spokesman for the force of 23 remaining Apache
gunships. ``We'll take that (information) back and adjust
procedures, if that is required.''
</P>
<P>
   An Army statement said that ``there are no initial indications''
that the chopper was felled by hostile fire.'' Dornan assured
Albanian reporters that ``there is no danger that I know of'' to
villagers, some of whom may herd their sheep near the crash scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Army said the Apache crashed about 30 miles north of this
airfield, in a very sparsely populated, mountainous sector of
Albania. A preliminary theory offered by senior commanders here was
that the Apache had hit an unseen power line well-hidden by the
darkness and trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the cost of doing business,'' Dornan said. ``You fly
in very hazardous conditions. You are flying totally blacked out
with Night Vision Goggles on. You are flying at high speeds at low
altitudes in mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``And why do you do that? The reason is so you are prepared when
you are given a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apache pilot, an experienced warrant officer, had been
trying to land in the Albanian mountains late Monday using night
vision goggles. Amazingly, the pilot struggled out of the wreckage
and suffered only a fractured finger and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   The co-pilot and weapons officer, an Army captain, also pulled
himself to safety with only cuts and bruises. The captain later
went into shock as the cameras of ABC News' Nightline kept rolling.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache, loaded with fuel, rockets and Hellfire missiles, was
totally destroyed. So, for the moment, was the Apache's vaunted
reputation as the invincible anti-tank weapon that many Kosovar
refugees have been waiting for to turn the tide of war against
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Both pilots were expected to be released Tuesday from a military
hospital unit on this air field, the Army said. Meanwhile, the Army
took steps to fly another of the Apaches to Albania to replace the
crashed chopper.

   When I attended an international conference at a Sydney hotel, I
noticed a big blackboard in the lobby that listed the flights
between Tokyo's Kansai International Airport and Sydney. The list
was in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese receptionist who was sitting in front of the
blackboard told me that the sign was for three Japanese couples
from the Kansai area who were holding wedding ceremonies in Sydney.
It was also there to help Japanese guests in the wedding parties.
</P>
<P>
   The receptionist said the brides and grooms were accompanied by
their parents, relatives and close friends in the package tour from
Japan. The flight to Australia takes nearly 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the couples are having weddings in Australia. Isn't that a
bit extravagant?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that some foreigners who see such people question
whether Japan is really undergoing a recession,'' she said. ``But
it costs less to have weddings here than in Japan because you have
far fewer guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, it's much less troublesome to have overseas
weddings,'' she said. Dropping the sound of her voice, she offered
the following explanation:
</P>
<P>
   In Japanese weddings, newlyweds usually are obliged to invite
their superiors at work even when they are uncertain about whether
it would cause their bosses problems. When they invite their
colleagues, they rack their brains over who to invite.
</P>
<P>
   But if they hold weddings abroad, they don't have to worry about
such matters. All they have to do is ask to be pardoned since
they're getting married in a faraway place.
</P>
<P>
   Getting away from worldly trouble. That makes sense, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   The woman lowered her voice again and said: ``Before, lifetime
employment was nothing special. But now, you never know when you'll
lose your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, indeed. I found her logic convincing.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation intrigued me and led me to call the tourism
bureau of the Australian government to find out more.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official in charge, Australia is now the second
largest market for overseas weddings next to Hawaii. Since it is a
promising area, the tourism office is putting a great deal of
effort into luring foreign couples, the official said. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The official also suggested that the recent surge in overseas
weddings may have to do with the Japanese trend of holding simple
wedding ceremonies. Overseas weddings seem to be an economical
alternative to elaborate domestic weddings, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the official said that Australia has seen a sharp
drop in the number of churchgoers in recent years and many churches
now stand virtually idle. That is why they welcome large numbers of
Japanese couples for church weddings, the official said.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While explaining the situation, the official repeatedly
mentioned the name Watabe, which prompted me to call Takao Watabe,
president of Watabe Wedding Corp., a Kyoto-based wedding service.
</P>
<P>
   The company triggered the trend for overseas weddings when it
started organizing them on a commercial basis 26 years ago.
Currently, it boasts a 60-percent share of the world market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overseas weddings are not a phenomenon unique to Japan,''
Watabe said. ``It is a global trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 20,000 German couples tie the knot in Las Vegas
every year,'' he claims. ``The Swiss go to Jamaica and the British
go to Disney World in Florida to get married. The trend is
spreading. The reason is the same anywhere in the world: Couples
don't want to be fettered by obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Britain, more than 10 percent of all newlyweds are holding
overseas ceremonies,'' Watabe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, the national average is 6 percent. In Tokyo, Osaka
and other urban areas, the percentage tops 10. I expect the
percentage to eventually hit 30 in Japan as well as in the United
States and Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Watabe's latest venture is overseas wedding tours targeted at
Chinese couples that he started organizing last spring. According
to Watabe, Bangkok is a favorite destination among Chinese brides
and grooms from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``China lifted the embargo on overseas travel for the general
public,'' he said. ``Since the population is so large, I wish to
attract as many couples as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, there will be fewer weddings starting in 2002 to
2003 because of a decline in the younger population. That's why
global business development is needed,'' he said. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, very few foreigners come to Japan to hold weddings.
</P>
<P>
   ``With such high prices, Japanese weddings are unaffordable,''
Watabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the price of Japanese weddings went down nearly 40
percent from the peak of the asset-inflated economy, it is still
double the average of U.S. weddings, according to Watabe. &QL;

<P>
   Globalization gives people a much wider selection to choose from
in any given area. The process of making a choice also allows
people to make decisions about economic obstacles in the form of
market barriers and also social restrictions such as local custom. &QL;

<P>
   Overseas weddings promoted price destruction of domestic
weddings and changed stereotyped wedding receptions. They are also
about to change the wedding culture itself.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered the following words of the receptionist at the
hotel lobby: ``The relatives accompanying the newlyweds say that
the trip gives people who hardly exchanged words before a chance to
get to know each other better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some couples seem happy that they were able to play golf
together day after day after a long time. They seem to be enjoying
themselves.'' &QL;

attract as many couples as possible.

HOW RITUALS CAN CREATE A RELUCTANT ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ From an early age, Sophie Calle organized her life
around rituals. She gave her goldfish and pet birds elaborate
funerals, with music and tiny coffins. She demanded to be awakened
with a glass of orange juice when her mother returned home from a
party, no matter the hour. In the week before her grandfather's
birthday she would mail him countdown letters daily.
</P>
<P>
   Later, sometimes much later, these rituals became stylized
performances and turned her into one of France's best-known
Conceptual artists. But even now, Ms. Calle, who is 45, invents her
games primarily for herself. Variously intrusive, humorous,
nostalgic, provocative, exhibitionistic, even erotic, they give
both drama and structure to her life. They may translate into works
of art, but this, she says, is a secondary function.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work is linked to improving my life,'' she said over coffee
in her sunlit studio in a converted factory on the outskirts of
Paris. ``I organize rituals to satisfy a specific need, to deal
with fear of being alone, to get married, whatever. I have
organized many that I never expected to exploit. Sometimes I used
the material years later. Some I have never gone back to.''
</P>
<P>
   She is evidently not one for throwing things away. From 1980 to
1993, her ritual was to invite a number of guests equal to her age
to her birthday party. (Her need was to have company on her
birthday.) She then put all the presents into storage. Finally, at
the Tate Gallery in London in 1998, she displayed them by year in
glass-faced cabinets in an installation called ``The Birthday
Ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Calle's studio, where she also lives, is itself something of
an installation. She is watched over by a lively black-and-white
cat and a veritable zoo of stuffed animals _ a fox, a couple of
eagles, several owls and two bulls' heads _ as well as by photos,
drawings, embroideries and statues of the Virgin Mary collected on
her travels. Her work area is neat: A current project about pain is
spread over three tables, but past material for future projects is
carefully stored in drawers and boxes.
</P>
<P>
   On one wall of her studio, there is a photograph of a blind man.
In the 1980s, setting out to ask people blind from birth for their
definition of beauty, she worried about being insensitive. But the
first person she queried, she said, freed her to create the texts
and photographs of ``The Blind.'' ``The most beautiful thing I have
ever seen,'' the man in the photograph answered, ``is the sea going
so far that you lose sight of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Conceptual and autobiographical, Ms. Calle's work is
anything but abstract. Often she simply seeks out a different way
of viewing ordinary behavior. In 1979 she was briefly a stripper in
a Pigalle nightclub, watching those who were watching her. A
photographer captured her routine as she cast off everything but
her black shoes, a fox fur collar and a blond wig. (Again, ``Le
Striptease'' was exhibited only years later.) On another occasion,
she invited 28 people to sleep for one night in her bed. She
photographed them (and was herself photographed asleep), and it
became ``The Sleepers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always curious,'' said the artist, dark-haired and
primly dressed, as she sat beneath a large rubber tree in her
studio. ``And I found a way of being able to ask questions from
behind the shield of art. I could watch people sleep when even
their wives didn't, because it was art. Now it is a way of life. I
no longer ask myself what I am doing. But I'm not obsessed with
whether it really is art and what will remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, interest in her work is growing. Over the winter
she had large exhibitions at the Centre National de la Photographie
in Paris and the Camden Arts Center in London. At a current show at
the Museum of Modern Art in New York, ``The Museum as Muse,'' she
has an installation recalling the famous art theft at the Isabella
Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990. At the Jewish Museum in
New York starting on June 20, she has an installation called ``The
Eruv,'' with photographs of private spaces in Jerusalem that permit
activity outside the home on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it was never Ms. Calle's ambition to become an artist.
In fact, she recalled, as a rebellious teen-ager, she was alienated
from art because her physician father was a collector. After high
school she fled France, spending seven years traveling and living
abroad. Eventually, while staying with a photographer in California
in 1978, she visited a nearby cemetery and took pictures of
tombstones inscribed with single words, ``father,'' ``mother,''
``brother,'' ``sister.'' ``I liked them and thought, `Why not
photography?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to Paris and, at 25, discovered that photography
added an interesting dimension to her games. By chance, after ``The
Sleepers,'' her first photo ritual, one participant showed the work
to her husband, who was organizing a show of young artists in
Paris. He liked the results and invited her to be part of the
exhibition at the city's Modern Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember asking myself whether I wanted the photos to be
regarded as art,'' she said. ``Do I want to be an artist? I had not
asked myself that before. And if I remember rightly, I'm not sure I
wanted to take that step. I'd never been that interested in the
world of art. I always thought I could do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue came up again in an unexpected way. Out of loneliness,
she took to following strangers around Paris. One evening in early
1980 she met a man who was leaving for Venice by train and, without
his knowledge, she followed him there, photographing him and
jotting down his movements. When she thought to include this ritual
in her first book, however, shelearned that the New York artist
Vito Acconci had done it over a decade before she did.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, I was confronted with the idea that there
were others,'' she said. ``How could I show something that had
already been shown? I went to see Vito Acconci to ask his
permission. Of course, he said. What I had done was different. For
him, what counted was the gesture of following. I had all my
feelings. My way was more sentimental, his more Conceptual. So he
sort of blessed me.''
</P>
<P>
   For a second time, then, someone else had decided that she was
an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Feelings were even more central to one of her strangest
projects, a 1994 film called ``No Sex Last Night,'' in which she
and a boyfriend drove across the United States with camcorders,
stopping in Las Vegas to get married. Ms. Calle said her only goal
was to hold onto a man she feared she was losing, while the man,
Greg Shephard, an aspiring filmmaker, saw a chance to make a movie.
In the end, Ms. Calle lost Greg, but together they made a
well-received art-house movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Game,'' her latest large work, seen in Paris and
London, included her most complicated set of rituals. In 1990 the
director Michael Radford (``Il Postino'') was planning a feature
film inspired by Ms. Calle's bizarre life, and he invited Paul
Auster to write the screenplay. The film plan did not prosper, but
Auster based a character in his 1992 novel, ``Leviathan,'' on Ms.
Calle and her rituals, adding a few more from his own imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Amused by the notion of obedience, Ms. Calle decided to live out
the rules invented for Auster's character, Maria, like eating food
of a single color on different days of the week and living out a
letter of the alphabet for an entire day. For B, for example, she
was photographed in bed as a ``big-time blond bimbo'' surrounded by
her stuffed animals; for C she spent the day at Montparnasse
Cemetery beside her future tomb, which she decorated with the words
ciao, ciao.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Calle also asked Auster to swap roles: Instead of his
appropriating her life, he would invent ``a fictive character whom
I would attempt to resemble.'' Auster balked at the responsibility,
but instead sent her ``Personal Instructions for S.C. on How to
Improve Life in New York City (Because She Asked).'' ``Smile when
the situation doesn't call for it,'' began the five pages of
instructions, which also included talking to strangers, giving
sandwiches to beggars and homeless people and ``cultivating a
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Through photographs and texts, ``Double Game'' brings together
the rituals that Auster borrowed from Ms. Calle's life and those he
invented for her. For her Manhattan ``spot,'' she chose a phone
booth on the corner of Greenwich and Harrison Streets, which she
cleaned and improved with flowers, a chair, a notebook and pencils,
an ashtray, a magazine and a sign saying, ``Have a Nice Day.'' In
the main, she said, New Yorkers liked it. ``It's a good
humanitarian gesture,'' one man said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she does wonder at times whether she is too intrusive, as
when she found a man's address book in a street, called his friends
and asked them to describe him, then published the results _
without his name _ in the Paris daily Liberation. (His revenge was
to send a nude photograph of Ms. Calle to the paper, and it was
published as a right of reply.) Similarly, voyeurism is clearly the
appeal of ``The Hotel,'' a series of photographs of empty but
rented rooms in a Venice hotel where she was a chambermaid in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact that she reveals herself encourages others to do
likewise. When she sat at a desk on the final day of her recent
shows in Paris and London to hear suggestions for her next project,
she was struck by how visitors wanted to share their secrets with
her. Ms. Calle waved toward two foot-high stacks of letters she
received during these shows. In Paris one young woman gave her a
book and hurriedly wrote a dedication: ``Sophie, this is the most
precious thing I have on me, my diary. You can read it, I'm giving
it to you. I never imagined I would dare come up to you. That is
always the problem with artists: We live with them but they do not
know us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Freud Museum in London through Sunday, Ms. Calle has an
``intervention'' called ``Appointment,'' comprising texts and
unlikely objects (like her stripper's wig) placed on the desk,
couch and bookshelves that surrounded Freud during his final years
in London. Since many texts are funny and self-deprecating, she
worried that some visitors might consider them irreverent, but the
show has proved immensely popular.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are invited to comment and one notebook has already
been filled. ``I'm touched when I read what people write,'' Ms.
Calle said. ``One likes to be loved.'' She opened the notebook to
its last page. In pencil, an anonymous visitor had written: ``Thank
you very much _ I think my life may change because of you.''

PALESTINIANS PAY LITTLE HEED TO PLO DEBATE ON WHEN TO DECLARE
STATEHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip, _ Several miles from the seaside compound
where Palestinian leaders locked themselves away Tuesday to
deliberate the timing of a declaration of statehood, Motee and Ali
Anan sat shrugging amid porcelain toilets in their luxury-bathroom
store on the main boulevard in town.
</P>
<P>
   The Anans, uncle and nephew, are not hanging on the outcome of
the meeting of the 120-member Central Council of the Palestine
Liberation Organization. They are barely curious; few people here
seem to care. It seems clear to them that under international
pressure, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has already decided to
delay the declaration he once promised for May 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is only a show,'' Ali Anan said, gazing at a $1,000
toilet, sink and bidet set. ``It is theater, and we don't have to
wait for the curtain to come down to know how it will end.''
</P>
<P>
   If the meeting was theater, it seemed to be a rehearsal of a
democratic process, with the Palestinian leaders reportedly
engaging in fiery debate. But despite guest appearances by such
opponents as Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the Islamic fundamentalist, Arafat
seemed to be guiding the council members toward a scripted
conclusion: A statehood declaration must be postponed, and
negotiations with the Israelis must continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going through a very delicate period in the history of
our people, a period during which we cannot afford to make any
mistakes,'' the official Palestinian news agency WAFA quoted Arafat
as saying. ``We don't need to affirm our state because we are
actually exercising statehood.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the Oslo peace accord, May 4 is the day when
the Palestinians' transitional government is to expire and a target
date for the conclusion of final peace talks between Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But because the peace effort is frozen, and the final-status
negotiations have barely begun, Arafat had said he would make a
unilateral declaration of statehood on that day. In the Palestinian
areas of the West Bank and Gaza, May 4 became a rallying cry: It
would be the day when the Palestinians would break free of Israel
and of the American peace brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, it seems unlikely that anyone will be dancing the
debka, the Palestinian dance of celebration, next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The council meeting may take many days, even weeks of what Nabil
Amr, the Palestinian minister of parliamentary affairs, said would
be ``hot, long, serial sessions.'' It may drag past the Israeli
elections on May 17 _ so that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
could not take credit for a decision to postpone the declaration,
some Palestinian leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   The time will be used by Arafat to soothe internal dissent,
which _ partly because of incompetence and corruption and abuses by
his security forces _ has grown during the five years of
Palestinian self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   Even for the pragmatic among the Palestinian leaders, a deferral
of statehood would be a particularly piquant disappointment, and
Arafat must work hard to persuade them that their interim autonomy
will not become a long-term limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat must confront the frustration of Palestinian legislators
like Marwan Barghouti, a leader of his Fatah Party, who are fed up
with peace talks. ``The Palestinians will not get their state from
the negotiating table but should take the decision to declare one,
even if the declaration provokes a clash with the other side,'' he
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Netanyahu government has said it would respond harshly to a
unilateral declaration, possibly by suspending the Oslo accords or,
more drastically, by annexing parts of the West Bank. But like
Barghouti, many Palestinians are prepared to play chicken with the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel tried to use violence against us in the past, and it
did not work,'' said Jamal Shati al-Hindi, a Palestinian legislator
from Jenin, on the West Bank. ``The world should understand that
Israel did not fulfill its commitments and stop pressuring us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a total breakdown of the peace effort and an outbreak of
violence, American, European and Arab leaders have pressed Arafat
to defer his declaration and to negotiate statehood with the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   To garner international support, Arafat has been traveling the
world at a breakneck pace. In the last month, he has visited the
leaders of 25 countries, including outposts like Burkina Faso and
Kazahkstan.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian journalists joke that the biggest news Tuesday was
that Arafat was actually home. But his travels have borne fruit.
The European Union declared last month that the Palestinians have
``an unqualified right to self-determination, including the option
of a state'' and that Israel does not have a ``veto'' over that
right.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton, in a letter Arafat brought to the meeting
Tuesday, said he supported ``the aspirations of the Palestinian
people to determine their own future on their own land,'' his
strongest endorsement yet. He also promised to help start
final-status negotiations immediately after the election in Israel,
and to encourage their completion within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said the letter had been shared with Israel
beforehand. ``I can tell you that they talked to us ahead of time,
and we agreed that this is a reasonable target,'' he said on Israel
Radio, referring to the one-year time frame.
</P>
<P>
   Many Palestinians say bitterly that their fate seems to lie in
the hands of the Israelis and the Americans, not in Arafat's. Some
see his intention to defer statehood as capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our destiny will be imposed on us,'' said Motee Anan, 68, the
owner of the bathroom store.
</P>
<P>
   But while a recent poll by the Center for Palestinian Research
in Nablus found that 43 percent of those Palestinians surveyed
favored a unilateral declaration now, 48 percent preferred a
deferral.
</P>
<P>
   One who prefers deferring a declaration is Kanan Abu Shaban, who
was scooping sticky yellow and pink sherbet into plastic cups in
his ice-cream parlor here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the leadership will take into consideration that a
declaration would lead to no changes except negative ones,'' he
said. ``The Israelis would instantly impose on us the most simple
and effective punishment: barring Palestinian workers from
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Down Omar el-Mukhtar Street, the main thoroughfare of Gaza, the
Anans agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis can close our borders and we suffer a lot,''
Motee Anan said. ``Our bread, our sugar, our cigarettes, our petrol
comes from them. We have to be realistic and not ask for the
moon.''
</P>
<P>
   His nephew added: ``We have waited to be independent since
1948,'' the year Israel was founded. ``You think we cannot wait
another six months?''

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Audie Bock has just cast the deciding vote
on one of the most important bills in the Legislature, giving
terminally ill patients the right to die. She switched her vote _
from no to yes _ in a single, understated movement and made it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, journalists are following the Green Party
assemblywoman down a Capitol hallway and into the back stairwell.
</P>
<P>
   She keeps smiling, her head down a bit. Tentative, restrained is
how some lawmakers describe her.
</P>
<P>
   No questions right now, though. The new lawmaker for Oakland,
Alameda and Piedmont _ on the east side of the San Francisco Bay _
needs a respite.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we're going to get a cup of tea,'' says Michael
Twombly, her chief of staff, Green Party organizer and former
lobbyist, her only permanent full-time employee so far. ``No. After
a cup of tea.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if she didn't think about the vote, Bock says later.
She went to sleep dreaming of a Japanese film about unwanted
grandmothers left to die on mountaintops, picked dead by crows.
</P>
<P>
   She had to go against Ralph Nader, the eminence grise of the
left-leaning Green Party, and all those angry people in wheelchairs
inside the committee room afraid the bill would lead to
state-sponsored euthanasia of the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   She began to believe the bill had enough protections, and she
thought of her grandmother, who once asked to die. So she switched
her vote, saying later she had no idea it would change the course
of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   A curiosity to the 119 other lawmakers in Sacramento, Bock
describes her first three weeks in the Assembly as ``parachuting
in.''
</P>
<P>
   No time for tea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of thing where people greet you nicely, and you
eat a sponge cake,'' said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San
Francisco, who also came to Sacramento after a special election, in
the middle of chaos. ``And a minute later you're a stranger left to
negotiate the hallways.''
</P>
<P>
   Bock arrived in the Assembly on April 5, after defeating Elihu
Harris in a special election. Harris, who was expected to win, is a
Democrat who was the former mayor of Oakland and a former
Assemblyman.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the nation's first state official from the Green Party is
quickly trying to set up her district office _ in the gleaming new
Elihu Harris State Building in downtown Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, Bock has a fifth-floor view of towering redwoods
outside the Capitol. It's one of the smallest offices in the
building: three tiny rooms and a reception area decorated only with
a weathered ``Bock for Assembly'' sign and a yarn sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Bock landed in town after the deadline to introduce bills and
three weeks before the deadline for those bills to pass committee.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of her time has been spent absorbing and actually showing
up at her committee meetings, unlike other members, sitting
dutifully at her desk in the far north of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things Bock learned is that there are fellow
travelers in the Legislature, which is dominated by Democratic and
Republican lawmakers, of course, but has a working staff of 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   `There are Greens working in the building,'' Bock said almost
conspiratorially, ``and they're not working in my office.'' She
laughed. ``They come over and whisper, `I'm a Green.' We've got a
lot of closet Greens here.''
</P>
<P>
   A movie distributor and former translator for the late film
director Akira Kurosawa, Bock was forced to abruptly cancel two
college teaching jobs and inform Harvard University that once again
she would not be taking up her doctoral thesis on another Japanese
filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   A single parent, Bock, 53, struggled at first with the daily
commute to Sacramento. She asked her mother to help watch her
14-year-old daughter. ``I don't think either of us have adjusted
yet,'' Bock said. ``We're still scrambling.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bock has abandoned, out of temporary necessity, her
environmental altruism when it comes to commuting.
</P>
<P>
   For the first week, Bock got up at 4:30 a.m. for the train to
Sacramento. But since the last train leaves for home at 5:30 p.m.,
far too early, she requested an electric or natural-gas-powered
car.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are still scrambling to find her a car that will
make the 90-minute trip. They even drove her route home but ran out
of energy in the middle of the test run. Bock gets $400 a month to
lease any American car she wants, but she's been using a
gasoline-powered car from the Capitol pool.
</P>
<P>
   Greens worry about these things; Bock nearly apologized for
owning a 14-year-old Nissan parked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Audie is kind of stunned, as all the rest of us were
the first couple of weeks that we were here,'' said Assemblywoman
Sheila Kuehl, D-Santa Monica, adding: ``She may not have
particularly expected that she would have to work in Sacramento or
be in Sacramento every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the right-to-die vote, Bock is back to virtual
anonymity amid the most chaotic day of the year. She sits patiently
in an oppressively stuffy room waiting to present her first bill
before an obscure Assembly committee.
</P>
<P>
   The labor-supported bill was given to her by a Democratic
lawmaker who had been holding it for Harris, the man bock beat.
</P>
<P>
   Bock gladly accepted AB1653, which sets up a resource center on
workplace safety for children and teen-agers. Groups opposed: None.

 &HT;    Secret to Hawks playoff success might be Blalock
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mookie Blaylock is pretty bright. He knows what he
must do to keep the Hawks winning. He knows , but there are too
many times when he plays in denial and his team goes belly up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the key,'' coach Lenny Wilkens says, ``but sometimes we
have to help him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaylock leads the Hawks in shots attempted and in assists made,
but often he has too many of the former and not enough of the
latter.
</P>
<P>
   He leads the team in defense, as well _ although for the first
time in four years he will not lead the NBA in steals, as he ranks
12th with a week to go.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Blaylock's role in the offense that determines the
success or failure of the team because it's his ball. Over the last
five games, he has been at his best _ shooting 48 percent and
averaging 18.8 points and 6.8 assists _ and the Hawks have won them
all. But Blaylock is only shooting 38 percent for the season,
dragged down by 29.8 percent on three-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Intellectually, Blaylock knows that when he stands still and
launches those momentum-killing 23-footers, he is shooting his team
in the foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I bring energy to the game, when I'm moving, catching the
ball in rhythm, it's all the difference in the world,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then why fire away?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, when my legs are heavy, I don't bring that energy
to the court. My body won't respond. Then, we all stand around, and
it don't work so good.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he doesn't want to take all those shots. ``It's a
natural thing when nobody's moving to throw the ball back to the
point guard. The clock's going down. I've got the rock. I've got to
shoot it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawks general manager Pete Babcock admires Blaylock for his hard
play and his energy. ``He really gives us a lift when he's on his
game,'' Babcock says. Yet. ``Sometimes you'd like Mookie to be a
little more patient.''
</P>
<P>
   With New York coming to town tonight, the Hawks are about to
clinch home-court advantage for at least one playoff round and at
28-17 can win the Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   But the closer the Hawks get to the top, the more tainted they
are by outrageous lapses at home early this season. And Blaylock's
fingerprints are on those lapses _ losses to Chicago (he shot
3-for-13, with only 3 assists), Washington (2-for-8, 4 assists) and
Toronto (1-for-6, 3 assists).
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to such games, Wilkens cites the need for a point guard
at his active best.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to get off to a great start this season,'' Wilkens
says, ``but his shooting wasn't there. You can attribute that to us
being off for so long, but I also thought he was anxious and trying
to make it happen too quick. And he really got out of rhythm. I
spoke to him about slowing down, catching, getting set. When he's
in rhythm, he's really good, you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Mookie's playing right now, he could take us a long
way. Could we win a championship with Mookie the way he's playing
now? I'd say, yes, I believe we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens, a Hall of Fame point guard, says Blaylock's excesses do
not stem from willfullness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mookie's not a natural point. I've coached other guys like
him. They're scorers in college, and when they come into the NBA
they have to make the adjustment. Mookie's done a pretty good job
of that, but, yeah, there are times when he relies too much on his
jump shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The lockout and abbreviated training camp made Blaylock's task
more difficult, Wilkens says, because there was little time to get
acquainted with such new or unfamiliar players as LaPhonso Ellis,
Chris Crawford, Anthony Johnson and Roshown McLeod.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to learn what they like to do and what they can do
best, and he's got to mesh that with his game,'' Wilkens says. ``At
the same time, he's always got to make sure Dikembe (Mutombo) is
involved. I played point guard in this league for a lot of years.
Believe me, it isn't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the statistics don't show a definitive line, Wilkens
says Blaylock started to find his groove in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to me because he was worried, and I said, 'Look, you
have to take care of your teammates, but you also have to take care
of yourself. From here on out, why don't you just play
basketball?''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens also has taken to calling plays for Blaylock down the
stretch of close games. ``He seems to want it and I think it makes
his job easier,'' the coach says.
</P>
<P>
   Blaylock confirms as much. ``I like knowing what coach wants.
That way, we're all on the same page, and I can just go out there
and execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens nods. ``I told him to let me do the worrying. A guy with
his ability, it surprises you that sometimes he gets a little down
on himself. So I just try to be positive, (saying), 'Come on you
can do it; we know you can do it. We're not going anywhere without
you, so come on.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know what? It's true and he is doing it.''

 &HT;    Software companies seek to stop piracy
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Microsoft and the rest of the software industry are
trying harder to get you to stop stealing what they make.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 27 percent of the software used by businesses in the
United States was illegally obtained, according to Microsoft.
Microsoft estimates that most of the pirated software, 65 percent,
is used by small- and medium-sized businesses, so that's the group
they're going after. Home users only account for about 15 percent,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the enforcement activities of the industry lobbying
group, the Business Software Alliance, collected $10 million in
fines from companies using software for which it did not have
licenses. The settlements are up from $6 million in 1996. Earlier
this month, a Massachusetts company, Intertek Testing Services,
agreed to pay $78,500 to the BSA for having unlicensed software,
including copies of Adobe, Lotus, Microsoft and Symantec.
</P>
<P>
   The money is put back into the BSA to pay for more enforcement
efforts. As the industry has cracked down on pirated software, the
enforcement staff has shot up. The BSA's staff of 35 has almost
tripled since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials, in Atlanta last week as part of last week's
Microsoft Explorer 99 exhibition, are starting an anti-piracy ad
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The lost sales cut into Microsoft's bottom line, it claims. The
company last week said it made $1.92 billion in the last three
months on sales of $4.33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft says the use of illegal software hurts everybody.
Flawed counterfeit software can corrupt the information entrusted
to it.
</P>
<P>
   The company has taken things a step further, placing the impact
of software piracy in your pocket. According to Microsoft, the use
of illegal software cost Georgia, for example, $157 million in
salaries and close to $23 million in tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The figures come from a study by the Redmond, Washington, branch
of International Planning &AMP; Research, a consulting firm for the
high-tech industry. IPR arrived at its tax estimates by multiplying
the typical number of software programs on a PC by the estimated
number of PCs shipped in Georgia in 1997, according to IPR's David
Fay, who worked on the study.
</P>
<P>
   IPR took that figure and subtracted the estimated number of
software applications software companies shipped in 1997. The
difference between the two figures was considered to be the number
of software programs illegally acquired. IPR took that number,
multiplied it by a typical retail price for software and used that
to determine the estimated losses in sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   But the estimated tax loss assumes the money not spent buying
software the legal way was not spent at all, Fay said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a valid assumption, said Donald Ratajczak, director
of Georgia State's economic forecasting center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is trying to say this is a big problem, and that's
valid,'' he said. ``But any numbers for individual states are total
estimates and it doesn't really wash one way or the other. Is there
anyone in their right mind who thinks the companies would be doing
less on software because of the pirating?''
</P>
<P>
   Ratajczak said there are legitimate moral issues involved with
the idea of using pirated software. But the economic impact is
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One wonders why Microsoft is worried about this. I continue to
wonder at who is making the corporate decisions at Microsoft: what
to put on email, how to approach the public. One wonders,'' he
said. ``They know how to market software, they sure don't know how
to market themselves.''

 &HT;      GRAHAM LEADING THE OPPOSITION TO GROUND TROOPS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, April 27 -- South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham
is leading the charge in Congress against deploying American ground
troops to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Graham is circulating a letter to House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., stating his position. He hopes to deliver the
letter by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly support President Clinton's policy against the use
of ground troops,'' the letter reads. ``Introducing American ground
troops in the middle of a bitter civil war is politically
unfeasible and militarily unwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, and some Democrats, are urging the Pentagon to
deploy ground forces to Yugoslavia as a way to increase pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and move the conflict toward
its end.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Graham's letter had signatures from
35 congressmen, including House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas,
and House Republican Conference Chairman J.C. Watts, R-Okla. DeLay
and Watts are the third- and fourth-ranking Republicans in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Republicans Charlie Norwood and Bob Barr, and South
Carolina Republicans Floyd Spence, Mark Sanford and Jim DeMint have
all signed.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Graham said Democrats have asked to join the letter, but he
wants it to be a vehicle for Republicans to let their leader,
Speaker Hastert, know where they stand.
</P>
<P>
   The letter claims a ground invasion would have three serious
pitfalls:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The possibility that coalition partners -- in particular
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Greece, Macedonia and Germany -- would balk at escalation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The danger of casualties from facing a Yugoslav Army that
</P>
<P>
   &UR; would have near parity with NATO forces on the ground, as
</P>
<P>
   &UR; opposed to the NATO air campaign's vast superiority.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The threat of reigniting a Cold War relationship between the
</P>
<P>
   &UR; United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mr. Graham warns the American military, ``which is
already stretched thin,'' would be overextended.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the introduction of American ground troops as part of an
invasion force in Yugoslavia, our capabilities will be put into
further question,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Graham began his campaign after returning from a
congressional delegation trip to the Balkan region. Members met
with U.S. and NATO commanders, American servicemen and Kosovar
Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing I heard or saw in the Balkans convinced me that the
way to ease the suffering of the Kosovar Albanians is by placing
American troops on the ground,'' Mr. Graham said. ``Right now we
don't have a clear objective, strategy, or means for exiting the
conflict.''

INDONESIAN INDUSTRIALIST STRUGGLES FOR FINANCIAL REBOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Few Asian tycoons have suffered as abrupt a
reversal of fortune as Anthony Salim, the chief executive of
Indonesia's largest conglomerate, Salim Group. Salim on Tuesday had
both a success and a setback in his effort to salvage his tottering
empire.
</P>
<P>
   Salim Group announced a deal to sell its Singapore property
holdings to a leading Philippine entrepreneur for $183 million. At
the same time, Salim's plan to sell 60 percent of its giant food
company hit a snag, when one of the two buyers, Nissin Food
Products Co. of Japan, withdrew from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The other buyer, First Pacific Co. of Hong Kong, said it still
intended to acquire a 30 percent stake in the company, PT Indofoods
Sukses Makmur. First Pacific said it might eventually increase the
stake.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Nissin's departure cuts the value of the deal in
half, to $285 million. That is another dose of bitter medicine for
the Salim Group, which was devastated by Indonesia's economic
collapse and is desperately shedding assets to pay off $5 billion
in debt to the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several categories of problems to solve,'' said Salim,
49, in a rare interview here Tuesday. ``For Singapore, I think this
deal is milestone No. 1. And I believe we will be in good shape on
the Indonesian side.''
</P>
<P>
   Salim's progress is closely watched here as an indication of how
Indonesia's corporate sector will overcome its crushing debt
burden. After months of negotiations, two major Indonesian
companies, Bakrie and PT Mulia Industrindo, reached agreements this
week with their banks to reorganize debts of $1.02 billion and $550
million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a tidal wave, but there is movement,'' said James
Castle, the head of the Castle Group, a consulting firm here.
``Nothing had been accomplished for so long that you wondered
whether anything ever would.''
</P>
<P>
   Castle said each new deal would encourage more agreements, since
banks and buyers of assets would have benchmarks from which to
negotiate. No seller is under sharper scrutiny than Salim Group.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by Salim's father, Liem Sioe Liong, it grew through
close ties with Indonesia's former president, Suharto, into a $20
billion colossus and a symbol of crony capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   When Suharto stepped down last May amid fierce riots and street
protests, the upheaval seemed to take down his wealthiest crony as
well. Angry mobs burned down Liem's house in Jakarta, and panicked
depositors stormed a Salim-owned bank, Bank Central Asia, to
withdraw their money.
</P>
<P>
   In seven days, Bank Central Asia lost 42 percent of its
deposits. The bank run, on top of an 80 percent devaluation of the
Indonesian rupiah, left Salim staggering under $5 billion in bad
loans. In September, the government took over BCA and bailed out
its depositors in return for stakes in hundreds of Salim companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events in Indonesia were not by anybody's design or
liking,'' Salim said. ``They just happened. It impacted the
well-being of our group, and we've had to adapt ourselves
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   To repay the government and perhaps repurchase BCA, Salim has
been trying to sell stakes in his major holdings. In addition to
Indofood, these include the country's largest cement producer,
Indocement; its second-largest automaker, Indomobil, and the
world's largest flour mill, Bogosari.
</P>
<P>
   Although analysts generally praise Salim's assets and
management, the divestiture process has been full of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Salim agreed to sell its Singapore assets to a Hong
Kong property developer, HKR International. But that deal foundered
after HKR contended that the division would not achieve the profit
targets that had been agreed upon as a condition of the sale. Salim
said Tuesday's deal, with the Philippine entrepreneur John
Gokongwei was solid and worth just as much.
</P>
<P>
   In the Indofood deal, announced in December, Salim was able to
boast that he had lured a major Japanese food company as an
investor. But after creditors of Indofood balked at some of the
terms, Nissin grew uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Salim is left with a $285 million investment by First
Pacific, a Hong Kong conglomerate that is 53.5 percent owned by his
family and associated investors. The coziness of the arrangement
has made analysts question whether one part of the Salim empire is
simply bailing out another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an attempt to ship Indofoods overseas,'' said Rosalina
Lazuardi, an analyst who follows Indofoods at PT Vickers Ballas
Tamara, a brokerage firm here. ``The lender of last resort is First
Pacific. It's a blue-chip stock in Hong Kong, and it's got plenty
of cash on hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at First Pacific, however, said they were getting a
chance to invest in Indofood, the world's largest producer of
instant noodles, at a 24 percent discount to its current market
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, we said that Indofood was a great
company and that we wanted to invest in it,'' said Thomas Yasuda,
the managing director of First Pacific. ``We're disappointed we
couldn't proceed with the Nissin deal, but we're determined to
proceed on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   For Salim, who spent Tuesday _ like every day _ engaged in
financial triage, any deal that brings in cash is a step forward.
``We have to be realistic and solve the problem,'' he said. ``This
is part of the solution.''

JAPANESE LAWMAKERS PASS BILL TO IMPROVE MILITARY TIES WITH U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The lower house of Parliament passed crucial legislation
Tuesday to improve military cooperation with the United States,
smoothing the way for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's departure
Thursday for a meeting with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been pressing for the legislation, which
would make it easier for Japan's military to cooperate with the
United States in any security crisis in East Asia. Washington has
been concerned that if a crisis erupts _ a war with North Korea is
the one most mentioned _ Japan would wring its hands but do little
else.
</P>
<P>
   The new bills are expected to become law after being passed by
the less important upper house of Parliament, probably in May. They
will allow Japan to do more to back up U.S. military action by
sending ships to evacuate civilians abroad, supplying fuel and
spare parts, making airports and hospitals available to U.S. forces
and conducting rear-area search-and-rescue operations for U.S.
troops.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the new military guidelines, Japanese forces would
not fight alongside U.S. troops, and there are doubts about how
quickly and how fully Japan would respond in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are deliberately ambiguous about whether they
apply to the Taiwan Strait, and some Japanese officials acknowledge
that if there is a war over Taiwan, they do not know whether Japan
would risk the wrath of China by allowing the United States to use
U.S. bases in Japan to intervene on behalf of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The three bills passed Tuesday were submitted by the government
to Parliament a year ago, but they have been controversial because
they run into sensitive questions about whether they are compatible
with Japan's ``peace constitution'' imposed after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was Washington that forced the peace constitution on
Japan, in recent years the positions have been reversed. Many
Japanese, particularly those on the left, are deeply pacifist and
want to stay out of any military crisis. But many U.S. officials
would like to see Japan play a greater military role to insure
regional security.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions and peace groups held rallies near the Parliament
building Tuesday, denouncing the legislation and warning that it
could make war more likely. China also criticized the bills, saying
they could harm regional security.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Monday, after
the bills passed out of committee, ``We are confident that this
legislation, when finally enacted, will enable the U.S. and Japan
to respond quickly and flexibly to any contingencies that might
arise.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Japanese Prime Minister Obuchi presumably is delighted
that the bills passed in time to set a positive note for his visit
to Washington, to achieve this he had to sacrifice some key
elements. In particular, Obuchi agreed to lay aside one of the
essential parts of the bills _ Japan's willingness to take part in
ship inspections to enforce international sanctions _ because it
was controversial and was delaying passage of the other elements.
</P>
<P>
   A separate bill on ship inspections will be hammered out in the
coming weeks.

   PESHKOPI, Albania _ Ten Kosovo refugees scrunched into a NATO
helicopter blanched Tuesday seconds before take-off, when three
armed soldiers flung open the door and jumped inside, armed to the
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   They were friendly fighters, it turned out, just Swiss guards in
green camouflage, with lightweight automatic rifles in their arms,
pistols on their hips and knives secured in belt holders. They were
defending the refugees, United Nations refugee agency operatives
and a couple of journalists. From what these NATO troops were
defending is uncertain, but clearly they could have done some
damage.
</P>
<P>
   That was the start of a largely misguided trip here to Peshkopi,
one of the towns in south Albania where UN relief agencies and
Albanian officials are trying to convince 100,000 refugees to
relocate.
</P>
<P>
   The departure point was Kukes, the northern border city where
refugees now are crammed in tents and tractors and homes. It is a
city that authorities fear may be a target of war any day, a
community under physical and social stress.
</P>
<P>
   The excursion sounded good -- a means to convince Kosovo refugee
leaders there are safe, comfortable places for their families to
move. And a few did seem convinced by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But others asked why they hadn't been shown actual places that
would be available to them and their townspeople, and wondered
where were the medical and food and general relief services so
important to people who have travelled in haste and in fear. They
may come around, but it will take some serious debate and
assurances.
</P>
<P>
   What they saw here was tempting. In a secondary school
dormitory, families each had a room with foam mattresses, shared
running water in communal bathrooms and were fed from a group
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard you are suffering much more in Kukes,'' said one
resident refugee. ``We are better off here.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions clearly were superior to the cold, wet tents in Kukes
surrounded by mud ponds from days of rain, where refugees use
smelly chemical toilets lined up outside and normally don't get hot
meals.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was no room for newcomers at the dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   On to an old hotel, which also had separate rooms for families
and plumbing, but it, too, seemed filled to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The third site was a thermal springs rehabilitation center that
not only had sunlit rooms and water, but boasted hot water.
Unfortunately, there was no space there, either.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee group finally did visit a family wanting to host
some Kosovars in need, but could accommodate only three or four.
Most of these families come in bunches of six to 16 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Finally they saw a spacious, clean empty house in a village
about four miles from the center of Peshkopi. They heard that more
such houses are available in other outlying villages, and more
families willing to open their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen these are places in good conditions, but is there
enough room for 6,000 people here?'' asked Rexhap Morina, who was
speaking on behalf of the total population of his tent camp in
Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotel is very nice, but what about the places we will be
staying? You will send us to remote areas and then we'll need a
horse to ride,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The response came from Staffan DeMistura, the UN agency's
special envoy here and the man largely responsible for talking
Kurdistan refugees down from the mountains where they fled after
the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we talk about survival,'' he said. ``You have to look at
things with reality. Look with your eyes, then compare what you
have in Kukes, then you compare with the situation in Kosovo. You
can't only look for the ideal situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Several refugees remained adamant that they did not want to move
so far from the border, where they are close to the family members
they left in Kosovo. Men there also can more easily link up again
with guerrilla independence fighters, once they have their families
settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this town was near to Kukes, I would bring my family,''
said Shaip Hadjari, who said he expected to go back into Kosovo to
fight. He also said there isn't enough assistance here, citing the
lack of medics and other aid supplied in Kukes by international
relief groups.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Dr. Avni Fejza said he was impressed with the
houses and the people who would be hosting relocated refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a positive view,'' he said. ``I will recommend they
come here. Compared to conditions in the tents, especially with bad
weather, I would say finding shelter here would be better.''

ALBANIAN WOMAN TELLS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BY SERBIAN SOLDIERS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Her tormentor told her she was chosen for
her beauty. But it is her determination that sets her apart.
</P>
<P>
   Sherife Alickaj, 18, is one of a small group of ethnic Albanian
women willing to say openly that they were sexually assaulted by
Serbian soldiers during the chaotic exodus from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alickaj said the attack occurred a month ago when she, her
sister and four female friends studying at the University of
Pristina fled their apartment in Pristina after NATO bombing began.
Their landlord warned them that Serbian soldiers were expelling
people from nearby homes.
</P>
<P>
   She, her friend Teuta Elshani, 20, and a third woman, who
requested anonymity, gave matching accounts of the attack in
separate interviews. They said Serbian policemen stopped the group
at a nearby checkpoint and ordered them to produce identity cards.
</P>
<P>
   But the six young women hesitated. They were all from the
Drenica region in northern Kosovo, the birthplace of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the guerrilla group battling Yugoslav forces, and
feared retaliation. They said they did not have their identity
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Several officers then ordered them into a nearby building and
searched their bags. Relieved when they were allowed to quickly
exit the building, a sense of dread fell over the group when two of
the policemen announced they would escort the young women back to
their apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alickaj and the other two women said that after following
them into their living room, the policeman ordered the women to
turn over all the money in the house. When the women said they had
none, they tore a necklace from one young woman's throat, and
ordered all six to go into a small room.
</P>
<P>
   The living room had no curtains in the window, Ms. Elshani said.
``They were afraid someone would see us.''
</P>
<P>
   The policemen, saying they were conducting another search,
ordered all six women to take their clothes off. Five burst into
tears as they undressed. Ms. Alickaj maintained her composure and
tried to reason with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you do this?'' she asked. ``Don't you have sisters?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have sisters, but they don't want a republic,'' one
policeman retorted, referring to some Kosovar Albanians' demands
for an independent country.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the women were menstruating, the young women said, and
the police tried to force those who were not into another room.
When they began to scream, the police relented.
</P>
<P>
   One of the policemen then ordered five of the women to get
dressed and leave. Ms. Alickaj was told to stay with him in the
apartment. ``We are letting the other girls go because you are the
most beautiful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The five young women, escorted by the other policeman,
reluctantly left the apartment. The officer, Ms. Alickaj said, then
forced her to perform oral sex. ``I was lucky to not be raped in
another way because I was having my period,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The policeman hurriedly left the apartment after the attack, Ms.
Alickaj said, and she ran to her uncle's home. Her friends returned
to the apartment later that day, found Ms. Alickaj gone, and feared
her dead. The group reunited the following day and joined the
exodus to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights investigators and medical aid workers say that so
far relatively few women are reporting sexual assaults, but that
does not mean they are not occurring. The intense social stigma
that accompanies rape in Kosovar Albanian society, particularly for
women from small villages, may be leading victims to simply not
report attacks, they said. The process of coming to grips with the
trauma of such assaults can take weeks, they added, and crowded
refugee camps makes it difficult to discuss such matters with
strangers or even relatives in private.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vincent Iacopino, an expert on torture and rape who heads a
Physicians for Human Rights team surveying refugees here, said the
scope of the attacks may not be known for months.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too early to tell,'' he said. ``Some of the people who
are experiencing the worst may still be trapped inside Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Few other issues have become as highly charged as rape in the
former Yugoslavia. During the war in Bosnia, Serbian forces were
accused of systematically raping women as a deliberate tactic of
war, a particularly cruel means, human rights investigators said,
of terrorizing and demoralizing one's enemy. Bosnian Serbs were
accused of operating ``rape camps'' where Muslim women were held
captive and repeatedly assaulted by Serbian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But Bosnian Serb officials vehemently dismissed such charges as
propaganda. They accused women of inventing the attacks and
journalists and human rights investigators of exaggerating their
scope.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, NATO officials said they had evidence
corroborating allegations that the Hotel Karagac in the town of Pec
in Western Kosovo was being used as a ``rape camp'' where young
Albanian women were repeatedly assaulted by Serbian soldiers.
Reports of rape have also emerged from refugees fleeing a handful
of other towns, particularly refugees from western Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia,
the first such body to classify rape as a war crime, has experts on
sexual assault. Investigators from the tribunal have been
interviewing refugees in Albania and Macedonia, but tribunal
officials declined to comment on the status of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   As she told her story last week, Ms. Alickaj spoke in a calm,
matter-of-fact tone. Her face flashed anger at times, but she
seemed determined to not be debilitated by what had occurred. She
freely gave her name and talked openly what the Serbian police had
done to her.
</P>
<P>
   But even for Ms. Alickaj, a young woman described by her friends
as unusually strong, admitting such an attack is both trying and
dangerous. Her female friends discussed the attack without
mentioning what happened to Ms. Alickaj until she arrived and
disclosed it herself.
</P>
<P>
   A male friend who knew of the attack angrily shooed away a
middle-aged man eavesdropping on the conversation. And in a seeming
effort to protect her, the young man blurted out in English ``he
made her do oral sex'' so it would not be understood by other
Albanians nearby.

 &HT;    Lottery officials admit 3-number game caused shortfall
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first time in its history, the Georgia Lottery
Corp. last year fell short of its target for funding education, the
main selling point used to win voter approval for a state lottery
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   State officials blame a statistical fluke in payouts for Cash 3,
the lottery's most popular game. But it is the second consecutive
year lottery officials have been faced with the payout problem
caused by the fixed-odds, casino-style game.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials drained an $8 million Cash 3 reserve they
control to plug the gap the first year, but couldn't turn to that
reserve again because the fund was depleted.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires the lottery to return ``as nearly as
practical'' 35 percent of its net proceeds to the treasury, where
it can be appropriated by the General Assembly for HOPE
scholarships, pre-kindergarten and school construction and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   But lottery payments dipped to 33 percent for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1998, according to State Auditor Claude Vickers.
The $555 million transferred to the state was more than enough to
cover HOPE and pre-K costs, but it was $33 million below the
statutory target.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers said the lottery came up short because it had to make
unusually high payouts to winners of Cash 3, particularly those who
bet triple numbers. ``The law of averages caught up with us on
those triple numbers,'' Vickers said. ``But since the inception of
the lottery, we're really close to a 35 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reasonable person, in looking at the way they've conducted
their business. . .would conclude they're probably doing it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes said he was pleased with the way the
lottery was being run.
</P>
<P>
   But Harold Parker, state president of Common Cause, said the law
shouldn't allow the lottery leeway with the language ``as nearly as
practical'' to a 35 percent payout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a loophole you could drive a bus through,'' Parker
said. ``The lottery should make up the difference out of their
advertising budget in order to honor their commitment to
education.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. George Hooks (D-Americus), chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, wasn't concerned. ``I think we're on safe
ground,'' said Hooks, who helps decide how lottery money is spent.
``We fully funded HOPE and Pre-K and our lottery reserves (within
the state treasury) are full.''
</P>
<P>
   However, temporary shortfalls could affect discretionary capital
spending for projects like computers or school construction, Hooks
noted. ``We need to keep an eye on it,'' he said. Lottery President
Rebecca Paul said there was little she could have done to attain
the 35 percent target last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have cut our ad budget and fired everybody and still
not make up the big Cash 3 payouts,'' Paul said. The lottery spent
$17.4 million on advertising in fiscal year 1998, about half of
that year's shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Cash 3 generated ticket sales of $627 million that same year.
</P>
<P>
   The game is designed to pay out 50 percent of ticket sales .
Players pay either a dollar or 50 cents to pick a number between
000 and 999. If their number is randomly selected, they win $500 or
$250, depending on the size of their bet.
</P>
<P>
   Any combination of numbers can be bet, and any has an equal
chance of winning. But players tend to prefer triple numbers, such
as ``888'' or ``444'', and the lottery sometimes has to pay
thousands of winners when one is drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Between December 1997 and February 1998, triples were drawn four
times. The lottery's total liability on those four drawings
exceeded $50 million. As a result, the lottery paid out 53.50 cents
in prizes for each $1 in Cash 3 sales in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The year before was even worse; the average payout was 53.99
cents per dollar.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the 35 percent contribution target, Paul said, the
lottery emptied an $8 million Cash 3 reserve account and
transferred $7.7 million from an unclaimed prizes fund.
</P>
<P>
   It also intentionally reduced payouts on scratch-off games, but
that strategy backfired by driving players away.
</P>
<P>
   So last year, Paul significantly raised scratch-off payout
ratios.
</P>
<P>
   Raising scratch-off payouts made it harder to meet the 35
percent payback target, but it spurred sales. Paul said Georgia is
on track to have its fifth straight increase in annual sales this
year, a rare accomplishment for a state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the lottery would meet the 35 percent payback
target this fiscal year, she said: ``We'll be 34 percent and
change. Our goal is to raise dollars, not achieve percentages.''
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1998, Georgia was 15th among 38 state lotteries in the
percentage of proceeds returned to the government, according to La
Fleur's Lottery World, a Maryland-based trade publication.
Georgians rank third nationally in spending a percentage of their
income on the state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   That ranking could suffer when Alabama and South Carolina begin
their own lotteries. But Paul said there is little danger the
Georgia Lottery won't be able to sustain the needs of its
highest-priority programs _ HOPE and pre-K.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Forget melatonin and faddish diets. When it comes to jet lag,
that traveler's hangover of digestive ailments, sleep deprivation
and moodiness, it's best to turn on the lights.
 &HT;    That's the contention of Dr. Martin Moore-Ede, a Harvard Medical
School professor for 25 years, who says that ``external and
internal desynchronization'' are the major culprits. Moore-Ede is
now president of Circadian Technologies in Cambridge, Mass., a
company that deals with issues of sleep and productivity for major
U.S. corporations, and the co-author of ``The Complete Idiot's
Guide to Getting a Good Night's Sleep'' (Macmillan, 1998; $16.95)
with Suzanne LeVert.
 &HT;    ``You're asking your body to cope with a sudden shift from day
to night,'' Moore-Ede points out. ``You're cramped in a plane with
low humidity, and you're dehydrated regardless of what you consume.
And when you get there, you're required to sleep at times that are
counter to your biology.''
 &HT;    Moore-Ede believes that once travelers determine whether they
are a ``morning lark'' or a ``night owl,'' they can counter the
effects of jet lag with massive doses of light at the proper time.
They must factor in which direction they're flying, how many time
zones they've skipped and how much sleep they've lost.
 &HT;    As for other methods of dealing with jet lag, Moore-Ede says,
``There's no data whatsoever'' to support jet lag diets and there
are clear dangers to using faddish drugs like melatonin. Instead,
he believes in using light and making some sensible travel
decisions.
 &HT;    ``First, your choice of flights and times is quite
significant,'' he says. ``Certain flights are better suited to
certain types of people.''
 &HT;    Moore-Ede says that morning people who can adapt well to going
to bed early and then rapidly adjust to a new time zone should take
advantage of daytime flights from the United States to Europe.
 &HT;    ``But if you're a morning person and there isn't a daytime
flight,'' Moore-Ede says, ``take an early evening flight that gets
you into Europe anywhere from 4:30 a.m. to 7 a.m. and then go to
bed immediately when you arrive.''
 &HT;    For night owls heading to Europe, ``you may do well by taking
the latest evening flight that you can find and then try to sleep
on the plane,'' he adds. ``You don't want a flight that gets you in
at 6 a.m. local time. You want to get in as close to noon as you
can.''
 &HT;    For today's business travelers who are making a relatively short
trip to Asia or Europe, Moore-Ede says that ``there's considerable
logic to not adjusting your biological clock at all but simply
adapting as best as you can, and staying on your home time zone.''
 &HT;    As for getting that precious sleep upon arrival, look for hotels
that cater to business travelers. Some Hiltons, for example, have
special rooms with blackout drapes and extra soundproofing and have
specially trained their housekeeping staff not to disturb guests.
 &HT;    But the two key components for dealing with jet lag are light
and dark, says Moore-Ede, who was a member of the Harvard team that
discovered in the human brain the cluster of nerve cells known as
the suprachiasmatic nuclei, or SCN.
 &HT;    ``The SCN regulates the 25-hour time clock that we are believed
to have and it enables early morning light to reset our clocks to a
24-hour day, every day,'' Moore-Ede says.
 &HT;    To reduce jet lag, Moore-Ede suggests using heavy doses of light
to both reset and advance time clocks based on individual sleep
personalities and the distance traveled.
 &HT;    His theory is that any light that a traveler receives before 5
a.m. home time shifts his or her time clock westbound. Light
received after 5 a.m. home time will shift it eastbound. The amount
of light needed to make a real adjustment is measured in lux, a
metric unit used to quantify the intensity of visible light.
Moore-Ede says that one needs about 2,500 lux to move one's body
clock one hour or more in a single dose.
 &HT;    Moore-Ede notes that a room lit with 100-watt lightbulbs will
produce only about 200 to 500 lux. With his corporate clients, he
uses a light visor called Bio-Brite to deliver the required number
of lux to them when they're sitting in a hotel room or on a plane.
 &HT;    His clients also use his software program, Midnight Sun, to
figure out how much light they'll need. This program can tell them
before they get on a flight to Japan this afternoon the exact time
of dawn in Tokyo tomorrow. It will inform them of how long a dose
of light they'll need in flight and how much they'll need upon
arrival.
 &HT;    But for those who don't have $300 to spend on a Bio-Brite light
visor, let alone the money for the software program, Moore-Ede says
to simply go outside. He maintains that a cloudy day yields about
10,000 lux while a sunny blue sky provides a whopping 50,000 lux.
 &HT;    The disappointing news is that even with concentrated doses of
light, jet lag won't be completely eliminated. But it should make
the transition from the United States to Paris or Tokyo or Tel Aviv
that much easier.

 &HT;    ---------------------------------------------------
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The enthusiastic guide in the ornate Victorian house draws the
members of the tour group along just as a real estate salesman
might, urging them to think of themselves as residents, make
decorating decisions and choose their bedrooms.
 &HT;    Joe Wolfenden, a guide in the Old Governor's Mansion in
California's capital city of Sacramento, tells stories relating to
each room. When he points to gowns worn by women in former Gov.
Earl Warren's household, he muses that his mother-in-law, Florence
Muschetto, may have been the seamstress who made one of the
dresses.
 &HT;    As you leave the mansion, whistles shriek across the treetops _
some from steam trains, some from sternwheelers.
 &HT;    Sacramento is a city that offers mature travelers insights into
history, railroading, riverboats, traditional jazz, politics and
gold fever. And it constantly adds new items to its repertoire. For
inquisitive travelers, Sacramento can be an in-depth and leisurely
learning experience in an easy-to-take climate.
 &HT;    The spirit of modern Sacramento depends on the many ghosts of
Sacramento's past _ like John Sutter, whose fort was the
provisioning headquarters for the 49ers in search of their fortunes
150 years ago. Touches of the golden heritage are everywhere:
melted gold coins creating the crown on the State Capitol, the
burnished golden onion domes of the Russian Orthodox Church, broad
golden bands circling china plates in the governor's mansion.
 &HT;    Sacramento was the site of the genesis of the gold rush that
tilted our nation west; the jumping-off place for the
transcontinental railroad that tied this nation together
economically; and the launching pad for the political dreams of
several notable people.
 &HT;    Sitting in the midst of rich agricultural acreage and a
meandering river delta, Sacramento is often overlooked in favor of
bigger, brassier California cities with their film and high-tech
industries. But it is easy to be surprised while sampling
Sacramento and to come away with tidbits of the past that make
today easier to understand. For instance:
 &HT;    _ The music room in the Old Governor's Mansion (1526 H St.),
where guests sang show tunes while an aide to Gov. Ronald Reagan,
Michael Deaver, played the piano.
 &HT;    _ The State Capitol's assembly chambers (10th &AMP; L streets),
which simultaneously boast chairs for representatives of the
English crown and display computers on each of its 130-year-old
desks. Or the brightly colored modernistic portrait of Gov. Jerry
Brown in the halls of the Capitol hanging beside more somber,
formal portraits of his predecessors, including his father, Gov.
Pat Brown.
 &HT;    _ The living history scenes showcased regularly at Sutter's Fort
(27th &AMP; L streets). They tell stories about life when the fort
stood alone on the Sacramento plain in 1847 through the gold rush
frenzy of 1849 until 1857, when the rush was over and the frontier
gone.
 &HT;    _ The Sierra scene in the California State Railroad Museum (2nd
and I streets), which tips its hat in tribute to the lives and
deaths of thousands of Chinese workers who helped build the
transcontinental railroad, a great civil engineering feat. You can
even catch a ride on the Sacramento Southern Railroad steam train
on weekends from April through September.
 &HT;    _ The Huntington, Hopkins &AMP; Co. Hardware Store sign in Old
Sacramento (113 I St.), which tells you clearly that a quartet of
merchants who sold hardware, groceries and dry goods could become
the Big Four railroaders, who had great influence in the worlds of
politics and finance.
 &HT;    It had been some time since we lingered in Sacramento. So when
we had a chance to stay awhile and wander the vast and comfortable
neighborhoods studded with architecture of every era and bike the
tidy trails along the American River, we relished renewing our old
friendship. We enjoyed not only the attractions in the city itself,
but neighboring areas where we could prospect for gold, hunt for
antiques, go river rafting or walk around historic neighborhoods.
And this year, added attractions include celebrations of the
Sesquicentennial of the Gold Rush.
 &HT;    My, how Sacramento has grown! Not so much in size as in style.
 &HT;    Monolithic government buildings of every hue and style cozy up
to gingerbread Victorians, some commanding high banks that once
helped thwart river floods, others with elevated porches and
staircases leading past unusual first-floor delta basements.
 &HT;    Quiet, clean, light-rail trains slide beside horse-drawn
carriages and lines of cars and trucks. Nouveau restaurants have
moved into warehouse districts and car showrooms. Their tables
spill outside, where patrons lounge on even the warmest (100-plus
degrees) or coldest days (around 35 degrees).
 &HT;    Sidewalks deviate from their straight lines to meander around
the bases of big leafy trees, towering palms and dusty evergreens.
 &HT;    New museums have popped up, such as the McClellan Aviation
Museum (3204 Palm St., McClellan Air Force Base, 916/643-3192, free
admission), which now displays approximately 31 vintage aircraft.
 &HT;    Another is the innovative Golden State Museum (1020 O St.,
916/653-4255, $5 admission for seniors), showcasing the people and
politics of California through interactive exhibits. For example,
you can climb inside a bus to hear the voices of those who
immigrated to ``Golden Mountain,'' as the Chinese referred to
California.
 &HT;    More established museums offer mini-theatricals with docents
dressed in costumes of the era or stage elaborate multi-day
festivals. One upcoming festival offered by the California State
Railroad Museum is Railfair '99 (June 18-27, 1999), which will
feature locomotives and railroad cars as well as live entertainment
and living history demonstrations to highlight the ways railroads
have made a difference in our lives.
 &HT;    Railfair prices for those 62 and older are $1 off whatever
admission you buy, from a one-day to a 10-day pass. Those buying
tickets in advance _ before June 17 _ get an additional $4 off.
Call 916/445-6645 for information.
 &HT;    And this year, dozens of special events are planned to celebrate
the Gold Rush anniversary, including ``Gold Fever!'' (Aug. 1-Oct.
31), an interactive, multimedia exhibition that is one of the
anniversary centerpieces. It will be held in Sacramento's Memorial
Auditorium at 15th &AMP; J streets (916/264-7072). Admission for those
65 and older is $6.
 &HT;    Sacramento's Old Town will convert itself into a theme park with
sawdust-filled streets for The Second Great Gold Rush from Sept. 3
to 6, featuring reenactments of everything from a horse-drawn
funeral to the arrival of the Pony Express. Call 916/264-8141 for
ticket info.
 &HT;    Earlier in the year, on Memorial Day weekend (May 28-31), the
city will resound with the music of the Sacramento Jazz Jubilee
(916/372-5277). Jazz concerts in dozens of venues from one end of
the city to the other will showcase bands from around the world and
across the United States, while aficionados dress up in costume and
dance and swing whenever the beat moves them. Daily tickets range
from $16 for half-day admission to $80 for the weekend; admission
on Monday is half-price for seniors.
 &HT;    Trains and planes and boats and all that jazz _ these are the
grown-up toys that hold fascination for many mature travelers and
are so much a part of the Sacramento of today.

   HAMILTON, Bermuda _ The construction project in the middle of
town tells the tale of how things have been going lately amid the
pastel bungalows and perpetual spring that have long defined this
island. The grand old Bermudiana Hotel and its luxuriant gardens
have been leveled; in their place are rising two big insurance
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   With relentless competition and changing tastes, Bermuda's
tourist business has been fading. But with no corporate taxes and
light regulation, the island has quietly developed a booming
insurance business, making Bermuda the third leg _ with New York
and London _ in the world's central insurance triangle.
</P>
<P>
   In the low-rising, vaguely dated village of Hamilton,
underwriters, actuaries and brokers are the new princes. The
resident lawyers and accountants depend heavily on insurance
business, and the construction trades have seldom been busier. Not
far from the Bermudiana site, an even bigger block of insurance
offices is just being completed. At night, tables at Little Venice
and the more expensive Cafe Lido are filled with insurance
executives and their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be lost without the insurance people,'' said Tullio
Lombardi, an assistant manager at the beachfront Cafe Lido.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of insurance people would be lost without Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Much as Liberia and Panama have provided flags of convenience
for the world's maritime fleets, Bermuda has blossomed as a
convenient extension of the U.S. insurance industry. A
self-governing British colony, it has generally managed to steer
clear of money laundering, drug smuggling and most of the
fly-by-night financial scams that have tarnished other so-called
tax havens. And it has attracted a cadre of insurance technicians
from the United States and Europe that, as government business
recruiters like to point out, adds to the ease of setting up shop
here.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda is the land of megadeals, where corporate policies are
written that often kick in only after losses hit more than $100
million. For the buyers and sellers in this highflying world,
Bermuda's oversight is a model of restraint. Here, the issue is
financial strength. The details of day-to-day business are between
the insurers and their customers.
</P>
<P>
   With that philosophy, Bermuda has become a place where new
twists in coverage can be worked out in a few days _ or at worst _
a few weeks, rather than the months, if not years, needed in the
United States. Bermuda's laissez-faire supervision stands in sharp
contrast to the thickets of regulation that have grown up in all 50
states with the goal _ rarely fully realized _ of protecting the
smallest policyholder rather than oiling the wheels of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda's overall success has recently inspired regulators in
the United States to begin easing up. Half a dozen states have
agreed to let corporate buyers and sellers negotiate the terms and
prices of high-level coverage just as all coverage is handled here.
And similar legislation is being considered in New York and a dozen
other states.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory and tax advantages of Bermuda _ and just an hour
and a half by air from New York _ made it a natural for solving the
industry's problems. When heavy losses caused even Lloyd's of
London to back away from offering high-ticket, high-risk coverage
against product liability lawsuits and the ravages of hurricanes
and earthquakes, Americans with deep pockets and a sense of
opportunity turned to Bermuda to set up companies that would
consider almost any proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda's main customers are America's corporate giants, whose
transactions here mean less money for insurers in the United
States. Yet the big U.S. insurers are not complaining. They helped
create Bermuda's insurance business. Some have profited by setting
up their own subsidiaries here; many others have become buyers of
catastrophe reinsurance, which at first was available almost
nowhere else and now helps them diversify.
</P>
<P>
   Still others have been delighted to have Bermuda sharing the
market for stratospheric coverages so they are not faced with
either taking on more risk than they can comfortably handle or
disappointing corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   So, out of self-interest, U.S. insurers have quietly accepted
the rise of Bermuda. ``The other insurers need Bermuda as much as
Bermuda needs them,'' said Sharda Cherwoo, an insurance specialist
at Ernest &AMP; Young, the international accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Bermudian companies pioneered financial coverage that pays off
on fluctuations of foreign currency rates and commodities prices,
often packaged with protection against, say, plant fires and
lawsuits. And the Bermudian titans _ Ace Ltd. and X.L. Capital Ltd.
_ have begun extending their reach. They have turned the tables on
their elders, buying up older _ and sometimes bigger _ companies in
the United States and prowling among the Lloyd's syndicates that
once tried to use their influence to crush the island upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   In the slimmed-down, customized world of Bermudian insurance,
there are fewer protections for corporate customers. For example,
most Bermudian policies require that disputes be worked out in
binding arbitration, rather than in the courts. Also in the United
States, insurers are required to contribute to a so-called
guarantee fund in each state that provides money to pay claims if
an insurance company collapses. In Bermuda, there is no guarantee
fund.
</P>
<P>
   But Bermuda has no shortage of customers. For many of its
clients, the ability to work out new coverage quickly to solve an
immediate insurance problem and to take on enormous risk outweighs
concern about a forum for resolving disputes that may never
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   For big corporations with policies in the tens of millions of
dollars, U.S. guarantee funds are of little value anyway because
they are usually worth only a few hundred thousand dollars, little
help if an insurance company fails to pay off a multimillion-dollar
loss.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, oversight does not end with the regulators. Many of
the Bermudian companies are publicly traded in the United States
and subject to the reporting requirements of the stock exchanges
and of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The rating agencies
periodically examine the books of all major insurers, including the
Bermudians, and publish their findings on financial strength, which
provides a powerful measure of their ability to pay claims. ``A
company with a low rating is just not going to get any business,''
said Barbara Stewart, an insurance consultant in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The foundations for Bermuda's insurance industry were laid
shortly after World War II. That was when U.S. corporations
realized they could save money with a paper device known as a
captive insurance company, which enables a corporation to
effectively sell itself insurance and deduct the premiums from its
taxable income. And for tax and regulatory reasons as well as
Bermuda's reputation for probity, many U.S. corporations began
registering their captives in Bermuda. Today, there are roughly
1,400 captives in Bermuda, more than anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But it took a few decades before the first big mainstream
Bermudian insurance companies were created. They began in the
mid-1980s with New York money, knowledge and technical skill. When
traditional insurers cut back on high-end coverage, Robert
Clements, a senior executive at Marsh &AMP; McLennan Cos., the world's
largest insurance broker, persuaded IBM, Ford Motor, Royal
Dutch/Shell and 31 other corporations to go offshore to Bermuda and
start their own insurance companies. That was how Ace was started.
Six months later, Clements brought together other corporations to
form Exel Ltd., now XL Capital. It is Ace and XL that are building
the new offices that are going up on the grounds of the Bermudiana
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   As a prerequisite for the new companies, Clement roughed out a
new kind of liability policy that carved a middle path between the
most restrictive and most liberal policies.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, big hurricane and earthquake losses
convinced major insurance companies that they should be buying a
lot more reinsurance. But traditional reinsurers, which provide
back-up coverage to the front-line insurers, did not want to put
more chips into a game that was looking increasingly dangerous. So
Clements dusted off his old blueprints and started Midocean
Reinsurance Ltd. to sell nothing but coverage for other insurers
against the worst calamities. Eventually, eight catastrophe
reinsurance companies were created.
</P>
<P>
   Others' disasters were a timely salve for Bermuda's economy. For
decades, Bermuda has been like a big country club for the East
Coast golf and tennis set. It also has been a favorite of
honeymooners.
</P>
<P>
   But Bermuda's popularity is waning. Visitors in recent years
have complained that the island is horribly expensive _ a couple of
sandwiches and drinks can easily run $40. While peace and quiet
were once big selling points for Bermuda, visitors today often
complaint that there is not much to do.
</P>
<P>
   The economic balance tipped in favor of insurance and other
international business three years ago and since then the gap has
been widening. In the last fiscal year, insurance and other
international businesses pumped $757.6 million into Bermuda
compared with $472.3 million from tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of the stagnation of tourism, Bermudians last
fall voted out the United Bermuda Party, which governed for 35
years. The new prime minister, Jennifer Smith of the Progressive
Labor Party, is in a delicate political position. She must
encourage the growth of insurance, but she must not be seen to be
favoring it over tourism _ even though there is some overlap _
because even now, tourism provides more jobs. By her count 2,400
people work in insurance and nearly 6,000 have jobs in hotels,
restaurants and other businesses in the tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   As practiced in Bermuda, insurance is a fast-paced business. The
companies have small staffs. There is a lot of give and take and a
blurring of ranks that often make the companies seem more like
research centers than like hierarchical insurance concerns. Ties,
and sometimes even shoes, are optional at some companies.
</P>
<P>
   While the insurers would like to do more local hiring, most of
their highest-paying jobs go to fairly young expatriates, attracted
by money, a balmy climate and the opportunity to work on big,
important transactions. After work on Fridays, underwriters,
actuaries and brokers crowd into the Robin Hood, a pub on Richmond
Road, to let off steam.
</P>
<P>
   They bring their energy to what was once a pretty sleepy place.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a certain amount of sassiness and arrogance
coupled with real entrepreneurial spirit,'' said Bill McGannon,
who, for years, was in charge of the insurance budget of the Nova
Chemical Corporation in western Canada. ``They don't come up with a
lot of reasons they can't give you what you need. They want to do a
deal.''

 &HT;    UPS continues overseas profit gains
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the heels of its first-ever annual profit from
international service, United Parcel Service kept up the momentum
in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   International operating profit quadrupled from a year earlier,
contributing to a 42 percent jump in overall profit for the Sandy
Springs-based delivery giant.
</P>
<P>
   Net income climbed to $499 million in the January-March quarter,
up from $352 million a year ago. Revenue rose to $6.33 billion, vs.
$5.86 billion. UPS stock is owned by employees and doesn't trade
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits from international business rose to $44
million from $11 million, which UPS attributed to growth in express
delivery volume in both Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw impressive growth in our express products in most
corners of the world,'' said Chairman and Chief Executive Jim
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The first-quarter gains also reflected UPS's efforts to expand
its e-commerce products, build overall volume and control costs,
Kelly said. Slightly lower fuel prices helped.
</P>
<P>
   UPS began a steady international expansion 11 years ago, mainly
by acquiring local companies. But it lost money on the expansion
until last year, when it posted international operating profits of
$56 million, reversing a $67 million loss in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   UPS now is well-positioned throughout much of Europe but faces
new challenges as national postal agencies offer competing
low-priced domestic service, most notably in Germany. UPS has
responded by de-emphasizing German domestic service and focusing on
cross-border European business.
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter U.S. domestic package operating profit rose to
$765 million from $594 million on a 2.7 percent volume increase.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits from non-package operations fell to $25
million for the quarter from $35 million a year earlier, despite a
26.6 percent gain in revenue for the sector.
</P>
<P>
   Non-package operations includes such areas as truck leasing and
supply-chain management services offered by UPS Logistics Group.
Spokesman Norman Black, however, said the profit decline was due to
start-up expenses for unannounced new products and services rather
than ongoing business.

 &HT;    Rafter relishes relaxed reputation
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The seventh of nine children, Patrick Rafter grew up
in a three-bedroom house on a farm in Australia. He slept in the
same room as his brothers, with five beds lined up in a row.
</P>
<P>
   And now that the fourth-ranked player on the ATP Tour can afford
a place or two of his own, he still can't always get the privacy he
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk behind him, you see the people staring at him,
so he tries to limit his eye contact,'' said Paul Kilderry, one of
Rafter's closest friends on the tour. ``In Australia, people come
up to him all the time, at restaurants and bars, and because he's
such a nice guy, he's never rude, so they think he likes it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, the No. 1 seed at this week's at the AT&AMP;T Challenge at
Atlanta Athletic Club, is most relaxed as just one of the mates
drinking a couple of beers after a match. He's never been fully at
ease with the money or attention that goes with a pair of U.S. Open
championships. His popularity grew beyond just the tennis public
two years back when People magazine featured him in their 10
Sexiest Men issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, who was scheduled to play Martin Rodriguez in a night
match Tuesday, prefers a lower profile. He donated $500,000 to a
hospital for terminally ill children after his 1997 U.S. Open
victory and didn't let anyone know about it. A brother squealed on
him some months later. Earlier this year, Rafter started a charity
in Sydney to combat drug addiction among teenagers and said there
was too much money in sports. Rafter tempered those remarks this
week, struggling to make sense of his unexpected fame and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably something I might take back to an extent,''
Rafter said. ``Only for this reason: We get paid the way we do
because we can't have a private life. You've got eyes on you all
the time. Giving up your life, your identity, is a big price to
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   At tournaments, however, Rafter enjoys the public affection. He
made extra time this week to sign autographs and meet children in a
local tennis program for at-risk youth. His status as a sex symbol
embarrasses him at times, but he concedes, ``I quite like that.
It's a fun thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's really nothing new, only magnified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always sort of there, going back to '94 and '95,''
Rafter said. ``I just sort of knew that if I ever did well,
something like that might happen. Tennis has always had a glamour
boy, but they didn't have one at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilderry said jokingly, ``It's amazing how much better you look
when you win the U.S. Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's friends have been known to search his bags for notes
and mail from admiring women, Kilderry said. Once at a tournament
in the Netherlands, one of the players found a letter from a woman
who'd left her phone number. The player called her and left a
message, saying he was Rafter, and gave her Rafter's number at his
hotel. The naive Rafter returned the call.
</P>
<P>
   Kilderry, who wouldn't reveal the prankster, said,''There would
be a number of guys who'd do it and get great pleasure out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter says he's not given to that sort of temptation, adding,
``I never, ever get distracted from my tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter has been dating Lara Feltham, an Australian model, for
more than a year and credits their stable relationship with
enhancing his tennis, especially last summer when he surged to four
hardcourt titles, culminating in his second U.S. Open win.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a little bit older, 28,'' said Rafter, who's 26. ``I've
dated some younger girls where it's been an ordeal and it can't
stand the test of touring. I don't want a lot of complications
going on in my head while I'm on the tennis court. It's a maturity
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Feltham occasionally joins Rafter on tour, but he usually
doesn't have an entourage, not even a coach. His brother Steve
manages his business affairs from Australia, and brother Peter
joins him for the hectic Grand Slam fortnights. Usually, you can
just find Rafter with his Aussie friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the other top guys stick with their own,'' fellow
Aussie Jason Stoltenberg said. ``Pat will go to dinner with the
other players. He's kept his feet on the ground.''

MEXICO FACES THREAT OF DEFORESTATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EJIDO PINO GORDO, Mexico _ The shepherds of this remote mountain
settlement till the earth behind oaken plows and grind their corn
between smooth stones. They have no television, telephones or
electricity. Yet by one standard, the village enjoys vast wealth:
It is surrounded by magnificent forests.
</P>
<P>
   So when outsiders recently bulldozed a logging road and began
applying chainsaws to hundreds of 200-year-old trees, villagers
panicked. Men, women and children walked for 36 hours across a
canyon to board buses for the Chihuahua state capital, where they
held a sit-in at the governor's palace this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want our forests felled,'' a Raramuri-speaking Indian
leader, Francisco Ramos, told authorities through an interpreter in
negotiations that followed. ``We didn't plant the trees, God did,
to collect water from the rain and give homes to the animals. The
trees are not our property. We're just taking care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials were stunned by the Indian protest and the
news coverage it prompted, and Chihuahua state officials recently
announced a halt to the illegal logging around the village in the
Sierra Madre, about 850 miles northwest of Mexico City, at least
for now. But a federal official denied that any decision had been
made. Conservationists said they hoped for an environmental
victory, but it was only one skirmish in a war for Mexico's
beleaguered forests.
</P>
<P>
   All across Mexico _ from Chihuahua in the north, to the central
woodland preserves that are wintering grounds for North America's
monarch butterflies, to the tropical jungles of Chiapas in the
south _ timberlands are being cleared at a devastating rate.
Poachers are even cutting the few surviving forest preserves around
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deforestation is pushing us toward environmental collapse,''
said Sen. Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, who has proposed legislation to
create a National Forestry Commission with broad powers to confront
what he calls an emergency. ``The government should declare a
national forestry disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The country has destroyed half its forests in four decades and,
unless the devastation slows, will finish them off in half a
century, Aguilar said in an interview. Mexico's forests still cover
an area larger than California. But since it is mountainous, Mexico
needs extensive timberlands to capture rain water and prevent
flooding, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, wildfires that sent smoke clouds drifting into
Florida and Texas focused American attention on the crisis. But far
more trees are lost every year in Mexico to timber clearing or to
the cultivation of crops than are lost to fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illegal logging is out of control,'' said Leticia Merino, an
anthropologist at a branch of the Autonomous National University in
Cuernavaca, south of Mexico City, who is studying timber poaching.
</P>
<P>
   Some trees are felled by poor farmers who use the timber to
build homes or to sell to firewood vendors. More destruction is
caused by companies who engage in large-scale illegal logging,
often in collaboration with corrupt officials, she said. Sometimes
drug traffickers muscle in, using sawmill operations to launder
drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican forest policy has been marked by zigzags. In the 1930s,
land reform gave 9,000 Indian and farming communities control over
80 percent of the country's forests, a higher percentage than
anywhere else in the world. The communities, called ejidos, took on
the role played by the Forest Service in the United States:
fighting fires, planting trees and managing the harvest of timber.
</P>
<P>
   But successive governments encouraged thousands of rural poor
people to clear forests for the grazing of cattle. The most
damaging of such projects were abandoned in the last decade, but
one farm program still pays rural people an annual subsidy for each
acre of forest cleared for farming.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Mexico's entire budget for all forest-related
programs totals only about $90 million, Aguilar said.
Responsibility for enforcing forestry laws across Mexico lies with
just a few dozen inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Forestry laws passed in recent years encourage ejido communities
to divide forests into plots and to sign timber-harvesting deals
with logging companies. But many forest communities that sign
timber contracts end up in peonage, owing increasing sums to
logging companies each year, despite the harvest of entire forests.
</P>
<P>
   In one Chihuahua village, for example, a logging company
harvested 103 million cubic feet of lumber in 1992, yet at year's
end the village owed $16,000 more than when the year began,
according to village records.
</P>
<P>
   David Barton Bray, an environmental studies professor at Florida
International University in Miami, said that 17 million people
still live in Mexico's woodlands. Policies should help them earn a
livelihood from the forests even as they manage and conserve them,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many peasant and indigenous people, forests are not only
an economic resource, but also a spiritual wellspring and a source
of ethnic identity,'' Bray said. Such is the case of the Chihuahua
Indians who speak a language called Raramuri. They are often called
Tarahumara by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forests are fundamental to their cosmic vision,'' said Isela
Gonzalez Diaz, an anthropologist who helped advise the Pino Gordo
villagers during the recent negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Pino Gordo lies next to Coloradas de los Chavez, a rival village
of Spanish-speaking people. Coloradas leaders are privatizing their
village forests, and last year the federal government issued a
permit allowing the village to sign contracts with a logging
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   But the loggers soon jumped the boundaries of Coloradas, cutting
roads into Pino Gordo's forests and felling trees there. Pino Gordo
villagers complained to authorities, but got no response until the
recent protest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the negotiations, one Indian leader asked why the
government would issue a permit to Coloradas de los Chavez to cut
forests that are habitat for endangered fauna, including the
thick-billed parrot and the jaguarundi wildcat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to restrict the cutting of forests wherever there
is fauna in danger, we'd risk being in the same situation as the
United States, where most forest lands are now off limits to
logging,'' responded Leonel Iglesias, an official from the federal
Environment Ministry based in Chihuahua. ``Mexico has economic
needs that are different than the developed countries. We need
greater flexibility in our forest management.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities insisted repeatedly that there was no illegal
logging in the Pino Gordo region and that the Indians were simply
confused about their village boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   But as the talks proceeded, journalists and environmentalists
who traveled to Pino Gordo found men with chainsaws and hydraulic
winches felling trees on Pino Gordo's hillsides. One logger,
Curberto Bustillo Acosta, said each man in his crew had been
cutting 200 trees a day in the area.
</P>
<P>
   As the Indian protest drew news coverage, government officials
eventually agreed to send surveyors and other state and federal
officials to Pino Gordo. By the time they arrived, the loggers had
fled. But, seeing hillsides covered with stumps, state officials
said they had ordered the suspension of logging that had already
stopped. Federal officials said they were still studying the
dispute.

   OPERA-HOUSES-EXPENSES (Undated) _ There is no other company like
it, and yet the Metropolitan Opera may end up a model for the
future. In the season just closed and the one to come, the Met
continues a practice of self-sufficiency and free enterprise that
is largely unfamiliar to the international opera world. But now we
see the free-spending ways of government-subsidized opera houses
being strenuously curbed. Indeed, the adventurous, the innovative
and sometimes the reckless are no longer automatically underwritten
by generous European ministries of culture. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FILMMAKERS-SCHOOLS (Undated) _ Although the University of
Southern California opened the nation's first film program in 1929,
the Hollywood studios provided their own educational system until
the 1960s: would-be directors worked their way through the ranks
from entry-level jobs. The path is still followed today. But with
the collapse of the studio system, film schools began to take over
the training of young filmmakers. Today, the most common route to a
directing career starts in the academy, with a master's degree in
filmmaking. By Margalit Fox.
</P>
<P>
   CALIGULA-FILM (Undated) _ This summer, the movie that became
infamous for going too far will go even further _ about 12 minutes
further, according to its producer, Bob Guccione. ``Caligula,''
called by Newsweek ``a two-and-one-half hour cavalcade of
depravity,'' will now run nearly two-and-three-quarters hours. By
Ted Loos.
</P>
<P>
   FLOCKHART-FILM (Los Angeles) _ There were those in the team of
British hair and makeup experts hired to give her the fairy-tale
makeover for Michael Hoffman's adaptation of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' who expected nothing good from Calista Flockhart. And they
told her so. Cast as the lovesick Helena, the television star was
going to pop over from America and proceed to be finicky, imperious
and exasperatingly unaware of just how horribly she was mangling
the Bard's words. Hoffman's version of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' which opens May 14, is contemporary in spirit while being
conscientious about theme, text and Elizabethan diction. By Margy
Rochlin.
</P>
<P>
   NOTTING-HILL-FILM (Hollywood) _ Surveying the summer-movie
landscape, Universal studios had at first intended to open its
high-profile romance ``Notting Hill,'' starring Julia Roberts and
Hugh Grant, a month after the release, on May 19, of George Lucas's
``Star Wars: Episode One _ The Phantom Menace,'' one of the most
anticipated films in years. But then Universal executives sat down,
took a second look and decided on a more innovative, if riskier,
plan: move ``Notting Hill,'' which is about a Hollywood star and a
British bookshop owner who fall in love, right into the eye of the
storm. Now, it will open only one week after the new ``Star Wars,''
when frenzy over the science-fiction film is likely to be at a
peak. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-SELL (Undated) _ How quaint to recall the days when
doubting a movie's honesty meant wondering whether its hero was
standing on a box. Now there are more important things to question:
whether the box is virtual or real, and whether it contains
anything that the film might want to sell. With the growing
prevalence of the many-tentacled corporate concept known as
vertical integration, we've seen ever more ingenious ways to
undermine what appears on screen. Would-be hits on the summer
horizon offer an invitation to visit the Web site, buy the toys,
wear the T-shirt, hear the soundtrack and play the video game. Oh,
if there's time left over, see the movie too. By Janet Maslin.
</P>
<P>
   HUGH-GRANT-FILMS (London) _ Is Hugh Grant, 38, the very model of
a modern English gentleman? He certainly seemed that way in ``Four
Weddings and a Funeral,'' a hugely successful confection of a film
kept afloat, in large part, by his bachelor character's diffident
charm, self-deprecating wit and endearing sense of chronic personal
embarrassment. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   DEEP-BLUE-SEA-FILM (Hollywood) _ For ``Deep Blue Sea,'' the film
director Renny Harlin has assembled more than 300 tracks of
recorded sounds, so that an essentially noiseless sea creature can
chew through metal and flesh _ and, with any luck, the summer box
office after the film's July 30 release _ in deafening Dolby
digital. By Bruce Newman.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-SEQUELS (Undated) _ The days of the sequel are numbered. Or
rather, Roman numeraled. ``Lethal Weapon,'' the Mel Gibson vehicle
that went from zero to IV in 11 years, will have no '99 model.
Rocky Balboa's five-bout film career ended in 1990, after a savage
critical beating that left him, and moviegoers, with collateral
brain damage. Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose most famous film line
is, ``I'll be back,'' won't be: The Terminator's term limit was
two. Thank goodness, because the sequel and prequel have become
cinematic Nyquil, putting audiences to sleep with their metronomic
monotony. By Franz Lidz and Steve Rushin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PICKER-MUSIC (Undated) _ It was a signal moment in the rebirth
of tonality. When the curtain rose on Tobias Picker's first opera,
``Emmeline,'' in 1996, the orchestra conjured an atmosphere of grim
foreboding, circling endlessly around a single, brooding chord. As
if to emphasize his immersion in the dark realm of B flat minor,
Picker, 45, prefaced the score with a device long scorned by
modernists: a key signature. Picker's embrace of tonality, though
particularly unambiguous, is hardly unique. Today, it seems, every
composer is eager to be portrayed as a lapsed modernist, newly
liberated from the shackles of Serialism. On Friday evening, the
Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in New York offers the
premiere of Picker's Cello Suite, performed by the cellist Lynn
Harrell and the pianist Anne-Marie McDermott at Alice Tully Hall.
By K. Robert Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   REVUELTAS-MUSIC (Undated) _ In the calendar of saints, the last
day of the year belongs to St. Sylvester, and it was on that day in
the last year of the 1800s that the Mexican composer Silvestre
Revueltas was born. Now, several months before his centenary, Sony
Classical has released an exhilarating Revueltas album, with
Esa-Pekka Salonen conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic and its
New Music Group, and other new releases round out the picture. By
Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JUNKYARD-SCULPTOR (New York) _ Ms. Nancy Rubins, 46, a sculptor
who creates monumental works out of oversize junkyard debris is in
the Rolodex of certain suppliers of airplane parts. They call her
when something special comes in, like a dismembered fuselage, a
severed wing or a battered engine. For her show that opened
Saturday at the Paul Kasmin Gallery, Ms. Rubins has created an
extravagant aluminum-and-stainless-steel sculpture out of a few
thousand pounds of colorful airplane parts, as well as 600 pounds
of wire. By Elizabeth Hayt.
</P>
<P>
   MATRIX-FILM-ARCH (Undated) _ Despite fortune cookie dialogue and
a dubious Nietschean subtext, ``The Matrix'' is a film that
deserves to be a classic. It will certainly become one for those
who value the power of sci-fi movies to crystallize moments of
urban sensibility. ``Metropolis,'' ``Alphaville,'' ``The Tenth
Victim'' and ``Blade Runner'' are also classics of this genre. By
Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   SCULPTURE-FURNITURE (New York) _ The Public Art Fund, a
nonprofit organization that supports projects around New York, is
backing an independent curator Amy Wolf's, ``Comfort Zone:
Furniture by Artists,'' an engaging exhibition of sculpture that is
also furniture. The show remains on view at PaineWebber building
through June 25. The exhibit includes pieces designed by 36 artists
over the last 60 years. By Paula Dietz.

<P>
   TOP-40-RADIO (Los Angeles) _ ``American Top 40 With Casey
Kasem'' has been on the air, under slightly different titles but
with virtually the same format, for nearly 29 years. Currently, the
four-hour-long show, heard in most markets on Saturday or Sunday
morning, is broadcast on more than 350 stations nationwide and
heard at any one point in his show by an audience that averages
approximately 1.1 million listeners over age 12. By Andy Meisler.

HIGH COURT REBUFFS INDEPENDENT COUNSEL'S BRIBERY DEFINITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday unanimously rejected
the expansive legal theory behind an independent counsel's
prosecution of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy and of those
who bestowed favors on Espy.
</P>
<P>
   Simply giving gifts to a federal official, without any
demonstrated connection between the gifts and the official's
actions, does not violate the law against illegal gratuities, the
court ruled in a case involving a California agricultural
cooperative that was convicted under the gratuity law of giving
Espy tennis tickets, luggage and other gifts worth some $5,900.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the federal appeals court in Washington overturned
the conviction of Sun-Diamond Growers of California. The justices
Tuesday affirmed that decision in a ruling on an appeal brought by
Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz.
</P>
<P>
   Espy himself, who was acquitted by a federal jury in December,
no longer had a direct legal stake in the case. But coming less
than five months after the acquittal of the principal target of
Smaltz's four-year, $17 million effort, the court's pointed ruling
nonetheless had symbolic as well as practical importance, marking
an effective end to a high-profile investigation that was a
lightning rod for criticism of the independent counsel statute.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawyers on Smaltz's staff have left, and he announced
months ago that his work was largely complete after having
collected more than $12 million in fines, penalties and
restitution. Sun-Diamond itself remains convicted on other charges,
including mail fraud and illegal campaign contributions, that were
not part of the Supreme Court case.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's decision was more than a historical footnote. The
ambiguities in the gratuity statute, which dates to 1962, have
confused courts and prosecutors for years. Among those actively
interested in the court's interpretation of what it means to give,
offer, or promise ``anything of value'' to a public official were
lobbyists, who viewed the independent counsel's broad
interpretation as a threat to the normal conduct of their business.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Buffone, who filed a brief for the American League of
Lobbyists on Sun-Diamond's behalf, praised the court's decision in
an interview Tuesday and said that lobbyists would no longer ``have
to look over their shoulder at an aggressive independent counsel
who can pursue criminal prosecution in this politically sensitive
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffone noted that aside from the gratuity statute, ``there are
a lot of regulations out there,'' a fact that played an essential
role in Justice Antonin Scalia's opinion for the court. Scalia said
that in light of the numerous other laws and regulations
``littering this field,'' it was clear that Congress knew how to
write, and often had written, ``precisely targeted prohibitions''
involving gifts to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Given that reality, a statute in this field that
can linguistically be interpreted to be either a meat axe or a
scalpel should reasonably be taken to be the latter. Absent a text
that clearly requires it, we ought not expand this one piece of the
regulatory puzzle so dramatically as to make many other pieces
misfits.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the federal bribery statute, which requires proof of a
quid pro quo, the more open-ended gratuity statute prohibits the
gift or promise of ``anything of value'' to a public official ``for
or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such
public official.''
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of Sun-Diamond's trial in 1996, Judge Ricardo
Urbina of U.S. District Court in Washington accepted Smaltz's view
that the law did not require proof of a connection between the gift
and any specific act. It was enough to show that the cooperative
gave Espy gifts ``simply because he held public office'' or to
build a reservoir of good will, Urbina instructed the jury.
</P>
<P>
   In overturning Sun-Diamond's conviction, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the instructions
reflected an erroneous view of the law. ``The giver must intend
either to reward some past concrete official act or acts, or to
enhance the likelihood of some future act or acts,'' the appeals
court said.
</P>
<P>
   In the decision Tuesday, United States vs. Sun-Diamond, No.
98-131, the court agreed. Scalia said that the law's ``insistence
upon an `official act,' carefully defined, seems pregnant with the
requirement that some particular official act be identified and
proved.'' Although Sun-Diamond's members had interests in two
regulatory issues before the Agriculture Department, Justice Scalia
noted that the prosecutor made no effort to link the gifts to any
particular action that Sun-Diamond wanted to encourage or reward.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Smaltz's broad view would produce ``peculiar
results,'' like potentially criminalizing ``a high school
principal's gift of a school baseball cap to the secretary of
education, by reason of his office, on the occasion of the latter's
visit to the school.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling applies beyond the independent counsel context to the
government's general prosecutorial authority under the statute.
While Smaltz's office handled its own appeal, the Justice
Department filed a brief as a friend of the court, supporting his
position in most although not all respects. Under the department's
interpretation, the law would be violated by a gift motivated by
``the recipients capacity to exercise governmental power or
influence in the donor's favor,'' without requiring proof of
connection to a particular official act. The court Tuesday rejected
that formulation as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by his office Tuesday, Smaltz said he was
``disappointed that the court chose to adopt a rule governing the
gratuity statute that, in my view, allows too much latitude to
those who would attempt to buy governmental favor.'' However, he
said he was glad the court ``has now articulated a single,
understandable rule'' in place of the confusion that had previously
existed.

CONGRESS TO TAKE RARE VOTE ON DECLARING WAR, BUT IT'S EXPECTED TO
FAIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since World War II, Congress
will vote on a declaration of war Wednesday. But the showdown is
likely to bear little resemblance to the historic session after
Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by a maverick Republican, the House will take up a
simple, one-paragraph resolution declaring war on the government of
Yugoslavia. Although the vote comes five weeks after U.S. warplanes
began bombing the Balkan nation, no one expects it to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Even the resolution's sponsor, Rep. Tom Campbell of California,
plans to vote against it. But Campbell contends that Congress has a
constitutional obligation to take a stand on the commitment of U.S.
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at war in Kosovo. We're bombing now, and I believe it
won't be long before ground troops are sent in,'' he said. ``The
Constitution gives this decision to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell forced House action by invoking the War Powers Act, a
Vietnam-era law that was intended to give Congress more say over
the use of troops in conflicts that fall short of an all-out war.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring pleas from House leaders who had hoped to avoid the
issue, Campbell will also force a vote on an alternative resolution
directing President Clinton to end U.S. involvement in the NATO
bombing campaign. The withdrawal resolution is also expected to
fail because even some of Clinton's harshest critics are reluctant
to pull the plug on a military operation that is well under way.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, after weeks of criticizing Clinton's handling of
the conflict in Yugoslavia, the Republican-controlled House will,
in effect, endorse it. House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving,
said lawmakers have little choice now that U.S. forces are in the
air against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choices are too stark,'' Armey said of the declare-war or
get-out options. ``The president is commander in chief, and the
president, working with NATO, has made this commitment. We try to
be respectful of that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's critics do not want to take any step that gives
comfort to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Clinton's
supporters do not want to take the giant step of declaring war.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has declared war only five times in the nation's
history: the War of 1812 against Britain, the war with Mexico in
1846, the war with Spain in 1898 and World Wars I and II.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't ready to make a final statement at this point,''
said Rep. Martin Frost of Dallas, who presided over a closed-door
meeting of House Democrats on the topic late yesterday. ``It's
clear that the majority in Congress is willing to be patient and
give the military a chance to show what it can do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, lawmakers in both parties seem to agree that
Clinton should not use ground troops without congressional
permission. Armey predicted that Congress will approve a third
proposal Wednesday that would require Clinton to come to Congress
before resorting to ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has repeatedly said that he does not believe ground
troops will be needed to achieve his goal of ending Yugoslav
aggression against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The president also
opposes the declaration of war, arguing that it is unnecessary and
would only complicate the NATO effort.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, the last time Congress declared war, Franklin Roosevelt
rallied a stunned nation the day after Pearl Harbor with a speech
to Congress predicting that the sneak attack would ``live in
infamy.'' Minutes after the speech, the House and Senate approved a
war declaration with only one dissenting vote.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the issues are not nearly so clear-cut for most
members of Congress. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Ennis, said he may vote to
declare war even though he opposed the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I vote for it, it's not because I want to go to war. It's
because we are already bombing,'' he said. ``Now that we are
bombing, if we cannot stop it, we ought to at least acknowledge
that's what we're doing.''

   STANKOVIC I REFUGEE CAMP, Macedonia _ Those who want food by
noon know to be up well before dawn, for the bread lines have
become impossibly long. The wait is normally in the rain.
Latecomers seem to leave without milk and with only two bananas
instead of the usual four. The old plead with the young to save
them a spot and spare them the wearying ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Portable toilets were tried _ colorful booths that said Toi Toi
on the side with the first ``i'' dotted in the shape of a heart.
Refugees quit using them after a week when the sensory assault
became too foul to endure. They now go outdoors, standing over
holes cut into a wood platform. Privacy is provided by sheets of
plastic, though at night the Macedonian policemen seem to take
pleasure in watching female silhouettes lit up through the curtains
with a searchlight.
</P>
<P>
   Water is carried in plastic jugs from a few central spigots.
There are no metal pans. To heat the water, the jugs are placed
over a fire made with scraps of wood, but it is hard to get it warm
enough before the flames burn through the plastic and the water
pours out
</P>
<P>
   Tents come in beige or green in cone shapes, A-frames or
rectangles. Early on, they were put up with adequate space between
them, as in a Boy Scout campground. Now, they are crammed
side-by-side and the camp is a heaving metropolis of fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, 4,000 more Kosovo Albanian refugees arrived at the
Macedonian border, a spurt in an exodus that has brought 11,000
people in the past four days and, United Nations aid workers say,
158,000 in little more than a month. About 61,000 of the refugees
are living in tent cities, and the supply of people has once again
outstripped the supply of emergency shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have passed the breaking point,'' said Paula Ghedini,
spokeswoman for the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees. ``New arrivals will be sleeping in the open.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not a shortage of tents but a lack of allotted
space to put them. There are eight camps at present, and the
Macedonian government has approved land for only one more _ in
Cegrane, 45 miles west of Skopje, the capital. This new settlement
was supposed to be ready by Thursday, but there have been
infuriating delays in construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Macedonians gave the job to a local contractor,'' said Ron
Redmond, another refugee agency spokesman. ``These guys put in an
eight-hour day and then go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Several international aid groups are ready to finish the job
more rapidly, he said, but the government has so far stuck with its
choice for the work.
</P>
<P>
   Places like Stankovic, at the foot of the lush green mountains
northwest of Skopje, are overwhelmed. Nearly half of those residing
in the camps are here in this one, living an unsightly existence in
the incongruity of a beautiful location.
</P>
<P>
   Laundry is strung between virtually all the tents, though it is
hard to tell whether the clothes have been hung out for washing or
drying. While an April day in these mountains includes searing heat
and bracing cold, all temperatures seem to arrive with rain.
</P>
<P>
   Mud is attached to every shoe like plaster. ``I would give
anything to have a real bath,'' said Magribe Neziri, a teacher who
said she was chased from her village by the Serbs on April 17. ``I
am grateful for the camps, but I do have complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   She had spent six hours waiting to use one of the few
telephones. The line went dead just before her turn came. ``It
should not be so hard to get to a telephone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But these are irritations, not perils. Disease is at bay.
Medical care is available. No one is starving. This is not a camp
of putrefying corpses like those sheltering the refugees from
Rwanda after mass killings in 1994, or an assemblage of the
starving as in Ethiopia 10 years before that.
</P>
<P>
   Camp life is hard but hardly horrific. A society is taking shape
here _ a demonstration of both human flaws and fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   A woman fashioned a broom out of a leafy branch in order to
sweep the loose dirt off the hard dirt in front of her tent.
Children without toys found playful uses for plastic bottles and
carved hopscotch squares into the ground. Boys met girls and they
made love, paying a fee to an entrepreneur who has turned his tent
into a motel.
</P>
<P>
   Several refugees who had volunteered to help the aid agencies
have undertaken small businesses with donated goods. Some of them
proudly confessed their misdeeds if not their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are hiding the best food, these rascals,'' complained
Zemrije Bela, a woman from Kacanik waiting in a bread line in the
rain. ``I have heard that things are being brought into this camp
and we are not getting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other volunteers described with chagrin what goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them steal boxes of chocolates, cheese, bananas and
juice,'' said Ganc Broqi, a 20-year-old from Pec. ``Oh yes, and
blankets. These all can be sold or traded or given away. Some
people stockpile these items, just to have them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most sought-after thing is finding a way out of the
camp, usually available only to those with relatives already in the
country. There are other ways to depart, though they can be costly
for people who have fled their homes with few possessions. At least
one Macedonian garbage crew charges $80 for a ride out, one
employee said. And refugees say that some policemen charge $100.
</P>
<P>
   The camp is many things _ the smell of rotting orange peel,
teen-agers trying to play volleyball without a net, gray woolen
blankets used to carpet a floor, 200 women washing clothes by
taking turns among four faucets, shafts of light streaming in
through the flaps of the tents, a little boy who has stopped eating
out of fear.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a hothouse of hatred, the seeds of which have been
carried in from Kosovo. Refugees tell their stories to each other,
trading tragedies, cursing Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the troubles of people here are caused by the Serbs, who
are beasts,'' said Ibrahim Pllashniku of Pristina. ``Who else but
beasts come into your house, hold a knife to your throat and steal
your money?''
</P>
<P>
   Pllashniku's tribulations were made more difficult by the
paralysis his wife suffers in her legs and left arm. In the final
part of their journey to the border, he had to carry her for
several miles, then return to get her wheel chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot go to the bathroom by myself anymore,'' his elderly
wife whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Hamit Beqiri, a big, robust man and father of two, said he was
taken captive by Serbian soldiers, and they made him and 30 other
men build fortifications against NATO air raids. He escaped by
bribing three of the guards with most of his life savings
</P>
<P>
   ``Are Serbs good people?'' he asked his 5-year-old son, Egzon.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, confused, said, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who stole our money, burned our house and took our car?'' the
father asked impatiently.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Egzon was in tune. ``The filthy Serbs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what should you do if you meet a Serb like Slobodan
Milosevic?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will kill him,'' the boy said.

   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ The military commander of NATO
acknowledged Tuesday that five weeks of intensive bombing had
failed to reduce the size of the Serbian force in Kosovo or its
operations against Albanians there. Addressing a press briefing,
Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO commander, insisted that the bombing had
crippled the air defenses of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, and was gradually wearing away the resources Yugoslav

MCDONAGH'S GRUESOME COMEDY MAKES A SPLASH ON BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN WINN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The Lonesome West,'' a perverse battle of two Irish
Catholic brothers, made a fierce late entry Tuesday night into a
Broadway season filled with Irish and British imports. It's a
bleakly funny return to the boggy turf of playwright Martin
McDonagh's ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane.''
</P>
<P>
   The black comedy at the Lyceum Theatre joins fellow Irish native
Conor McPherson's ghost-haunted ``The Weir,'' British phenom
Patrick Marber's sex comedy ``Closer'' and senior statesman David
Hare's ruminative ``Amy's View'' as possible contenders for a 1999
Tony Award. Hare, for good measure, is performing ``Via Dolorosa,''
a monologue about the Middle East, on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lonesome West'' is situated firmly in the remote Irish village
of Leenane. Rain is so commonplace here it falls in great long
sheets through the second act and never gets mentioned. The
characters are too busy with their own private storms to notice.
</P>
<P>
   McDonagh turns his eye and faultless ear for insult on a pair of
consummate losers, Coleman and Valene Connor. They're played to
rank perfection by Maeliosa Stafford and Brian F. O'Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   One of the brothers has just killed their father, and it wasn't
an accident. Coleman didn't like what his dad said about his hair,
so he shot him. Valene has blackmailed his brother out of the
inheritance, which consists of the dreary cottage they share and
very little else.
</P>
<P>
   Father Welsh (David Ganly) is the brothers' hopeless spiritual
keeper. ``God has no jurisdiction in this parish,'' he laments,
between belts of home-distilled spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Despair is like the rain, unrelenting, and McDonagh is merciless
about the Catholic church's failure to relieve it. The brothers'
violent slapstick curdles into a parody of confession and
absolution in the second act. It's a Laurel and Hardy routine run
wildly, theologically amok. Father Welsh is the sacrificial lamb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lonesome West'' lacks the devilish flair for plot the
playwright flashed in ``Beauty Queen.'' But it does have some
hilarious dialogue, a more deeply subversive outlook and
distinctive McDonagh devices from the earlier play, including a
crucial letter and a gruesome hand-scalding scene. This one,
fittingly, involves a pot of molten plastic saints. The church is
in dangerous meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Hynes directed, with the same appetite for humor and shock
she brought to ``Beauty Queen.'' Hynes and two excellent Broadway
casts have helped make Leenane the unforgettable Irish capital of
family murder.

COURT WEIGHS WHO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DISABLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court struggled Tuesday with the
unsettled issue of whether a law protecting disabled workers from
discrimination also covers someone whose physical problem is kept
in check through medication.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the first of three this week being considered by the
court that will eventually define who is protected under the 1990
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): the severely disabled, or
millions more who take medicine or use contact lenses, hearing aids
and other medical aids that allow them to lead normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   The law forbids job discrimination against ``a qualified
individual with a disability.'' It defines disability as a
``physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or
more major life activities.'' It includes among the disabled those
``regarded as having such an impairment.''
</P>
<P>
   The law has been used for removing physical barriers in public
places and for opening job opportunities to people with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply, my client has a disability, and he was fired
because of it,'' said Stephen McAllister, representing a mechanic
named Vaughn Murphy, who was dismissed from his job for medical
reasons because of high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   With medication, Murphy is able to reduce his blood pressure
from a dangerous 260/160 to 186/124.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1994, Murphy began working for United Parcel Service
in Topeka, Kan., and was required to drive to different locations
to work on trucks. A month later, a nurse noticed on his medical
chart that Murphy's blood pressure was too high under Department of
Transportation regulations, which requires commercial truck drivers
to have blood pressures below 160/90. UPS fired him, saying his
condition made him unfit to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming his high blood pressure constituted a disability,
Murphy sued UPS under the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   Although a federal district court and appeals court rejected
Murphy's suit, other lower federal courts have accepted similar
claims, giving the Supreme Court an impetus to clarify the scope of
the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   Congress did not list the precise conditions or diseases meant
to be covered by the act. Also left ambiguous was whether a person
would be covered by the law before or after medication or other
corrective measures, such as eyeglasses, were taken into account.
Those issues helped trigger a flood of lawsuits involving the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   McAllister urged the justices to rule that the effects of
medication should not be considered when deciding whether a
person's medical condition qualifies as a disability.
</P>
<P>
   But his position drew a number harsh responses from several
justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we accept your argument, why shouldn't we look at it as if
every person who needs glasses to see is disabled?'' Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor asked.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 152 million Americans are nearsighted enough to
need glasses, according to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   McAllister said that these people should be considered disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia retorted, ``It's very comforting to think
that most Americans can claim a disability ... (but) it just
doesn't square with what Congress intended with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer told McAllister that if his argument is
accepted, ``I don't see how to get (the ADA) to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department attorney James A. Feldman joined McAllister,
arguing that medication and medical aids, such as glasses, should
not be considered when deciding whether a person has a disability.
</P>
<P>
   But UPS lawyer William Kilberg said that Congress meant for the
law to include the use of medication and protect those using it but
still suffering serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress was looking at epilepsy, diabetes and other
conditions that require medication but that still leave
difficulties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kilberg said the only reason UPS fired Murphy in 1994 was that
his blood pressure exceeded federal regulations for drivers.
``There is simply no evidence that UPS ever regarded Mr. Murphy as
disabled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing with Kilberg's argument, Scalia added, ``It's hard to
understand how UPS is at fault for following the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The other ADA cases, to be heard on Wednesday, were brought by:
</P>
<P>
   _ Karen Sutton and Kimberly Hinton, twins licensed as pilots in
Colorado for commuter airlines who sought to apply for jobs with
United Airlines but were rebuffed because they are very
near-sighted and were unable to meet United's requirement for
uncorrected vision of at least 20/100.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hallie Kirkingburg, an Oregon truck driver who was fired when
his employer, supermarket chain Albertson's, discovered that he is
legally blind in one eye. He argues he has an unblemished 20-year
driving record and that his brain has learned to compensate for his
vision deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Employers have won 92 percent of the 700 ADA cases resolved in
court from 1992 to 1997, according to a study by the American Bar
Association. But now many employers fear that if the workers win in
the current Supreme Court cases, another slew of lawsuits will
follow.

ROBERTS RETURN TAKES HIM TO 'CANES LEADERSHIP ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He's vague about the date. Why would he want to
remember it, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 1994, I think,'' said Gary Roberts. ``Or was it '93? It
might have been '92.''
</P>
<P>
   The details are another matter. They're indelibly etched in his
mind, like the surgical scars on his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Rouse in Toronto hit me from behind,'' said Roberts. ``I
had just dumped the puck in and was headed to the bench for a line
change. That started it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. Actually, it merely brought to Roberts's
horrified attention a degenerative condition known as foraminal
stenosis. It's a constricting of the nerves in the neck that
eventually can cause muscles to atrophy and severely limit arm
movement _ a rather dire impediment for a certified NHL sniper who
had produced 50- and 40-goal seasons with the Calgary Flames. The
condition wound up hounding Roberts into retirement, an ordeal he
somehow overcame by getting a second hockey life with the Carolina
Hurricanes, for whom he has proven an inspiring force in this
Eastern Conference quarterfinal series against the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rouse is not the villain of the piece. The damage to
Roberts's neck was the cumulative result of years of abuse, the
punishing hits that are the price an NHL goal scorer pays. But that
hit remains a handy reference point, and Roberts never will forget
the feeling _ the lack of it, actually _ that night in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to cut the uniform off me,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He mentions this as a matter of fact, but it also could serve as
a metaphor for his lingering miseries. Roberts is a fitness zealot,
as his coach, Paul Maurice, reverently attests: ``What can you say
about Gary Roberts and his work ethic that a man can go that hard
all the time? You can see the work he puts in in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   But that fanatic desire never to shed the uniform ultimately
betrayed Roberts. To relieve the condition, he underwent operations
on both sides of his neck, surgeries he considers successful _
except that the patient didn't recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing for it is rest,'' said Roberts. ``But you know
how it is _ you end the season, you start preparing for the next
one, then you're back playing. I never really gave it time to heal.
I tried to come back to play 12 weeks after both surgeries, which
was the dumbest thing I could do and the dumbest thing the Calgary
Flames could have let me do.''
</P>
<P>
   So the symptoms, and the consequences, persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burners,'' said Roberts, who has become a reluctant expert
both in technical and layman's language involving the neck.
``Football players get them. The problem for me was that they'd
last three or four minutes at a time and go all the way down my
arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Which rendered the arms useless for alarming stretches. It
reached the point where Roberts would raise an arm to shoulder
level _ and watch it flop lifelessly to his side. By the 1994
playoffs, a seven-game series against Vancouver, Roberts was
wearing a neck collar and his wife had to cut his food. She
expressed wonder _ and concern _ that he could continue to play
with such a condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her they said it wouldn't get any worse,'' said
Roberts. ``Of course, they didn't tell me it wouldn't get any
better.''
</P>
<P>
   By June 1996, after having played only eight and 35 games the
previous two seasons, Roberts finally got the message. Just turned
30, the left wing announced his retirement, realizing that his
problem no longer involved merely controlling a wrist shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to lead a normal life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He got a bonus. Five months after he quit hockey, a friend put
him in touch with Michael Leahy, a Colorado Springs chiropractor
who advocated a treatment called active release technique that
involved tearing down scar tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a week,'' said Roberts, ``I was feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   There was still much room for improvement, and a physical
therapist associated with Leahy, Charles Poliquin, provided it by
making Roberts his personal project.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked with me every day from Nov. 21 to Sept. 1 the next
year,'' said Roberts. ``He taught me how to train, how to eat
properly, everything. He basically took a year out of his life to
work with me in Phoenix. I had decided to hide out there because I
figured everyone would have known if I was rehabbing in Calgary.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, Roberts remembers, there was a feeling in his
spine he hadn't experienced since before the Rouse hit _ shivers of
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the gym one day,'' said Roberts, ``and Charles said
to me, `You know what? You're going to play again.' It was
unbelievable to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, he returned to the ice that September when training
camp opened. But not in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was best to make a change,'' said Roberts. ``In Calgary,
there would have been the extreme pressure of everyone asking,
`How's the neck?' every day.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 26, 1997, the Hurricanes took a flier, acquiring Roberts
and Trevor Kidd from the Flames for Andrew Cassels and
Jean-Sebastien Giguere. Roberts has been a fixture in the Carolina
lineup since. And Monday night at the FleetCenter, he capped his
comeback by scoring his first playoff goal in five years, launching
the Hurricanes toward a 3-2 victory and a 2-1 advantage in the
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really exciting to come back like that, to be back in the
Stanley Cup playoffs,'' said Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   His goal was no artistic triumph, but Roberts wasn't being
fussy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a pass to (Jeff) O'Neill and followed it up,'' he said.
``I saw the puck between (Dmitri) Khristich's legs and just whacked
at it. When I saw it on (Byron) Dafoe's chest, I knew it was in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those lucky bounces. I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can quibble? He's entitled to one by now.

BRUINS LOSING THE FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Yes, indeed. The Bruins are down, two games to one.
It's in the books.
</P>
<P>
   They coulda/shoulda lost Game 1, but they didn't. They
coulda/shoulda won Game 2, but they didn't. They coulda/shoulda won
Game 3, but they didn't. There is no deep, dark mystery involved in
all this, but that doesn't mean people aren't looking for one.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the boos that accompanied them as they skated off the
ice at the conclusion of Monday night's game, I'd say some of the
fans are panicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the media, too,'' chuckles Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   With us, Byron, it's not so much panic as a desperate need to
find The Answer. It can't be anything as simple as the fact that
these are two reasonably equal hockey teams and sometimes you win
and sometimes you lose, can it?
</P>
<P>
   Um, maybe. At any rate, players have to leave the panicking to
the fans and media. Being down, 2-1, is a problem, not a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stay calm,'' Dafoe points out. ``If there were 20
panicking guys here in this dressing room, they'd all be flying
around hitting somebody and being out of control. We've lost two
games by one goal. Obviously, whatever we're doing, it isn't
enough. We've got to step it up, yes. But we can't panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, in case you haven't heard, is the goalie on this outfit.
He is as much individually responsible for the Bruins even being in
the playoffs as anyone in the room. I'm not as big a Most Valuable
(i.e. Indispensable) Player guy as I am a Player of the Year (i.e.
who simply played the best, regardless of surrounding
circumstances, such as a quality backup, and team placement, etc.)
guy, but on the basis of what-if-he-weren't-there? value to his
team, Dafoe was a serious MVP candidate. He had 10 shutouts. He was
immense down the stretch, as the Bruins went from thinking about
those early tee times to a sixth-place finish in the East.
</P>
<P>
   And right now Dafoe can hardly catch a break. He's not crying
about it or anything. That's my job. And I'm more than happy to
point out that the Puck God, or whoever, is currently doing some
nasty stuff to Mr. Byron Dafoe. I mean, Ray Sheppard's OT
game-winner in Game 2 came while Dafoe was kissing the ice after a
scramble. And then there were goals 1 and 3 in Monday's setback.
You can't say they actually were scored as much as they somehow
materialized. Not that the second goal was a hockey Rembrandt,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pass hit Hal Gill's stick and went right to Sheppard,'' says
Dafoe. I'll fill in the rest: the right side of the goal was open.
Sheppard didn't miss. He could have. Guys do it all the time,
generally on teams you root for and often in OT. But Sheppard
didn't, because he is a hot man now and Dafoe isn't.
</P>
<P>
   No one respects the ebb and flow of good fortune more than the
goalkeeper. Even Dominic Hasek, playing in Nagano for the
fatherland, needed some luck now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' maintains Dafoe. ``When you're going well, a
puck will hit the post when you need it, or it will hit you and you
don't even know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins easily could be down, 3-0, right now if Dafoe had not
been Haseklike in the opening minutes of Game 1 in Greensboro.
Carolina came on like, well, a hurricane, as soon as the puck was
dropped, storming the net and putting Dafoe to a supreme test. The
crowd, as Dafoe himself put it, sounded like 25,000. It was a big
moment, all right, and Dafoe came up huge. Did he use up all his
good karma, right then and there? Who knows? Surely not Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   What he does know is that the post isn't necessarily his very
best friend any more and that he was beaten in Game 3 by, and I
quote, ``three freaky goals,'' one of which took place 65 ticks
into the game. That alone might have unnerved a less mature goalie.
But Dafoe hung in there and was actually sitting on a 2-1 lead in
the middle of the second period before the Hurricanes made a few
things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Dafoe isn't running around tugging the sleeves of those
toting notebooks, tape recorders, and cameras begging for sympathy
in his time of need. He's just a polite guy answering some
questions. If anything, we're all making things unnecessarily tense
for him by planting some bad thoughts in his head. He's been around
long enough to understand that a game is a game and a streak of
luck is a streak of luck (good or bad) and a series is something
else entirely. It really isn't over until it's over, and please
remember that this is the only league in which someone (two
someones, in fact) actually has come all the way back from an 0-3
series deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a seven-game series,'' reminds Dafoe. ``Over the course
of seven games, many things can happen. If we go out ... and play
our game and get a break or two, it will be 2-2. We can't put too
much pressure on ourselves, but we do have to play with a sense of
urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, yeah, that does sound cliche, but that happens to be
the truth. Nothing has happened in this series to make the Boston
Bruins lose faith in themselves, just as nothing has happened that
suddenly makes the Carolina Hurricanes into the 1959 Canadiens or
1981 Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Hurricanes a technical problem for the Bruins? Yup. They
are big and they have a frustrating way of forechecking
relentlessly while being able to tend to business in their own end.
There are a lot of experienced guys on that team. They are in front
because they deserve to be. Luck is, always has been, and always
will be, a part of this game. Let's remember that all this luck
took place in front of the Boston net, not at center ice.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hurricanes are still a team that finished the regular
season with 5 fewer points than the Bruins. We are talking about
two half-decent, just OK hockey clubs; nothing more, nothing less.
If all the technicalities cancel each other out, then luck just
might be the determining factor in any one game. But then there's
luck, and there is, shall we say, forced luck born of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make your own luck.'' Who said that? Who didn't?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no secrets.'' Who's been saying that? Pat Burns;
that's who.
</P>
<P>
   And there aren't. So drop the puck. As Dirty Harry might say,
we'll see who's feeling lucky tonight.

 &HT;    HOUSE TO CONSIDER WAR POWERS, GROUND TROOP AUTHORITY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington, (i) international categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. House of Representatives, which has stood
on the sidelines for more than a month of an intense air war, will
be forced Wednesday to take a formal position on the fighting in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., the lawmakers
are to vote, under the War Powers Act, whether to order a
withdrawal of American forces from hostilities, or make a formal
declaration of war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Neither proposal is expected to pass, but the Campbell
resolutions have prodded a reluctant Republican leadership to allow
a formal debate on the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, GOP leaders have assigned both the responsibility and
any potential blame for the conflict to President Clinton, while
promising to support the troops with emergency funds. House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., Tuesday
proposed $13 billion for the Balkan conflict, more than double
Clinton's request.
</P>
<P>
   For Wednesday's debate, House leaders have staked out a middle
ground that would neither challenge the war nor give it their stamp
of approval. Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., and Rep. Bill Goodling,
R-Pa., are sponsoring a bill that would require the president to
seek approval from Congress before ordering a ground offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and his advisers began this war on their own,
and have conducted it for the last month without the involvement of
Congress,'' Fowler said. ``It would be an abuse of his office and
show a total lack of regard for the Constitution for the president
to escalate this war with the introduction of U.S. ground forces
without the express approval of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   She gave her remarks even as the president was authorizing the
Pentagon to call up 33,102 reservists either to assist in the
Balkans or shore up U.S. forces that have been stretched thin
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Fowler led an unsuccessful effort to bar the use of
U.S. ground troops as part of any NATO operations in Yugoslavia,
even as peace keepers in Kosovo. Her toned-down proposal Wednesday
has stronger backing, including that of House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, who predicted it would pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that will be controversial,'' Armey said, noting
that Clinton has said he would not use ground troops in the Balkan
hostilities and that he would take the proposal to Congress if he
changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the House prepared to take up the Balkan conflict,
Republican leaders continued to keep their distance from
decision-making on the war.

   ``The president has had a kind of a record of presenting us with
fait accompli,'' Armey said. ``He gets troops in there. He gets the
air war on and then comes back and briefs us ... We're stuck,'' he
complained, repeating a refrain of Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Tuesday that he
would consider a follow-up debate after the House vote. But Lott
has consistently said he opposes a ``divisive debate that could
give aid and comfort'' to Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said he hoped the House debate would be ``professional and
cordial.''
</P>
<P>
   On paying for the war, House and Senate leaders have promised to
complete a supplemental spending bill by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Young's bill includes $11 billion for the Pentagon, more than
double the amount Clinton sought, plus funds for NATO construction,
diplomatic installations, and disaster assistance in the Balkan
region.
</P>
<P>
   Because the money would be designated ``emergency,'' the
spending would not be required to fit under the budget spending
limits. It would come entirely from the ``surplus'' from this
year's Social Security tax collections, despite promises from
lawmakers and the White House to reserve those funds.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said he did not know if
Clinton would veto such a the spending bill and seek one closer to
his $6 billion original request.

 &HT;    HOUSE TO CONSIDER WAR POWERS, GROUND TROOP AUTHORITY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington, (i) international categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. House of Representatives, which has stood
on the sidelines for more than a month of an intense air war, will
be forced Wednesday to take a formal position on the fighting in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., the lawmakers
are to vote, under the War Powers Act, whether to order a
withdrawal of American forces from hostilities, or make a formal
declaration of war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Neither proposal is expected to pass, but the Campbell
resolutions have prodded a reluctant Republican leadership to allow
a formal debate on the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, GOP leaders have assigned both the responsibility and
any potential blame for the conflict to President Clinton, while
promising to support the troops with emergency funds. House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., Tuesday
proposed $13 billion for the Balkan conflict, more than double
Clinton's request.
</P>
<P>
   For Wednesday's debate, House leaders have staked out a middle
ground that would neither challenge the war nor give it their stamp
of approval. Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., and Rep. Bill Goodling,
R-Pa., are sponsoring a bill that would require the president to
seek approval from Congress before ordering a ground offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and his advisers began this war on their own,
and have conducted it for the last month without the involvement of
Congress,'' Fowler said. ``It would be an abuse of his office and
show a total lack of regard for the Constitution for the president
to escalate this war with the introduction of U.S. ground forces
without the express approval of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   She gave her remarks even as the president was authorizing the
Pentagon to call up 33,102 reservists either to assist in the
Balkans or shore up U.S. forces that have been stretched thin
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Fowler led an unsuccessful effort to bar the use of
U.S. ground troops as part of any NATO operations in Yugoslavia,
even as peace keepers in Kosovo. Her toned-down proposal Wednesday
has stronger backing, including that of House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, who predicted it would pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that will be controversial,'' Armey said, noting
that Clinton has said he would not use ground troops in the Balkan
hostilities and that he would take the proposal to Congress if he
changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the House prepared to take up the Balkan conflict,
Republican leaders continued to keep their distance from
decision-making on the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has had a kind of a record of presenting us with
fait accompli,'' Armey said. ``He gets troops in there. He gets the
air war on and then comes back and briefs us ... We're stuck,'' he
complained, repeating a refrain of Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Tuesday that he
would consider a follow-up debate after the House vote. But Lott
has consistently said he opposes a ``divisive debate that could
give aid and comfort'' to Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said he hoped the House debate would be ``professional and
cordial.''

NATO COMMANDER SAYS BOMBINGS HAVE NOT REDUCED SERBIAN OPERATION IN
KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-TROOPS, KOSOVO-RUSSIA) 
(mb) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The military commander of NATO acknowledged
on Tuesday that five weeks of intensive allied bombing had failed
to reduce the size of the Serbian force in Kosovo or its operations
against Albanians there.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a press briefing, Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO commander,
insisted that the bombing had crippled the air defenses of the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and was gradually wearing
away what Serb army and police forces needed to carry on their
attacks. But Clark said persistently unfavorable weather conditions
had kept the bombing from having full effect on the Serb forces on
the ground in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bringing in reinforcements continually,'' Clark said of
Milosevic. ``If you actually added up what's there on any given
day, you might actually find out that he's strengthened his forces
in there. And that's going to be a phenomenon until we can further
cut the lines of supply and go more intensively against his
forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The briefing seemed to underscore the limitations of the allied
strategy, reaffirmed at last weekend's NATO summit meeting in
Washington, of using bombs but not ground troops to try to stop a
sweeping ``ethnic cleansing'' operation by Milosevic's Yugoslav
army, police and irregular paramilitary forces on the ground in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said these forces usually numbered around 40,000, about as
many as there were before the bombing started.
</P>
<P>
   Since the allies started the bombing on March 24, Clark said,
the Serb forces have driven 700,000 ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo
and left another 820,000 homeless inside their own country. And the
Serbs show no signs of stopping their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been reinforced in the last three or four days by an
influx of newly mobilized reservists to replace combat casualties,
and they've also been reinforced by the continuing assistance and
movement of elements of the Yugoslav 2nd Army, which is based in
Montenegro and has been fighting from across the border,'' the
general said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are systematically taking apart President Milosevic's
structure and power,'' Clark said. ``I can't give you a prediction
on how long he's going to endure this kind of punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the punishment the allies are meting out has been mitigated
by bad weather that have forced the allies to cancel more than 50
percent of all planned bombing missions on 20 of the 35 days since
the air campaign started last month.
</P>
<P>
   As the weather clears, Clark said, the attacks will be stepped
up. ``It's been only a fraction of what is to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming more success in attacking strategic targets that
underpin Milosevic's hold on power through the army and police
forces, Clark said that 4,423 bombing missions so far had rendered
Yugoslav air defenses ``ineffective,'' with more than 70 aircraft
destroyed and 25 percent to 40 percent of Yugoslav surface to air
missile batteries destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather has not kept the allies from attacking large fixed
targets, like the television tower on top of the 23-story
headquarters building of Milosevic's Socialist Party in Belgrade
that finally crumpled on Tuesday after the second air attack in a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has it kept them from launching guided missiles and guided
bombs against roads and bridges the Serbian army and police need to
move around the country, like the bridge across the Danube River at
Backa Palanka that Clark said had also been destroyed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the general said that the military communications network
had so many built-in redundancies that it had suffered only
``moderate to severe damage'' so far.
</P>
<P>
   And though allied bombing had destroyed virtually all of
Yugoslavia's ability to refine raw petroleum, Clark said, military
analysts believed that the air campaign had so far managed to
destroy only about a third of the army's military fuel reserves.
</P>
<P>
   To choke the flow of fuel even further, the alliance's military
authorities submitted detailed plans to NATO's political
decision-makers on Tuesday as to how allied warships would enforce
an embargo on oil and fuel deliveries by ship to Yugoslav ports in
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Allied defense ministers in Washington commissioned plans last
weekend for what they called a ``visit and search regime'' that
would allow allied navy ships to intercept and interrogate merchant
vessels bound for Bar and other Montenegrin ports about what they
were carrying.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 European Union countries called on European oil companies
last week to halt all oil deliveries to Yugoslavia, but in the
absence of a U.N. Security Council embargo, some allies,
principally France, do not see how NATO can impose a blockade on
all such shipments from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any visit and search regime, of course, has to have the
appropriate rules of engagement to be able to use the threat of
force,'' Clark said on Tuesday. ``It has to be an enforcement
regime. This will be, if it's approved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But whether France and the other allies would approve was not a
foregone conclusion on Tuesday, according to Western diplomats. One
said that France was also concerned about the effects of crippling
or cutting off the principal port of Montenegro, which, though it
is part of Yugoslavia, has distanced itself from Milosevic and his
actions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For Clark, the main thing was to stop what he said were as many
as 16 oil tankers a day offloading fuel and other supplies in Bar
around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be an effort to make it a cooperative
regime,'' he said. ``We're going to encourage shippers to contact
us for pre-clearance, but essentially a naval regime like this is
precisely what it suggests. We intend with any authority granted to
us to stop the onward flow of oil to Serbia.''

BRUINS NEED TO   CAPITALIZE ON THEIR CHANCES, BURNS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As bad as things might be, and as bad at they could
become, the Bruins haven't been all that bad in the first three
games of the playoffs. They're in trouble, because two losses in a
seven-game series allow little room for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, and we broke down the tape _ it's right there on
the tape _ we outchanced them,'' said Boston coach Pat Burns
following a tale-of-the-VHS review of Monday night's 3-2 loss to
the Hurricanes at the Vault. ``And you may laugh at this, but we
also outhit them.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's gone wrong? Why are the Bruins in a 2-1 hole again,
standing two hours from elimination, in the opening round of the
postseason? What must they do better in Game 4 Wednesday when the
series resumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finish,'' said Burns. ``We get there. We get our chances. We
even get more chances than they do. But the problem is, we don't do
anything with those chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Finish can be a fateful thing. Ask a contractor to build you a
house, and it's no home if he forgets to build the front steps or
shingle the roof. In hockey, teams can take pride in passing,
shooting, puck possession, winning all the fights (nothing but
shoving matches in these three games), and dishing out the most
checks, but all that really matters is who gets the puck in the net
most often. Everything else is just a stocking stuffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do more of our game,'' said winger Rob DiMaio,
among the most reliable and effective Bruins forwards in the
series. ``Our game is to get the puck behind their defense and
create off that. We've got some big, strong guys and we should be
able to do it. Our game's not tic-tac-toe passing. It's bang,
grind, and get to the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it Carolina's design to pass the puck around and shoot
off the rush like the mid-'80s EuroOilers come back to life. In
fact, their game is even less refined than Boston's, not that style
matters, of course. They have set and carried the tone for the
series with an up-tempo forechecking game _ something Rick Pitino
would relish _ and haven't been overly concerned with how they
attack the net. Many, if not most, of their shots just kind of
happen, after enough mashing in the corners and bumping behind the
net produces an opportunity. Their goals don't come as a product of
X's and O's, but rather through a large dollop of effort and a
pinch of serendipity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be a little quicker on the puck,'' mulled Burns,
``and we have to get some breaks. It seems every time we're in
position to get the puck, there are three red sweaters on us.''
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, the Boston defensemen have done an admirable
job of dealing with that red tidal wave. Don Sweeney has been
especially effective, his game taking a giant step forward in the
postseason. The blue line corps lost Dave Ellett (strained neck and
back) in the early going Monday night and Burns did an effective
job of rotating his five backliners and keeping the score close
down to the last seconds. It could have been far worse. Wednesday,
Mattias Timander will move in for the injured Ellett.
</P>
<P>
   As for the forwards, and the need to get them to finish their
chances, Burns will roll out his same struggling dozen and hope for
different results. He will not pull the exasperatingly ineffective
Dmitri Khristich in favor of either of his spare forwards, Cameron
Mann or Ken Baumgartner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that going to make us a better team?'' was Burns's
rhetorical answer to a question about making any changes up front.
``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Khristich, with one shot in three games, barely got on the ice
in the latter stages of Game 3. He is not the sole disappointment
up front, but he is the most obvious, because his accurate, searing
shot is the kind of touch and finish the Bruins so desperately
need. Steve Heinze, Anson Carter, and, to a lesser extent Sergei
Samsonov, all have been in a funk around the net. But it's
Khristich, who between shifts can be spotted on the bench with
shoulders hunkered and head down, who is so profoundly out of sync.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I do?'' offered Burns. ``I've got to keep him in
there and just hope he gets it going.''
</P>
<P>
   On the upside of the offense, the Bruins have seen marked
improvement in both Ken Belanger and Landon Wilson, both of whom
have played their best hockey of their careers over the last three
games. If Belanger and Wilson keep crashing and some of their
fellow forwards find their hands, then the series easily could be
knotted Wednesday. Don't forget, too, that netminder Byron Dafoe
had a league-high 10 shutouts in 1998-99. He could blank the 'Canes
and the mood in the Boston dressing room takes a dramatic upswing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, we have to play now with a sense of urgency, and
that includes me,'' said Dafoe. ``Our backs aren't completely
against the wall, but we are getting pushed in there.''
</P>
<P>
   While the players showered and dressed after the workout,
assistant coach Jacques Laperriere, master of the minute detail,
sat stoically, almost hypnotized, in the coaches' office and rolled
through video of the series. Lappy, as everyone calls him, clicked
back and forth on the VCR, scrutinizing each frame as if it were
forensic evidence. He occasionally called a player in for a brief,
private chat, the way a professor would review a term paper with a
student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to find something,'' said Burns's loyal partner. ``I
find the positive and show that to them.''
</P>
<P>
   As bad as things might be . . .

HIGH COURT MULLS DEFINITION OF DISABILITY UNDER ANTI-BIAS LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: segment on casinos at end of article) 
(bl) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court began grappling Tuesday with the
definition of disability, in the first of three cases that raise
the question of whether a person who can restore normal functioning
by taking a daily pill, wearing glasses or even strapping on an
artificial limb can be considered disabled, and therefore protected
against discrimination on that account, under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The lively argument Tuesday, to be followed by two more
Wednesday, found the justices deeply engaged and also quite visibly
confused by their encounter with the far-reaching but vaguely
worded Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. ``I don't see how
to get this statute to work,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer said at
one point to a lawyer representing a truck mechanic whose high
blood pressure, although controlled by medication, led to his
dismissal by United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court in Denver ruled last year that because
conditions claimed as disabilities should be viewed in their
corrected or medicated state, the mechanic, Vaughn Murphy, was not
disabled and was not entitled to sue under the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to say, `You're right, your client is disabled,' is
it then necessary to say that everyone who uses false teeth or
glasses is disabled, or is there a way of drawing a line?'' Breyer
wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, removing his glasses and waving them in
the air, observed that ``I couldn't do my current job without
them.'' He continued: ``I guess it's nice if a majority of
Americans can claim the benefit of the law. It's comforting. But it
doesn't square with what Congress seemed to be talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Murphy's lawyer, Stephen McAllister, and James Feldman, an
assistant solicitor general also arguing for the mechanic on behalf
of the government, said that Congress intended disabilities to be
considered in their ``unmitigated'' state. There was considerable
debate in the courtroom about whether this view, or the employer's
contrary view that correction must be taken into account, fit more
clearly with the preamble to the 1990 law, in which Congress
referred to 43 million Americans with physical or mental
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Several justices observed that counting every nearsighted or
hypertensive person would produce a figure much higher than 43
million, meaning that Congress could not have intended that
approach. But Feldman said that under the employer's view, the
number would be much smaller than 43 million.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter asked UPS lawyer William Kilberg why, in
light of the law's ambiguity, the court should not follow its usual
practice and defer to the government's view as a ``tie breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilberg said that in his view, it was clear that Congress was
concerned with the ``functional limitations'' actually imposed by
disabilities, which should therefore be assessed in their treated
or corrected state.
</P>
<P>
   The law provides several alternative definitions of a
disability, including an ``impairment that substantially limits one
or more of the major life activities'' and ``being regarded as
having such an impairment.'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor suggested
that the ``regarded as'' definition, which she described as dealing
with ``mistaken beliefs about a person's ability,'' offered the
best fit for Murphy's case.
</P>
<P>
   The court has not yet interpreted the ``regarded as'' portion of
the disability act, and the justices' interest in it Tuesday
indicated that this case, Murphy vs. United Parcel Service, No.
97-1992, could become their means for doing so. The justices also
referred many times Tuesday to the cases they will hear Wednesday,
both of which involve employees with vision impairments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, hearing arguments in a challenge to a federal
ban on broadcast advertisements by gambling casinos, the justices
expressed considerable doubt about whether the current version of
the 65-year-old law can withstand First Amendment scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   What was once a broad prohibition against broadcast advertising
for gambling now has exceptions for state-run lotteries and for
casinos owned by Indian tribes. Bruce Ennis, arguing for a group of
New Orleans broadcasters who are challenging the law, said it was
``so riddled with exceptions that it cannot materially advance the
government's asserted interests'' in reducing the social costs of
gambling and helping states without casinos to shield their
residents from exposure to them.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Greater New Orleans Broadcasting vs. United States,
No. 98-387, has attracted considerable attention for the
constitutional light a decision might shed on government efforts to
limit advertising about other lawful activities, such as smoking.
The justices did not appear to be pressing toward a broad ruling,
however, instead peppering Ennis and the government's lawyer,
Deputy Solicitor General Barbara Underwood, with specific questions
about the numbers and locations of Indian and non-Indian casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Several justices said they were uneasy about a law that
permitted Indians to speak, by means of advertising, when others
could not. ``Is it permissible for Congress to favor a particular
group through its speech statutes?'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
asked Ms. Underwood, adding: ``Can it use speech as a element of
political largesse?''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said that viewed from another perspective, the
distinction was not between speakers but between subjects. Anyone
can advertise Indian-owned casinos and no one can advertise
non-Indian casinos, Scalia said, adding: ``I can't and the Indians
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And rich and poor can sleep under bridges,'' Souter commented.

AL HIRT, 76, JAZZ TRUMPETER WHO SYMBOLIZED NEW ORLEANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Hirt, the portly Dixieland jazz trumpeter who was a symbol of
the exuberant laissez-faire way of life of New Orleans, died
Tuesday at home in New Orleans. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Hirt had been hospitalized until last week at East Jefferson
General Hospital in Metairie, La., with liver ailments, said his
personal assistant, Peggy Stegman. He had used a wheelchair for the
last year because of edema in his leg, she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's most recognizable performers in the 1960s,
Hirt, recorded 55 albums in his career and won a Grammy award in
1963 for the song ``Java.''
</P>
<P>
   Genial, bearded, sometimes topping 300 pounds and known to some
friends as Jumbo, Hirt was a ubiquitous figure in his home town. He
had roles in several motion pictures, was a minority owner in the
city's Saints football team and ran a popular club on Bourbon
Street in the city's French Quarter for 22 years; it closed in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's part of New Orleans, like Louis Armstrong,'' said the
clarinetist Pete Fountain, a fellow New Orleans resident who knew
and played with Hirt for 55 years. ``When you say Al Hirt, you say
New Orleans. When you say New Orleans, you say Al Hirt. We're just
lucky enough to be from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Alois Maxwell Hirt was born on Nov. 7, 1922, in New Orleans, the
son of a police officer. A child prodigy, he got his first trumpet
from a pawnshop at age 6 and played his first gig in 1938 when he
was hired to blow the horn at a local race track. Besides earning
young Hirt $40 a week, the job also started a lifelong and often
-expensive passion for the ponies.
</P>
<P>
   Hirt attended the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music from 1940 to
1943 and, after a three-year stint in the Army, started his career
as a trumpet player, bandleader and songwriter, touring with big
bands, including those led by Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   He started his own band in 1950 and a combo with Fountain in
1955. In 1960, he signed with RCA Records, which released his first
album the following year. His most popular albums included
``Greatest Horn,'' ``He's the King'' and ``Bourbon Street.'' He
also had a pop single hit with ``Cotton Candy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirt continued to play at local clubs until recently, even
though he had to be wheeled on to the stage. It was a tribute to
his feisty spirit. Indeed, Fountain recalled the time in 1970 when
Hirt, riding on a float during Mardi Gras, was reportedly hit in
the lip with a brick thrown by a rowdy spectator. ``I think I was
bent over, looking up, about to throw some doubloons to some kids
when the lights went out,'' he said. ``I always told him I think he
fell on a Courvoisier bottle,'' Fountain recalled. He said they
last played together about two months ago at Fountain's Night Club
in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sat in and that was a good time that night,'' Fountain
said. ``He was having trouble getting around because his legs hurt
him, because he's so big his knees gave out. But otherwise, he was
all right. He played. He tooted with us, all the old favorites that
we have done together through the years _ `Muskrat Ramble,' `When
the Saints Go Marching In,' `A Closer Walk With Thee,' `Struttin'
with Some Barbecue' and `Jazz Me Blues.' We played all of those
that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was adept at many musical genres, Hirt was sometimes
derided by critics and jazz purists for injecting rock into jazz
numbers and pandering to mass tastes.
</P>
<P>
   He often responded by saying he was nothing more than a
crowd-pleaser. ``I'm a pop commercial musician,'' he said in a New
York Times interview in 1984. ``I'm not a jazz trumpet, and never
was a jazz trumpet. When I played in big bands for Tommy Dorsey and
Jimmy Dorsey and Ray McKinley and Horace Heidt, I played first
trumpet. I led the trumpet section. I never played jazz or
improvised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hirt's playing style was never progressive, but more of a
swing type,'' Fountain said. ``But Jumbo could play anything.
That's how schooled a musician he was. He was a good musician, very
good. He could read all the notes off the page.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirt is survived by his wife, Beverly Essel Hirt, and six
children from a previous marriage: Mary Lee Russo of Bethesda, Md.,
Rebecca Dickerson, Bridgid Mearns, Stephen Hirt, Rachel Caron and
Jennifer Sammons, all of New Orleans; a sister, Rosemary Hirt Rost;
a brother, Gerald; 10 grandchildren, 6 step-grandchilden and two
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The trumpeter, who was often also called the ``Round Mound of
Sound,'' considered one of his most important performances to have
been his 1987 solo rendition of Handel's ``Ave Maria'' for Pope
John Paul II during the pontiff's visit to New Orleans.

US, RUSSIAN OFFICIALS TALK ABOUT YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ NATO put into play Tuesday a plan to work with Russia
to solve the Yugoslavia crisis, but talks between an American envoy
and senior Russian officials appeared to produce no immediate
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the first of
several Western diplomats to visit Moscow this week, said after a
series of closed-door talks Tuesday that he better understood
Russia's position and that talks between Moscow and Washington
would continue.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself was something, given Washington's desire to avoid
confrontation with the world's other major nuclear power. Relations
with Moscow have hit a post-Cold War low after five weeks of NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO leaders have expressed hope that Russia would use its
unique access to Yugoslavia's leaders to negotiate a compromise.
Brokering an end to the Balkans war also appeals to Russia as a way
to buff up its status as a world power, tarnished by nearly a
decade of political upheaval and economic decline.
</P>
<P>
   But while Talbott called his talks ``very constructive, serious
and frank,'' there was no sign Tuesday that he had made progress
toward getting Yugoslavia to withdraw its forces from Kosovo,
NATO's primary condition for stopping its airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that Russia and the United States are
working together on this problem,'' Talbott told reporters after
talks with former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is
heading Russia's peace effort. ``The problem is extremely
complicated. It is important that our urgent work continues and it
will continue in the days to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin hinted that NATO and Belgrade had edged closer on
the critical issue of whose troops would monitor a cease-fire in
Kosovo. But he repeated Moscow's stance that NATO would have to
stop bombing before negotiations could start, a position the
Western alliance has already rejected as unacceptable. Chernomyrdin
also seemed to rule out participation by NATO troops in the force
that would implement a peace accord in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic has agreed to an international presence in Kosovo
under UN auspices, only from those countries that it names and with
Russia's big participation. . . . I think NATO will not be fully
satisfied, but we can work further. . . . We can discuss the
international presence,'' he told Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   One of Talbott's goals was to better understand what Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic told Chernomyrdin in Belgrade talks
last week. The Russian envoy later made contradictory statements
about the results of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned even more about Russian perceptions of the
situation,'' said Talbott, who also met with Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott is the first senior Western official to visit Moscow
since the bombings began. His visit, following a lengthy
conversation Sunday between President Boris N. Yeltsin and
President Clinton, kicks off a flurry of diplomacy involving
Moscow. The foreign ministers of Greece and Canada, as well as UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan, are also due in Moscow this week for
talks on the Kosovo crisis, and Russian Foreign Minster Igor Ivanov
plans to visit London May 8-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Russia to be part of the solution,'' British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing Serbia cannot go on forever,'' commented privately
owned NTV television. ``Both Brussels and Belgrade realize this,
but they need Russia as a translator.''
</P>
<P>
   But this strategy has already run into several snags. Russia has
so far been unable in several high-level diplomatic missions to
Belgrade to extract any significant concessions from Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   And Moscow has shown little desire to act merely as the West's
messenger. While Russian officials have quietly expressed growing
impatience with Milosevic, Moscow has gone out of its way to
embrace the Serb leader.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Russian President Boris Yeltsin Tuesday sent a note to
Milosevic, saying that Russia ``deeply sympathizes with the
fraternal people of Yugoslavia, the victim of NATO airstrikes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Russia disagrees with NATO over the bombing not just because
of Moscow's wounded pride over its lost superpower status, and not
just because of the cultural and religious affinity Russians feel
for Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   From senior officials down to ordinary citizens, Russians are
worried about the NATO airstrikes. Many Russians believed NATO
leaders, who assured Russia after the Cold War that the alliance
was a strictly defensive organization; now these Russians feel
betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   From Russians' perspective, NATO has consistently ignored their
objections.
</P>
<P>
   At the 50th anniversary summit in Washington last week, where
NATO leaders emphasized the need to get Russia involved in the
search for a solution in Kosovo, they also agreed to a strategic
doctrine that may open the way for the alliance to take action in
future conflicts without the backing of the UN Security Council, of
which Russia is a member.
</P>
<P>
   That does not go over well in Moscow, where NATO's refusal to
seek UN approval for its airstrikes is one of the main objections
raised by Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this forces Russia to reconsider many provisions for
ensuring its own military security,'' Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev commented on the summit to reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian newspaper Izvestia reported Tuesday that Moscow was
considering maintaining strategic forces, including
intercontinental ballistic missiles, strategic bombers and nuclear
missile submarines, that had been marked for scrapping this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin, anxious for new loans from the West, has played
down rumblings in the military and rejected calls to send Belgrade
weapons. Tuesday, First Deputy Prime Minister Yury Maslyukov was in
Washington for talks with the International Monetary Fund on a new
multibillion-dollar credit.
</P>
<P>
   While staking out a tough position on Kosovo, Moscow has found
ways to avoid confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott and Chernomyrdin also reportedly discussed NATO calls
for an oil embargo on Yugoslavia. Russia, which is a leading
supplier of oil to Belgrade, has said it would not honor such a
blockade. The possibility of NATO warships halting Russian tankers
in the Adriatic has caused some commentators to point out that wars
begin that way.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow has also said it suspended oil deliveries when the
bombing began.

&HT;        MANY PA WORKERS GET HURT ON THE JOB HELPING PATIENTS, OSHA
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, April 27 -- Twenty percent of the workplaces in
Pennsylvania with the highest injury or illness rates are nursing
homes or personal care facilities, according to a federal report
released this week.
</P>
<P>
   Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] officials
said awkward movements involved in moving or lifting patients often
caused workers injuries on the job at a growing number of health
care facilities around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've recognized nursing homes and care facilities as an area
where a lot of occupational injuries occur,'' said Michael
Fluharty, an OSHA spokesman. ``There are workers lifting people and
equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   OSHA released a list this week of 12,500 workplaces with the
highest injury or illness rates from around the nation. Of the
1,102 workplaces listed from Pennsylvania, 229 are health care
facilities. Other businesses on the list from the state were:
packing, groceries and manufacturing companies.
</P>
<P>
   The employers on the list reported the highest lost workday and
illness rates to OSHA in a 1997 survey of injury and illness rates
at 80,000 workplaces. For every 100 workers, the businesses on the
list reported eight or more injury or illnesses that resulted in
lost work days. The national average is 3.3, according to OSHA.
Construction sites were not included on the list, because they are
temporary, OSHA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA sent letters to the employers on the list encouraging them
to make their workplaces safer and will conduct inspections on
2,200 of them by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Health care industry officials said there is training for
workers on how to lift or move patients, which accounts for most
injuries on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risk for a worker lifting a patient because it is not a
dead weight, which can be very stressful on the back,'' said Tom
Burke, a spokesman for the American Health Care Association, which
represents 11,000 nursing homes and assisted living facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said there is equipment that can help workers lift
patients, but it frequently isn't used.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are machines to help workers -- a sling someone wold sit
on to help them out of a bathing situation,'' Burke said. ``But
patients object when someone wants to crank them out on a sling. It
becomes a dignity issue. A patient wants to be helped by a person
not by a machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke recommended that nursing care companies encourage workers
to ask a colleague for help when lifting someone.
</P>
<P>
   But Fluharty, of OSHA, said there may be more injuries at
nursing care facilities simply because there are more of them than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the population gets older, there are more of these
facilities,'' Fluharty said. ``There are therefore more injuries.''

RANCHERS (Douglas, Ariz.) - Dale Cureton's voice turned soft and
wistful as he recalled the good old days here on the sprawling
Rocker M Ranch, just a jackrabbit sprint from the Mexican border.
He spoke of a time when the same handful of deferential Mexican
farmworkers repeatedly used his place as their first stopoff point
on their way north. Today, an endless stream of illegal immigrants
- as many as 10,000 a month - take on this arid minefield of
rattlesnakes and thickets of prickly pear, mesquite, agave,
ocotillo and cholla spines that tear the flesh. By MARK SHAFFER and

ARAFAT BACKS AWAY FROM INDEPENDENT PALESTINE GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY _ At a meeting of the leadership of the Palestine
Liberation Organization Tuesday, Yasser Arafat began a careful
climb-down from a diplomatic high-wire act in which he had promised
to declare an independent state on May 4.
</P>
<P>
   In a session of the 124-member mini-parliament, the Palestinian
Central Council, Arafat took the first steps to delay the
declaration, analysts and observers agreed. The council is now
expected to postpone any action on statehood until at least after
the Israeli general election on June 1, and possibly longer by
extending peace talks with Israel for another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going through a very delicate period in the history of
our people, a period during which we cannot afford making any
mistakes,'' the official Palestinian news agency WAFA quoted Arafat
as saying. ``We don't need to affirm our state because we are
actually exercising statehood.''
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations are expected to continue through Thursday, but
members of the PLO body, which is stacked with hand-picked Arafat
loyalists, were indicating which way the process was headed even
before Arafat's statement.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, the PLO leader had referred to May 4 as a
``sacred date'' for the Palestinian people to declare sovereignty _
unilaterally, if necessary. The date marks the end of the five-year
interim period of the Middle East peace process and was the
deadline set for a permanent accord between Israelis and
Palestinians when they signed the historic Oslo agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States has put intense pressure on Arafat to
postpone a unilateral declaration of statehood, most recently in a
letter from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian peace negotiator, quoted the
letter as saying that Clinton supported ``the Palestinian people's
right to determine their own future on their own land.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter has not been released, but if the word ``right'' was
used, it would bring the United States closer to supporting
Palestinian self-determination than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Ronni Shaked, a journalist for the newspaper Yediot Aharanot who
specializes in Palestinian affairs, said, ``Arafat knows that the
key to his future is the United States. He knows the US can save
him and give him the legitimacy to build a state. He realized that
he would be a fool to risk that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has played this whole statehood drama out over months and
done it masterfully,'' Shaked added, refering to a just-completed
56-nation tour in which Arafat worked to build support for
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure to back off the May 4 declaration, for now, has also
come from Arab and European states that have expressed fears that
such a move would wreck any prospect for a renewed push for a final
peace agreement after Israel's election and boost the reelection
bid of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, whose campaign rhetoric has taken a hard-line stance
against a Palestinian state, has threatened to permanently annex
Israeli-occupied land if Arafat proclaims independence of his own
accord.
</P>
<P>
   The scene Tuesday at Arafat's headquarters, informally known in
Arabic as ``muntada'' or ``the club,'' was classic Palestinian
political theater.
</P>
<P>
   There was the dramatic appearance of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the
ailing spiritual leader of the Islamic resistance group Hamas, who
arrived in a Land Rover with his wheel chair. The arrival of Yassin
as an ``observer'' suggested that Arafat was welcoming even the
most ardent opponents of the peace process to take part in the
debate over declaring statehood.
</P>
<P>
   There were small and tightly controlled protests demanding
statehood, and a man dressed in traditional Islamic garb was
shouting ``Long live freedom of speech.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics pointed to glaring indications that the appearance
of a democratic process at the meeting was more superficial than
substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was closed to outsiders and the media. Palestinian
television and radio did not carry the speeches live; as they took
place, Palestinian TV aired an animal show that featured alligators
devouring their prey in African swamps.
</P>
<P>
   The council has no parliamentary rules for making decisions. It
is expected that debate will continue over for two more days, but
no one knew for sure. And it remained unclear Tuesday whether there
would be any vote, or recommendation from a committee, specifically
on delaying the statehood decision.
</P>
<P>
   Marwan Barghouti, the council member for the Fatah political
organization, said, ``We are waiting for a courageous decision, a
brave one which is declaring a Palestinian state on May 4 and not
submitting to international pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahmud Zahar, a political adviser for Hamas, which opposes the
peace process, made veiled threats of a return of violence if there
is no declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Arafat) decides to postpone it,'' he said, ``it is his
responsibility for what happens.''

WHALE'S DEATH ATTRIBUTED TO SHIP IMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a surveillance plane watching from the sky and a special
state warning for boaters to avoid them, one of the rare Northern
right whales in Cape Cod Bay was apparently struck by a boat before
she died last week, according to preliminary autopsy results
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said the female whale, nicknamed Staccato, had five
broken vertebrae as well as a broken jaw, all injuries consistent
with a collision with a ship. The researchers said the injuries
probably did not kill the whale immediately, but she may have died
of a combination of injuries and disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our task now is to determine whether pre-existing illness made
this animal vulnerable to the traumatic injuries she sustained,''
said David St. Aubin of Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut, who
directed the autopsy on a Wellfleet beach last week. ``This degree
of trauma might not have killed an otherwise healthy animal.''
</P>
<P>
   National Marine Fisheries Service officials have launched an
investigation to find out who struck the animal _ a violation of
the Endangered Species Act _ but they admit it's an uphill task.
Only once in 14 ship strikes have investigators found the boat
responsible for killing a right whale.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Staccato, found floating five miles off Wellfleet
on April 20, dealt a blow to the survival hopes for the species
because she was a prolific breeder, the mother of six of the 300 or
so remaining right whales. Underscoring the loss, the environmental
magazine E rates right whales among the 10 species worldwide that
are most likely to go extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, conservationists said Staccato's death casts doubt on
the adequacy of government efforts to protect the whales. After
all, they said, Staccato died in spite of an aerial survey intended
to keep an eye on the whales as they feed in Cape Cod Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Some called for a dramatic increase in the $1 million National
Marine Fisheries Service budget to protect right whales.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before Staccato's death, the state had issued its
first-ever right whale alert, cautioning boaters to be on the
lookout for at least 20 right whales in eastern Cape Cod Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never saw (Staccato) in the water until it was dead.
Their little observation program is full of crap,'' said Max
Strahan of the group Green World and an outspoken critic of federal
and private efforts to protect the whales.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the National Marine Fisheries Service said
Staccato's death may illustrate the difficulty of preventing rare,
far-flung tragedies. Although ship strikes are the leading
human-induced cause of whale death, such collisions occur once or
twice a year in thousands of square miles of ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have animals that extend anywhere from Cape Cod Bay to
Great South Channel (off Nantucket, Mass.),'' said Chris Mantzaris,
head of the protected resources division at the National Marine
Fisheries' Gloucester, Mass. office. ``It is very difficult to
cover all those areas in one aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Mantzaris also stressed that his agency and others are stepping
up the right whale campaign, noting that ships will soon have to
report to shore whenever they enter an area where right whales are
gathered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mantzaris said he is frustrated by the limited federal
money available to protect right whales. His eight-man team has to
protect all marine mammals from Maine to Virginia, leaving the
staff spread extremely thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably feel frustrated every day of my life working here
because I can never get enough resources to do what I want to do,''
said Mantzaris.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Kraus, a leading right whale researcher at the New England
Aquarium in Boston, said the National Marine Fisheries Service has
to experiment with more effective strategies than aerial
surveillance _ which he called ``Neanderthal'' _ and public
education, which may not affect boaters' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Kraus called for more research into improved sonar that would
allow ships to detect right whales in front of them, and he also
called for more research into the use of acoustics to alert the
whales when ships are approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires a fairly aggressive approach if you want this
animal to be around in 100 years,'' said Kraus, who has been
working with shipping companies to persuade Congress to boost right
whale funding significantly. ``It's not unreasonable to do this to
save one of the great whales.''
</P>
<P>
   Lab analysis of Staccato's bones and tissue is expected to
continue for the next two to three weeks as researchers try to
assess Staccato's health at the time she sustained the broken
bones.

RELIGIOUS GROUP, LED BY JESSE JACKSON, PLAN TRIP TO BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mich., Texas)  (nk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of religious leaders led by the Rev. Jesse
Jackson plan to leave Wednesday on what they call a humanitarian
mission to Belgrade, where they hope to persuade Yugoslav officials
to free three captive American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither NATO nor the United States has sanctioned the trip, and
the administration has distanced itself from the effort. A senior
White House official said on Monday that Jackson was acting as a
private individual and would not be used by the government to carry
any message to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who helped negotiate the release in 1984 of a Navy
pilot shot down over Syria and hundreds of Europeans and Americans
held hostage in Iraq in 1990, said his group's goal was to create
an opening for a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Yugoslavia
by persuading the government to free the servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations are left to governments, but both governments are
locked in their political positions, and while they say it's a
diplomatic solution they want, they are looking for a military
victory,'' he said in an interview at his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition
office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The group that will make the trip includes representatives of
the American Muslim Council, a rabbi and clergy from several
Christian denominations, among them the Rev. Joan Campbell, the
general-secretary of the National Council of Churches, an
organization of 35 Eastern Orthodox and Protestant church groups.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said representatives of the Yugoslav government had
assured him that the group would be allowed to visit the three
soldiers, who were captured along the Kosovo-Macedonia border on
March 31 and received their first visit from the International
Committee of the Red Cross only on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers are Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los
Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek,
Mich.; and Specialist Steven M. Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas.

HOUSE TO CONSIDER BILL TO HALT U.S. ROLE IN YUGOSLAV CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Wednesday is likely to defeat
legislation that would require President Clinton to withdraw U.S.
forces from the air campaign against Yugoslavia or declare war on
the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
   The votes are being forced by Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., who
wants Congress take a firm position on the U.S. role in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at war,'' Campbell said Tuesday. ``That's the truth and
we ought to admit it and proceed or we ought to pull the troops
back.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the House International Relations Committee defeated
the bills, one to withdraw American forces from the NATO-led air
assault, the other to declare war.
</P>
<P>
   The full House must still debate and vote on the measures, but
the committee's action, coupled with pressure from Republican
leaders for Campbell to withdraw his bills, indicate likely defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders and the Clinton administration are
concerned that the wrong signal would be sent to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic if Congress entered into a divisive debate about
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on the panel complained that Campbell's resolutions
gave them too stark a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., called the resolutions ``extreme''
and said they offered lawmakers the choice of either validating
Milosevic's attacks against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by
withdrawing the U.S. military presence, or declaring an all-out
war.
</P>
<P>
   He and other lawmakers argued that if the United States declared
war against Yugoslavia, it would disrupt the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and further alienate the Russians who are opposed to
the NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   House International Relations Chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.,
urged the panel to vote against withdrawing troops. ``Now is not
the time to cut and run in the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who favors withdrawing U.S. forces, said he proposed
the resolutions to force Congress to take a position on the war in
Yugoslavia because the Constitution empowers the House and Senate
to declare war.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution also makes the president commander-in-chief,
which presidents have argued allows them to send troops into battle
without consulting Congress.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. forces have gone into battle more than 200 times while
Congress has declared war just five times: the War of 1812, the
Mexican War in 1846, the Spanish-American War in 1898, World War I
and World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the Vietnam conflict, Congress adopted the War
Powers Act. The 1973 law says that unless U.S. troops are under
attack, a president must obtain congressional approval before
deploying troops. In the event of an emergency, the president has
48 hours to consult with Congress on the military deployment and to
remove troops within 60 days if Congress does not declare war.
</P>
<P>
   That law has not stopped president from sending troops into
action in scattered conflicts. Before the Persian Gulf War began in
1991, Congress did vote to authorize the use of military force,
although the troops had already been sent to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he may petition a federal court to make a ruling
on the law if the House does not vote to authorize the military
action in Yugoslavia, which began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said lawmakers would
vote on the two Campbell resolutions, along with two moderate
alternatives, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Republican-sponsored alternative is expected to require
Clinton to obtain congressional permission before sending any U.S.
ground forces to the region. The bill may also cut off funding if
Clinton were to commit land forces without consulting Congress.
Clinton has repeatedly said he has no plans to send in combat
troops, but would send a land force as part of a peace-keeping
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are expected to offer a resolution supporting the
air campaign. The Senate approved a similar resolution last month.

   Also Tuesday, House Appropriations Committee Chairman C.W. Bill
Young, R-Fla., introduced a $12.9 billion spending bill to fund the
Kosovo operation through Sept. 30. The measure is double the $6
billion the Clinton administration requested.
</P>
<P>
   Young's proposal includes $2 billion to fund a 4.8 percent
across-the-board pay increase for military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill recognizes the we are more deeply involved in Kosovo
than we were led to believe and that unless Milosevic has a major
change of heart, our involvement will be longer and deeper than
anticipated,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said he expected the House and Senate would approve the
Kosovo spending bill next week.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Association says numbers show mandatory
vaccinations not best for children
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Children younger than 14 are three times more
likely to be killed or seriously injured by hepatitis B vaccines
than to catch the disease, the Association of American Physicians
and Surgeons said in opposing Ohio's mandate that children entering
kindergarten this fall must begin receiving three doses of the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   An Ohio House committee will continue hearings and possibly vote
today on legislation that would suspend the requirement for one
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gratified that a physicians' group is courageous enough to
finally speak up,'' said Kristine M. Severyn of Centerville, a
pharmacist with a Ph.D. that involved the composition and physical
effects of drugs. As director of Ohio Parents for Vaccine Safety,
Severyn already had given the Health, Retirement and Aging
Committee letters opposing the mandate from 24 individual
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association and the American Academy of
Pediatrics have endorsed the vaccine, but Severyn and the AAPS
expressed concern about the organizations' financial ties to
vaccine manufacturers. Severyn has a thank-you letter from the AAP
for a $100,000 donation in 1988 from Merck &AMP; Co., which
manufacturers vaccines for hepatitis B and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The AAPS statistics came from the federal National Vaccine
Information Center's last tabulated year, 1996, when there were 872
``serious adverse events'' and 48 deaths associated with hepatitis
B vaccinations of children younger than 14, compared with 279 cases
of hepatitis B in that age group. ``Serious'' was defined as
requiring an emergency room visit or hospital stay, or causing
death or life-threatening or disabling injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless, government health officials cavalierly dismiss
reports of serious adverse vaccine effects as coincidental,'' said
Dr. Jane M. Orient, AAPS executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Virginia Haller, chief of the Ohio Department of Health's
family and community health division, calls the vaccine's risks
slim and vaccines in general ``the No. 1 accomplishment in the
effort to improve the health and well-being of U.S. citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Haller told the House committee that only about one in 600,000
recipients suffers severe allergic reaction to the hepatitis B
vaccine and that it successfully immunizes 90 percent to 95 percent
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis B is not spread by casual contact. The U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention recommends targeting the vaccine
to people with the disease's distinct risk factors: multiple sex
partners, injection-drug use, frequent occupational exposure to
blood and transmission at birth from an infected mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's mandatory hepatitis B vaccine was tacked onto a hazardous
waste bill last year without debate because committee chairman Dale
Van Vyven, R-Cincinnati, was unaware of opposition. Now Van Vyven
plans to introduce two amendments to the bill under consideration.

 &HT;    Carson planning new product launch
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Carson Products said Tuesday it plans to unveil a new
hair coloring product this fall, the first new product announcement
in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Carson, a Savannah, Ga.-based ethnic beauty products maker,
plans to call the line Dark &AMP; Lovely Diva. Diva will become part of
Carson's highly successful flagship Dark &AMP; Lovely brand.
</P>
<P>
   It will hit store shelves in August or September, said Shawn
Tollerson, marketing director for Dark &AMP; Lovely. Dark &AMP; Lovely
Diva's introduction will be supported by a print and radio
advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Carson commands a 61 percent share of the ethnic hair coloring
market, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The last two product launches for the company ended in
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   One, a professional line, was discontinued, and a Dark &AMP; Lovely
cosmetic line has had sluggish sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game is product and staying ahead of the
competition,'' said Warren Beck, an analyst with New York-based
Cromwell, Miller &AMP; Greer.
</P>
<P>
   The new line will have eight shades with such names as Toffee
Tease, Calypso Candy and Golden Goddess.
</P>
<P>
   Introduction of the new line comes at a critical time for
Carson. On Monday, the company released its first-quarter results,
which showed its first profit in a year. The company reported net
income of $180,000, compared with a loss of $501,000 in the same
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the company has had a management
restructuring, and President Gregory Andrews died while on business
in South Africa. Carson expects its new line to contribute $10
million in sales within the next year, said Chief Financial Officer
Robert Pierce.

 &HT;    Overseas profit gains continue for UPS
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the heels of its first-ever annual profit from
international service, United Parcel Service kept up the momentum
in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   International operating profit quadrupled from a year earlier,
contributing to a 42 percent jump in overall profit for the Sandy
Springs-based delivery giant.
</P>
<P>
   Net income climbed to $499 million in the January-March quarter,
up from $352 million a year ago. Revenue rose to $6.33 billion, vs.
$5.86 billion. UPS stock is owned by employees and doesn't trade
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits from international business rose to $44
million from $11 million, which UPS attributed to growth in express
delivery volume in both Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw impressive growth in our express products in most
corners of the world,'' said Chairman and Chief Executive Jim
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The first-quarter gains also reflected UPS' efforts to expand
its e-commerce products, build overall volume and control costs,
Kelly said. Slightly lower fuel prices helped.
</P>
<P>
   UPS began a steady international expansion 11 years ago, mainly
by acquiring local companies. But it lost money on the expansion
until last year, when it posted international operating profits of
$56 million, reversing a $67 million loss in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   UPS now is well-positioned throughout much of Europe but faces
new challenges as national postal agencies offer competing
low-priced domestic service, most notably in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   UPS has responded by de-emphasizing German domestic service and
focusing on cross-border European business.
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter U.S. domestic package operating profit rose to
$765 million from $594 million on a 2.7 percent volume increase.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits from non-package operations fell to $25
million for the quarter from $35 million a year earlier, despite a
26.6 percent gain in revenue for the sector.
</P>
<P>
   Non-package operations includes such areas as truck leasing and
supply-chain management services offered by UPS Logistics Group.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Norman Black, however, said the profit decline was due
to start-up expenses for unannounced new products and services
rather than ongoing business.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Five full weeks into NATO's air campaign against
Yugoslavia, the United States is plunging deeper into a conflict
that has no visible endpoint, with President Clinton poised to
deploy hundreds of additional warplanes and 33,100 fresh reservists
in the largest such call up since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   A prolonged and escalating war of attrition is not what Clinton
had in mind on March 24, when he led the world's mightiest military
alliance to launch air strikes against a third-rate Balkan
mini-state, citing a ``moral imperative'' to halt ethnic
repression.
</P>
<P>
   As the imperative shifts from moral to strategic, with U.S. and
NATO credibility at stake, the addition of forces and firepower to
the fray will surely increase the pressure on Serb leader Slobodan
Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   It will do little, though, to change the allies' fundamental
challenge: how to bring a determined dictator to heel with a
campaign constrained by the limits of air power and the politics of
coalition warfare in the television age.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder Clinton is gearing up for the long haul -- and
calling for patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're sort of at the top of the third inning here,''
said former Pentagon official David Ochmanek, an air power expert
at RAND, a strategic think tank based in Santa Monica, Ca. ``Our
team is several runs down, but we've got a deep bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sent in fresh players on Tuesday, giving the Pentagon
approval to call up to 33,100 reservists into action supporting
Operation Allied Force. The first tranche of 2,100 reservists will
go to help support 30 additional refueling tankers as early as this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force is also working with the NATO commander, U.S. Army
Gen. Wesley Clark, on a plan to deploy some 270 additional
warplanes and support craft, to enable Clark to expand his
around-the-clock attacks on military targets across Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also plans to begin a naval blockade -- as early as this
weekend -- to choke off Yugoslavia's oil imports.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Clark said Tuesday, the alliance has tripled the size
of its air armada -- roughly 1,000 planes strong -- since air
strikes began. His request would raise the force by another third
on top of that.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton nor his generals will say so publicly, but the
dramatic widening of the NATO offensive underscores an obvious
point:
</P>
<P>
   ``We underestimated Milosevic's staying power and what it would
take to get him to see things our way,'' said Lawrence Korb, former
assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Now the alliance is struggling to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   As early as last summer, NATO began bracing for a confrontation
with Milosevic over the issue of Serb repression targeting the
ethnic Albanian majority in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   By fall, the allies had decided not to send ground troops to
fight a shooting war against Serbs, but to rely instead on NATO --
mostly U.S. -- air power. The hope was that Milosevic would
capitulate in the face of NATO's overwhelming air power.
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes had long since faded by this weekend, when NATO
leaders gathered here for a 50th anniversary summit and reiterated
their reliance on the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a ground option, though, has undercut the air
operation.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, with no ground campaign to fear, Serbs haven't
been forced to defend their border, the sort of tactic that pins
down large concentrations of troops and weapons. Massed troops are
far easier to hit from the air -- as Iraqi forces learned during
the Gulf War -- than thinly deployed armies dispersed across the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Without advancing troops to flush them out, moreover, Serb
forces can survive -- apparently for some time -- simply by
hunkering down and hiding in bombed-out villages, farms and woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence of a NATO ground force in Kosovo is allowing the
Serbs to choose the time and place of their operations. They can
sit when they need to sit and they can move when they want to
move,'' said Ochmanek. ``It allows Milosevic to retain the
initiative, and it makes us predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, NATO air strikes have made life miserable for Serb
forces on the ground inside Kosovo. Scores of tanks, armored
personnel carriers and trucks have been blown up, supplies of food,
ammunition and fuel have become scarce and direct communications
between fielded forces and their senior commanders have been
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air campaign is working,'' Clark told reporters Tuesday in
Brussels. ''There's more to be done. And, there should be no doubt,
more will be done.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, though, it remains up to Milosevic to decide when
he's had enough to say uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give you a prediction,'' said Clark, ``on how long he
is going to endure this kind of punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Under the best of circumstances, air strikes alone stood little
chance of physically stopping small groups of Serb forces,
operating cheek by jowl with civilian populations, from rampaging
across Kosovo, shelling villages, burning homes and executing
victims at will.
</P>
<P>
   For NATO pilots, bedeviled by poor bombing weather during two
out of every three days of the campaign, these have not been the
best of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 4,400 NATO combat sorties flown as of Tuesday, hundreds,
perhaps thousands, have been scrubbed in mid-air due to heavy
clouds and fog, which NATO military spokesman Konrad Freytag called
``The best ally for Mr. Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on relatively clear days, the Air Force, a frighteningly
efficient tool for attacking and destroying armies, has brought
only limited influence to bear upon the sort of roving hordes of
gunmen that have forced an estimated 1.5 million Albanians to flee
their homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have regular military forces in any sense of the
word,'' said a senior Air Force pilot with extensive combat
experience in the Balkans. ``Six thugs in the back of pick-up
trucks going to a village and burning it down, you can't just
target that situation from the air, particularly with the
collateral constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO pilots are instructed to do all they can to avoid injuring
or killing civilians, including not dropping bombs unless they're
certain to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   Turning that virtue to their advantage, Serbs have, predictably,
billeted even moved troops and equipment alongside civilians -- a
violation of the Geneva Conventions -- forcing NATO pilots to make
split-second cockpit decisions at high altitude over whether they
are targeting soldiers or refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy appears to have resulted in tragedy at least once,
when NATO warplanes mistakenly bombed a convoy containing refugees
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the damage television footage of such disasters can
do to public support for the air campaign, NATO is going to pains
to avoid a reprise of that incident, making it all the more
difficult for U.S. and allied pilots to strike effectively at Serb
convoys and fielded forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do,'' said the Air Force official, ``is nibble at
the margins.''

ANALYSTS EXPECT `VERY CHAOTIC ELECTION' IN INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also INDONESIA-TIMOR) 
(mk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia is holding its breath. Ready or
not, it is about to leap into the second phase of its transition
from 32 years of dictatorship with an election _ just six weeks
away _ that will shape the post-Suharto era.
</P>
<P>
   Though the election has been planned for months, it is fraught
with uncertainties, from unresolved technical questions to the
possibility of violent rivalries and attempts to derail the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The election, scheduled for June 7, will be the first step in a
complex process of selecting a 700-member body that is to choose a
president in November. None of the parties is expected to win a
majority; the leading parties will be happy to win 30 percent of
the vote. Intense coalition-building is expected after the
election.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first democratic vote in this nation of 200
million people since the 1950s, and the capstone to the uprising
that forced former President Suharto from power last May.
</P>
<P>
   But with competing interests _ political and religious
rivalries, major economic feifs, an unsettled military and a
plethora of armed groups _ and with election preparations far
behind schedule, many analysts are bracing for confusion, electoral
disputes and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to see more dead victims in the process of
democratization,'' President B.J. Habibie said recently. ``We all
want to see a smooth, peaceful election. Otherwise disaster is
waiting for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Suharto took power in 1965, no one has ever lost a
presidential election in Indonesia: He was always the only
candidate. A do-or-die contest with 48 parties will be a new
experience with unpredictable results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are probably heading for a very chaotic election,'' said
David Timberman, an American election analyst. ``There is far too
much that needs to be done with far too little time and far too few
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the best-case scenario will probably be characterized by
a great deal of ad-hoc-ism and improvisation, which in turn will
lead to confusion, inconsistencies and, as a result of that, a
great number of disputes and controversies. There is nobody who
knows how this is going to turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   One Western diplomat said: ``The diplomatic community expects
serious violence in May and June, but it has very, very little idea
who may be behind it or why or what the consequences might be for
the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am relatively optimistic that the election will take place
and that the votes will be distributed relatively fairly. I expect
we'll see a lot of violence and in the end see some kind of
coalition emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Hari Tchan, a political analyst with the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, said the greatest threat of instability
would come from a possible victory by Golkar, the political party
that was formed to protect the interests of Suharto and that still
dominates the government.
</P>
<P>
   It is the party of Habibie, who is resented by many in the
political elite because of his ties to the past as Suharto's vice
president. This taint, along with sharp internal rivalries, make it
unclear whether Habibie will be the party's presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the forces considered to be pro status quo win, people will
just not accept that,'' Tchan said. ``There will be prolonged
disturbances, prolonged tension.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the country's many competing groups have for the most
part swapped street demonstrations for electoral politics, the
momentum still appears to be with the forces of change. An outcome
that does not bring a clear-cut end to the Suharto era will not be
widely accepted, Tchan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Habibie has overturned much of the legacy of his mentor and
introduced a vividly open new style of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment the capital is strikingly calm. The disruptive
student demonstrations and violence of four months ago have
disappeared from the streets. The collapse of the economy has
become a way of life, with people hunkering down in more frugal and
limited lives.
</P>
<P>
   An outbreak of communal violence that has taken hundreds of
lives this year in several remote areas has not, so far, spread to
the capital or had a significant political impact here.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential for widespread violence remains, particularly
as Indonesia's economy continues to founder. The local eruptions
have mostly involved long-suppressed ethnic, religious and
separatist conflicts, issues that are reflected across Indonesia
and could flare spontaneously, or be provoked for political
reasons, at any time.

<P>
   EJIDO PINO GORDO, Mexico _ The shepherds of this remote mountain
settlement till the earth behind oaken plows and grind their corn
between smooth stones. They have no television, telephones or
electricity. Yet by one standard, the village enjoys vast wealth:
It is surrounded by magnificent forests.
</P>
<P>
   So when outsiders recently bulldozed a logging road and began
applying chainsaws to hundreds of 200-year-old trees, villagers
panicked. Men, women and children walked for 36 hours across a
canyon to board buses for the Chihuahua state capital, where they
held a sit-in at the governor's palace this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want our forests felled,'' a Raramuri-speaking Indian
leader, Francisco Ramos, told authorities through an interpreter in
negotiations that followed. ``We didn't plant the trees, God did,
to collect water from the rain and give homes to the animals. The
trees are not our property. We're just taking care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials were stunned by the Indian protest and the
news coverage it prompted, and Chihuahua state officials recently
announced a halt to the illegal logging around the village in the
Sierra Madre, about 850 miles northwest of Mexico City, at least
for now. But a federal official denied that any decision had been
made. Conservationists said they hoped for an environmental
victory, but it was only one skirmish in a war for Mexico's
beleaguered forests.
</P>
<P>
   All across Mexico _ from Chihuahua in the north, to the central
woodland preserves that are wintering grounds for North America's
monarch butterflies, to the tropical jungles of Chiapas in the
south _ timberlands are being cleared at a devastating rate.
Poachers are even cutting the few surviving forest preserves around
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deforestation is pushing us toward environmental collapse,''
said Sen. Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, who has proposed legislation to
create a National Forestry Commission with broad powers to confront
what he calls an emergency. ``The government should declare a
national forestry disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The country has destroyed half its forests in four decades and,
unless the devastation slows, will finish them off in half a
century, Aguilar said in an interview. Mexico's forests still cover
an area larger than California. But since it is mountainous, Mexico
needs extensive timberlands to capture rain water and prevent
flooding, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, wildfires that sent smoke clouds drifting into
Florida and Texas focused American attention on the crisis. But far
more trees are lost every year in Mexico to timber clearing or to
the cultivation of crops than are lost to fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illegal logging is out of control,'' said Leticia Merino, an
anthropologist at a branch of the Autonomous National University in
Cuernavaca, south of Mexico City, who is studying timber poaching.
</P>
<P>
   Some trees are felled by poor farmers who use the timber to
build homes or to sell to firewood vendors. More destruction is
caused by companies who engage in large-scale illegal logging,
often in collaboration with corrupt officials, she said. Sometimes
drug traffickers muscle in, using sawmill operations to launder
drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican forest policy has been marked by zigzags. In the 1930s,
land reform gave 9,000 Indian and farming communities control over
80 percent of the country's forests, a higher percentage than
anywhere else in the world. The communities, called ejidos, took on
the role played by the Forest Service in the United States:
fighting fires, planting trees and managing the harvest of timber.
</P>
<P>
   But successive governments encouraged thousands of rural poor
people to clear forests for the grazing of cattle. The most
damaging of such projects were abandoned in the last decade, but
one farm program still pays rural people an annual subsidy for each
acre of forest cleared for farming.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Mexico's entire budget for all forest-related
programs totals only about $90 million, Aguilar said.
Responsibility for enforcing forestry laws across Mexico lies with
just a few dozen inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Forestry laws passed in recent years encourage ejido communities
to divide forests into plots and to sign timber-harvesting deals
with logging companies. But many forest communities that sign
timber contracts end up in peonage, owing increasing sums to
logging companies each year, despite the harvest of entire forests.
</P>
<P>
   In one Chihuahua village, for example, a logging company
harvested 103 million cubic feet of lumber in 1992, yet at year's
end the village owed $16,000 more than when the year began,
according to village records.
</P>
<P>
   David Barton Bray, an environmental studies professor at Florida
International University in Miami, said that 17 million people
still live in Mexico's woodlands. Policies should help them earn a
livelihood from the forests even as they manage and conserve them,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many peasant and indigenous people, forests are not only
an economic resource, but also a spiritual wellspring and a source
of ethnic identity,'' Bray said. Such is the case of the Chihuahua
Indians who speak a language called Raramuri. They are often called
Tarahumara by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forests are fundamental to their cosmic vision,'' said Isela
Gonzalez Diaz, an anthropologist who helped advise the Pino Gordo
villagers during the recent negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Pino Gordo lies next to Coloradas de los Chavez, a rival village
of Spanish-speaking people. Coloradas leaders are privatizing their
village forests, and last year the federal government issued a
permit allowing the village to sign contracts with a logging
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   But the loggers soon jumped the boundaries of Coloradas, cutting
roads into Pino Gordo's forests and felling trees there. Pino Gordo
villagers complained to authorities, but got no response until the
recent protest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the negotiations, one Indian leader asked why the
government would issue a permit to Coloradas de los Chavez to cut
forests that are habitat for endangered fauna, including the
thick-billed parrot and the jaguarundi wildcat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to restrict the cutting of forests wherever there
is fauna in danger, we'd risk being in the same situation as the
United States, where most forest lands are now off limits to
logging,'' responded Leonel Iglesias, an official from the federal
Environment Ministry based in Chihuahua. ``Mexico has economic
needs that are different than the developed countries. We need
greater flexibility in our forest management.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities insisted repeatedly that there was no illegal
logging in the Pino Gordo region and that the Indians were simply
confused about their village boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   But as the talks proceeded, journalists and environmentalists
who traveled to Pino Gordo found men with chainsaws and hydraulic
winches felling trees on Pino Gordo's hillsides. One logger,
Curberto Bustillo Acosta, said each man in his crew had been
cutting 200 trees a day in the area.
</P>
<P>
   As the Indian protest drew news coverage, government officials
eventually agreed to send surveyors and other state and federal
officials to Pino Gordo. By the time they arrived, the loggers had
fled. But, seeing hillsides covered with stumps, state officials
said they had ordered the suspension of logging that had already
stopped. Federal officials said they were still studying the
dispute.

EAST TIMORESE TO VOTE ON AUTONOMY IN INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also INDONESIA-ELECTION)

 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ President B.J. Habibie of Indonesia
announced Tuesday that a referendum would be held on Aug. 8 in the
territory of East Timor to allow residents to choose whether to
accept a plan giving them autonomous status within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   If they reject the plan, Habibie said, the former Portuguese
colony, which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed in 1976, is
free to become an independent nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will accept whatever they decide, whether it be integration
or separation,'' Habibie said after a meeting on Bali with Prime
Minister John Howard of Australia. Habibie said he would announce
the result of the vote on Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   He added that a six-nation team would supervise the balloting
and that U.N. advisers would help police maintain security.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has grown in the territory of 800,000 people since
January, when Habibie raised the possibility of independence. Many
experts are concerned that the losers in the referendum will not
accept the results.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for an irregular militia that opposes independence
told The Associated Press that he opposed a referendum, which many
Timorese believe will favor independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will never solve the conflict in East Timor,'' the
spokesman, Florencio Viera, said. ``East Timor with greater
autonomy is our choice, and that's final. The East Timorese are
blind when it comes to politics. If the ballot is carried out, the
winners will be proud and the losers won't accept that.''

ANOTHER YUGOSLAV OFFICIAL SUGGESTS COMPROMISE POSSIBLE OVER
KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A senior Yugoslav government official,
the second this week, spoke optimistically Tuesday about the
possibility of a negotiated settlement to the war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that this will be the week in which the basic
outline of an agreement on Kosovo can be firmed up,'' Goran Matic
said on Tuesday. Matic, a minister without portfolio, is from the
Yugoslav United Left party of Mirjana Markovic, the influential
wife of President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The other Yugoslav official seeking a compromise over Kosovo is
the more liberal deputy prime minister, Vuk Draskovic, the former
leader of protests against Milosevic. Draskovic, who is outside of
ruling circles, first came out in favor of a negotiated settlement
in an interview on Sunday on Belgrade's Studio B television. He
continued to press Tuesday for a compromise that would involve a
peacekeeping force led by the United Nations that could include
troops from NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   While Draskovic maintains that Milosevic would back his
initiative, he conceded Tuesday that he had not talked with the
president specifically about an armed U.N. force containing NATO
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Matic said that diplomacy, with the help of Moscow, was
advancing. He maintained that Yugoslavia, under more than a month
of NATO air attacks, would like to see them stopped, but not at any
price. ``We have a national interest in this,'' he said in an
interview Tuesday. ``But it's in America's interest as well, and at
one point our interests will intersect.''
</P>
<P>
   While much work remains to be done to bring the two sides
together, he said, Yugoslavia would insist only on two things: ``We
won't give up Kosovo or allow armed troops into Kosovo. Everything
else we'll give NATO for their victory.''
</P>
<P>
   But even on the question of armed troops, Matic was careful.
``That is our official position,'' he said when pressed, but
conceded that any peace settlement would have to involve
negotiation and compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the idea of some form of international protectorate
for Kosovo, as NATO is now proposing, Matic said flatly: ``No one
can sign an agreement that allows the secession of the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Tuesday, Draskovic, the most liberal member
of the relatively weak federal government, pulled back from his
threat to lead street demonstrations if Belgrade's television
station, Studio B, remains under army censorship.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that a military officer is controlling footage about
the army on the news for security reasons, but is not otherwise
interfering with programming, which is in any event subject to
wartime censorship from the Serbian Information Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted the censors out of Studio B. If the military
does interfere further with Studio B's programming, he said
Tuesday: ``We'll take the action that we decide.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Matic was politely patronizing about Draskovic,
seeming to reflect a government decision to ignore his challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite normal for him to have such outbursts,'' Matic
said. ``Mr. Draskovic is free to express his views. But if you
follow him closely, he did not abandon the basic position of unity
and of the defense of the country, and that is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, in an interview Sunday that Belgrade's intellectuals
and democratic opposition largely applauded, called on the
government to speak realistically to the nation about the war and
its costs, and not to pretend that Yugoslavia could defeat NATO or
be saved by Russian military aid. He also pressed for a U.N. force
to monitor any Kosovo agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts think Draskovic is probably right, but even his
proposal falls short of NATO's demands for an armed ``international
security force'' with NATO troops as its core, so that ethnic
Albanian refugees feel that it is safe to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade also wants to keep larger numbers of its security
forces in Kosovo than NATO is willing to allow, but most diplomats
consider that issue, too, subject to negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic also asserts that Yugoslavia is willing to allow
international human-rights investigators access to Kosovo as part
of a settlement, but Milosevic has previously refused such access
outright.
</P>
<P>
   Matic, 40 and telegenic, was the federal information minister
until Draskovic's liberal Serbian Renewal Movement joined the
government. Draskovic's party, which controls the Belgrade city
government, took over the Information Ministry, while Matic became
a minister without portfolio. But he has taken a more assertive
role in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, Matic said that ``no massacres and no
atrocities'' have been committed by Serbian forces in Kosovo as the
West alleges, but he confirmed a statement by Draskovic that the
federal government has set up a special investigative committee to
gather evidence on allegations of criminal acts committed against
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Matic said that NATO propaganda appeared to be following ``the
Bosnia script,'' with ``unprovable assertions'' about mass graves,
concentration camps, rapes and other atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the NATO bombing campaign had moved from military
targets to civilian ones in a vain effort to demoralize ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main attempt of the air campaign is to promote psychosis
and defeatism in the population, and to panic people so we will
accept anything,'' he said. ``But that is impossible,'' because of
the Serbian ``primordial attachment to Kosovo and refusal to break
the state apart,'' and because of ``the huge number of civilian
casualties.''

MAROONED BROTHERS RESCUED FROM HARBOR ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM AND JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- From now on, the brothers Diaz will be casting their
fishing lines from dry land.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning Manuel Diaz, 56, and German Diaz, 54, both
from Dorchester, and Efrain Diaz, 44, visiting from Puerto Rico,
had launched German's 14-foot motor boat into the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't meant to be much more than a three-hour tour. Four or
five, tops.
</P>
<P>
   But almost 24 hours later, after a cold, wet, hungry night on
inhospitable Lovell Island in Boston Harbor, they were being
hoisted by helicopter onto a Coast Guard vessel.
</P>
<P>
   And for a while there in between, their plight was looking
dangerously similar to that of the gang from the S.S. Minnow, but
without the movie star part.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, all skippers who had fished together often in
Puerto Rico, set out at 11 a.m Monday from the Old Colony Yacht
Club in Dorchester Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no fish, and there was a lot of wind,'' Efrain said
at his Dorchester home Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At about 3 p.m., the net they were using got tangled in the
motor's blade. A piece of the motor broke off. ``And that was it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers had taken no food or drink on their trip. No
blankets, no two-way radio or other means of communicating to
shore.
</P>
<P>
   And in an oversight worthy of Gilligan himself, they had flares
but no matches to light them, and one flashlight with dying
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no radio. We could not communicate with anybody. We
were just there, floating around. We hoped a boat would pass by,
but none did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At around 5:30 p.m., the wind and cold picked up, the current
began pushing the boat out, and two of the brothers began rowing,
aiming for the only thing they could see _ Lovell Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were wet and freezing. We had lifevests on, and light
coats. We were still very cold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the brothers jumped out of the boat into the surf to
guide the craft to the island's shore around 6:15 pm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it began to rain hard,'' Efrain said, chuckling at their
bad luck. ``Everything went badly for us.''
</P>
<P>
   They did have a waterproof tarp they set up with pegs as a
shelter to block the wind and rain. They huddled under it for
warmth, sitting on the bare ground.
</P>
<P>
   The island _ 1,500 by 400 yards _ was too big to allow them to
see to the other side. Efrain said it was windswept, with small
tress and undergrowth, and what appeared to be an abandoned cement
shack. He said they didn't explore much, because they were tired
and worried.
</P>
<P>
   Though they were only four miles from downtown Boston, they did
not know where they were.
</P>
<P>
   They remained stoic. ``We did not think we would die, but we
talked about how we could survive'' if rescue did not happen soon,
Efrain said. ``We kept saying `Tomorrow is another day.' '' He said
he felt their relatives would report them missing, and that someone
would begin searching for them.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers slept on and off, leaning against each other in the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, relatives in Dorchester were frantic. They went to
the police at 10:30 p.m., said Elba Diaz, German's daughter. The
Coast Guard began a search at 12:50 a.m., using a helicopter and a
night-sun spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were waiting by the phone all night,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At about 5:30 a.m., Efrain said he heard the hum of a helicopter
overhead. They all jumped to their feet, shouting ``Thank God.''
The helicopter airlifted them onto a Coast Guard vessel and within
hours they were back in Dorchester, sleeping off the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he and his brothers would go fishing again after
this, Efrain laughed and said ``No, no more fishing for me.'' At
least, not from anything floating.

 &HT;    Mindspring profits reflect growth
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First-quarter profits at MindSpring Enterprises more
than doubled as sales surged on strong growth in subscribers, aided
by acquisitions and internal growth.
</P>
<P>
   Operating income, excluding acquisition-related expenses, jumped
to $4.7 million, or 16 cents a share, against $2 million, or 8
cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street had expected operating earnings of 13 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues of the Atlanta-based Internet services provider nearly
tripled to $61.6 million from $21.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Including amortization associated with acquisitions, MindSpring
posted a net loss of $3.3 million, or 12 cents a share, against net
income of $860,000, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The loss breaks a string of five profitable quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts aren't concerned. They knew MindSpring is on a
buying spree to expand its subscriber base. For example, the
company last February completed its $245 million acquisition of San
Jose-based Netcom Online Communication Services, adding 371,000
individual accounts and 45,000 Web-hosting accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase made MindSpring the nation's fourth-largest
Internet services provider. It now has 1,157,000 subscribers, up 67
percent from the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   President and chief operating officer, Michael S. McQuary, said
the company is further along integrating Netcom into its operations
that it had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We exceeded the expectations of the analysts that follow our
company,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, such as Jeff Sadler of FAC Securities in New York,
lauded the results and the company's management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profiability for the business was much stronger than I
anticipated,'' Sadler said. It was a ``very, very strong quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said the challenge facing MindSpring is to continue to
successfully integrating Netcom. But he said he believes management
is up to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a growing and developing business, they're still way ahead
of the game,'' Sadler said. ``MindSpring continues to show they can
control a sense of profitability and generate cash instead of
losing it, and that's good corporate government.
</P>
<P>
   `` Charles (Brewer, chairman and chief executive) has always had
his eye on the shareholder,'' Sadler continued. ``The company's
core values and beliefs might sound quirky, but it does make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of MindSpring Enterprises fell along with many other
Internet-related issues, finishing at $116.31 1/4, down $8.62 1/2.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The craving for speed seized John Drees the day after he bought
his first personal computer late last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a stir-crazy state that almost every home user of the
Internet can identify with, he counted the minutes it took for Web
pages to appear on his screen. He paced as his standard modem _ the
fastest on the market _ took an hour to funnel a huge file to his
hard drive, only to lose the connection before he was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Then Drees, a college professor in Jenkintown, Pa., stepped
through a looking glass that transformed his journey from home to
cyberspace: he got a cable modem. Now he travels the Net roughly 50
times as fast as he did before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go on, it's just amazing to me,'' Drees said in
the hushed tones with which many recent converts speak of their
high-speed Internet connections. ``Look,'' he told a visitor,
twirling through a 3-D animated tour of a World War II submarine.
``It's changed everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door, Brian and Lisa Banberger can't help but agree. They
opted for a comparably fast service _ not from the cable company,
but from Bell Atlantic, the local phone company. More than the
speed, Brian is enamored of the fact that the line is always open,
turning the Internet into a silent, beckoning presence on his desk
whenever his computer is turned on.
</P>
<P>
   So far the two households in Jenkintown, a well-to-do
Philadelphia suburb, are among just half a million across the
nation to sample the phenomenon known among technology wonks as
broadband. Much-hyped and long-delayed, high-speed Internet access
is finally coming to the home, with research firms predicting that
10 to 16 million households will sign up by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Such fast connections via phone and cable lines will become
widely available over the next year, at a cost of $40 to $200 a
month plus installation. The experience of the early users offers a
glimpse at the Internet's next frontier, where waiting is rare,
dialing in is unnecessary, and local communications monopolies are
for the first time vying for customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadband is the Internet's next version,'' said Kevin
Werbach, editor of Release 1.0, a technology industry newsletter.
``It's a fundamental advance over what we have now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most obvious sense, broadband crosses a technical
threshold that has long been a holy grail among media and
technology companies: enough bytes can be squeezed over their wires
to make video over the Internet look like television and audio
sound like radio. As a result, downloading the two-and-a-half
minute trailer for the new ``Star Wars'' movie over a cable modem
takes about two minutes, compared with about two hours over a
conventional modem.
</P>
<P>
   But the most far-reaching effect on the daily lives of broadband
users is this: instead of tapping into the network, they are simply
part of a network. The combination of speed and ease of access
suddenly makes it worthwhile to use the Internet for a myriad of
tasks from looking up a phone number to listening to music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadband has integrated the Internet into my life a hundred
times more than it was before,'' said Christopher Mines, an analyst
at Forrester Research, who moved his computer to the kitchen when
he got his cable modem and says most mornings his newspaper stays
in the driveway. ``What happens is the Web starts to take over from
other resources.''
</P>
<P>
   If millions of Americans now dabble in electronic shopping,
banking, publishing and information gathering, broadband seems
poised to significantly alter the nature of those activities as
well as the number of those who engage in them.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some of the bandwidth-obsessed are making decisions on
where to buy their homes based on the availability of high-speed
access. In the geographical pockets where broadband has become
available, neighbors are comparing download speeds and modem
installation fees in a 1999 version of keeping up with the Joneses.
</P>
<P>
   Even more striking than the speed, many users say, is the way
the ``always on'' connection removes a psychological barrier
between the user and cyberspace. Although the difference between
broadband and dial-up access is only a couple of minutes and a
screech of the modem, it seems enough to tip the balance, making
for shorter, but far more frequent sessions at the screen.
</P>
<P>
   And with high-speed access, high-quality video and audio will
become a more routine part of the Internet experience, with the
advantage of being able to choose what you want to see and hear,
and when.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do it right, by the back half of this year you're going
to see big spike in consumption of video and audio,'' said Jeff
Mallett, president of Yahoo, the prominent Internet company whose
purchase of Broadcast.com earlier this month for a stunning $5.6
billion reflected its faith in the future of broadband.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, for instance, anticipates that people who check their
stock quotes in the finance area of its site will supplement the
experience with a video news clip about their companies, or an
audio address by the chief executive. Businesses from mortgage
lenders to car dealers are expected to take advantage of the ease
of video conferencing over high-speed lines to entice customers to
make significant purchasing decisions over the Internet that they
would be unlikely to make without some human interaction.
</P>
<P>
   The technology also makes it possible for anyone to become not
only a consumer but a broadcaster of audio and video, sending
continuous sound and images to other computers across the Internet.
John Breuer, 37, a network engineer in Danville, Calif., who in
March subscribed to Pacific Bell's high-speed service known as
digital subscriber line, or DSL, now regularly plays Led Zeppelin
over what amounts to his own radio station, accessible to anyone
who has downloaded the free software that enables them to listen.
While he works and spins tunes from home, he often gets video calls
from his brother in North Dakota, who was never big on e-mail.
Asked if his new Internet habits cut into any of his other
activities, Breuer cites housework.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could easily reach what I would call epidemic proportions
in terms of addiction level,'' he said. ``It's really easy to get
caught up in it. There's so much out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Heralded for nearly a decade as the Internet's imminent
multimedia future, the deployment of broadband technology has been
long delayed in part because the technology was not ready and in
part because cable companies did not devote the cash to get it
ready. And without being prodded by competition, phone companies
were disinclined to offer a far less expensive service that would
eat into the lucrative high-speed T1 service that they now sell to
many businesses at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, cable companies, flush with capital from a series of
investments like AT&AMP;T's purchase of Tele-Communications Inc., the
largest cable operator, are upgrading their equipment. The
companies are eager to supplement the annual $25 billion cable
service with broadband revenues that Forrester estimates will reach
$5.7 billion by 2001. Local phone companies, whose $90 billion
phone service market is already under siege from long-distance
carriers and cable companies providing dial-tone service, have
their own reasons to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're preparing for a battle royal,'' said Richard Rasmus,
general manager of Philadelphia-based Comcast.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Castleton, executive director for Bell Atlantic's
high-speed products replies simply, ``Our intention is to beat
cable modems.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Also at stake in the broadband wars is the future of the 4,500
Internet service providers who now offer dial-up access to American
households, one-quarter of which are now online. Because cable
modem service includes Internet access, companies like America
Online, by far the nation's biggest Internet service provider with
16 million customers, are scrambling to strike deals with the
regional Bell companies to offer high-speed service over their
digital telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   And a high-stakes lobbying battle is unfolding in Washington and
across the country over whether cable companies _ notably AT&AMP;T, as
a condition of its acquisition of Tele-Communications _ should be
compelled to establish a level playing field for Internet providers
over their cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   Is all the fuss worth it?
</P>
<P>
   If the smug tone that creeps into conversations with many of the
early broadband subscribers is any indication, speed does make a
difference. A typical Internet user today connects at speeds
between 28,800 and 53,000 bits a second. Cable modems and DSL are
between 10 and 80 times as fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was over at my brother-in-law's the other day and sat at his
modem and that's when I really realized how much better I have it
than all those folks still on 28.8,'' said Banberger, Drees'
neighbor in Jenkintown and an executive at a health care
information publishing company. ``It's like when you got automatic
door locks on your car, and at first you thought, `Do I really need
this?' Once you have them, you can never go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Banberger's wife, Lisa, isn't as thrilled with the new setup,
since she says her husband spends more time online now than he did
before. She also tends to more frequently lose the game where Brian
tries to find a phone number or a movie listing online first while
she searches more pedestrian sources like the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   But both like the fact that their three young daughters, who
used to be too bored to wait for Web pages to show up on the
screen, now regularly sit in their father's desk chair and explore.
(The Teletubbies page, for instance, is a much-used bookmark).
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Richter, who subscribes to DSL from her telephone
carrier, US West in Phoenix, said the service had allowed her to
run her accounting firm out of her home. Several of her clients are
also self-employed at home by means of high-speed access from Cox
Cable or the wireless broadband company, Speedchoice, which takes
advantage of the area's flat geography to provide speeds comparable
to cable modems and DSL over the airwaves. With three competitors
in the market, broadband has become a subject to hash over at
cocktail parties, in the supermarket parking lot and, of course,
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always comes up,'' Ms. Richter said. ``Everyone's talking
about who has the fastest access.''
</P>
<P>
   The main virtue of DSL is that it offers higher guaranteed
speeds than do cable modems. It is also potentially more portable.
But its range is limited: people who live more than about three
miles from a local switching station cannot get DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, cable modems are more readily available, and
their top speed is almost three times that of the average DSL
connection. But because each household in a given area shares the
cable network, the more subscribers, the slower their connections
can be. Cable executives insist that they can add capacity to
maintain the speed, but customers in several markets including
Fremont, Calif., and Connecticut have complained about slow speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep a stopwatch here at my computer,'' said Marshall Wice,
75, of Hartford, Conn., who has cable modem service through
Tele-Communications. ``Sometimes I'm downloading two, three,
four-meg files in less than a minute. But at night, forget about
it. It just drags and drags and drags.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wolfington, 28, who chose his home in Foothill Ranch in
part because Cox Cable was offering high-speed service in the area,
also sometimes feels his connection is slow. But he has a remedy:
``When I feel myself getting spoiled I make myself spend some time
on a 28.8 modem,'' he said. ``That's when reality sets in.''

<P>
   In the week since two teen-agers killed 13 people at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo., thousands of mourners have gone to
a public park nearby, carrying flowers, memorial cards and banners,
stuffed animals and balloons, building a rambling, multicolor
memorial that spreads out across the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening in Robert F. Clement Park offers testimony
both to an ancient human impulse, to honor the dead, and to a far
more recent cultural phenomenon, in which private emotions are made
vividly public.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to connect in visceral ways, and one of the ways
to do this is to leave things,'' said Edward T. Linenthal, a
professor of religion and American culture at the University of
Wisconsin at Oshkosh, who is writing a book about the memorial to
victims of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Linenthal said that the recent creation of popular shrines at
the sites of mass deaths might come from people's desire to
overcome feelings of powerlessness and to experience a sense of
unity, a ``community of bereavement,'' that transcends race,
ethnicity and other distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   Rituals of public mourning have always been important in the
United States, going back to the elaborate funerals of the
Puritans. But the response to recent violence has taken on an
individualized cast in a way not seen even three decades ago, at
the times of the funerals of President John F. Kennedy, his brother
Robert and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   What prevails now is an acceptance, even expectation, that
personal feelings may be freely exposed, that women and men alike
can freely cry in public.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Farley, a psychologist at Temple University in
Philadelphia and a recent president of the American Psychological
Association, said that people were feeling a greater sense of
permission to express themselves, not least through the inspiration
of television and radio programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you follow daytime television, there's a lot of weeping and
public revelation of emotion, a lot of grieving,'' Farley said.
</P>
<P>
   Therese Rando, a clinical psychologist who is director of the
Institute for the Study and Treatment of Loss, in Warwick, R.I.,
said memorials like the one outside Columbine High School responded
to a sense on the part of some people that society has become
``deritualized,'' lacking sufficient formal outlets for grief and
other emotions.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Ms. Rando said, she has seen a rise in the
number of roadside shrines, with flowers, candles and handmade
signs, at the sites of fatal accidents. Makeshift shrines for
victims of violence in cities like New York have also become almost
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   And referring to events like the Oklahoma City bombing, the
death of Diana, princess of Wales, and the Colorado shooting, Ms.
Rando said, ``There is more the need to give expression to our
grief at the senseless deaths of young people in their prime.''
</P>
<P>
   A young woman in Clement Park, Morgen Warner, 17, who led about
100 students on a nine-mile walk to the park on Monday, said that
visiting the memorial ``was just such a unifying experience.
</P>
<P>
   Linenthal said a change in public expressions of grief became
visible after the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was opened on the
Washington Mall in November 1982. Visitors have left mementos at
the V-shaped wall, including flags and family photographs, boots
and jackets.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial outside Columbine High began to take shape on April
21, the day after the shooting. People have strung up paper chains
between trees with messages for the victims. Some have planted 13
crosses, one for each victim, in the grass, and set out 13 teddy
bears, with one slightly larger than the others to honor William
David Sanders, the only teacher killed.

   Visiting the site, 4-year-old Alexa Sharp-Wiley arranged a pair
of pinwheels beside a Winnie-the-Pooh doll. Her grandmother, Jo Ann
Schlegel, 62, said, ``I wanted her to see the reality of how to
serve others by going in and paying tribute to the lives that were
lost.''

   For some, just going to see the memorial meant feeling a
connection to the dead. ``This is moving me more than the TV did,''
said Frances Stall, 62, from nearby Lakewood. ``This is making me
feel part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after a bomb-laden truck destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, visitors flocked to
the chain-link fence around the site. Many left handwritten prayers
and poems. Children hung drawings. And some people peeled off their
T-shirts and left them on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   One observer, the Rev. Nick Harris, senior pastor of First
United Methodist Church, which sits across the street from the
Federal Building and was itself damaged in the explosion, said, ``I
think it's a way to do something physical and tangible to make sure
you never forget this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have always built shrines to that which is
overwhelming and that which is transcendent,'' Harris said. ``You
enshrine things that you cannot explain.''
</P>
<P>
   A permanent memorial is being built at the Oklahoma City site.
Another is going up at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Ark.,
where two boys killed a teacher and four girls in March 1998. That
project will include an amphitheater, a garden and a sculpture of a
white ribbon with the victims' names. Before construction began,
people came by to leave personal items.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Young, superintendent of the Westside Consolidated School
District, said he remembered the expressions on the faces far more
than anything they left. ``You could tell there was a bond,'' Young
said. ``It's a way for them to connect and share and put meaning to
the feelings you're having.''

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Easier transplant technique gives hope to
patients
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ There really is no easy way to ask a brother for
one of his kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was gut-wrenching,'' said Jill Reffner of Hillsboro. Her
family was close, everyone knew she would need a kidney transplant
sometime and both of her brothers agreed to be donors without
hesitating, but still _ this wasn't just a pint of blood that she
needed.
</P>
<P>
   At the time she asked, Reffner knew kidney donors must undergo
painful surgery that knocks them out of work for six to eight
weeks. She didn't learn for two or three more months that her
brother, David Wilmer, would have the tri-state area's first
laparoscopic kidney removal for a transplant, cutting recovery time
by more than half.
</P>
<P>
   The new technique could help many of the 41,000 Americans
waiting for kidney transplants by making it more practical for
living relatives to donate a kidney, say doctors who performed the
operations at The University Hospital in Cincinnati. Kidneys from
living donors have better survival rates than kidneys from
cadavers, and they can be transplanted before the patient's health
declines while waiting for a kidney.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for patients to say they'd rather stay on
dialysis than ask a relative to miss two months of work, said
Wilmer's surgeon Dr. James Whiting, last November. ``Now we've
already had a couple of times where they've said, 'Well, if it's
not going to be so bad, let's do it.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The conventional operation is safe and reimbursed by insurance,
but as Reffner said, ``They pretty much cut your body in half.'' A
12- to-18-inch incision goes from the belly button toward the
spine, where a rib often must be removed to take out the kidney.
The recipient's operation, with the new kidney placed in the
abdomen, is much easier.
</P>
<P>
   Laparoscopy requires just a 3-inch incision just above the belly
button for removing the kidney, plus four holes of less than half
an inch along the ribcage for inserting miniature surgical tools
and a tiny camera to guide the surgeon. He watches a video monitor
to detach the kidney, and then it is pulled out through the
abdomen. Wilmer's was fished out in a pouch, but Whiting's team is
doing it more often by hand now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've felt worse when I had the flu,'' said Wilmer, retired
from Delphi at 52 and living in Fletcher in Miami County. He
started eating the next day, never took so much as an aspirin, left
the hospital after three days instead of two weeks and returned to
all his normal activities in six weeks ``instead of probably six
months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd do it again,'' Wilmer says. ``But you've only got one to
spare. I'm kind of done.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Wilmer's kidney, Reffner would be on dialysis by now,
waiting more than a year for a transplant because of her tissue
typing. Instead, the 44-year-old Dayton native is back to work
three days a week at Reffner Photography Studio in Beavercreek
while her retired military husband, Wayne, tends the farm they
bought four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reffner found out at 17 she was born with only one kidney, and
it gradually stopped working over the past two years. ``Basically,
it's just been overworked all these years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting a year ago February, her kidney function and energy
declined steadily. She had surgery to install a port for dialysis
in July, when Dr. Gordon James of Wright-Patterson Medical Center
referred her to University Hospital, which has been doing kidney
transplants for 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati doctors said she should talk to her brothers in
early August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either one of us would have done it,'' said Wilmer, whose
tissue typing was the better match. ``We didn't want to see our
sister go through dialysis every other day for the rest of her life
until she got another kidney.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Wilmer said, ``I was scared to death, to tell
you the truth.'' He had never been in a hospital, hadn't even seen
a doctor for 20 years. ``Even just going to the doctor gives me the
willies,'' he said. ``With this, I was afraid if they put me to
sleep, I wouldn't wake up again.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have backed out any time during the tests and
conferences in the next several weeks. And he certainly didn't have
to be the hospital's first laparoscopic patient, knowing it was a
more intricate procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Laparoscopy evolved during the 1980s from arthroscopic joint
surgery, the first use of camera-guided miniature surgical tools.
Gynecologists used the scopes for examinations and by the late
'80s, surgeons used them for the relatively simple chore of
removing gall bladders. ``Sort of like picking a cherry off a
tree,'' Whiting said.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins Medical School in
Baltimore pioneered laparoscopic kidney removal and trained
Whiting, who expects it to be standard procedure in three or four
years. Only the Maryland hospitals and Mount Sinai Medical Center
in New York have done more than 100, he said, with another 12 to 20
starting in the past several months. University has done about a
dozen transplants, still requiring donors to be thin and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to do,'' Whiting said. ``You can't just say,
'Let's start doing this.' '' The kidney and blood vessels have to
be preserved intact by remotely maneuvering instruments in an area
visible only on a wall-mounted screen.
</P>
<P>
   That part didn't bother Wilmer. It looked to him as if doctors
flew in from all over the country to watch Whiting's procedure,
``so if something went wrong, one of them was bound to know what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything went smoothly. ``I thought it would be a lot more
painful, and also more traumatic,'' Reffner said, but she calls
herself ``fortunate'' to have just the slightest of side effects.
She takes 15 pills a day now, down from 69 at first, and she talks
with her brother more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot closer,'' she said. ``I feel more of a
connection, of course.''

TEACHER'S FAMILY RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT POLICE RESPONSE TO
SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (With COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING) 
(mb) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ For more than three hours, William Sanders
lay dying on a classroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   Terrified students with cell phones called frantically for an
ambulance for the teacher, shot twice while helping students flee
gunfire in the Columbine High School cafeteria last Tuesday. They
used their shirts to bind his wounds. They hung a sign from a
window: ``HELP, BLEEDING TO DEATH.'' When rescuers finally arrived
about 3{ hours after the first shots were fired, the 48-year-old
Sanders died as he was being carried from the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of last week's carnage, the teacher's family
has raised questions about the police response, especially the long
wait in sending rescuers into the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of his daughters are angry,'' said Melody Smith, a
sister-in-law of Sanders, who was substituting for a science
teacher last Tuesday. ``They feel like, had they gone in and gotten
Dave out sooner, he would have lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials say they did not send the police into
the second-floor classroom sooner because they feared the two
gunmen were still shooting inside the building. Sacrificing the
lives of police officers would not have helped anyone, said Sgt.
Jim Parr of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't run blindly down a hallway, not knowing that
you're running by doors that may contain gunmen,'' Parr said.
``They also had bombs they had to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the mayhem inside the sprawling school: sprinkler
systems flooding the halls, ceiling tiles falling down, fire alarms
sounding loudly and strobe lights from the alarm system flashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, all the worst things out of a horror movie,'' Parr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears that the two gunmen, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan
Klebold, 17 _ both seniors at Columbine _ did all of their
shooting, including killing themselves, within a matter of minutes
after beginning their assault around 11:25 a.m., said Steve Davis,
a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department. The
sound of gunfire inside the building for the next two hours, Davis
said, most likely came from the police _ ``cover fire'' meant to
protect the officers dashing into the building.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said the family does not blame the rescuers
themselves, but questions whether law-enforcement agencies have an
effective policy for such a crisis. Indeed, members of the tactical
unit were invited to Sanders' funeral on Monday as an expression of
gratitude. All of them attended the services, which drew about
3,000 mourners to the Trinity Christian Center here. ``We want them
to know we do not blame them,'' she said. ``But the family wants to
sit down and ask some questions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of the Sanders family, she said, the response to the
ambush did not seem to be well-organized. ``It was utter chaos,''
Ms. Smith said. ``We want some policies changed, so that this
doesn't happen to the next guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Parr said the SWAT team had been going from room to room in the
school, breaking down locked doors that had been barricaded by the
frightened students. When they reached the science classroom where
Sanders, a business teacher and athletic coach, lay dying, he said,
the officers rescued 60 students first. After that, two officers
started to carry Sanders out. He said the police knew that the
condition of Sanders was grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only so much you can do,'' Parr said. The police have
described Sanders as a hero whose bravery in charging into the
panic-stricken cafeteria, then herding about 200 students up the
stairs, probably saved the lives of many of them. Sanders took two
bullets as he guided students toward the science classroom. With
that, he stumbled into the room with blood flowing from his chest,
then fell on a desk and broke a tooth.
</P>
<P>
   One student in the classroom, Aaron Hancey, a junior, knew some
first-aid, and paramedics talked to him on a cell phone about
life-saving techniques. As Sanders' temperature fell, the students
wrapped the teacher in a blanket. Two boys took off their shirts,
twisted them up and pressed them against the wounds in an effort to
stanch the bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the teacher lay dying, students said he tried to comfort
them, telling them that everything would be fine.
</P>
<P>
   As he became weak from the loss of blood and seemed as if he
were going to pass out, students took his wallet from his pants
pocket and held up photographs of his family to try to keep him
conscious. But he could scarcely breathe. He said that he did not
think he could last much longer, then said, ``Tell my daughters
that I love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela Sanders, one of his three daughters, read an open letter
to her father at the funeral service. ``What you did in that school
Tuesday was an amazing act of heroism,'' she said. ``The rest of
the family and I will make sure your grandchildren never forget
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, a native of Indiana who played baseball at Chadron
State University in Nebraska, had been a coach of girl's basketball
and baseball teams. Every year he published a sports program with a
list of imperatives he called the ``Definite Dozen,'' urging the
students to be responsible and loyal.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Mazula, a firefighter whose daughter attends Columbine High
School, delivered a letter to the Sanders house on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of your selfless act, you saved my little girl,''
Mazula wrote. ``You gave up your life to save hers and because of
that I am able to hug and kiss her everyday.''

MARKETING OF CLONED BEEF DISTURBS JAPANESE CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government says at least 66 head of cloned
cattle have been slaughtered and sold on the beef market in Japan,
raising concerns among consumers about the safety of the meat.
</P>
<P>
   The cattle had been produced as part of Japan's advanced
research into the cloning of animals. Japan has gone farther than
most countries in cloning livestock, and those that were butchered
and sold were no longer needed for research.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said they did not have any health concerns about the
meat _ which is, after all, identical genetically to the meat of
the natural cattle that were cloned. But some consumers are
apprehensive about the idea of eating cloned animals.
</P>
<P>
   After acknowledging earlier this month that it had allowed the
sale of cloned beef, the government mounted a campaign to persuade
the public that eating cloned beef is safe. Last week, Shoichi
Nakagawa, the agriculture minister, ate cloned beef at a tasting
party to dispel anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the meat also underscores the potential of cloning,
which could drastically change the way meat is produced in this
country, consistently developing the best beef-producing cattle
specimens and thus driving down Japanese beef prices, the highest
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bio-engineering is not as divisive an issue in Japan as in
Europe and the United States. But some Japanese still are alarmed
over the ethical issue of raising cloned animals, even if they are
domesticated animals bred for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the cloning technique becomes possible, to manipulate
life and to go beyond God's control _ we need to think carefully
whether to accept this or not,'' said Setsuko Yasuda, a spokeswoman
for the Consumers Union of Japan. ``This discussion is lacking in
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the news came out also unsettled some consumers. They
were told about the cloned beef only after it had been sold and
eaten, and it was never identified as cloned when it was sold.
Moreover, the government at first had said that it knew of only two
cattle clones that had been sold; then, last Friday, it
dramatically raised the figure.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the meat from at least 66 cloned cattle, and
possibly as many as 144, had found its way to the marketplace,
along with the milk from four other cloned cows. Since 1990, Japan
has cloned 461 cows, mostly using the technique in which the
divided nuclei of fertilized eggs are transplanted into
unfertilized eggs. The result is that the cloned cow is like a
twin.
</P>
<P>
   The cloned beef was inspected and approved by inspectors and was
graded as ordinary beef, according to Hayato Iwamoto of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Scientists have
reassured the public that eating cloned beef is safe, but people
are still wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew it was cloned beef, I'd hesitate to eat it,'' said
Nobuko Hiwasa, a spokeswoman for the National Liaison Committee of
Consumer Organizations. ``We would like information on what exactly
cloned beef is. Is it safe?''
</P>
<P>
   Yukio Tsunoda, a cloning scientist at Kinki University, said
that hormonal experiments on cattle breeding may be of more concern
than the risks of eating cloned beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``If excessive debate has aroused too much anxiety among the
public, there is a role maybe for the Agriculture Ministry to
investigate, clarify and carry out an awareness campaign before the
beef is shipped out,'' said Tsunoda, who has eaten cloned beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ordinary meat,'' she added. ``It is not that any genes
are manipulated.''

   The corporate policy at Borders bookstores, says the latest
Mother Jones, is to shelve just about all books by black authors in
an African American literature section. This means that if you're
looking for a novel by  &UR; James Baldwin  &LR; or  &UR; Terry McMillan &LR; , or
 &UR; Toni Morrison &LR; 's latest, you probably won't find it in the general
literature section. According to the magazine, ``if a book's writer
is black, it gets coded as African American literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Although individual stores are permitted by the corporation to
cross-reference books, Mother Jones surveyed several and found that
10 out of 11 had failed to cross-reference Morrison's ``Paradise,''
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Several African American authors sounded off to Mother Jones:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; John Edgar Wideman &LR;  called separate shelving ``an implicitly

books in another place perpetuates a lot of false ideas about

</P>
<P>
   ``I profoundly resent the fact that my race is causing me to be
isolated and ghettoized,'' said  &UR; Shelby Steele &LR; . ``It hurts me as a
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all were outraged. ``I have mixed feelings about it,'' said
 &UR; Terry McMillan &LR; . ``On the one hand, you don't have Jewish American
sections or Irish American sections. So it's insulting and
flattering at the same time that we get our own special section. On
the other hand, since we are trying hard to eliminate color lines,
we should all just be included in literature.''

HIGH COURT WEIGHS CASINO ADVERTISING CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, in a case with free-speech
implications, considered Tuesday whether Congress has violated the
First Amendment by prohibiting private casinos from broadcast
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ennis Jr., a lawyer for broadcasters, argued that the
Communications Act not only impinges on the free-speech rights of
private casino owners but hurts their businesses because gambling
houses on Indian reservations _ a fierce source of competition _
remain free to advertise.
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy U.S. Solicitor General Barbara Underwood called the
statute a valid governmental effort to combat compulsive gambling
while allowing Indian tribes, which are sovereign, to continue to
advertise without federal interference.
</P>
<P>
   Several justices, however, appeared unconvinced that the ban is
really an effort to stop compulsive gambling. They said the
government allows broadcast advertisements of lotteries, horse
racing and other forms of addictive gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The case the high court considered was an appeal by the Greater
New Orleans Broadcasting Association after a federal court and the
5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the law constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Ennis said the law is ``so riddled with exceptions'' that it
cannot achieve the government's legitimate interest. Ennis cited
the law's allowance for Indian tribes to advertise their casinos,
which, he said, cater to all kinds of gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the government could
reasonably conclude that most compulsive gambling occurs at private
casinos and that the law is, therefore, a narrowly tailored,
constitutional method for reducing that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ennis said the government can constitutionally reduce compulsive
gambling without restricting free speech, such as by imposing
dollar limits on wagers at casinos and prohibiting gambling on
credit.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the government cannot constitutionally restrict
advertising of a legal activity _ an argument that drew fire from
several justices, who cited legal restrictions on cigarette
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood, the government's lawyer, argued that the federal
restriction on advertising is a legitimate method for reducing
compulsive gambling while ensuring that financially strapped Indian
tribes have access to the airwaves to advertise their casinos, a
lucrative source of income.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said the government could not
argue they were fighting compulsive gambling while they permit ads
that encourage people to wager at Indian casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The only justification the government can have is that ``you
want the money to go to a very worthy group,'' Breyer said,
referring to the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But Breyer, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, said he had
difficulty finding constitutional a law that restricts advertising
by one group while permitting its competitor to advertise freely.
</P>
<P>
   The Newspaper Association of America and other media
organizations urged the justices to rule the federal law
unconstitutional.

 &HT;    BellSouth, AT&AMP;T expect to suffer little
 &HT;    (EDS: This version replaces CoxNet-budgeted story,
BELLSOUTH-FINGERS.)
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth and AT&AMP;T have completed a series of joint
tests the companies say show their telephone systems are secure
from the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   Both systems passed with flying colors, demonstrating that
BellSouth and AT&AMP;T will suffer little, if any, loss of service when
computer systems reach Jan. 1, 2000, the companies say.
</P>
<P>
   ``These joint tests confirm the results of an enormous amount of
preliminary Year 2000 testing we have conducted internally _ that
call completion should not be affected by the century date
change,'' said Rick Harder, BellSouth's vice president with overall
responsibilities for the company's Year 2000 compliance program.
``This testing also shows how the telecommunications industry is
collaborating on an unparalleled level in addressing the Year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests were designed to see whether Atlanta-based BellSouth's
local telephone system will continue to connect reliably with
AT&AMP;T's long-distance network and vice versa after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In five interconnected labs, the companies ran 500 tests across
the country. The companies tested wireline-to-wireline telephones,
wireline-to-wireless and wireless-to-wireless.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most comprehensive Year 2000 testing
efforts between a local exchange carrier and a long-distance
carrier to date,'' said Harder.
</P>
<P>
   Added John Pasqua, vice president of AT&AMP;T's Year 2000 program,
``We view preparing for Year 2000 as a cooperative effort, not a
competitive issue. We are publicly sharing what we have learned,
because our objective is to make the arrival of the new year
transparent to all telephone customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest successful tests reflect years of advance planning on
the part of both companies. The current project began in September
of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The recent test covered the most critical aspects of providing
local and long-distance telephone service, said the companies. They
said the testing included 911 emergency systems, local calls,
long-distance calls, toll-free calls, operator assistance, credit
cards and international calls.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is a $23 billion Baby Bell that serves the
Southeastern states. The company also provides wireless telephone
service, Internet access and wireless digital television service.
AT&AMP;T is the country's largest long-distance carrier but also
provides wireless telephone service and soon will offer cable TV in
some markets nationwide.

CLINTON CALLS ON HUNTERS FOR SUPPORT AS HE UNVEILS GUN CONTROL
MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET) 
(sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday beseeched the hunters
and sportsmen who make up much of the nation's gun culture to
accept certain regulations and restrictions as a tradeoff to help
curb the easy access to firearms and try to save lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make a plea to everybody who is waiting for the next
deer season in my home state to think about this in terms of what
our reasonable obligations to the larger community of America
are,'' Clinton said at a White House ceremony where he announced
his gun-control package, which he sent to Capitol Hill on Tuesday,
a week after the lethal rampage at a school in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who said he took up target practice when he was
12 years old in Arkansas, presented himself as a product of the gun
culture and said he understood the fear that many had that any
restrictions were a first step toward taking away their firearms.
He said the rest of society needed to persuade rural Americans that
restrictions on guns were as reasonable as metal detectors at
airports and that the inconvenience of restrictions would be worth
it by saving lives.
</P>
<P>
   His proposed legislation includes a measure to restrict the
purchase of handguns to one a month per person and to restore a
waiting period before someone could buy a gun _ two proposals that
have gone nowhere before.
</P>
<P>
   The package also includes raising the minimum age for buying a
handgun from 18 to 21, banning possession of semi-automatic assault
rifles by juveniles and requiring background checks on people who
want to buy explosives and on people who buy guns at gun shows. And
it would impose felony penalties on adults who knowingly or
recklessly allow a child to have access to a gun that is used to
commit a crime. The president would also ban the import of
large-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Republican leaders showed little interest in
Clinton's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, dismissed
gun control as ``the typical knee-jerk reaction'' to school
shootings. ``I don't think this is just about guns,'' he said,
calling instead for ``a national conference on youth and culture''
to explore the broader societal causes of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican whip who was
threatened last year by a gunman in the Capitol, accused Clinton of
trying to exploit a tragedy for political benefit. ``Only one
thought came to mind when watching the president unveil his
proposal today: How dare you?''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay added: ``I can only say to the president that your
legislation, no matter how well it polls, will not solve the
problems we face.''
</P>
<P>
   But support for some provisions came from some unlikely
quarters. Robert Ricker, executive director of the American
Shooting Sports Council, which represents the firearms industry,
said his group supported the idea of background checks on people
who buy guns at gun shows, particularly because of early reports
that some of the weapons used in Littleton were bought at such
shows. ``That will get a lot of consideration,'' he predicted.

   Al Hirt, the portly Dixieland jazz trumpeter who was a symbol of
the exuberant laissez-faire way of life of New Orleans, died
Tuesday at home in New Orleans. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Hirt had been hospitalized until last week at East Jefferson
General Hospital in Metairie, La., with liver ailments, said his
personal assistant, Peggy Stegman. He had used a wheelchair for the
last year because of edema in his leg, she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's most recognizable performers in the 1960s,
Hirt, recorded 55 albums in his career and won a Grammy award in
1963 for the song ``Java.''
</P>
<P>
   Genial, bearded, sometimes topping 300 pounds and known to some
friends as Jumbo, Hirt was a ubiquitous figure in his home town. He
had roles in several motion pictures, was a minority owner in the
city's Saints football team and ran a popular club on Bourbon
Street in the city's French Quarter for 22 years; it closed in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's part of New Orleans, like Louis Armstrong,'' said the
clarinetist Pete Fountain, a fellow New Orleans resident who knew
and played with Hirt for 55 years. ``When you say Al Hirt, you say
New Orleans. When you say New Orleans, you say Al Hirt. We're just
lucky enough to be from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Alois Maxwell Hirt was born on Nov. 7, 1922, in New Orleans, the
son of a police officer. A child prodigy, he got his first trumpet
from a pawnshop at age 6 and played his first gig in 1938 when he
was hired to blow the horn at a local race track. Besides earning
young Hirt $40 a week, the job also started a lifelong and often
-expensive passion for the ponies.
</P>
<P>
   Hirt attended the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music from 1940 to
1943 and, after a three-year stint in the Army, started his career
as a trumpet player, bandleader and songwriter, touring with big
bands, including those led by Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   He started his own band in 1950 and a combo with Fountain in
1955. In 1960, he signed with RCA Records, which released his first
album the following year. His most popular albums included
``Greatest Horn,'' ``He's the King'' and ``Bourbon Street.'' He
also had a pop single hit with ``Cotton Candy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirt continued to play at local clubs until recently, even
though he had to be wheeled on to the stage. It was a tribute to
his feisty spirit. Indeed, Fountain recalled the time in 1970 when
Hirt, riding on a float during Mardi Gras, was reportedly hit in
the lip with a brick thrown by a rowdy spectator. ``I think I was
bent over, looking up, about to throw some doubloons to some kids
when the lights went out,'' he said. ``I always told him I think he
fell on a Courvoisier bottle,'' Fountain recalled. He said they
last played together about two months ago at Fountain's Night Club
in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sat in and that was a good time that night,'' Fountain
said. ``He was having trouble getting around because his legs hurt
him, because he's so big his knees gave out. But otherwise, he was
all right. He played. He tooted with us, all the old favorites that
we have done together through the years _ `Muskrat Ramble,' `When
the Saints Go Marching In,' `A Closer Walk With Thee,' `Struttin'
with Some Barbecue' and `Jazz Me Blues.' We played all of those
that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was adept at many musical genres, Hirt was sometimes
derided by critics and jazz purists for injecting rock into jazz
numbers and pandering to mass tastes.
</P>
<P>
   He often responded by saying he was nothing more than a
crowd-pleaser. ``I'm a pop commercial musician,'' he said in a New
York Times interview in 1984. ``I'm not a jazz trumpet, and never
was a jazz trumpet. When I played in big bands for Tommy Dorsey and
Jimmy Dorsey and Ray McKinley and Horace Heidt, I played first
trumpet. I led the trumpet section. I never played jazz or
improvised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hirt's playing style was never progressive, but more of a
swing type,'' Fountain said. ``But Jumbo could play anything.
That's how schooled a musician he was. He was a good musician, very
good. He could read all the notes off the page.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirt is survived by his wife, Beverly Essel Hirt, and six
children from a previous marriage: Mary Lee Russo of Bethesda, Md.,
Rebecca Dickerson, Bridgid Mearns, Stephen Hirt, Rachel Caron and
Jennifer Sammons, all of New Orleans; a sister, Rosemary Hirt Rost;
a brother, Gerald; 10 grandchildren, 6 step-grandchilden and two
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The trumpeter, who was often also called the ``Round Mound of
Sound,'' considered one of his most important performances to have
been his 1987 solo rendition of Handel's ``Ave Maria'' for Pope
John Paul II during the pontiff's visit to New Orleans.

IN EUROPE, TENSIONS AND PATRIOTISM OVER KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This story, sent and held yesterday, is now released for
publication.) 
(kd) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ A month of war in Europe has already brought deep
changes to the continent, awakening a new sense of European
patriotism, rekindling tensions over ``American imperialism'' and
reviving the sagging fortunes of some leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Raised after World War II to reject military violence but also
to insure that the barbarism of Hitler and Stalin never be
repeated, a generation of Europeans has been abruptly forced by
events in Kosovo to a painful choice between these principles.
</P>
<P>
   In general, they have come down in favor of using military power
to try to stop the ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo and have
increasingly portrayed the fate of the province as a decisive test
of Europe's commitment to a continent freed in the 21st century of
the mass deportations and killings that marked this one.
</P>
<P>
   Ludger Volmer, Germany's deputy foreign minister and a member of
the once pacifist Green Party, said: ``We have to fight for our
Europe where boundaries no longer matter, against old notions of a
Europe of ethnic identity and race-based violence. An integrated
Europe with an open wound in the Balkans is unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unconvincing results of more than four weeks of NATO
bombing and the failure of past appeals to rally to a European
rather than national ideal, such ideas have had a surprising
resonance as image after image of desperate ragged refugees hounded
from Kosovo have filled newspapers and television screens.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of people in Britain, France, Germany and Italy
support the military campaign. A poll last week in France showed 70
percent in favor of the NATO intervention. Support for Gerhard
Schroeder, the German chancellor, has surged as his chief
preoccupation has become war rather than unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, such is the popular support that the British and French
governments have felt able to go further than President Clinton in
suggesting the use of ground forces, although the allies' summit
meeting in Washington over the weekend suggested that support for a
land war is limited and that the air campaign will persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be ready to die for Pristina,'' Kosovo's capital,
``because to die for Pristina is to die for the future of Europe,''
said Andre Glucksmann, a leading French philosopher. ``Americans
have died for Europe twice. Now we have to make sacrifices to show
this continent will no longer tolerate policies that recall
Stalin.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, Europeans have been looking to their own future. Many
see the conflict as a decisive moment for the internal politics of
the continent _ one that could give Europe the political and
military identity it has lacked even as economic ties have
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Images of trainloads of deportees, of stunned refugees with
unseeing eyes, have stirred terrible memories. In a Europe no
longer divided by the Cold War, the images have prompted a
determination to act, and to establish a continent-wide respect for
human rights that will serve as the basis for the Europe of the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   But this bold new determination to salvage Europe's pride after
a wounding century, a determination embodied most emphatically in
the oratory of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, is by no means
shared by everyone.
</P>
<P>
   With an American general directing the NATO military campaign,
deep concern or outright anger over European dependency on
Washington and over what some see as America's control over the
post-Cold War world has surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Deploring Europe's premature decision to cash in the ``peace
dividend'' and cut military spending, Lamberto Dini, the Italian
foreign minister, said: ``The United States cannot be the gendarmes
of the world, nor the mercenary soldiers for countries that do not
intend to assume military responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In a distinctly anti-American tone, some French intellectuals
have portrayed the war in Kosovo as the latest attempt by
Washington to satisfy the appetites of its military-industrial
complex, undermine Europe and bolster the unilateral power that the
United States has enjoyed since the Soviet Union collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The undeclared war in the Balkans is not a war against the
Serbs,'' Guy Declos, a French sociologist, wrote in the French
daily Le Monde. ``It is a war against Europe.'' Disguised as a
fight for a certain morality, it is in reality a struggle to
``stamp out definitively any hope of a multi-polar planet,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such anti-Americanism is not new in France; but its
tone has been sharpened by events in Kosovo, and found strong
echoes among small left-wing European parties, though not with the
dominant center-left forces led by the likes of Blair and the
French premier, Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, it appears that a crisis of European-American
relations has been averted, although one could develop if the
current confusion turned into an irreversible debacle.
</P>
<P>
   A rupture in relations with Russia has also been avoided, and
Western governments now seem determined to back a Russian-led peace
bid because President Boris Yeltsin's influence in Belgrade is
considerable. Whatever the outcome of this diplomacy, concern is
strong, particularly in Germany, that Moscow not be alienated.
</P>
<P>
   After Europe's profound failure in Bosnia, a war the European
Union initially volunteered to stop and much later saw halted by a
``Pax Americana,'' the desire to assert a political and military
identity with a success in Kosovo is strong.
</P>
<P>
   And with the arrival this year of the common European currency,
the euro, the continent has been casting around for some new
catalyst for the political and military integration that has been
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo could be our military euro, creating a political and
defense identity for the European Union in the same way as the euro
is the expression of economic and financial integration,'' said
Ulrich Beck, a professor of politics at Munich University.
</P>
<P>
   But the attainment of a ``military euro'' is evidently a long
way off. A month of bombing has failed to bring any of the results
NATO had sought, and the longer the war continues, the sharper the
tensions in Europe are likely to become.
</P>
<P>
   Volmer, the German deputy foreign minister, said he thought his
Green Party, the junior partner in the governing coalition, would
be unable to accept the dispatch of ground troops if NATO moved in
that direction to break the impasse. ``This could bring down the
German government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens are to hold a congress on May 13 at which they are
likely to vote on this issue. The tensions in the party reflect the
way the conversion of Volmer and of the foreign minister, Joschka
Fischer, to supporting military force against Yugoslavia has by no
means been followed by all members of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Similar tensions may emerge in Italy's coalition government,
where the former Communists are very uneasy about ground forces,
even as the British and French governments push the view that a
long war fought only with air power may risk losing public support.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a war in which the only victims are civilians does not
appear likely to command widespread support indefinitely in a
continent where the idea of ``body bags'' is more acceptable as a
price of war than it is in the United States.

33,000 US RESERVISTS ON TAP FOR BALKANS DUTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Tuesday deepened US involvement
in the Balkan conflict by authorizing 33,102 reservists for active
duty, as a US envoy reported no breakthrough in talks with Russian
leaders in Moscow aimed at ending the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's move cleared the way for the largest mobilization of
US reserve forces since the Gulf War in 1991. In the first wave of
the deployment, the Pentagon immediately called up more than 2,100
members of the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard from units
in eight states.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the additional 31,000 reservists, from every branch
of the military, are expected to be activated ``over the coming
days and weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The development was one of several indications that NATO's
assault on Yugoslavia, now in its fifth week, is unlikely to end
soon.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott reported
no significant progress in his talks with Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov and Russia's envoy to the Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
Both sides were trying to bridge the vast diplomatic gulf between
NATO and Yugoslavia's embattled president, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign the US government foresees no quick exit from
the conflict, Republicans in Congress were preparing to double
Clinton's request for $6 billion to fund the US role through
September in the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
   The moves came as the United Nations for the first time
described the teeming refugee camps in Macedonia as ``hopelessly
overcrowded'' and Russia estimated the NATO campaign has already
destroyed $100 billion in Yugoslav property.
</P>
<P>
   These other developments unfolded on the 35th day of the NATO
airstrikes:
</P>
<P>
   -- NATO jets pounded Serb forces in round-the-clock attacks, and
one struck a civilian community in southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Local authorities in Surdulica, 200 miles south of Belgrade,
said at least 17 people were killed and 11 wounded when NATO
missiles struck the agricultural community Tuesday afternoon. The
dead and injured included women and children. Rescuers were
searching the rubble for more victims.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press reporter, taken to the scene by Serb police,
saw 50 destroyed homes and 600 damaged. Rescue workers said 11
people, including five children, were believed trapped in the
basement of one house.
</P>
<P>
   Explosions also rocked the Belgrade suburbs of Topcider, Senjak,
Resnik and Rakovica early Wednesday, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   -- NATO leaders claimed that morale among Milosevic's troops has
grown so dismal that several hundred troops a week are deserting
their units and that the special police are going door to door to
roust reserve troops who have balked at calls to mobilize. And five
retired Yugoslav generals, apparently at odds with Milosevic,
reportedly have been placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO siege ``is adding to the chaos of war that Milosevic is
now suffering,'' said British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook. ``It is
creating confusion throughout his forces and adding to the stress
that is mounting on daily in the minds of his military commanders
and putting doubt in the mind of his forces on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Clinton administration prepared to impose an embargo on
all US exports to Serbia other than humanitarian supplies. The move
comes after reports that US oil companies have been delivering fuel
to Yugoslavia at the same time the US government has been trying
unsuccessfully to coordinate a global embargo against oil shipments
to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   -- The House International Relations Committee unanimously
rejected a resolution that would compel the United States to
declare war against Yugoslavia or withdraw from the conflict.
Another resolution calling for the United States to pull out of the
NATO operation entirely was defeated, 30-19.
</P>
<P>
   Both measures will be debated Wednesday by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rebuffing warnings from the White House, Reverend Jesse
Jackson said he will leave for Yugoslavia Wednesday with a
delegation of US religious leaders who hope to secure the release
of three American soldiers. The delegation includes Reverend
Raymond Glen Helmick, a Roman Catholic priest from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a perilous journey,'' Jackson said. ``If God be with us,
we'll succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said the group's safety cannot be
guaranteed and expressed concern that Milosevic would use their
mission for propaganda purposes. ``Ultimately, the decision is
theirs to make,'' said David Leavy, the White House national
security spokesman. ``Our responsibility, from our vantage point,
is to make clear the risks.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A Red Cross doctor examined the three US soldiers and found
them to be in satisfactory condition. Red Cross officials also
picked up letters home from the soldiers: Staff Sergeant Andrew A.
Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sergeant Christopher J. Stone of
Smiths Creek, Mich.; and Specialist Steven M. Gonzalez, 21, of
Huntsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   -- Russia and China, which oppose the NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia, blocked the United Nations Security Council from
issuing a strong statement on the refugee crisis in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In a related matter, the Pentagon confirmed that the first wave
of 20,000 Kosovar refugees who will be placed with relatives in the
United States will be processed and possibly housed temporarily at
Fort Dix in New Jersey. There was no indication when the refugees
will begin arriving.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees fleeing from
Milosevic's campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo descended on
six refugee camps, which already are clogged beyond capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian leaders, appealing for urgent financial aid from the
European Union, expressed fear that an additional 150,000 Kosovar
refugees will pour into their struggling nation, which will be too
destitute to provide any more help.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 140,000 refugees already have fled to Macedonia, a
fraction of the 1.4 million ethnic Albanians who have been driven
from their homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Hope for a swift settlement to the crisis had risen in recent
days after Chernomyrdin and a Yugoslav deputy premier, Vuk
Draskovic, each indicated Milosevic appeared open to negotiating a
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Chernomyrdin, after meeting Tuesday with Talbott and Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, said NATO ``will not be fully
satisfied'' with Milosevic's demand that he approve which countries
would participate in a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.

PARK PLACE TO BUY CAESARS CASINOS FROM STARWOOD FOR $3 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a deal that will reshape the gambling business in Atlantic
City, N.J., and Las Vegas, Park Place Entertainment agreed Tuesday
to acquire the Caesars casino operations of Starwood Hotels &AMP;
Resorts for $3 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will create a serious rival in Atlantic City to Donald
Trump, where Park Place will have three casinos with nearly as much
gambling space as Trump's, while casinos owned by Park Place
Entertainment in Las Vegas will dominate three of the four corners
at the Strip and Flamingo Boulevard, the most valuable gambling
real estate site on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Park Place, a recent spinoff from Hilton Hotels,
jumped nearly 25 percent Tuesday, closing at $11.375, up $2.25,
while Starwood fell 68.75 cents, to $34.3125.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Park Place's cash flow, or earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, will be about $1.3
billion, nearly twice that of the next largest gambling company,
Harrah's Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   For Starwood, the world's largest hotel company, the cash
payment will allow it to reduce its $8 billion of debt by more than
one-third, lowering interest charges enough to increase earnings by
about 7 cents a share in the first year, said Jim Gallagher, a
Starwood spokesman. ``This will bring us much closer to our goal of
being able to issue investment grade debt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the $3 billion price ``might represent a small loss''
for Starwood on the price it paid plus improvements to the casino
properties, which it acquired just 17 months ago. Others estimated
the loss at more than $500 million based on the purchase price and
investments Starwood made.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place chief executive Arthur Goldberg said: ``By acquiring
the Caesars brand name and related customer data base, we plan to
heavily cross market between our destination resorts. This will
boost revenues and expand the markets where we operate.''
</P>
<P>
   He projected savings of $50 million a year in operating costs, a
figure that two analysts said was probably low given Goldberg's
record of cutting costs in previous deals by as much as twice what
he promised.
</P>
<P>
   The deal to sell the casinos comes less than four months after
Park Place was created by spinning off Hilton's gambling
properties, including the Flamingo in Las Vegas and the Bally
casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a triumph for two casino executives known for making
smart deals who joined forces in December 1996 when Hilton Hotels
acquired Bally Entertainment. One is Goldberg, who was a New Jersey
trucking company owner before 1990, when he took over Bally
Manufacturing, a debt-ridden maker of slot machines and operator of
casinos and health clubs. The other is Stephen Bollenbach, the
chief executive of Hilton and chairman of Park Place Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly all of 1997, the two men tried to buy the casino and
hotel properties of ITT Inc., the conglomerate run by Rand Araskog.
But Hilton dropped out of the bidding in December 1997, with
Bollenbach saying that the price ITT wanted was to high. Starwood
was the winning bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal leaves them gratified that they were right and that
this was the wrong acquisition for Starwood at the wrong price,''
said William Moore, an analyst at Forum Capital Markets in Old
Greenwich, Conn. ``This deal shows that they were justified that
they walked away when the price was too high, especially since the
guy who paid too much has to come back and sell to them. And Steve
Bollenbach likes to be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, Jason Ader of Bear Stearns, said the deal
``could be a positive for the Atlantic City market because you will
have a greater concentration within fewer companies and are less
likely to have foolish marketing decisions'' such as big coin
giveaways to lure slot machine gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's bad for the value gambler, good for the investors,''
Ader said of the expected tight rein on giveaways to customers.
</P>
<P>
   It cost 11 percent more to gamble at Bally's Park Place than
next door at Caesars, which was more willing to extend
complimentaries like free drinks for blackjack players and private
jets to fly in high rollers, a 1990 study by National Economic
Research Associates showed.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bally's Park Place, an extension of its gambling area called
Wild West and Caesars will be owned by the same company. Park Place
Entertainment also owns the Atlantic City Hilton, formerly the
Golden Nugget, at the south end of the Boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   These three Atlantic City properties will have 27.6 percent of
the gambling floor space, compared with 29.9 percent for the three
Trump casinos, according to records of the New Jersey Casino
Control Commission.
</P>
<P>
   On the Las Vegas Strip, Park Place will acquire Caesars Palace.
It already owns three casinos across the Strip from Caesars: the
Flamingo Hilton, Bally's Las Vegas and Paris, which is scheduled to
open in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   After the deal closes, the company will have 15 percent of the
casino space on the Strip and 18 percent of the hotel rooms, said
Adam Brecht, a spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was a loss for Mirage Resorts Inc., which owns casinos
on each side of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas that its chief
executive, Steve Wynn, wants to connect with a monorail.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place is also acquiring Caesars casinos in Lake Tahoe,
Nev., riverboat casinos in Mississippi and Indiana, slot machines
at Dover Downs Race Track in Delaware and interests in various
gambling operations from Canada to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place did not buy Starwood's Desert Inn, which, with its
own golf course on about 35 acres, is one of the large tracts of
developable land left along the Strip in Las Vegas.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton ordered a call-up of 33,102
reservists Tuesday, to serve up to nine months of active duty in
the Kosovo air campaign. It was the biggest military call-up since
the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The first group of 2,100 air reservists and guard members who
are part of refueling tanker crews will be sent quickly to the
region. They are drawn from air bases in Arizona, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, California, Alabama, Wisconsin, Indiana and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   In authorizing the call-up, Clinton said in a statement Tuesday
that the remaining reservists would be sent in the coming days and
weeks ``from all branches of the service to fill critical support
positions in our humanitarian and combat operations in and around
the former Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank each reservist, their families and loved ones, and
their employers here at home for their service and sacrifice,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The call-up was set off by NATO's request for 300 more planes to
allow Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's top military commander, to
expand the air campaign against Yugoslavia to a 24-hour operation
and to broaden the range of targets that NATO forces can attack in
Kosovo and the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Refueling tankers that can keep the airplanes flying day and
night are essential to the operation. The first reservists include
the crews for 21 more KC-135E refueling tankers from the reserves.
Six more tankers will be sent to Kosovo from active duty.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of these 300 aircraft, the U.S. contribution
to the Kosovo air campaign is approaching the level of aircraft
used in a major war and could soon require nearly half of all of
the Air Force's refueling tankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be over the level of aircraft we had in Desert Storm,''
said Maj. Gen. Michael Kudlacz, deputy chief of staff for air and
space operations for the Air Force, referring to the operation
during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   A major review of American defense capabilities undertaken in
1997 concluded that the United States must be prepared to fight two
major wars as well as several contingency missions. The Kosovo air
operation began as the smaller type of mission, but has been
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Clinton authorized the Air Force to enact an order
that prevents pilots and other critical service members from
retiring or leaving the Air Force before the Kosovo air war ends.
The Air Force will put the order into effect in the next several
days, said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new tankers will be based in Hungary, whose prime
minister said on Sunday that his nation _ the newest NATO member
and the only one bordering on Yugoslavia _ would open up its three
airfields to NATO aircraft for the war. An agreement was reached
between Hungary and NATO on Monday that allows the Pentagon to send
the new tankers and with them, the reserves being called up.
</P>
<P>
   In requiring the reservists to serve until next January, the
Pentagon said it was hoping to avoid the problems that arose during
the Gulf War, when some of the reservists were required to extend
their initial terms of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, we hadn't given enough days in the call-up and they
had to extend,'' said Maj. Gen. Jimmy Sherrard, commander of the
Air Force Reserve. ``That created real difficulties for them and
their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The call-up during the Gulf War also caused problems for the
employers of the reservists, leading to changes in the way the
reserve operates. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said Tuesday that he
would introduce legislation that would help small businesses
employing reservists who are called up by providing loan deferments
and low-interest loan assistance from the Small Business
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The total call-up includes up to 25,000 reservists from the Air
Force, 892 reservists from the Navy, 1,000 from the Marines, 10
from the Coast Guard, and the rest from the Army, Kudlacz said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said, ``We'll move up to that total in a relatively quick
time.''
</P>
<P>
   With reservists already reporting for duty Tuesday at their
bases across the country, the Pentagon hoped to have the first
reservists off to Italy and Hungary by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the reservists put on active duty Tuesday were already
serving in the air operation as volunteers, said Sherrard. They
will be allowed to return home and make necessary preparations for
a return to active duty in Europe.

CLINTON MAKES NEW PUSH FOR RESTRICTIONS ON GUNS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Plunging into a politically nettlesome issue in the
wake of last week's shooting at a Colorado high school, President
Clinton on Tuesday made a renewed push for a series of gun control
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by sympathetic lawmakers, the president offered his
gun initiatives, many of which have previously met with little
success in the GOP-controlled Congress. Republican leaders quickly
dismissed the president's proposals as a simplistic answer to
school violence. They proposed instead a national conference on
youth and culture.
</P>
<P>
   The key White House proposals are:
</P>
<P>
   Requiring background checks for those who purchase firearms at
gun shows and for those who buy explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Imposing felony penalties on adults who knowingly allow children
to gain access to guns that are used to cause injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the age of the youth handgun ban from 18 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   Mandating safety locks on all guns.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring a three-day waiting period before the purchase of
guns. A waiting period had been required under the Brady Law, but
it had expired when instant background checks became available.
</P>
<P>
   Banning the importation of all large-capacity ammunition
magazines that allow the firing of more than 10 rounds of
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   In rolling out the gun initiatives, both the president and first
lady conceded that the killing of 12 students and a teacher in
Colorado by two students was the result of a complex mix of
factors, including violence in the media and on video games. But
they said access to guns was clearly part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is criminal how easy it is for children in America to
obtain guns,'' said Hillary Rodham Clinton. ``Guns and children are
two words that should never be put together in the same sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, however, reflected on the political resistance to
gun control, explaining that many Americans, including those in his
home state of Arkansas, are resistant to laws they unreasonably
fear would restrict their ability to hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the culture of violence that has to change; it's
the culture of hunting and sport shooting that has to stop
financing efforts to frighten their members, who are good,
God-fearing, law-abiding, tax-paying citizens out there, into
believing that every time you try to save a kid's life, it's a
camel's nose in the tent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that gun control should be compared to metal
detectors at the airport in that it is a necessary inconvenience
that ensures safer travel.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to criticism that gun control doesn't work, the
president said, ``we've got to get out of this crazy denial that
this won't make a difference Just because it won't make all the
difference doesn't won't mean it won't make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's gun control proposals have fared poorly in Congress
since the Republicans took control in 1994. And there was no
indication that GOP leaders would be more receptive this time
despite the Colorado shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., dismissed the
president's plan, calling it a ``typical knee-jerk reaction. Oh,
goodness, we've had a crime, therefore we need gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, accused the
president of trying to exploit the high school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only say to the president that your legislation, no
matter how well it polls, will not solve the problems we face,''
DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to change the subject from gun control, Lott and House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, D-Ill., said they would commence a National
Conference on Youth that would turn to experts to examine a number
of issues facing students, including video games, drugs in schools
and parental involvement.
</P>
<P>
   While opposition to gun control has been strongest within the
Republican Party, even some Democrats have been wary of embracing
the issue that hurts their lawmakers from rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The top two Democrats in Congress, Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D. and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
did not attend the White House event.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, who represents a largely rural state, said earlier this
week that he wasn't sure gun legislation was the answer to the
latest school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Even gun control proponents who attended the president's
announcement voiced skepticism that the measures would move through
Congress without strong public pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go to the congressional hearing. They'll say we'll look
at it and that will be the end until the next shooting,'' said Rep.
Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband was killed in a shooting on
the Long Island Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   However, McCarthy is an example of how gun control can be a
potent issue in the suburbs where many swing voters frown on GOP
resistance to restrictions on firearms. McCarthy beat a Republican
incumbent who opposed gun control.

BOMBING SUSPECT'S GIRLFRIEND BOUGHT GUNS, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The young woman who accompanied Dylan Klebold
to the senior prom purchased at least two of the four weapons used
in the April 20 massacre at Columbine High School, police said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robyn Anderson, 18, who friends say is an honor roll student and
respected Klebold's quick wit and sharp mind, was interviewed by
police and released without being charged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Anderson _ whom they identified as a witness and not
as suspect _ was not at school on the day of the shooting. But they
believe a semiautomatic pistol and a rifle used in the rampage were
purchased by Anderson at a Denver-area gun show late last year.
</P>
<P>
   As Littleton buried more of the victims Tuesday, Jefferson
County police continued pursuing the more than 350 tips they have
recieved since Klebold and Eric Harris carried out their deadly
assault on classmates.
</P>
<P>
   A Colorado Springs gun dealer, Mel Bernstein, phoned police
shortly after the shooting to say he recognized Harris as one
member of a group of teens who tried to buy guns in his store in
early March. Tuesday, police said a surveillance camera in
Bernstein's Dragon Arms store apparently did not capture Harris or
his friends on tape, but they do not discount his report.
</P>
<P>
   The information could prove valuable if Bernstein eventually can
identify acquaintances who were aware of the planned attack or were
involved in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them you had to be 21 years old'' to purchase a
handgun, Bernstein said in a telephone interview. ``That's when the
girl spoke up,'' Bernstein recalled, adding that he believed it was
Anderson, but wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Well I could by it for them,' '' Bernstein said.
But he said he asked the group of youths to leave the store before
they bought anything.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said he remembers Harris because he did most of the
talking for the group of teens, some wearing long black trench
coats, and that he asked most of the questions about the powerful
assault rifles for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has hired an attorney to represent her throughout the
investigation. She could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, an 18-year-old person can buy a rifle, but
not a pistol, from a federally licensed gun dealer. But Colorado
allows an 18-year-old to buy a handgun in a private sale, such as
those in gun shows. However, the buyer could not provide the
handgun to a person younger than 18.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold was 17, and Harris turned 18 earlier this month.
Anderson was 18 last November.
</P>
<P>
   Police also said Tuesday that they have confirmed that Harris
and Klebold both shot and killed themselves, clearing up questions
about whether they died in a murder-suicide or not. Police also
disclosed that they have now recovered more than 60 homemade
explosives from the hallways of the high school, and from several
vehicles in the school lot.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Davis said
investigators believe it is ``likely'' that Harris and Klebold had
help planting the explosives and carrying four weapons, including
two sawed-off shotguns, to school.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said police continue to theorize that Harris and Klebold,
who both attended the junior-senior prom on the night of Saturday,
April 17, spent time prowling the hallways and hiding explosives
while their classmates danced in the gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   The boys killed 12 students and one teacher, and wounded 20
others. Ten students remain hospitalized, and Monday, 18-year-old
Valeen Schnurr was released from the hospital, a homecoming that
freiends called a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Schnurr was, like her friend Cassie Burnall, asked by one of the
presumed killers whether she believed in God. Moments after she
replied that she did, she was shot four times. She survived, though
her close friend Burnall, who is being remembered as a Christian
martyr for confirming her faith to the gunmen, did not.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine High School students will resume classes Monday. They
will share Chatfield High School with their peers, with students
from each of the schools attending clases for a half-day.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday at 11:21 a.m. there was a city-wide moment of silence
marking the one week that has passed since Harris and Klebold
declared war on Columbine High. Investigators continue to use a
diary dicovered in Harris's bedroom to help lead them to friends
and acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   In the diary, Harris refers to himself under the code name
``Rebel'' _ apparently lifted from Columbine High School's Rebels
athletic teams. And he refers to Klebold with the moniker
``Vodka.''
</P>
<P>
   One of their victims, Dan Rohrbugh 15, was buried Tuesday, and
several students in this sprawling high school who had never met
him stepped to a podium to recall how he held a school door open
while hundreds escaped, only to be shot just as he was stepping to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Tuesday at the funeral of Kyle Velasquez, 16, the Rev.
Wayne Lagrone urged mourners to look for answers to widespread
societal violence within themselves and to fight against evil.
Lagrone said: ``There is no doubt in my mind those two young
assailants were acting under satanic intervention.''

 &HT;    Millwood takes outing in stride
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The difference for Kevin Millwood came down to two
inches. That's how much he shortened his stride on the mound Monday
night, which freed up his delivery and resulted in his most
effective start not only this season but perhaps over his last 16
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that Kevin has a tendency to get spread out all
over the place, especially when he reaches back for something
extra,'' said pitching coach Leo Mazzone. ``That will throw him off
target.''
</P>
<P>
   With a slightly shortened stride at Florida, Millwood limited
the Marlins to four hits in 7 1/3 innings, his lowest hit yield
dating back to July 4th, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just shortened (his stride) a little bit,'' Millwood said.
``I really wasn't even thinking about that while I was pitching. I
was just trying to slow down, throw a lot smoother. Try to be more
free and easy.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. After the Marlins nicked him for two runs in the
fourth, Millwood retired the next 12 men he faced. He allowed just
one hit to the last 15 batters. He was only charged with the third
run after reliever Kevin McGlinchy walked consecutive batters to
force in Bruce Aven, who has singled off Millwood to open the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the lineup
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko made his first start at first base in 13 days while
nursing a sore right hamstring. He had just one at-bat in the last
nine games entering Tuesday night, interrupting a strong 11-for-27
start from the season-opening homestand.
</P>
<P>
   But while Klesko used nearly two weeks to recover, third baseman
Chipper Jones was back in action after sitting out just one game
with a strained left adductor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel it's bad enough to keep me out,'' Jones said. ``I
feel I could do some damage to it but I'm not going to sit by and
watch. Can't do it. Go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   No hurry
</P>
<P>
   Though right-hander Russ Springer has pitched effectively on his
re-hab assignment at Class AAA Richmond, the Braves aren't
comfortable enough to activate him. After a pair of extended spring
training appearances, he has pitched in three Richmond games,
retiring nine of the 10 men he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bounced back and is throwing the ball very well,''
general manager John Schuerholz said. ``He's very, very close. In
fact, he is ready. It's just a matter of being certain that we
protect him and protect ourselves. Because that's a substantial
operation the guy had.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely three months have passed since Springer had parts of a
herniated disk removed from his lower back. He should be activated
by the second week of May.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves stole 19 bases in their first 18 games. The club did
not reach 19 last season until the 33rd game, on May 6. . . The
Braves opened the night with a .281 team average, 44 points higher
than when they left town April 11.

SCHOOL ATTACK MAY CAUSE CHANGE IN POLICE TACTICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING) 
(sw) 
 By TIMOTHY EGAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After a decade of the largest buildup ever of special
weapons squads by American police departments, the siege at
Columbine High School has shown many officers a new kind of
domestic terror _ and one that tests the limits of training and
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Shooters spraying people indiscriminately and setting off bombs
in a school are not what most SWAT teams are trained for. While the
use of the teams _ SWAT is an acronym for special weapons and
tactics _ has grown nearly tenfold, the units have primarily been
used for drug raids and hostage situations.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbine, the SWAT team followed standard procedure by
moving very deliberately _ and on live television, seemingly
extremely slowly _ prompting criticism that more lives could have
been saved if they had moved more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado police dispute that contention. But in the wake of
at least a half-dozen multiple-victim school shootings in the past
18 months, some SWAT units have changed their planning. For these
agencies, the student with an arsenal is now considered a more
likely threat than an outside terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got blueprints now of every single school in this
county, which we keep inside the SWAT vehicles,'' said Maj. Steve
Ijames, who heads a SWAT unit for the Springfield, Mo., Police
Department. ``We're preparing for this very thing to happen. We're
training other jurisdictions in this. And when it does happen, we
are ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Most SWAT teams are trained to follow a deliberate process,
usually establishing a perimeter of officers around a site, then
taking steps to free people held hostage, as was done in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The violence at Columbine, which left 15 people dead, presented
officers with what they call an ``active shooter,'' someone who is
not holed up but is on a killing offensive. Time, usually an ally
of a SWAT team, works against them in such a case because the
shooter is trying to kill as many people as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly will go down as the worst-case SWAT scenario of
the century,'' said Larry Glick, executive director of the National
Tactical Officers Association, which provides training for hundreds
of police agencies. Ijames, who teaches SWAT tactics to officers
from around the country, said one of the lessons of the Columbine
shooting is that elite police units should be trained in new
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surrounding a school may not be the best thing to do,'' Ijames
said. ``The goal should be to take out the hostage-taker.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching what appeared to be a slow-motion response to a high
school laden with explosives and under fire by two heavily-armed
students, some police officers were openly critical of the SWAT
response in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Patrick, a veteran officer from Westminster, a suburb of
Denver, called the SWAT response ``pathetic,'' and told the Denver
Post, ``I think they should have been more dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   Television showed groups of officers slowly surrounding the
school and crouching behind vehicles as students fled classrooms
with their arms in the air. Jefferson County sheriff's deputies say
the television images did not show what was going on inside the
school, where a makeshift SWAT team had entered the building within
30 minutes of the first call to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Davis, a spokesman for the Jefferson sheriff's office,
said SWAT members from at least four different police jurisdictions
were able to surround the school, prevent the shooters from
escaping, and saved many lives by quickly moving police officers
inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado police say that because of the confusion at the
scene _ fire alarms going off, water pouring down from sprinklers,
gunfire, bombs, screaming students and wounded victims _ the first
officers to arrive did not immediately know how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   An armed deputy, routinely posted at the school, fired at the
two student shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, within minutes
after the gunfire erupted, the police say. The deputy called for
backup, and officers from several agencies in the Denver area
responded.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether a specially-trained unit could have
entered the school immediately and perhaps saved more lives. The
police have not said whether SWAT members fired shots at the
gunmen. They have speculated that the shooters could have been dead
for up to two hours after television seemed to show the school
still under siege.
</P>
<P>
   Four elements _ an active shooter, numerous deaths and injuries,
hundreds of bystanders and a sprawling location _ combined to make
Columbine a SWAT unit's worst nightmare, Glick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Why didn't SWAT move in faster?'' Glick said.
``If I was a parent at that school, with my child inside, I'd be
asking the same thing. But I think you have to give the police in
Colorado credit. It's a wonder they did as well as they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, asked about the police response,
praised the investigation but did not elaborate on SWAT details.
</P>
<P>
   David Klinger, a former Los Angeles police officer who is a
professor at the University of Houston and studies SWAT teams, gave
qualified praise to the Colorado police. ``Clearly, what they had
was a dynamic event where SWAT had to go in and do what they don't
like to do _ respond quickly without getting all the information,''
he said. ``In this situation, officers need to ratchet things up
and respond a lot more quickly than they normally would.''
</P>
<P>
   The tactical officers association has trained members of the
Littleton and the Jefferson County SWAT teams involved in the
Colorado case. The association director, Glick, defended their
actions. ``When you see these people at Columbine called cowards _
that just turns my stomach,'' he said. But he added that the
Columbine shootings were likely to prompt changes in how the teams
are trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an active shooter going after people at random _
a shooter with a plan,'' he said, ``that's completely different
than your typical barricade hostage situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Glick and other police officers cautioned that an overly
aggressive SWAT unit can often get into trouble. SWAT teams, which
are typically not full-time units, have been criticized for causing
deaths and excessive property damage by acting too hastily. The
Branch Davidian standoff in Waco, Texas, in which a police assault
led by federal agents ended in deaths of many people trapped in a
religious compound, has become a symbol of what can go wrong.

GUN SHOWS JUST ONE EASY SOURCE FOR GUNS, OBSERVERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The law of the land is that a person must be at
least 18 to buy a rifle or a shotgun, and 21 years of age to
purchase a handgun. But reality tells a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Buying firearms, including a sawed-off shotgun, is sometimes as
easy for a teenager as buying a pack of cigarettes, gun control
advocates say and federal agents privately confirm. It is as easy
as surfing the net or the newspaper for ads, finding a pal to buy a
gun for you, or going to one of the more than 5,000 gun shows
annually.
</P>
<P>
   There, minors can find an unlicensed dealer to unwittingly or
uncaringly sell them a firearm without having to worry about
background checks, waiting periods, paper trails _ or coming under
the scrutiny of federal agents who have an unwritten policy of not
attending such shows unless they believe an illegal transfer is
taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say a woman identified as Robyn K. Anderson, the
18-year-old girlfriend of Colorado high school gunman Dylan
Klebold, apparently attended a Denver-area gun show late last year
where she apparently bought at least two of the weapons used to
kill a dozen students and a teacher last week.
</P>
<P>
   State laws on possessing and transferring firearms are more
lenient than laws governing firearm purchases by minors. In some
states, such as Texas and Wyoming, an individual does not have to
be 18 _ or even 15 or 10 _ to possess a handgun. And in almost half
the states, there is no minimum age requirement for minors
possessing a rifle or a shotgun, according to a review of state
laws by Handgun Control Inc. That includes the Hi-Point 9mm
semiautomatic rifle gun-control advocates say has the features of a
military-style assault weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's law made it legal for Anderson to give the shotguns,
if their barrels were not sawed off, and the rifle she apparently
bought shortly after her 18th birthday to Klebold, as long as she
did not know that the weapons would be used in a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has not been arrested and appears to be cooperating
with authorities, who stopped short of describing her as a suspect
but who are now reportedly trying to determine whether she had
knowledge of the planned massacre.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in a speech Tuesday implored Congress to pass
legislation closing the ``gun-show loophole,'' which allows
hobbyists and gun collectors _ some of whom are actually dealers _
to sell guns without filing any paperwork or conducting background
checks. Guns can literally disappear without a trace at these
shows, which agents from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms
say are popular among criminals as well as law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Such a measure even has the backing of the gun industry's
lobbying group, the American Shooting Sports Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ASSC board of directors supports increased funding for the
ATF and ... the concept of background checks and a paper trail for
those purchasing guns at gun shows,'' said Jack Adkins, the
association's director of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike gun shows, little is known about the use of the Internet
to buy weapons, but gun control advocates warn that it has the
potential to become an unregulated arms bazaar that is vulnerable
to fraudulent transations and is attractive to teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet provides instant access to a wide variety of
guns,'' said Kristen Rand, director of federal policy at the
Violence Policy Center in Washington, a gun-control research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has an endless source of ads and opportunities to buy guns.
But the real danger is that the Internet is completely blind: The
seller can't see the buyer and evaluate if that person looks young
or unbalanced or suspicious. Gun laws are designed for face-to-face
transactions, which the Internet erases, and that is really
dangerous,'' Rand said.
</P>
<P>
   The other alleged gunman, Eric Harris, may have been among five
teenagers who last month tried to buy an MP-5 automatic rifle and
an M-60 machine gun from a gun dealer who said he refused to sell
the firearms because the group appeared to be under age, according
to news accounts. Federal agents, however, have said the videotape
provided by the gun dealer was inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, it is illegal for anyone to buy a machine gun
without applying for a license, filling out an application, and
paying a tax to the ATF.
</P>
<P>
   But most states have dramatically tightened restrictions on
buying and possessing sawed-off shotguns. There is, however, a
healthy ``secondary market'' for automatics like machine guns and
the high-capacity magazines they require, according to the ATF and
gun specialists.

 &HT;    Threats of violence in abundance after school shooting
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A week after the bloody attack at a Colorado high
school, a wave of bomb threats and rumors at Georgia schools has
frayed nerves even further, leaving communities tense and nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a level of apprehension everywhere,'' said Alan Wood,
principal of Newnan High School in Coweta County.
</P>
<P>
   Across the U.S., scores of students have been suspended for
calling in bomb threats, threatening classmates and teachers, and
wearing black trench coats like those worn by the two Columbine
High School seniors who killed a dozen classmates and a teacher
before turning their guns on themselves. On Tuesday, all 146 public
schools in Washington, D.C., were evacuated after a caller warned a
bomb would go off in one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes of high school evacuations are also repeating across
metro Atlanta. Since the April 20 massacre in Littleton:
</P>
<P>
   _ Babb Middle School in Forest Park, Ga. was evacuated Thursday,
Friday and Monday due to bomb scares.
</P>
<P>
   _ On Tuesday, Brookwood High School in Snellville and Norcross
High School were evacuated after bomb threats. Norcross students
returned after police, accompanied by a bomb-sniffing dog, searched
the building. Those at Brookwood, where a fake pipe bomb was found,
were sent home for the day.
</P>
<P>
   _ DeKalb county police arrested a 15-year-old Cedar Grove High
School student Monday who told school officials he was going to
blow up the school. Police searched his house with his parents'
permission but found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, the grounds of Brookwood High filled with
nervous agitation as 2,700 students were evacuated and more than
100 scared parents descended on the school. Parents watched
anxiously, some crying with each other, a few gathering for a
prayer. Several parents who found their children hugged them
dearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent four days crying for those children'' in Colorado,
said Deb Callewaert, who has two daughters at Brookwood. ``Now I
have to wonder if it's going to happen tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Adam Mailliez was standing in front of the school,
waiting for a field trip to the Gwinnett jail to begin, when police
cars screamed into the parking lot and officers ordered students
into an outdoor stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are all paranoid now,'' he said, adding he figured it
was a hoax from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the students took it lightly. As freshman Cassie
Callewaert walked out of her classroom she locked arms with a
friend. ``You're my bodyguard,'' she told him, stressing they must
stay together.
</P>
<P>
   Once assured of their children's safety, parents' anger toward
the prankster came out. ``I want to wring that person's neck,''
said Joan Kline.
</P>
<P>
   At Norcross High School, where 2,000 students waited 90 minutes
on the football bleachers, the upset was made worse by the slaying
Saturday in Atlanta of a popular social studies teacher. A
makeshift memorial to Philip Rau stood near the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy. One day a teacher dies and the next there's a bomb
scare,'' said Melissa Reyes, a 19-year-old senior.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, students and educators seemed at a loss to explain the
rash of anti-social acts, coming at a time of national mourning and
healing. Many said they're shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as though every crazy person in the world has come out
after Columbine,'' said Brookwood parent Teresa Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened sense of vulnerability has spurred many people to
action. School phones have been ringing off the hook as parents
call inquiring about security measures. Cobb County schools are
reporting high levels of absenteeism.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which usually declines to
report on bomb scares, has noted the recent threats and the
accompanying unrest.
</P>
<P>
   A hastily organized group in Norcross, which calls itself the
National School safety Advocate Association, says it has 500
signatures supporting more police in county schools.
</P>
<P>
   School security has risen to the top of many communities'
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Daniel Elementary School in Dacula has taken to locking its
back doors to ensure visitors enter only though the front of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Alpharetta City Council member Debbie Gibson has asked
police Chief Dana Davis to offer free security checks at local
schools. ``School administrators and parents are not experts in
security,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Even seemingly minor school incidents are receiving significant
attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, Cherokee County police have arrested a handful
of students for threatening other students or teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's society, and in light of what just happened, you
can't take anything too lightly,'' said Cherokee Sheriff Roger
Garrison.
</P>
<P>
   A Cobb County second-grader was suspended for a day when he
brought a bullet to school. The boy told the principal that he
found it on a playground in Atlanta. School officials met with the
boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   But as people scramble for news, rumors are quickly taking on
the ring of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, rumors among students of a bomb hidden on the
grounds at Lovejoy High School in Clayton County prompted an
evacuation. Again, nothing was found.
</P>
<P>
   In Cherokee, rumors of a bomb spread quickly on morning buses,
reaching panicked parents who called the police. Detectives did not
find a bomb, but the rumors spread so fast that National Public
Radio had called the sheriff's office within five hours.
</P>
<P>
   So numerous have been the rumors that Pope High School principal
David Shumake sent a letter to Cobb parents stressing that rumors
are being investigated and that none have proven to be true.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened unrest is also revealed in the diary of
10-year-old Roger Garza, a student at Canton Elementary School in
Cherokee whose mother offered her son's thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so scared coming to school after what happened to the
high school,'' Roger wrote. ``I need to stop worrying about it.
Watch over me please.''
</P>

SUPREME COURT REFUSES TO BAN GIFT-GIVING BY LOBBYISTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt a
victory to lobbyists who wine and dine federal bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   In its 9-0 ruling, the court said U.S. law allows people to give
gifts to officials so long as they are not given in return for or
in expectation of a favorable act by the officials.
</P>
<P>
   The decision marked another defeat for independent counsel
Donald Smaltz, whose lengthy investigation and prosecution of
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy resulted in Espy's acquittal
in December on 30 counts of accepting illegal gifts from
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Sun-Diamond Growers of California was caught in Smaltz's
investigation, having been found guilty by the U.S. District Court
in Washington of illegally treating Espy to 1993 U.S. Open Tennis
Tournament tickets, $2,427 worth of luggage, $665 in meals, and a
framed print and crystal bowl worth a total of $524.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court, agreeing with the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Washington, overturned the conviction. The justices
ruled that the federal law prohibiting the payment of gratuities to
U.S. officials did not apply to Sun-Diamond's gifts to Espy unless
Smaltz could show a link between them and a specific ``official
act'' Espy had performed or that Sun-Diamond wanted him to perform.
</P>
<P>
   In their decision, the justices said the district court had
erroneously interpreted the statute as barring people and companies
from giving gifts to an official simply because of his or her
official position.
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz, in a prepared statement, expressed disappointment with
the high court's decision, saying it ``allows too much latitude to
those who would attempt to buy governmental favor.'' The
independent counsel, however, said he would ``respect'' the high
court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who believe that no one should be allowed to give
gifts to public officials to purchase goodwill or curry favor,
regardless of the specificity with which the desired official acts
can be identified, any future refinement of this law must come from
Congress, or from the Office of Government ethics, whose
regulations govern the behavior of governmental officials in the
executive branch,'' Smaltz said.
</P>
<P>
   The American League of Lobbyists, which represents more than 500
government-relations professionals, hailed the court's decision for
recognizing that in Washington lobbyists and officials ``interact
all the time'' for social and political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, not all gifts are intended to be a bribe,
said Thomas Susman, the league's vice president.

FLORIDA POISED TO PASS SCHOOL VOUCHER PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mb) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In a move that critics say will cause an exodus from
struggling inner-city schools but one that advocates believe will
save them, Gov. Jeb Bush and leaders in the Florida Legislature
have agreed to allow children in the lowest-rated schools to attend
private institutions with state-paid tuition.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which was a cornerstone of Bush's campaign for
governor, will make Florida the only state to use public education
funds for vouchers that will pay the way for students to attend
private schools. including religious schools.The measure is
expected to pass in the House and Senate this week, perhaps as
early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the State House and Senate, both controlled by
Republicans, worked out an agreement on Monday on a bill that Bush
will sign ``with a smile on his face,'' said Nicolle Devenish,
press secretary to the Republican governor, who is also frequentlty
mentioned as the party's most attractive presidential candidate in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which is also intended to pay the way for children in
failing schools to attend higher-rated public schools, will assign
every state public school a grade _ A, B, C, D or F _ based on
standardized test scores. Students who attend schools rated ``F''
can, on the request of their parents, be awarded vouchers of about
$4,000 _ called ``opportunity scholarships'' _ no matter what a
student's grades are.
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue that has consumed much of Bush's first term, as
he put the issue ahead of all other business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half our kids graduate from high school,'' said Bush. ``Half
are reading below basic levels in the fourth grade. This is vital
for our long-term competetiveness as a state, vital for restoring
our civil society. It pushes the resources and attention where it
needs to be. It will improve public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which will begin in September with four schools that
have tested poorly in the past _ one near Orlando, one outside
Tallahassee and two in Pensacola _ and gradually be expanded to
include all 3,000 public schools in the state, is seen by
proponents as a bold initiative to reform a system that has been
held back by teachers' unions and school administrators afraid of
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child in a failing school will now have the option to go
to a school where he or she can learn,'' said State Representative
Alex Diaz de la Portilla, a Republican from Westchester in
Miami-Dade County who is one of the plan's strongest proponents.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the plan said it violates the constitutional division
of church and state. And here in south Florida, where many
inner-city schools are expected to score low in the planned
standardized testing, they say it will worsen things by taking
their best students, and their state financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you will have is a massive exodus of students leaving the
public schools,'' said State Rep. James Bush, a Democrat from Miami
whose district, which includes Liberty City, Overtown and Opa
Locka, is the poorest in the state. ``You're going to lose
teachers,'' as enrollment drops and tax dollars dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   Other states, including Texas and Pennsylvania, are considering
such a plan, and some cities, including Milwaukee and Cleveland,
already have such systems in place, said Jeanne Allen, president of
the Center for Education Reform, a non-profit research group based
in Washington. Maine and Vermont have long-standing voucher
programs that allow a small number of students in rural areas who
do not live near schools.
</P>
<P>
   Other school systems, including the New York City system, have
considered using vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes this unique,'' said Ms. Allen, ``is that it is not
a simple program that pulls kids out of school. It puts schools on
notice that they will lose their good students unless they are
quality schools.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it is the first time a state has laid down ``immediate
consequences for pitiful results.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan would increase financing for schools that improve, as
it decreases financing to failing ones, as enrollment drops. While
state officials are unsure how many of Florida's 2 million students
would be affected, ``this could potentially be in the tens of
thousands or hundreds of thousands,'' said Ms. Allen.
</P>
<P>
   In cities that have voucher programs, anywhere from 5 to 30
percent of students take advantage of the program, said Brewser
Brown, chief of staff for Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan.
</P>
<P>
   There is not special allocation for the vouchers themselves,
just a re-distribution of state tax money already earmarked for
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money follows the child,'' said Brown. If a private
school's tuition is less than the amount _ about $4,000 _
earmarked, that money goes back into the state treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Under this legislation, public school students from the third
grade through through the 10th would be tested every year under a
vigorous new state test called the Florida Comprehensive Assessment
Test, and those cumulative scores would be used to rate the school.
De la Portilla said as many as 160 of the state's 3,000 schools
could get a failing grade.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Yarger, dean of the Scool of Education at the University of
Miami, said the plan ``very viable, politically,'' but one that
breaks down in the realities of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you allow vouchers,'' Yarger said, ``the students who
voucher out of public schools will be those whose parents care
about them,'' because they will have to provide transportation and
make other arrangements for their children, said Yarger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids who are left behind are the kids who are poor, whose
parents don't have the concern,'' he said. ``They will be left in
the school. That residual student body will demonstrate more
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bush said it is unfair to grade all schools by
the same standards. ``Traditionally, most inner-city schools don't
receive the resources that they should to catch up with schools
that have adequate books and computers and support staff and those
things that give some schools an upper hand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Small schools, which hold a warm place in the history of their
communities, would just disappear, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said another aspect of his education reform _ including
a $500 million increase in the education budget to tutor students
in those schools that were at risk of receiving a failing grade _
would make the eventual implementation of the program in inner
cities and rural areas more equitable.
</P>
<P>
   As the battle over the plan has raged, largely along party
lines, some private school principals have said they do not know if
they can accept the students or if the $4,000 voucher will cover a
year's tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle could be its legality. ``This will definitely
end up in court,'' Ms. Allen said. But provisions in the plan that
bar mandatory prayer in the class could help in pass its challenge
in the courts. ``This is about choice, not about religion,'' she
said.

NATO'S BOMBING OF CIVILIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NATO bombing of Serbia's state-run radio and television
headquarters in Belgrade last week, which killed at least 12 people
_ 20 more bodies may be buried in the rubble _ was unwarranted and
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to defy the Geneva Conventions protecting civilians
and journalists in a war zone, NATO not only tempts Slobodan
Milosevic to retaliate against the many foreign journalists
covering the Balkan conflict; it loses moral ground in its stand
against the Yugoslav president's butchery.
</P>
<P>
   Misha Glenny, a Balkans expert, sees ``no tangible benefit''
from the strike, noting that TV was back on throughout Serbia
within five hours. ``The whole operation gave Milosevic a boost,''
says Glenny. ``Like so much of this campaign, it was ill-conceived,
arrogant, and counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO justifies the bombing by insisting that state-run media
constitute a propaganda machine that spreads hate and
misinformation and so should not be afforded the protections
guaranteed a free press. But that logic is ethical hair-splitting,
for while reporters presenting outright lies as fact deserve
contempt, they certainly do not deserve to die.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the NATO summit meeting in Washington on Sunday,
President Clinton attacked Milosevic for the ``murder of innocent
people'' and for knowing ``only one way to achieve his aims _
through force.'' The West exhibited a similar, one-track,
militaristic mind-set in bombing the broadcasting center.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was particularly troubling because NATO officials
gave assurances earlier this month that broadcasting transmitters,
not journalists, would be targeted, according to Amnesty
International and the Committee to Protect Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Radio stations, the Internet, and information air drops provide
ample opportunity to counter the heinous spin Milosevic puts on the
murder of innocents. The United States and its allies would be most
credible in their battle to defend human rights if they blasted
this poison with the firepower of the truth, not bombs.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as it continued its flurry of deal-making, AT&AMP;T Corp. on
Tuesday reported strong financial results for the first quarter
that exceeded analysts' expectations. But investors did not rush to
buy AT&AMP;T's shares amid continued uncertainty about the company's
unsolicited $58 billion bid to acquire MediaOne Group Inc., the big
cable television company.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings for AT&AMP;T, the nation's biggest communications company,
rose 42 percent over the first quarter of last year, largely
because of an aggressive cost-cutting campaign by C. Michael
Armstrong, the company's chairman of 18 months. More important,
AT&AMP;T showed signs of finally emerging from the revenue funk it had
been stuck in for years, boosting sales by more than 6 percent over
the comparable period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, AT&AMP;T also announced a partnership with Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, the world's biggest phone company, to
provide comprehensive packages of communications services to
multinational corporations in Japan and perhaps other parts of
Asia. AT&AMP;T has formed a separate joint venture with British
Telecommunications PLC, and if AT&AMP;T can work well with both
partners, it will have gone a long way toward realizing its global
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   But it is AT&AMP;T's ambitions in the United States that continue
both to invigorate and worry investors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main questions facing Wall Street, not to mention
MediaOne's board, which had already agreed to sell its company to
Comcast Corp., is how feasible AT&AMP;T's offer really is from a legal
and regulatory perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, those are questions that also preoccupy Comcast,
which needs to gauge AT&AMP;T's offer before deciding whether to make a
serious counterbid of its own. Executives close to Comcast said
Tuesday that while that company had weighed a variety of options,
it had not yet decided how to respond to the AT&AMP;T bid.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal development for Comcast would be for William Kennard,
chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to denounce
AT&AMP;T's plan for MediaOne as ``unthinkable,'' just as Kennard's
predecessor, Reed Hundt, did when AT&AMP;T tried to merge with SBC
Communications Inc., one of the Bell local phone companies, in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But that seems unlikely, and not just because Kennard is more
diplomatic than Hundt. The regulations governing concentration of
ownership in the cable television industry are in limbo, and it is
not clear that anyone in the industry, even Comcast, necessarily
wants them resolved in a way that would prevent AT&AMP;T from acquiring
MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Congress directed the FCC to draft rules to prevent the
cable television industry from becoming an oligopoly. In response,
the commission issued regulations saying that generally, no one
company could own cable systems that covered more than 30 percent
of homes in the United States in which cable television was
available. These days, cable is available to about 95 million of
the nation's roughly 100 million households.
</P>
<P>
   A loophole in the rules said that a company could expand its
stake to 35 percent if it did so by acquiring cable companies
controlled by members of racial minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's rules were challenged by Daniels Cablevision
Inc., which persuaded a federal judge in Washington to declare that
the law requiring the FCC's concentration rules violated the cable
carriers' First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   In response to that decision, the commission suspended its
rules. Since 1993 the case has been sitting before a federal
appeals court in Washington, where it could drag on for another
year.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows what, if any, restrictions on cable
concentration will eventually be implemented and upheld. And that
makes it difficult to determine the relative regulatory merits of
AT&AMP;T's and Comcast's bids for MediaOne. In fact, both bids might be
in violation of the original rules.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast, including its deal to acquire Jones Intercable, owns
cable systems offering service to about 9.4 million homes. MediaOne
offers service to about 8.5 million homes. Together that is about
18 million homes, considerably fewer than the 28.5 million that
would form 30 percent of the nation's 95 million cable-accessible
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The potential problem is MediaOne's 25.5 percent stake in Time
Warner Entertainment, a venture that includes most of Time Warner
Inc.'s cable operations. The stayed FCC rules say that any active
investor that owns more than 5 percent of a cable operation must
count all of the homes potentially served by that operation in
calculating their 30 percent limit. Time Warner may pass as many as
18 million homes. Including those systems would boost Comcast's
reach to as many as 36 million homes, far above the old limit.
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T, the potential problem is much worse. With its purchase
of Tele-Communications Inc., AT&AMP;T already owns cable systems that
pass 18 million homes. Add in MediaOne and Time Warner and the
figure becomes as high as 44.5 million. And that does not even
include TCI's myriad affiliates, which pass another 13 million
homes.
</P>
<P>
   So in the battle for MediaOne, both AT&AMP;T and Comcast need
whatever new rules that emerge to be quite a bit more lenient than
the current regulations. For Comcast, the trick is to have the
rules relaxed a bit, so it can acquire MediaOne, but not enough to
enable AT&AMP;T to do the same thing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As complex (and potentially moot) as the stayed cable rules are,
Time Warner Entertainment could pose yet another potential problem
for AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   When Time Warner acquired Turner Broadcasting System Inc., John
Malone, who was then chairman of TCI and who had a big stake in
Turner, agreed not to acquire any more Time Warner stock. Comcast
could contend that Malone's agreement now applies to AT&AMP;T and that
AT&AMP;T would violate that deal by acquiring MediaOne and assuming its
stake in Time Warner Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's response to that possibility is that the Malone agreement
applies only to Liberty Media, the programming operation that is
publicly traded as an AT&AMP;T tracking stock but in which AT&AMP;T has no
economic interest. That leaves AT&AMP;T itself free to invest in Time
Warner Entertainment (or Time Warner Inc., for that matter), AT&AMP;T
says.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about AT&AMP;T's MediaOne bid (which also include concerns
about the deal's dilution of AT&AMP;T's future earnings) may have
obscured a robust quarterly financial report for AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Including the effects of a recent 3-for-2 stock split _ but not
including one-time charges and the effects of the TCI acquisition,
which was completed last month _ AT&AMP;T earned $1.78 billion, or 67
cents a share, up from $1.25 billion, or 46 cents a share, in the
comparable period last year. That beat the 63 cent average estimate
of analysts polled by First Call, a financial research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Including the effects of the TCI deal and special charges, AT&AMP;T
earned $1.08 billion, or 38 cents a post-split share, down from
$1.3 billion, or 48 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by strong gains in the company's wireless unit and in
sales to business customers, AT&AMP;T's revenue, excluding TCI,
increased by 6.1 percent, to $13.61 billion from $12.83 billion
during the comparable period last year. Including TCI, revenue
increased almost 10 percent, to $14.1 billion from $12.83 billion.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's stock closed Tuesday at $53, up 6.25 cents on the New
York Stock Exchange.

ROADS TO RUIN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration can improve its already strong
environmental record if it presses ahead with restrictions on road
construction in 33 million National Forest acres that are open to
logging and mining. It has already placed an 18-month moratorium on
road building, but conservationists are concerned that the
prohibition will be eased following an in-house study of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The road ban effectively blocks logging and mining operations
and preserves the natural character of the forests. The 33 million
acres represent about a sixth of the entire National Forest acreage
but are little over half the 60 million acres that environmental
groups like the Heritage Forest Campaign have identified as
deserving permanent protection from invasive activities.
</P>
<P>
   The areas, primarily in the West and Alaska, are important not
only as forests but for watershed protection. Wilderness roads,
usually unpaved, create erosion problems in hilly terrain. Over the
years, nearly 400,000 miles of them have been built, giving access
to forest areas otherwise beyond the reach of loggers or miners.
</P>
<P>
   Setting aside the entire 33 million acres permanently would not
deprive lumbering interests of all logging opportunities. Nearly
100 million acres have been logged over the years, and in time they
will produce commercially useful timber again to supplement acreage
in private hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service's chief, Michael Dombeck, has built a good
reputation for restraint during his tenure despite constant
pressure from industry and congressional supporters of maximum
economic development. He deserves support from Clinton
administration officials who have staked out strong stands on
environmental issues _ notably Vice President Al Gore, Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman, and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.
Without such backing, the danger is that the Forest Service might
yield to demands that these forest areas, which belong to the
American people, be sacrificed to short-term business interests.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The craving for speed seized John Drees the day after he bought
his first personal computer late last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a stir-crazy state that almost every home user of the
Internet can identify with, he counted the minutes it took for Web
pages to appear on his screen. He paced as his standard modem _ the
fastest on the market _ took an hour to funnel a huge file to his
hard drive, only to lose the connection before he was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Then Drees, a college professor in Jenkintown, Pa., stepped
through a looking glass that transformed his journey from home to
cyberspace: he got a cable modem. Now he travels the Net roughly 50
times as fast as he did before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go on, it's just amazing to me,'' Drees said in
the hushed tones with which many recent converts speak of their
high-speed Internet connections. ``Look,'' he told a visitor,
twirling through a 3-D animated tour of a World War II submarine.
``It's changed everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door, Brian and Lisa Banberger can't help but agree. They
opted for a comparably fast service _ not from the cable company,
but from Bell Atlantic, the local phone company. More than the
speed, Brian is enamored of the fact that the line is always open,
turning the Internet into a silent, beckoning presence on his desk
whenever his computer is turned on.
</P>
<P>
   So far the two households in Jenkintown, a well-to-do
Philadelphia suburb, are among just half a million across the
nation to sample the phenomenon known among technology wonks as
broadband. Much-hyped and long-delayed, high-speed Internet access
is finally coming to the home, with research firms predicting that
10 to 16 million households will sign up by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Such fast connections via phone and cable lines will become
widely available over the next year, at a cost of $40 to $200 a
month plus installation. The experience of the early users offers a
glimpse at the Internet's next frontier, where waiting is rare,
dialing in is unnecessary, and local communications monopolies are
for the first time vying for customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadband is the Internet's next version,'' said Kevin
Werbach, editor of Release 1.0, a technology industry newsletter.
``It's a fundamental advance over what we have now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most obvious sense, broadband crosses a technical
threshold that has long been a holy grail among media and
technology companies: enough bytes can be squeezed over their wires
to make video over the Internet look like television and audio
sound like radio. As a result, downloading the two-and-a-half
minute trailer for the new ``Star Wars'' movie over a cable modem
takes about two minutes, compared with about two hours over a
conventional modem.
</P>
<P>
   But the most far-reaching effect on the daily lives of broadband
users is this: instead of tapping into the network, they are simply
part of a network. The combination of speed and ease of access
suddenly makes it worthwhile to use the Internet for a myriad of
tasks from looking up a phone number to listening to music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadband has integrated the Internet into my life a hundred
times more than it was before,'' said Christopher Mines, an analyst
at Forrester Research, who moved his computer to the kitchen when
he got his cable modem and says most mornings his newspaper stays
in the driveway. ``What happens is the Web starts to take over from
other resources.''
</P>
<P>
   If millions of Americans now dabble in electronic shopping,
banking, publishing and information gathering, broadband seems
poised to significantly alter the nature of those activities as
well as the number of those who engage in them.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some of the bandwidth-obsessed are making decisions on
where to buy their homes based on the availability of high-speed
access. In the geographical pockets where broadband has become
available, neighbors are comparing download speeds and modem
installation fees in a 1999 version of keeping up with the Joneses.
</P>
<P>
   Even more striking than the speed, many users say, is the way
the ``always on'' connection removes a psychological barrier
between the user and cyberspace. Although the difference between
broadband and dial-up access is only a couple of minutes and a
screech of the modem, it seems enough to tip the balance, making
for shorter, but far more frequent sessions at the screen.
</P>
<P>
   And with high-speed access, high-quality video and audio will
become a more routine part of the Internet experience, with the
advantage of being able to choose what you want to see and hear,
and when.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do it right, by the back half of this year you're going
to see big spike in consumption of video and audio,'' said Jeff
Mallett, president of Yahoo, the prominent Internet company whose
purchase of Broadcast.com earlier this month for a stunning $5.6
billion reflected its faith in the future of broadband.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, for instance, anticipates that people who check their
stock quotes in the finance area of its site will supplement the
experience with a video news clip about their companies, or an
audio address by the chief executive. Businesses from mortgage
lenders to car dealers are expected to take advantage of the ease
of video conferencing over high-speed lines to entice customers to
make significant purchasing decisions over the Internet that they
would be unlikely to make without some human interaction.
</P>
<P>
   The technology also makes it possible for anyone to become not
only a consumer but a broadcaster of audio and video, sending
continuous sound and images to other computers across the Internet.
John Breuer, 37, a network engineer in Danville, Calif., who in
March subscribed to Pacific Bell's high-speed service known as
digital subscriber line, or DSL, now regularly plays Led Zeppelin
over what amounts to his own radio station, accessible to anyone
who has downloaded the free software that enables them to listen.
While he works and spins tunes from home, he often gets video calls
from his brother in North Dakota, who was never big on e-mail.
Asked if his new Internet habits cut into any of his other
activities, Breuer cites housework.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could easily reach what I would call epidemic proportions
in terms of addiction level,'' he said. ``It's really easy to get
caught up in it. There's so much out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Heralded for nearly a decade as the Internet's imminent
multimedia future, the deployment of broadband technology has been
long delayed in part because the technology was not ready and in
part because cable companies did not devote the cash to get it
ready. And without being prodded by competition, phone companies
were disinclined to offer a far less expensive service that would
eat into the lucrative high-speed T1 service that they now sell to
many businesses at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, cable companies, flush with capital from a series of
investments like AT&AMP;T's purchase of Tele-Communications Inc., the
largest cable operator, are upgrading their equipment. The
companies are eager to supplement the annual $25 billion cable
service with broadband revenues that Forrester estimates will reach
$5.7 billion by 2001. Local phone companies, whose $90 billion
phone service market is already under siege from long-distance
carriers and cable companies providing dial-tone service, have
their own reasons to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're preparing for a battle royal,'' said Richard Rasmus,
general manager of Philadelphia-based Comcast.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Castleton, executive director for Bell Atlantic's
high-speed products replies simply, ``Our intention is to beat
cable modems.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Currently, cable companies are equipped to provide cable modem
service to about 23 million households nationwide, and phone
companies are wired to offer DSL to another 6 million. The areas of
availability remain a patchwork _ for example, in New York City,
only a few homes can get cable modem service, but it is offered in
many areas of New Jersey, Long Island and Connecticut. Bell
Atlantic, which provides DSL connections in parts of northern New
Jersey, said that by the end of the year it will offer service to
about 2.2 million homes in the metropolitan area, including areas
of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Also at stake in the broadband wars is the future of the 4,500
Internet service providers who now offer dial-up access to American
households, one-quarter of which are now online. Because cable
modem service includes Internet access, companies like America
Online, by far the nation's biggest Internet service provider with
16 million customers, are scrambling to strike deals with the
regional Bell companies to offer high-speed service over their
digital telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   And a high-stakes lobbying battle is unfolding in Washington and
across the country over whether cable companies _ notably AT&AMP;T, as
a condition of its acquisition of Tele-Communications _ should be
compelled to establish a level playing field for Internet providers
over their cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   Is all the fuss worth it?
</P>
<P>
   If the smug tone that creeps into conversations with many of the
early broadband subscribers is any indication, speed does make a
difference. A typical Internet user today connects at speeds
between 28,800 and 53,000 bits a second. Cable modems and DSL are
between 10 and 80 times as fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was over at my brother-in-law's the other day and sat at his
modem and that's when I really realized how much better I have it
than all those folks still on 28.8,'' said Banberger, Drees'
neighbor in Jenkintown and an executive at a health care
information publishing company. ``It's like when you got automatic
door locks on your car, and at first you thought, `Do I really need
this?' Once you have them, you can never go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Banberger's wife, Lisa, isn't as thrilled with the new setup,
since she says her husband spends more time online now than he did
before. She also tends to more frequently lose the game where Brian
tries to find a phone number or a movie listing online first while
she searches more pedestrian sources like the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   But both like the fact that their three young daughters, who
used to be too bored to wait for Web pages to show up on the
screen, now regularly sit in their father's desk chair and explore.
(The Teletubbies page, for instance, is a much-used bookmark).
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Sechler of Phoenix, who subscribes to DSL from her
telephone carrier, US West, said the service had allowed her to run
her accounting firm out of her home. Several of her clients are
also self-employed at home by means of high-speed access from Cox
Cable or the wireless broadband company, Speedchoice, which takes
advantage of the area's flat geography to provide speeds comparable
to cable modems and DSL over the airwaves. With three competitors
in the market, broadband has become a subject to hash over at
cocktail parties, in the supermarket parking lot and, of course,
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always comes up,'' Ms. Sechler said. ``Everyone's talking
about who has the fastest access.''
</P>
<P>
   The main virtue of DSL is that it offers higher guaranteed
speeds than do cable modems. It is also potentially more portable.
But its range is limited: people who live more than about three
miles from a local switching station cannot get DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, cable modems are more readily available, and
their top speed is almost three times that of the average DSL
connection. But because each household in a given area shares the
cable network, the more subscribers, the slower their connections
can be. Cable executives insist that they can add capacity to
maintain the speed, but customers in several markets including
Fremont, Calif., and Connecticut have complained about slow speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep a stopwatch here at my computer,'' said Marshall Wice,
75, of Hartford, Conn., who has cable modem service through
Tele-Communications. ``Sometimes I'm downloading two, three,
four-meg files in less than a minute. But at night, forget about
it. It just drags and drags and drags.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wolfington, 28, who chose his home in Foothill Ranch,
Calif., in part because Cox Cable was offering high-speed service
in the area, also sometimes feels his connection is slow. But he
has a remedy: ``When I feel myself getting spoiled, I make myself
spend some time on a 28.8 modem,'' he said. ``That's when reality
sets in.''

   HOMES WIRED TO INTERNET NOW SEEKING MORE SPEED
</P>
<P>
   Much-hyped and long-delayed, high-speed Internet access is
finally coming to the home, with research firms predicting that 10
million to 16 million households will sign up by 2002. Such fast
connections over phone and cable lines will become widely available

next-generation Internet _ a network that can move data at speeds
1,000 times faster than the fastest lines now used by corporations
and universities.

 &HT;    Penn stays for family
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Coaches say it, commentators say it, columnists
say it.
</P>
<P>
   But you wonder if the kids listen.
</P>
<P>
   You fear they don't. You fear the words go off into the
atmosphere and dissipate like smoke.
</P>
<P>
   But now, on Tuesday, here was Scoonie Penn saying it. Standing
deep inside the Schottenstein Center, he said he was staying at
Ohio State to play basketball his senior year for a number of
reasons. ``One of the most important things,'' Scoonie said, ``is
that I get to walk across the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, walk across the stage and grab his diploma as if it's a
long rebound come home to roost. Become the first member of his
family to do so. ``That's something my family wanted to see,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   I reminded him that several times this past season he told me he
didn't like studying. I had told him I was the same way when I was
in school, that that feeling wasn't limited to jocks.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him how hard that was when he was making his decision
not to put his name into the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too hard,'' he said. ``I know what's important. I know
what needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   So, if all goes well, he will graduate after winter quarter next
year with a degree in sociology, and he will not be dependent on
his considerable basketball skills to get him through life.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone open his eyes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said. ``It just came with maturity. You grow
up and all your focus is on your dreams, your goal _ to become a
professional athlete. It was hard to see anything else, and that's
all I wanted. I still want it, but I realize there are other things
in life.''
</P>
<P>
   He has set a standard for more than his family. He has set a
standard for other college athletes thinking of leaving school
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took some time to realize how important education is,'' the
kid from Boston said. ``As you grow up, you always hear a lot about
it, but as you grow older, you watch guys go into the NBA and other
professional sports and you see how their lives turn out. And after
their sports, they really don't have much to fall back on. You
know, it makes you think.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he did.
</P>
<P>
   Think.
</P>
<P>
   In the four weeks since OSU's season ended with a loss to
Connecticut in a national semifinal game, Penn has spent a lot of
time discussing it with his family, his teammates and his coaches.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it was his life. His decision.
</P>
<P>
   Well done.
</P>
<P>
   With head coach Jim O'Brien on vacation, assistant coach Rick
Boyages put Scoonie's decision into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very unique,'' Boyages said. ``Very very mature. Very
responsible. Very mentally strong. Tough. I'm not surprised that
wanting a degree would factor in more for him than for the normal
college athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, a couple of us stood out in the arena with Scoonie. The
wooden floor was gone and we stood on concrete. He was wearing a
Boston Red Sox baseball cap, so the conversation flowed into
baseball. He said he had been a diehard New York Mets fan in fourth
grade and when that ball went through Bill Buckner's legs in the
1986 World Series, while the rest of Boston cried, he jumped up and
down screaming in joy.
</P>
<P>
   Then the converstion turned back to basketball and he got
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm staying,'' he said, ``because I know an NBA career isn't
that long. It might be 10 years, but it might be 10 days. I look at
that, and I know I'm going to have something to fall back on.''
</P>
<P>
   You hope other kids are listening.

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2)

 By K. ROBERT SCHWARZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a signal moment in the rebirth of tonality. When the
curtain rose on Tobias Picker's first opera, ``Emmeline,'' in 1996,
the orchestra conjured an atmosphere of grim foreboding, circling
endlessly around a single, brooding chord. As if to emphasize his
immersion in the dark realm of B flat minor, Picker prefaced the
score with a device long scorned by modernists: a key signature.
</P>
<P>
   Picker's embrace of tonality, though particularly unambiguous,
is hardly unique. Today, it seems, every composer is eager to be
portrayed as a lapsed modernist, newly liberated from the shackles
of Serialism. For some, this conservatism smacks of opportunism.
But for Picker, 45, it represents another step in a long and
unpredictable compositional journey.
</P>
<P>
   Its catalyst was opera, which has quickly become Picker's
obsession. And a narrative approach has rubbed off on his
instrumental music as well. On Friday evening, the Chamber Music
Society of Lincoln Center offers the premiere of Picker's Cello
Suite, performed by the cellist Lynn Harrell and the pianist
Anne-Marie McDermott at Alice Tully Hall.
</P>
<P>
   When Harrell requested a work for cello and piano, Picker
delivered a set of five character pieces, three inspired by poetry,
the five together tracing a story of love won and lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a little opera,'' Picker said recently. ``There's a
dramatic scenario that goes from movement to movement. These are
not just five contrasting pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   His transformation into a traditional opera composer becomes
even more remarkable when one considers his background. As an
adolescent, Picker came to realize, he said, that one of his prime
personality traits was ``total irrationality.''
</P>
<P>
   So he sought out teachers who would encourage compositional
discipline and discourage freewheeling self-expression. With
remarkable single-mindedness, he studied with three pillars of
American rationalism: Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter and Charles
Wuorinen.
</P>
<P>
   Picker got the discipline he yearned for, along with heady doses
of Serialism and systematic atonality. At Princeton University, he
absorbed the prevailing modernist esthetic but ignored its
scientific trappings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a background in mathematics,'' he said, ``so I
never had the faintest idea what they were talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   But he had a clear idea of the kind of music he wanted to write,
and it didn't always conform to prevailing doctrine. When writing a
12-tone piece, he might choose a row so rich in tonal allusions
that further turns toward tonality could be justified. His works of
the 1970s and early 80s showed a persistent conflict between
modernist rationality and Romantic irrationality.
</P>
<P>
   Picker's music resembled that of his teachers in its disjunct
lines, atonal harmonies and irregular rhythms. But a barely
controlled explosive streak would erupt unexpectedly, piercing the
systematic canvas with bursts of intuitive passion. It is tempting
to find a parallel in the neurological disorder with which Picker
was born, Tourette's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a condition that leads people to make involuntary
movements, or tics, and sometimes noises,'' the noted psychiatrist
Oliver Sacks, who helped Picker deal with the outward
manifestations of the syndrome, said recently. ``There may also be
sudden bursts of thought or feeling, which may take the form of
unusual ideas. It provides a certain energy that is distracting and
destructive on one hand but is generating and stimulating on the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to control the symptoms is to focus all energy on a task
at hand, like a performance. ``Tobias conducted a long concert of
his works, and he had nary a tic for two hours,'' Sacks said.
``Everything flowed into the performance, which may have been
infused with some of the energy of the Tourette's syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Might Picker's music in some way reflect the syndrome? ``If an
artist has a condition like this,'' Sacks said, ``it is very
possible it may enter into his art or creativity in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Westchester County, Picker was, by his own
account, a ``strange, unhappy little boy.'' He poured himself into
the piano with fearsome intensity and developed a virtuoso
technique.
</P>
<P>
   At 8, inspired by attending one of Leonard Bernstein's Young
People's Concerts at the New York Philharmonic and hearing Gian
Carlo Menotti's ``Amahl and the Night Visitors'' on television, he
decided to be a composer. At 9, he saw Puccini's ``Girl of the
Golden West'' and knew that he, too, would one day write an opera.
</P>
<P>
   But his rigorous academic training turned him toward abstract,
instrumental music. (Program music, considered naive and
unsystematic, was discouraged.) He composed chamber and orchestral
pieces, including two symphonies, a violin concerto and two piano
concertos. In his early works, short breathless phrases, amorphous
rhythms and dissonant harmonies were the rule.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the balance began to shift. In the piano concerto
``Keys to the City'' (1983), Picker burst out in an exuberant
boogie-woogie cadenza; in the melodrama ``The Encantadas'' (1983),
based on the diaries of Melville, he wrote vividly pictorial music,
and in ``Old and Lost Rivers'' (1986) he explored static tonality.
</P>
<P>
   For Picker, all these works were rungs on a ladder that led to
opera. ``Opera was lurking all the time,'' he said. ``I was totally
involved in the other music I wrote, but I was always aware that
opera was what I was meant to do. I started searching for a subject
in the 1980s. When I discovered `Emmeline,' it just spoke to me,
and I became an automaton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmeline,'' set in early 19th-century New England, is an
Oedipal tale of a young woman who unwittingly marries her
illegitimate son. Drawn from a novel by Judith Rossner, the opera
is tragic in tone yet human in scale, and it erased the last of
Picker's creative inhibitions. `` `Emmeline' enabled me to write
the kind of music I always wanted to write,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although his background was primarliy in instrumental music,
Picker showed a real knack for shaping long, soaring vocal lines.
Driven by a motoric pulse, ``Emmeline'' saves dissonance for
moments of high drama and frenzied action. Straightforward in its
narrative presentation, keen in its musical characterization,
visceral in its passion, ``Emmeline'' was a superlative if
surprisingly traditional achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The work won popular and critical acclaim, bringing Picker to
wide notice. Its premiere, at the Santa Fe Opera, was taped for
national telecast in PBS's ``Great Performances,'' and an audio
recording was released by Albany Records. A New York City Opera
production was widely praised. Picker was soon showered with three
opera commissions, including one from the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some miss the astringent manner of the atonal modernist
and wish that Picker's embrace of tonality had been less complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he doesn't make a standstill or a regression into
placid tonality,'' said Christoph Eschenbach, the music director of
the Houston Symphony, of which Picker was composer-in-residence
from 1985 to 1990. ``I always liked the pieces most where his
musical language had more edge to it, and I hope he doesn't forget
that he has a very expressive voice in this direction as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The pianist Ursula Oppens, who has championed Picker's music for
more than 20 years, takes a more measured view: ``I really loved
his atonal music. But when Tobias writes a melody in `Emmeline,' it
is so beautiful and irresistible. That's what composers have for
too long been afraid of. In that sense he is a leader and a
follower of our time. But `Emmeline' is not the last word, and
things still might change a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Picker speaks cautiously and deliberately, one
occasionally glimpses a tempestuous interior. When he discusses
opera, he exudes a palpable, almost maniacal intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opera freed me to convey complex emotions of character and
situation and drama,'' he said. ``If a dramatic situation calls for
a 10-minute scene in B flat minor, that's what I write.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmeline'' was followed by ``The Fantastic Mr. Fox,'' based on
a Roald Dahl tale, which received its premiere at the Los Angeles
Opera last December. Ostensibly a children's opera, the lean,
nimble ``Fox,'' like Prokofiev's ``Peter and the Wolf,'' speaks
just as well to adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therese Raquin,'' inspired by a Zola novel, will have its
debut at the Dallas Opera in 2001. And an American novel yet to be
announced will form the basis for a Met production in 2003, ``the
very first Met commission of the 21st century,'' Picker noted with
pride.
</P>
<P>
   Instrumental music, it appears, has become a secondary pursuit.
The Cello Suite will be followed by a cello concerto and perhaps
another violin concerto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telling a story in music with real characters who come to life
onstage is much more involving emotionally than writing an abstract
piece,'' Picker said. ``When I'm telling a story, I'm a much
happier composer.''

DOW AND S&AMP;P 500 HIT NEW HIGHS IN BUSY SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were mixed Tuesday in fairly heavy
trading. Two major market averages rose to new highs even as
investors took profits in bellwether technology and Internet
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In general, it was a good day for so-called cyclical stocks,
like Alcoa and DuPont, a group that until earlier this month had
been neglected. But with the exception of IBM, it was not a
positive market for computer and technology shares, which over the
last week have rocketed higher.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as they surveyed the action many traders and analysts
said the market looked tired, and might need a correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big stocks were better, the tech stocks were yuck and the
small caps went nowhere,'' said Bill Allyn, head of listed trading
at Jeffries &AMP; Co. ``The market is searching for leadership. For
right now, the market is having a problem reestablishing itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by big gains in American Express, United Technologies,
Chevron and Alcoa, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 113.12, or
1.1 percent, to a record 10,831.71, eclipsing the previous high of
10,727.20 set Thursday. American Express, a big loser Monday,
gained 4 11/16, to 139, while United Technologies rose 4 1/2, to
143 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index also set a record, rising
2.76 or 0.20 percent to 1,362.80, helped by gains in Coca-Cola,
BankAmerica and Royal Dutch Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   But the NASDAQ composite index fell 49.64 points, or 1.87
percent, to 2,602.41.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 4, to 84. Intel dropped 2 3/16, to 62 1/4. Dell
Computer declined 1 5/8, to 43 3/16. By the closing bell, the index
had lost 49.64, or 1.9 percent, to 2,602.41. And TheStreet.com's
Internet stock index fell 17.30, or 2.4 percent, to 696.97.
</P>
<P>
   America Online slumped 5 5/16, to 154 9/16. After the market
closed, the company released earnings results that beat Wall Street
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   As Allyn suggested, small cap stocks, which have been inching
higher lately, did very little Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks gained 0.21, or 0.1
percent, to 435.18.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, whose vertiginous rise over the last two weeks has been a
big reason the Dow has gained nearly 400 points during that period,
had another good day. Since April 19, IBM shares have risen more
than 27 percent. According to analysts at Birinyi &AMP; Associates,
during that period IBM's gain has accounted for than 202 Dow
points.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the opening the company announced it was
increasing its dividend and that it planned to buy back up to $3.5
billion worth of its shares. The stock gained 2 1/8, to 212.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is tired, and it should be,'' said Al Goldman,
chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis. ``The
main thing that has gotten the market in gear over the last month
has been corporate earnings, which have been much better than
people expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Goldman said, ``I think the odds favor a little time out
and a decline of four or five percent in the averages before we
turn again. It is a very tough thing for a long-time bull like me
to say, but I would be keeping some powder dry at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   A better-than-expected first-quarter earnings report helped lift
DuPont, another Dow stock, which climbed 1 5/8, to 68 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Oil company shares also did better. Royal Dutch, an S&AMP;P
component, gained 1 11/16. And BP Amoco gained 3 3/4, to 110 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclical stocks as a whole had a very good day.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgan Stanley Cyclical index gained 1 percent, its best
performance in more than a week. Since the beginning of April, the
index has risen by more than 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the beating technology shares took, there is little
doubt that interest, if not hysteria, in the Internet remains
extremely high.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Razorfish Inc., a company that designs websites for
online businesses more than doubled in price Tuesday, rising 17
1/2, to 33 1/2, in its first day of trading. The stock was
initially priced by investment bankers at Credit Suisse First
Boston on Monday night at $16 a share.

ARKANSAS GRAND JURY INDICTS 10 IN WIDE-RANGING CORRUPTION SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ A federal grand jury shook the Arkansas
political establishment Tuesday with a long list of political
corruption indictments that reaches to the apex of the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Ten people, including two well-known state senators, two former
state senators, two former top education officials and several
lawyers and associates of the legislators, were indicted on a
variety of racketeering, mail fraud and money laundering charges.
</P>
<P>
   The ringleader of the group, said U.S. Attorney Paula Casey, was
Nick Wilson, the senior state senator and one of the most powerful
and feared men in Arkansas politics. Ms. Casey said that Wilson, a
Democrat, planned and directed four separate schemes to divert $5
million in state money from child-support enforcement, workers
compensation for the state school board and a program to provide
legal counsel for children caught up in divorce cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the divorce program, Wilson and his associates
``corrupted the legislative process of the Arkansas General
Assembly'' by establishing a program to provide legal counsel to
children in divorce cases with no intention of actually providing
the services, the indictment said. Wilson and the other legislators
funneled the money to contractors who returned most of it to them,
the indictment says.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's lawyer, Bill Walmsley, said Wilson would plead not
guilty to each of the 129 charges against him, and predicted he
would be exonerated. Wilson believes the indictment raises serious
questions about the independence of the legislative branch from the
judiciary, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the other senator named in the indictment, Michael
R. Bearden, 50, said he was unavailable for comment. Both Wilson
and Bearden are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Casey's office, along with the FBI, the IRS and the state
police, has been investigating the case for 19 months, ever since a
weekly newspaper here broke the news about problems with the
divorce program. But even though the indictments were long
expected, the scope of the corruption charges was greater than any
subsequent news accounts had indicated. The suspected pattern of
kickbacks and self-dealing clearly surprised the investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Jegley, the district attorney for the Little Rock region,
who spent a few weeks investigating the case in 1997 before
realizing that it was so big that it should be turned over to the
federal government, said: ``After I issued subpoenas, I got them
back and said, holy cow, what have we got a hold of here. There was
something at the end of the tail we've grabbed onto.''
</P>
<P>
   Good-government groups in Arkansas had long charged that many
members of the part-time state Legislature were benefiting from
state contracts, but the full scope of the problem had not been
publicly known until the Arkansas Times, a weekly newspaper
covering politics and culture, reported in September 1997 that
several relatives and friends of legislators were directly
benefiting from the divorce program. The early articles barely
mentioned Wilson; it appeared that other senators had set up the
program and funneled the money.
</P>
<P>
   But as federal and state investigators began to look into the
case, they said they discovered a much larger conspiracy. Dozens of
state legislators, lawyers and lobbyists were interviewed, and Ms.
Casey said that several decided to provide evidence to the
government as part of plea agreements and immunity deals.
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI raided Wilson's office in November 1997, it became
evident to the public that the investigation had grown
substantially, and it began to affect state politics. Gov. Mike
Huckabee railed against the legislative branch, although many
legislators accused the Republican governor of capitalizing on the
fact that all of those under investigation were Democrats. Two of
the senators named in Tuesday's indictment, Michael Todd and Steve
Bell, decided not to run for re-election, and in the most recent
session, the Legislature passed a bill that outlaws a wide variety
of practices that allowed lawmakers to benefit from state
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   If proved, the accusations against Wilson could end one of the
state's longest and most colorful political careers. Wilson, who is
57, entered the Senate in 1971 as a fiery, left-of-center reformer
from the northern town of Pocahontas, and frequently clashed with
governors of both parties, including Bill Clinton. Once, while
Clinton and the lieutenant governor were out of the state, Wilson _
then president pro tem of the Senate _ declared himself acting
governor and temporarily fired Betsy Wright, Clinton's chief of
staff. Many legislators said Wilson, gruff and quick with a profane
quote, essentially ran both houses of the Legislature for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been an extremely influential senator,'' said Roby
Robertson, a public administration professor at the University of
Arkansas at Little Rock. ``He came in as a maverick, taking on the
establishment, and has always been one of the brightest people in
state government. I have to admit, I was often very impressed with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But the indictment paints a grim picture of a different kind of
brilliance. Beginning in 1995, it says, Wilson set up a corporation
that received state contracts to collect child-support payments.
The corporation submitted phony billings, and two-thirds of the
$546,000 received from the state was kicked back to Wilson, the
indictment says, while other payments were made to Bearden, a
senator for 13 years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition, it says, a Little Rock insurance company, Sedgwick
James of Arkansas, paid Wilson $227,000 to be selected to
administer workers compensation claims for the Arkansas School
Board Association. Wilson gave half the money to Burton L. Elliott,
former director of the state Department of Education, according to
the indictment. In a related scheme, it says that Sedgwick James
conspired with Wilson and Tommy R. Venters, former executive
director of the school board association, to have lawyers
representing school districts pay Wilson $20 an hour for each hour
they billed the state.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the indictment says, Wilson received $1.38 million
through the various schemes, an amount which the government
demanded be repaid. The defendants, charged with a total of 133
counts, will remain free on their own recognizance, Ms. Casey said,
and are expected to be arraigned in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Casey said the investigation was one of the largest public
corruption cases in state history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, but that's an
overwhelming amount of money to me,'' she said. ``Particularly when
you consider the purpose for which that money was originally
appropriated: to collect child support and help children and
parents who are trying to raise their families. And to have that
diverted to a fraud, I think, is particularly egregious.''

 &HT;    Reynolds' dinner theater on auction block
 &HT;    By Clay Lambert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ The doors are shuttered at an up-and-down
playhouse most recently known as the Carousel Jupiter Theatre.
Workers are converting the place for a fall opening of Christ's
Church of the Palm Beaches.
</P>
<P>
   But before church officials can welcome what they hope will be
thousands of parishioners, they have to evict Burt Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday they will host ``The Longest Yard Sale.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10:30 a.m., Jay Sugarman Auctioneers will sell the
picked-over remains of what opened in 1979 as the Burt Reynolds
Dinner Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials now own everything inside the Indiantown Road
building. They have uncovered kitchens full of industrial cooking
equipment. Theater props, slightly used light bulbs, Christmas
ornaments and other inexplicable baubles have been pulled from
every dusty corner and prepared for display.
</P>
<P>
   But the stars of Tuesday's show will likely be the stars who
once came to the theater; there are dozens of framed photographs
and drawings of 1970s-era stars who added luster to the productions
at the house that Burt built.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will want to see the shrine,'' said D. Cooper Getschal,
director of worship and programming for the church. He jokingly
refers to virtually everything inside the building as once
belonging to Reynolds. He speaks of ``Burt's piano'' and ``Burt's
adding machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Getschal takes visitors through a side entrance, where stairs
lead to a room marked: ``Burt Reynolds Private Box.'' Inside, the
walls are lined with faces that could have come from a cast party
for Cannonball Run.
</P>
<P>
   There are photographs autographed to Reynolds from Woody Allen,
Myrna Loy, Jackie Gleason, Mae West and Dean Martin, to name just a
few.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will pay good money for this stuff,'' Getschal said.
``We're counting on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much it will bring is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sugarman, president of the Miami-based auction house, said
Tuesday he had no idea what the total take might be. Getschal said
the church has estimates of the value of the restaurant equipment,
though he declined to name a figure.
</P>
<P>
   It is much more difficult to calculate the worth of memorabilia
peculiar to the theater, such as posters and autographs. And
collectors say it is impossible to put a price on things that are
just plain peculiar _ a black-and-white still photo of Reynolds and
the pope, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, pictures that have been autographed to you or I are
less valuable than those without personal messages,'' said Joseph
Rubinfine, a West Palm Beach autograph dealer. ``But these that
have been autographed to Burt Reynolds may have some market
precedence.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime theater-goer Eleanor Shubert said she has fond memories
of the place. When told of the auction, she said she might go
bargain hunting, though she wasn't sure how to tell a good price
for a photo of Reynolds lounging in a bubble bath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' she said. ``He's still alive, isn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   At 63, Reynolds is alive and well, though he didn't immediately
return telephone calls placed through his publicist on Tuesday.
Last year he emerged from bankruptcy proceedings without his
Jupiter Farms ranch, but still in possession of a $1.17 million
home in Hobe Sound. Renolds sold the former dinner theater to
developer Otto (Buzz) DiVosta in 1996. It later became the Carousel
Jupiter Theater.
</P>
<P>
   What if Reynolds should come forward and ask for the return of
his personal items?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Gary Templeton, senior minister for the
church. ``I don't think we have any preconceived notions of what
might happen then.''

IF THE CITYSCAPE IS ONLY A DREAM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite fortune cookie dialogue and a dubious Nietschean
subtext, ``The Matrix'' is a film that deserves to be a classic. It
will certainly become one for those who value the power of sci-fi
movies to crystallize moments of urban sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metropolis,'' ``Alphaville,'' ``The Tenth Victim'' and ``Blade
Runner'' are also classics of this genre. Like them, ``The Matrix''
is basically an adventure in stylish mise-en-scene. The special
effects offer more than eye-popping trappings. They're the heart of
the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving too much of the story away to the six people in
the world who haven't yet seen the movie: the action is set in a
post-apocalyptic world ruled by artificial intelligence. People's
brains have been programmed to think that they're living ordinary
lives in conventional cities circa 1999 _ a sort of ``Truman Show''
stage set for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, humans inhabit a kind of post-atomic blast Hiroshima on
a global scale. The aim of the Good Guys and Gals (Morpheus, Neo,
Trinity) is to liberate everyone from delusion so that they can
perceive the world as it is.
</P>
<P>
   This crypto-Buddhist parable reverses the usual sci-fi set-up.
Here, special effects are used to depict the ``real world'' (a
burned-out Chicago), while still and action photography of a real
city (Sydney, Australia) is used to represent the Matrix _ an
elaborate system of neurologically induced special effects.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second major urban adventure movie produced by Joel
Silver. ``Streets of Fire,'' co-produced by Silver and Larry Gordon
and directed by Walter Hill in 1984, was not a commercial success
but was admired by many in the art world. Like the East Village
gallery scene, then at its peak, this film sought a glamorous
mythology in the rubble of the abandoned inner city. It was a
vibrant allegory of the malign neglect endured by American cities
during the cold war.
</P>
<P>
   An elevated subway track was the movie's main scenic feature.
The crumbling track explicitly evoked the policy of ``deferred
maintenance'' adopted by the New York City transit system,
contributing to its gradual decay. Implicitly, the track stood for
the extension of such policies to the city as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   We were all living in the gutter, but some artists saw rough
poetry in the harsh light of neon signs, street lights, headlamps
and trash-can fires filtered through the noxious mists rising from
the streets. As the painter John Button once put it, ``New York's
manhole covers gush with steam because the city is so close to
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver's new film, by contrast, allegorizes anxieties that have
emerged in the post-cold war years. In the era of the one remaining
superpower, a single dominant ideology and the spreading advance of
the Internet, the Matrix can easily stand for what some have called
``the monoculture'': the network of shopping malls, theme parks,
edge cities, suburban subdivisions, convention centers and hotels
built around the consumer culture of advanced capitalism and its
market research standards of normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   Without an ideological adversary, it's easy to fall into an
only-the-paranoid-survive mentality. How can you tell whether
you're being manipulated? Or, what form of manipulation do you
prefer? Watching ``The Matrix'' you're never entirely certain what
is real photography, what is computer-generated imagery, what is a
location, what is a set, what actions are performed by actors, what
by stand-ins.
</P>
<P>
   A similarly ambient quality permeates the film on the level of
ideas. The Wachowski brothers have been presented as naifs, a
couple of comic book-bingeing carpenters from the Windy City. But
the idea of diffused power/intelligence seems to come straight from
Michel Foucault, and many viewers will undoubtedly see references
to Lacanian psychology, Cabbalism, Mahayana Buddhism, Christian
eschatology, Romantic rebellion, surrealist painting and other
sources amid the rapid whirl of kick-boxing, morphing, scrolling
digits and bang-bang firepower.
</P>
<P>
   The viewer bobs through religions, philosophies, arts and
sciences like a cork on a sea of liquefied civilizations. But
squint, and the drama is reduced to colored light projected in
space.
</P>
<P>
   Silver is best known for action movies like the ``Lethal
Weapon'' series, but he has also become a figure in architecture
circles, mainly because of his passion for the work of Frank Lloyd
Wright. In 1984, he bought and now lives in the Storrer House, one
of the four concrete ``textile block'' houses that Wright built in
Los Angeles in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a stretch to see parallels between the producer's house
and ideas that flicker through his movie. In both, the message is
freedom from repression, symbolized by the ability to move fluidly
through space.
</P>
<P>
   Wright expressed this Romantic ideal by rejecting historical
European styles, eliminating the confinement of enclosed rooms and
developing new building technologies that (in theory) expressed the
inherent qualities of his materials. In the Storrer house, built on
a hillside, he extended the concept of the open floor plan
vertically: when you ascend the stair from the lower to the upper
living room, you become conscious of being in two different spaces
at the same time. The effect is not dissimilar from that
experienced by the movie heroes when their digitized selves sally
forth into the Matrix, leaving their bodies behind at home base.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I happened to see ``The Matrix'' at the new United Artists
multiplex on Union Square South in Manhattan, an appalling spot
with all the charm of a high security prison. The poor moviegoer
rises through a bleakly Piranesian escalator core, past sheetrock
walls painted a sullen grey. On the landings, the walls are adorned
with what look like tubes of spangled gift-wrap. The twinkling
tubes, hung from hooks, swing limply in the air-conditioned breeze.
</P>
<P>
   The place would be less offensive if it weren't for a recorded
message, repeatedly piped through tinny speakers, that welcomes
moviegoers to this abysmal place and touts its state of the art
virtues as if we were witnessing the second coming of Radio City
Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The Matrix has got our ears, in other words, and you halfway
wish it could control our vision as well. I found myself in the
position of Cypher, the movie's Judas figure, who knows that the
steak he's eating is just an illusion, but he really loves the
illusion. I would gladly have turned in my popcorn if I could have
been fooled into thinking I was at the Roxy. Even the real Roxy was
a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that architecture has always functioned as a
matrix, an enveloping environment that embodies a world view. In
``The Architect of Desire,'' Suzannah Lessard writes about the fear
that overtook her on a visit to the Bowery Savings Bank, an ornate
Beaux Arts building designed by her great-grandfather, Stanford
White, in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   ``The source of the fear was the very geniality of the
architecture,'' Lessard observes, ``its delicacy, its glow, its
enspelling seductiveness.'' One could diagnose similar impulses in
London's Regency terraces, Versailles, Baroque cathedrals and
virtually any form of urban organization back to the time when our
ancestors painted on the walls of caves.
</P>
<P>
   Today, architecture has fragmented into a grid of overlapping
matrices, spheres of influence each with a distinctive world view
and a set of architectural projections.
</P>
<P>
   THE TERRORIST MATRIX As much the creation of the monoculture as
of those who violently oppose it, this is the shadow world of mad
bombers, chemical warriors, militia fanatics, fringe cults, street
gangs. (High-security architecture; gated communities; video
surveillance of public spaces; black helicopters; prisons.)
</P>
<P>
   THE ECO-MATRIX The dystopian realm of shrinking rain forests,
diminished biodiversity, depleted ozone, drug-resistant viruses.
(Green Architecture; Biosphere 2; Mexico City).
</P>
<P>
   THE CYBERMATRIX The informational utopia of mass literacy,
transnational affiliations, instant gratifications, spaces and
objects with continuously morphing shapes. (Smart buildings; Sim
City; blob designs created with software programs developed for
animated films.)
</P>
<P>
   THE OLD BOY MATRIX White male architects sitting around not
saying what they really think about other white male architects at
the table.
</P>
<P>
   THE P.R. MATRIX Architects spinning freely within the suspension
of disbelief in their own mediocrity, sustained by the control
their profession exercises over the architecture and design press.
</P>
<P>
   THE THEORY MATRIX Aka Critical Architecture: officially opposed
to the monoculture, unofficially (and understandably) eager for
whatever commissions it might cough up.
</P>
<P>
   `THE MATRIX' MATRIX With its own website
(www.whatisthematrix.com), probable sequels and prequels and
forthcoming product tie-ins, like groovy Matrix sunglasses. I can't
wait to get a pair. Then I'll be just as good-looking as Keanu.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no inevitability so long as there is a
willingness to contemplate what is happening,'' wrote Marshall
McLuhan at the end of his 1966 book ``The Medium Is the Massage.''
I take that to be the moral of this media-mad movie. It's the point
of this column as well.

 Andy Meisler's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the series ``Dilbert.''  
 By ANDY MEISLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Cahuenga Boulevard, near Universal Studios,
there is a landmark of sorts: a medium-size office building whose
upper stories, mirrored in the fashion of the 1980s, angle outward.
The structure adjoins the busy Hollywood Freeway; passing motorists
get a swift, startling glance of themselves as they speed past.
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth floor of this building are a number of small
recording studios. In one of them, on a recent weekday, sat Casey
Kasem, the disk jockey. A medium-size, neatly dressed man of 67, he
sat behind soundproof glass. Illuminated by a single desk lamp, he
read with energetic earnestness from a thick sheaf of script pages
in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   He says: ``Inching back up a notch to No. 13 is a band that
features a gifted guitarist named the Edge. When the Edge was
growing up, his family couldn't afford to buy him a guitar, so the
talented teen built one! Here's U2 and `Sweetest Thing'!''
</P>
<P>
   A few bars of the beginning of the song, just to help mate the
introduction with the music, were played. Then silence.
</P>
<P>
   Kasem turns the page and begins reading another sound bite. In
the next few hours he reads dozens more, including numerous
vanilla-flavored biographical tidbits, upbeat comments on the
record ratings race and several heartfelt ``long distance
dedications'' _ a teen-ager to her late boyfriend, killed in a car
crash; a daughter to her hard-working, financially distressed
father.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, enough spoken words are recorded to begin editing
the actual music into Kasem's weekly pop and rock music countdown
show.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly the most riveting spectacle, except when you
realize that ``American Top 40 With Casey Kasem'' has been on the
air, under slightly different titles but with virtually the same
format, for nearly 29 years. Currently, the four-hour-long show,
heard in most markets on Saturday or Sunday morning, is broadcast
on more than 350 stations nationwide and heard at any one point in
his show by an audience that averages approximately 1.1 million
listeners over age 12.
</P>
<P>
   In the supposedly volatile worlds of radio and popular music,
Kasem's longevity matches that of personalities like Dick Clark and
Paul Harvey. To put it another way: his tenure has extended from
the era of Melanie and the Moody Blues through Donna Summers and
the Police through Madonna and Milli Vanilli and, at last glance,
the likes of Alanis Morissette, Courtney Love and Hole, Garbage,
and the Goo Goo Dolls.
</P>
<P>
   His show is at the center of mainstream America's connection
with its pop and rock-and-roll music and artists: a rather warm and
fuzzy relationship quite unfamiliar to readers of the angst-, rage-
and pharmaceutical-filled articles in much of the mainstream rock
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so simple,'' says Kasem in an interview after the
recording session. ``What do people love? Plato said it best:
`People who tell the stories rule society.' And we tell the
stories, and people love to hear the stories. Of course we've got a
tremendous responsibility to be accurate with those stories. And in
most cases to be wholesome.''
</P>
<P>
   By this, Kasem adds, he means that if, say, a song holds the
record for consecutive weeks on the chart for a female recording
artist born in Britain _ the kind of inside information he has
learned his listeners like to hear _ he and his staff will make
sure that the statistic is completely accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if any biographical anecdote involves drugs or alcohol, it
will almost certainly be about the artist's rehabilitation and
subsequent career comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think magazines like Rolling Stone go into much more depth
and, um, critique,'' says Kasem. ``Where we don't really get into
that. We just tell the story as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People listen to the show on their way to church,'' says David
Kantor, senior vice president of Chancellor Radio Networks in
charge of AMFM Networks, the Dallas-based company that currently
distributes ``American Top 40 With Casey Kasem,'' in a telephone
interview. ``Our audience tunes in at the same time each week and
gets a show that is always different, but also always the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Poleman, program director of New York's WHTZ-FM, which
broadcasts the show on Saturday from 5 to 9 a.m., says: ``Casey
attracts a lot of core audience, from 18 to 34, and also the people
who grew up listening to him over the years. It's one of the few
shows parents can listen to with their kids. He's a true mass
appeal D.J.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Stone, 38, a South Portland, Maine, resident and
single parent whose long distance dedication, to a foster child,
was read on the air recently, says: ``I've been listening to
`American Top 40' for four or five years. It's the only radio show
I really listen to regularly. When Casey read my name I went sort
of nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone also reports that she particularly enjoys listening to
the singer Jewel and the Australian pop group Savage Garden. Since
both have had several songs in the contemporary hit records
rankings issued by Radio and Records, a trade publication (a list
hewed to religiously by ``American Top 40''), both groups have been
well represented on the show. Hence, automatic listener
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never have to work to find our audience,'' says Kasem. ``It
finds us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasem, now well into his fifth decade in the music business,
cheerfully admits that he no longer makes judgments about _ or
indeed, regularly listens to _ the music he plays on his show.
Which makes it all the more interesting that most observers credit
his warm and familiar voice with much of the show's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Detroit, the son of a Lebanese-American mother and a
Lebanese immigrant father, Kasem was a popular disk jockey in his
hometown; in Oakland, Calif., and in Los Angeles before beginning
``American Top 40'' on July 4, 1970. Many elements of its format
were admittedly borrowed from older shows like ```Your Hit
Parade.'' (``That was `Teach Your Children,' a debut from Crosby,
Stills, Nash and Young. It's heavy stuff, and you expect heavy
stuff from them.'')
</P>
<P>
   While all has been tranquil on the listeners' side of the radio,
Kasem's show has experienced some bumps and bruises behind the
scenes. A significant threat to the franchise has been the drastic
fragmentation of pop music radio: In the 1970s and earlier, the
strongest station in each market would almost invariably play Top
40; in recent years formats like urban and alternative rock have
shoved them aside.
</P>
<P>
   To service a wider range of stations Kasem's show is now
programmed in three versions based on three somewhat different play
lists: contemporary hit radio, roughly equal to the old Top 40;
adult contemporary, slightly milder, and hot adult contemporary,
slightly edgier. These alternative versions are packaged as Top 20
shows, as is a shortened version of '`American Top 40.''
</P>
<P>
   The show has experienced several changes in ownership: In 1989
Kasem left his longtime employer, ABC Radio, to throw in his lot
with the Westwood One network, now owned by CBS. For a time ABC,
which retained the rights to the name ``American Top 40,''
countered with a show that had the radio and television personality
Shadoe Stevens as host, while Kasem's was called ``Casey's Top
40.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC eventually canceled its show; last year Kasem, amid a flurry
of lawsuits, left Westwood One for AMFM and the show reassumed its
name.
</P>
<P>
   These days Kasem, who works two days a week, has no plans to
retire _ or to be retired. ``The great thing about radio is that
nobody really knows how old you are,'' he says. ``People `see' who
they want to see. They're seeing what radio allows their mind to
create.''

 &HT;    Florida ``turkey'' budget passes
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ A record state budget stuffed with a record
$665 million in ``turkeys'' unanimously passed the Legislature
Tuesday, on its way to a dubious governor who warns lawmakers to
expect some ``discomfort'' over what he intends to do.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in both chambers congratulated themselves for
allocating $1 billion more for schools, giving back $1 billion in
tax cuts and setting aside $1 billion for the Lawton Chiles
Endowment for youth and elder programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of this budget,'' said House Speaker John
Thrasher, R-Orange Park, of the $48.9 billion, inch-and-a-half
thick document, noting that the 119-0 vote in the House and 40-0
passage in the Senate marked the first time since 1984 that the
state budget passed without dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Perennial anti-budget vote Rep. Rob Wallace, R-Tampa, even voted
yes this time, pointing out that the 1999-2000 budget eliminates
646 state government positions. ``That's the first time we've done
that before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats, outnumbered nearly 2-1 in the legislature, found
praise. ``I just want to say how impressed I am with your
commitment to education,'' Sen. Betty Holzendorf, D-Jacksonville,
told Senate President Toni Jennings, R-Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   What went almost unmentioned though, was the $664.8 million in
hometown projects lawmakers have inserted for such things as a
shooting range in Alachua County, eradicating gnats in Sanford and
``safety resurfacing of the slide and glide playground'' in Coral
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Only once was the word ``turkey'' mentioned on either floor: by
Rep. James Bush, D-Miami, who said he hoped in the future poor
districts like his get more of them. He added that he was grateful
for those he did get, including $50,000 for the Miami-Dade Police
Athletic League, and that he hoped Gov. Jeb Bush doesn't veto them,
as he has promised he will do for projects that do benefit the
whole state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the governor will not view these as turkeys when they
hit his desk,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The big, seven and eight-figure projects among the 913
identified in a Palm Beach Post analysis went disproportionately to
the two chambers' presiding officers and budget committee and
subcommittee chairs. Indeed, those fourteen lawmakers account for
$346.2 million of all the member projects _ 52 percent.

 &HT;    Legislators, lobbyists think Bush's budget-slashing won't fly
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Despite repeated warnings that Gov. Jeb Bush
will unmercifully slash ``turkeys'' from the state's $48 billion
budget, many lobbyists and lawmakers insist that Bush will be
forced to leave most of them alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a balance of power question,'' says Sen. Tom Rossin,
D-West Palm Beach. ``You can't just have the governor imposing his
view of the world on the legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He will have chaos next year if he goes too far,'' said a
prominent lobbyist of 20 years who does not want to get on Bush's
bad side. ``The members will revolt and he will have problems
governing if he kills their projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush insists that any member project that does not fill a
legitimate state need will be vetoed and he will not show
favoritism toward lawmakers who have supported his legislative
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important that we establish a precedent for the
future,'' Bush said Tuesday. ``If that means I have to veto the
projects of my friends, even though I don't like to disappoint my
friends, I will veto it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Moffitt, a former House speaker who now lobbies the
legislature, said he thinks Bush will find it much more difficult
than he thinks to veto some member projects. ``He has to have a
good working relationship with the members and he's going to have
to be responsive to their needs if he wants them to help him in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   A Palm Beach Post review of the budget has found $664.8 million
in hometown projects in the budget. That total includes $36 million
for Palm Beach County projects and nearly $44 million for Martin
and St. Lucie counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that some of these things get called
turkeys,'' said Rossin. ``I have a waste water system for Pahokee
that will cost $850,000. They desperately need it and they can't
afford it as a city. I think that makes it a legitimate state need.
There are all kinds of projects like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, while not commenting on any specific project, said he
doesn't expect to veto every member project but that the criteria
he will use will be much more stringent than the legislature has
been accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has done a good job of protecting his right to veto,''
said lobbyist Jim Krog, who worked as Gov. Lawton Chiles' chief of
staff. ``A governor has to take a real hard stand or he'll get run
over. I think he's going to get his way. I don't see a Republican
legislature trying to override the veto of a Republican governor
just to save some hometown projects. I think he's got a free
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Herb Morgan, who was House budget chairman for 10 years and
fought huge battles with Gov. Bob Graham, thinks Bush could go too
far. ``If he ticks off too many people he could get into trouble.
The legislature has the right to determine how the state's money
should be spent and I think they would want to protect that right
if they think a governor is going too far with his vetoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that many Republicans voted for school vouchers
only because Bush asked them to do so. If he in turn vetos their
projects these same members will feel betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they feel that way,'' said one former lawmaker, ``you
have a hard time getting them to support you on the next tough
vote.''

AT&AMP;T PROFIT SURGES 42 PERCENT ON COST CUTS

<P>
   Even as it continued its flurry of deal-making, AT&AMP;T Corp. on
Tuesday reported strong financial results for the first quarter
that exceeded analysts' expectations. But investors did not rush to
buy AT&AMP;T's shares amid continued uncertainty about the company's
unsolicited $58 billion bid to acquire MediaOne Group Inc., the big
cable television company.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings for AT&AMP;T, the nation's biggest communications company,
rose 42 percent over the first quarter of last year, largely
because of an aggressive cost-cutting campaign by C. Michael
Armstrong, the company's chairman of 18 months. More important,
AT&AMP;T showed signs of finally emerging from the revenue funk it had
been stuck in for years, boosting sales by more than 6 percent over
the comparable period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, AT&AMP;T also announced a partnership with Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, the world's biggest phone company, to
provide comprehensive packages of communications services to
multinational corporations in Japan and perhaps other parts of
Asia. AT&AMP;T has formed a separate joint venture with British
Telecommunications PLC, and if AT&AMP;T can work well with both
partners, it will have gone a long way toward realizing its global
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   But it is AT&AMP;T's ambitions in the United States that continue
both to invigorate and worry investors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main questions facing Wall Street, not to mention
MediaOne's board, which had already agreed to sell its company to
Comcast Corp., is how feasible AT&AMP;T's offer really is from a legal
and regulatory perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, those are questions that also preoccupy Comcast,
which needs to gauge AT&AMP;T's offer before deciding whether to make a
serious counterbid of its own. Executives close to Comcast said
Tuesday that while that company had weighed a variety of options,
it had not yet decided how to respond to the AT&AMP;T bid.

U.S. AND RUSSIAN OFFICIALS MEET ON KOSOVO CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Senior American and Russian officials met on Tuesday to
discuss competing notions of how Kosovo could be resettled and
administered once hostilities end, as Moscow moved increasingly
into a role as mediator in the lengthening Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Moscow for Germany, Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott gave a positive assessment of his meetings with
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, a former prime minister who has been
appointed Russia's special envoy for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that Russia and the United States are
working together on this problem,'' Talbott said. ``The problem is
extremely complicated. It is important that urgent work continues,
and it will continue in the days to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, important disagreements were evident. The major
differences centered on how Kosovo would be administered, what kind
of force would keep the peace and how many Serbian troops might be
allowed to remain.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have been talking about setting up an
``internationally protected area'' in Kosovo that would be
nominally within Yugoslavia, but effectively controlled by allied
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow favors a different arrangement, one that harks back to
American proposals made at the peace talks outside Paris before
they collapsed and the bombing began. In Russia's approach, Kosovo
would be under international supervision for only a limited period
until security could be established, the refugees returned and a
new government elected.
</P>
<P>
   This plan appears to reflect Russia's anxiety about having NATO
establish protectorates in sovereign nations, and Yugoslavia's
preoccupation with retraining control over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin reaffirmed that argument in an interview on Russian
television in which he said, ``Kosovo is part of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Tuesday's discussions reflected differences over the
sort of force that might enter Kosovo once the hostilities ended.
</P>
<P>
   NATO favors an international force, with allied troops at its
core. A major component would be the British troops who are now
assembling in the thousands in neighboring Macedonia. The United
States has pledged to contribute 4,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a senior administration official said the
Russians spoke to Talbott about an international military force,
rather than just an international presence, that would enter Kosovo
and bring the refugees back. But the official said there was ``a
lot of ambiguity'' about what Moscow means by ``military force,''
for example, whether it means heavily armed soldiers or lightly
armed police.
</P>
<P>
   The official said Chernomyrdin repeated his earlier assessment
to the Americans that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
could accept an international force from nations like Russia, South
Africa, Ukraine, Nigeria, Algeria, Greece and other countries not
involved in the hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Belgrade also differ about the number of Serbian troops
that might remain in Kosovo after a settlement: virtually none, as
far as the alliance is concern; about 22,500 troops and Interior
Ministry police, according to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   During the discussions in Moscow on Tuesday, Russian officials
proposed a bombing pause to encourage diplomacy, but Talbott
rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such complications, Russian mediation has emerged as the
most promising avenue for a diplomatic solution, and the
businesslike tone of Tuesday's meeting suggested that a serious
process is under way. But it remains unclear how much influence
Russia really has over Belgrade, and how much leverage it is
prepared to use.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin sidestepped the question in his public comments on
Tuesday. ``We are intermediaries, not participants, and everybody
should realize it,'' he said. ``The thing is, only Russia can make
contact with Yugoslavia today.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the differences, a State Department official said the
talks were ``not strident.'' A NATO official said the Clinton
administration was mildly encouraged because Chernomyrdin was in a
``listening mode'' with Talbott and took a ``positive approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is not the only channel. U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan is due in Moscow on Wednesday. There have been suggestions
that he may appoint a special envoy for Kosovo, but it is not clear
if he is prepared to do so now.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Russia, as well as NATO, has much to gain by
negotiating a solution. The allies' air strikes have been a painful
thorn in the side of President Boris Yeltsin, who is trying to fend
off nationalist critics while maintaining a good working
relationship with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has been consumed with the Yugoslav issue, according to
Chernomyrdin, who has also been busy: Before his two-hour meeting
on Tuesday with Talbott, he talked on Monday by telephone with Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is the enormous gulf between NATO's
demands and the vague proposals that Milosevic is floating through
Russian intermediaries.

MARKET PLACE: NOTHING TOYLIKE IN MATTEL CEO'S COMPENSATION

<P>
   Barbie was a tough sell in 1998, but Jill Barad had a good year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad, the chairman and chief executive of Mattel, the maker
of Barbie, was received $4.75 million, according to a recent filing
with securities regulators. Her salary, $1.26 million, and her
bonus, $500,000, were 14 percent higher than in 1997, her first
year leading the giant toy maker. She also received $2.86 million
in long-term incentive pay last year and $131,756 in other
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   But by almost any measure, last year was disappointing for
Mattel shareholders. Revenues from the Barbie brand fell as Toys
``R'' Us cut back on all its inventory, causing Mattel's profits to
sink and its stock to tumble 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Barad had either the good luck or the foresight to take
options grants back in 1997 intended to carry her for several years
_ grants not subject to renegotiation. Mattel's board awarded her
special options grants whose value was estimated at $24 million at
the time and brought her total compensation for 1997 to $26.3
million. After lumping all the options in that year, her
compensation this year appears modest in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   While the increase in her base salary may raise eyebrows given
Mattel's dismal performance last year, the total compensation was
far more reasonable this year, said Graef Crystal, an
executive-compensation critic and editor of the Crystal Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you threw her pay package on a scale, all the springs would
have fallen out'' in 1997, Crystal said. ``It looks like they went
on a pay Weight Watchers all during 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Barad's base salary is 60 percent higher than that of
chief executives running companies of similar size, by Crystal's
calculation. After factoring in her bonus for completing the
acquisition of Tyco Toys Inc., Ms. Barad's pay is 29 percent above
the market average, he found. Her total compensation, including
long-term incentive pay, is 13 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter of last year, Mattel reported a 67 percent
decline in earnings on lower revenue. For the year, its profits
rose 16 percent, to $332.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The problems have continued this year. Earlier this month,
Mattel reported a $17.9 million loss, or 7 cents a share, for the
first quarter of 1999 and said revenue fell 2 percent, to $692.1
million. The company also said that it would dismiss about 3,000
employees, or 10 percent of its work force, and close some
factories and offices. The stock fell from $37.25 to $23.50 last
year and has since languished. It closed at $25.8125 Tuesday, up
6.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mattel said neither Ms. Barad nor the company
would comment on her compensation or that of any of other senior
executives.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.86 million in long-term incentive pay was for meeting
certain three-year financial targets, though the company declined
Tuesday to say whether it was the maximum she could have earned for
reaching the strategic goals.
</P>
<P>
   On her short-term goals, Ms. Barad missed the mark. She did not
qualify for a bonus of up to 150 percent of her base salary tied to
meeting certain internal financial targets. She also did not get
any new stock options.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the value of her existing options has declined
along with Mattel's stock price. Ms. Barad exercised options for
224,453 shares last year, but still held those shares, with a paper
profit of $6.4 million, at the time of the filing.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Barad's total pay package, David Leibowitz, a stock
analyst with Burnham Securities, said he expected some of the
initiatives she put in place in 1998 to begin paying off this year
and, therefore, did not consider her compensation out of line. In
particular, the company's pending acquisition of The Learning
Company, a leading software maker, should make Mattel more
competitive in interactive toys, Leibowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is clearly keeping step with the times and is
trying to get ahead of the curve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the acquisitions, Ms. Barad has shuffled management.
Mattel's regulatory filing also shows that Bruce Stein, who
resigned as chief operating officer and president of the company's
worldwide operations in March, received a salary of $760,390 and a
bonus of $350,000 for 1998. He also received $1.6 million as part
of the long-term incentive package and $69,000 form the company's
personal investment plan.
</P>
<P>
   He received a $1 million signing bonus when he joined the
company in 1996. His severance package was not disclosed.

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ An 18-year-old woman who attended the senior
prom with one of the killers at Columbine High School bought at
least two of the firearms used in the attack, the authorities
confirmed on Tuesday as they announced that 51 pipe bombs _ nearly
twice as many as first mentioned _ had been found.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Robyn Anderson, who did not respond to requests for
comment, was interviewed by the police on Monday and released. She
bought two shotguns at a local gun show she attended recently with
the two gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, her prom date, and
is currently being considered a witness, not a suspect. Ms.
Anderson could face criminal charges if she knew how her friends
intended to use the weapons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we feel she has committed a criminal act,'' she will be
returned to custody, said Sgt. Jim Parr of the Jefferson County
Sheriff's Department. ``As far as I know, she's still
cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Parr and Steve Davis, a spokesman for the Sheriff's department,
declined to say how many of the pipe bombs had been detonated or
which ones had been found in the school, the adjacent parking lot,
or Harris' home.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the additional bombs came on the one-week
anniversary of the rampage here, which left one teacher 14 students
_ including the two gunmen _ dead and a community in shock and
mourning. This middle-class suburb south of Denver, and indeed much
of Colorado, came to halt at 11:21 a.m. on Tuesdayday to mark the
moment the shooting began, with a blackout on local television and
radio stations as church bells tolled 15 times, one for each of the
slain. Two more students were buried on Tuesdayday in tearful
funerals that drew thousands, part of an overflowing calendar of
grief that will continue through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the first hints of normalcy began to appear, as
teachers met to plan next week's return to classes for Columbine's
nearly 2,000 students, and the girls' soccer team played the first
interscholastic athletic event since the devastating attack on the
school.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though the parents of the two young men who
plotted the massacre for at least a year remained in seclusion, a
new details began to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who kept a journal outlining plans for the attack and
appears to have been the mastermind of the plot, had hoped to join
the Marines but was rejected because of a medical reason just days
before he and his best friend stormed onto campus carrying guns and
bombs, officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a retired Air Force pilot, Harris was recruited as
part of a routine telephone canvass and did well at a preliminary
interview, but was nixed after a meeting at his home April 15, when
his ``parents divulged a medical factor,'' according to Lt. Jeff
Sammons, a spokesman for the Marine Corps Recruiting Command in
Quantico, Va. The Marines would not disclose the medical reason,
but the parent of a friend of Harris' said the young man had been
on psychiatric medication, which can be disqualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Eric's case, the system worked,'' Sammons said. ``We caught
someone who didn't qualify for the Marine Corps.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reliance on certain prescription drugs, reasons
for a medical disqualification include asthma, flat feet, and some
allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Good, whose son Nathan Dykeman was a friend of both
youths said that Harris had been seeing a psychiatrist. ``Eric did
have a few problems, Eric was in counseling,'' Good said in an
interview on Tuesday. ``When we heard about it we were like, so, so
he's seeing a psychiatrist? So the parents think he needs someone
to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   Good said that he has known Klebold and his parents for years,
and that no one could have predicted the attack. ``Now everyone
wants to point fingers, at the parents, at the schools _ the
Sheriff's Department should have known something, the school should
have known something,'' he said. ``The most horrifying thing of
this that people should be horrified and scared to death of, is
that these kids did not show any signs of this. It's terrifying. We
knew a different Dylan.''
</P>
<P>
   Good praised Susan and Thomas Klebold as excellent parents, and
criticized the politicians _ from President Clinton to the local
sheriff _ who have questioned their responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was no broken family, this was no abusive family, no
anything,'' he said. ``These people spent time with their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The elderKlebold considered his two sons his best friends, Good
said, nboting that earlier this month he spent five days with Dylan
touring the University of Arizona, where the 18-year-old senior
planned to enroll in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked about the future and everything,'' he added.
``This guy knew his kid, and loved his kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Just three days before the attack, Dykeman attended the prom
with Klebold as part of a group of four couples who shared a
limousine, and saw Harris at the post-prom party. ``They all had a
great time,'' Good said. Though the parents of both shooters have
remained in seclusion, Good said he had spoken to the Klebolds on
Tuesday morning.

   ``We're forgetting that family _ those two families are by
themselves,'' he said. ``Their life has been forever turned upside
down and it will never heal. They're looking for explanations,
they're looking through everything: Was that a sign, was that a
sign, did I miss something? They're second-guessing their entire
lives.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House approved broad legislation Tuesday that
rewrites the rules for the satellite television industry,
permitting companies to broadcast local television programs and
long-distance signals that have until recently been either
restricted or more costly.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed 422-1, with the lone dissenting vote cast
by Rep. Robert Brady, D-Pa. It imposes a new ``must carry''
requirement backed by cable companies that mandates that satellite
companies like Echostar Communications and Direct TV that decide to
offer any local signals must also offer all local programming in
those markets by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill said it was intended to resolve
long-running disputes between the satellite and broadcasting
industries, while also helping the satellite companies compete with
cable television, which many analysts say holds a monopoly in many
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will level the playing field between cable versus
satellite,'' said Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., the chief sponsor of
the legislation. ``With this new competition will come better
services at lower prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., the senior Democrat on the House
telecommunications subcommittee, said, ``I can't imagine in this
video revolution that we're facing a bigger moment than today.''
</P>
<P>
   The House action comes nearly one month after the cable industry
was deregulated from most price controls set by the government
under a three-year-old law that had assumed greater competition
between operators of cable television and satellites. Although
subscriptions to satellite television have grown significantly in
recent months, consumer groups have said that the high cost of
satellite dishes and other equipment necessary to receive signals,
combined with the lack of local programming, has discouraged true
competition to the cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also follows recent court decisions that had
threatened to reduce the attractiveness of satellite television to
consumers by restricting its ability to broadcast signals of the
major networks. Current law permits satellite companies to beam
network signals if those customers cannot receive local stations
using rooftop antennas.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said the legislation would be helpful to
viewers, but was only a modest beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small step in the right direction,'' said Gene
Kimmelman, the co-director of the Washington office of Consumers
Union and a leading opponent of the deregulation of the cable
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation permits satellite companies to carry the same
local-broadcast affiliates that are provided by cable rivals.
Current law restricts consumers from receiving satellite
retransmission of network programming if local channels can be
received by an antenna. It reduces the copyright fees on satellite
companies for carrying superstation and distant network stations.
And it eliminates a provision in the current law that requires
consumers of cable television to wait for three months after they
cancel their cable service before receiving satellite service.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation has already been adopted by two Senate
committees and could be debated on the floor of that chamber next
month, aides said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists and executives from the satellite television industry
generally praised the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with the bill,'' said Andrew Paul, a senior vice
president of the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications
Association. Still, Paul and others from the industry said
legislative battles remain ahead over several of its provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Marsocci, a spokesman for Direct TV, said that although the
legislation was ``a step in the right direction,'' it contained
some provisions that the company would continue to lobby against.
For instance, satellite companies oppose a provision that would
require them to provide roof antennas to subscribers who lose
distant network signals.

PENTAGON STRUGGLING TO MOVE TROOPS FASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-NATO) 
(mb) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT and STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ever since the Persian Gulf war, the Pentagon has
tried to transform its forces into lighter, mobile units able to
intervene swiftly in the world's trouble spots. But as the war in
the Balkans has shown, the military is anything but the
``expeditionary'' force it wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   Despite spending billions of dollars through the 1990s on ships
and aircraft meant to give the American military rapid global
reach, the Pentagon's war effort in the Balkans has still struggled
to overcome the obstacles inherent in moving military might
thousands of miles.
</P>
<P>
   Even sending two dozen Apache helicopters from Germany to
Albania has taken a month as the Pentagon juggled the need to
provide aid to refugees with the austere conditions of Albania's
airfield, while wrestling with NATO's bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for such delays vary _ from the fact the Pentagon
has only recently begun to reshape its transportation to the fact
that no one, after the end of the cold war, envisioned fighting a
major land war in the Balkans. Instead, the Pentagon shifted much
of its attention and its heavy equipment to preparing for wars in
the Persian Gulf and the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have accused the Pentagon of moving slowly to
create smaller, more mobile forces, but officials say that no
matter what the shape of Army divisions, sending a large numbers of
troops has always and will always take time.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and many NATO allies still oppose putting
ground forces into Kosovo in anything but a peacekeeping role. But
with prodding from Britain and France to update the assessment of
what troops could be needed to wage a ground war, NATO has signaled
a new willingness to at least consider using ground forces to evict
Yugoslavia's army from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still no political will to mount an invasion of
Yugoslavia or the ability to do so any time soon. Pentagon and NATO
officials said it would take two to three months to assemble a
force large enough to do the job, depending on its exact mission.
NATO planners would need at least a couple of weeks just to prepare
the details.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO first addressed the issue last fall, the planners
estimated that the allies would need 75,000 troops to invade Kosovo
and as many as 200,000 ground forces to take over all of
Yugoslavia. Now these numbers are likely to grow as aides to NATO's
Supreme Commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, update their assessment in
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had an option _ a planned option for ground forces _ it
would be a long and drawn-out proposition from the deployment to
using it,'' Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, told Congress recently.
</P>
<P>
   No nation has the means to move military forces around the globe
the way United States can. But American strategy still rests on a
simple fact: even the best forces are no good if they cannot get to
the front quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   The time needed is such that winter could arrive just as NATO
assembled a ground force large enough to rout Serbian forces in
Kosovo, which is accessible from the south only through narrow
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Some military experts say NATO and the Pentagon have the ability
to move more rapidly into the Balkans but, so far, lack the will to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Hanlon, an analyst at the Brookings Institution, said
that the Pentagon could chose to deploy a smaller force _ like an
assault division _ within a month rather than waiting for a large
buildup, though a fear of casualties was driving planners to
consider only using overwhelming force. He added that a lack of
foresight _ as much as logistics _ contributed to the delay in
moving forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the administration had had its head anywhere above water
when this began, they would have already been thinking about the
need for ground forces,'' he said. ``If they had started to send,
say, a week into the war, they'd be there by now.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Soviet Union _ followed by the Pentagon's
struggle to amass the forces necessary to drive Iraq out of Kuwait
in 1991 _ forced the military to rethink how it dispatches forces
to deal with crises in far-flung parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   After the Persian Gulf war, all of the armed services moved to
make themselves more agile. But many of the new methods are still
evolving.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, for example, is spending $6 billion to build 19 new
cargo ships designed to haul troops and heavy weapons, as well as
the supplies they carry. The first five of these ships are now in
the Persian Gulf, carrying a heavy Army brigade's worth of M1-A1
battle tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, mortars and other
equipment, but the rest of the ships are not scheduled to join the
fleet until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force, with the strong support of the Army, is building
120 C-17 cargo planes, an aircraft large enough to carry almost the
same payload as the giant C-5s but nimble enough to operate from
austere landing strips that previously only smaller C-130s could
manage. Only 48 C-17s have been built, and about a dozen are flying
in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But flying in materiel has inherent limitations. General Shelton
said it would ultimately take several hundred C-17 loads to fly in
the rockets and other equipment supporting the two dozen Apache
helicopters that have been sent to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Until all these faster, more mobile cargo planes and ships are
ready, the military is relying heavily on equipment and supplies
stockpiled on ships and depots in strategic parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, the Pentagon's planning for major
wars has focused on the Persian Gulf and the Korean peninsula _ and
not Europe. Because planners failed to anticipate a major war in
the Balkans, the Army withdrew much of its stockpiles from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Army now has stocks for only three Army brigades _ not even
a full division _ in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. That means
that any significant ground force deployed to fight Yugoslavia
would have to rely on equipment hauled from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has outlined a strategy for moving its forces,
something known as the Strategic Mobility Program. Under this plan,
the Army sets goals for moving different sizes and strengths of
troops. A light infantry division of 11,000 soldiers, which can be
flown most anywhere fairly quickly, is supposed to arrive within 12
days. The heavier divisions take longer. Two heavy armored
divisions _ with 34,000 troops and 101,342 tons of equipment _
should be able to arrive in Europe from the United States within 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   But the heaviest force under the strategy _ five divisions and
more than 100,000 troops _ would not be expected to arrive for 75
days.
</P>
<P>
   Even if NATO had the ability to move its forces faster, physical
and political difficulties abound.
</P>
<P>
   There are few seaports that can accommodate the deep-draft cargo
ships the Navy would like to use. Albania's main port in Durres is
too shallow for the large ships carrying tanks and other heavy Army
equipment, officials say. And the roads leading from the Albanian
port to the border with Kosovo are so poor that when NATO planners
drew up their assessments last fall for a land invasion of
Yugoslavia, they eliminated Albania as staging area for tanks and
other heavy forces.
</P>
<P>
   Albania, however, could be developed into a base for long-range
artillery and attack helicopters, like the 24 Apache gunships now
in country.
</P>
<P>
   The major port for NATO to pour forces into Kosovo would be
Thessaloniki in Greece, which is about 140 miles south of Kosovo,
on good roads that run through Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy equipment sent by road or rail from bases in Germany,
could be trucked or sent by rail to Adriatic ports like Trieste.
From Trieste, for instance, it would take ships three to four days
to dock in Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary is giving NATO use of its air bases, but its leaders
have deep misgivings over massing a large NATO force. They fear
that such a step could unleash a crackdown against the 300,000
ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina, the other province in the republic
of Serbia that, like Kosovo, lost its autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to avoid using ground troops,'' Gen. Firenc Vegh,
Hungary's chief of defense, said in an interview. ``It could cause
strong ethnic cleansing in the Vojvodina.''

FLORIDA POISED TO PASS SCHOOL VOUCHER PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to delete incorrect reference in 3rd graf to `the Republican
governor, who is also frequently mentioned as the party's most
attractive presidential candidate in 2000.')  (mb) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In a move that critics say will cause an exodus from
struggling inner-city schools but one that advocates believe will
save them, Gov. Jeb Bush and leaders in the Florida Legislature
have agreed to allow children in the lowest-rated schools to attend
private institutions with state-paid tuition.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which was a cornerstone of Bush's campaign for
governor, will make Florida the only state to use public education
funds for vouchers that will pay the way for students to attend
private schools. including religious schools.The measure is
expected to pass in the House and Senate this week, perhaps as
early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the State House and Senate, both controlled by
Republicans, worked out an agreement on Monday on a bill that Bush
will sign ``with a smile on his face,'' said Nicolle Devenish,
press secretary to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which is also intended to pay the way for children in
failing schools to attend higher-rated public schools, will assign
every state public school a grade _ A, B, C, D or F _ based on
standardized test scores. Students who attend schools rated ``F''
can, on the request of their parents, be awarded vouchers of about
$4,000 _ called ``opportunity scholarships'' _ no matter what a
student's grades are.
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue that has consumed much of Bush's first term, as
he put the issue ahead of all other business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half our kids graduate from high school,'' said Bush. ``Half
are reading below basic levels in the fourth grade. This is vital
for our long-term competetiveness as a state, vital for restoring
our civil society. It pushes the resources and attention where it
needs to be. It will improve public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which will begin in September with four schools that
have tested poorly in the past _ one near Orlando, one outside
Tallahassee and two in Pensacola _ and gradually be expanded to
include all 3,000 public schools in the state, is seen by
proponents as a bold initiative to reform a system that has been
held back by teachers' unions and school administrators afraid of
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child in a failing school will now have the option to go
to a school where he or she can learn,'' said State Representative
Alex Diaz de la Portilla, a Republican from Westchester in
Miami-Dade County who is one of the plan's strongest proponents.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the plan said it violates the constitutional division
of church and state. And here in south Florida, where many
inner-city schools are expected to score low in the planned
standardized testing, they say it will worsen things by taking
their best students, and their state financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you will have is a massive exodus of students leaving the
public schools,'' said State Rep. James Bush, a Democrat from Miami
whose district, which includes Liberty City, Overtown and Opa
Locka, is the poorest in the state. ``You're going to lose
teachers,'' as enrollment drops and tax dollars dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   Other states, including Texas and Pennsylvania, are considering
such a plan, and some cities, including Milwaukee and Cleveland,
already have such systems in place, said Jeanne Allen, president of
the Center for Education Reform, a non-profit research group based
in Washington. Maine and Vermont have long-standing voucher
programs that allow a small number of students in rural areas who
do not live near schools.
</P>
<P>
   Other school systems, including the New York City system, have
considered using vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes this unique,'' said Ms. Allen, ``is that it is not
a simple program that pulls kids out of school. It puts schools on
notice that they will lose their good students unless they are
quality schools.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it is the first time a state has laid down ``immediate
consequences for pitiful results.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan would increase financing for schools that improve, as
it decreases financing to failing ones, as enrollment drops. While
state officials are unsure how many of Florida's 2 million students
would be affected, ``this could potentially be in the tens of
thousands or hundreds of thousands,'' said Ms. Allen.
</P>
<P>
   In cities that have voucher programs, anywhere from 5 to 30
percent of students take advantage of the program, said Brewser
Brown, chief of staff for Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan.
</P>
<P>
   There is not special allocation for the vouchers themselves,
just a re-distribution of state tax money already earmarked for
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money follows the child,'' said Brown. If a private
school's tuition is less than the amount _ about $4,000 _
earmarked, that money goes back into the state treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Under this legislation, public school students from the third
grade through through the 10th would be tested every year under a
vigorous new state test called the Florida Comprehensive Assessment
Test, and those cumulative scores would be used to rate the school.
De la Portilla said as many as 160 of the state's 3,000 schools
could get a failing grade.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Yarger, dean of the Scool of Education at the University of
Miami, said the plan ``very viable, politically,'' but one that
breaks down in the realities of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you allow vouchers,'' Yarger said, ``the students who
voucher out of public schools will be those whose parents care
about them,'' because they will have to provide transportation and
make other arrangements for their children, said Yarger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids who are left behind are the kids who are poor, whose
parents don't have the concern,'' he said. ``They will be left in
the school. That residual student body will demonstrate more
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bush said it is unfair to grade all schools by
the same standards. ``Traditionally, most inner-city schools don't
receive the resources that they should to catch up with schools
that have adequate books and computers and support staff and those
things that give some schools an upper hand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Small schools, which hold a warm place in the history of their
communities, would just disappear, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said another aspect of his education reform _ including
a $500 million increase in the education budget to tutor students
in those schools that were at risk of receiving a failing grade _
would make the eventual implementation of the program in inner
cities and rural areas more equitable.
</P>
<P>
   As the battle over the plan has raged, largely along party
lines, some private school principals have said they do not know if
they can accept the students or if the $4,000 voucher will cover a
year's tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle could be its legality. ``This will definitely
end up in court,'' Ms. Allen said. But provisions in the plan that
bar mandatory prayer in the class could help in pass its challenge
in the courts. ``This is about choice, not about religion,'' she
said.

ADVERTISING COUNCIL'S NEW PRESIDENT IS FIRST TO COME FROM MEDIA
BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For only the fourth time in its 57-year history, the
Advertising Council has a new president.
</P>
<P>
   The council, the nonprofit organization that has coordinated
public service campaigns for Madison Avenue since 1942, is naming
Peggy Conlon as president, succeeding Ruth Wooden, effective June
1. Ms. Wooden announced in January that she would leave the New
York-based council after serving as president since November 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Conlon, 48, is the first president to come from the media
industry. Since 1992, she has been vice president and group
publisher for the Broadcasting &AMP; Cable Group at Cahners Business
Information in New York, part of the international media
conglomerate Reed Elsevier. Before that, she spent a decade
overseeing trade newspapers at CMP Publications in Manhasset.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Conlon, who supervises eight publications like Broadcasting
&AMP; Cable, Digital Television and Television Latin America, was
selected from among five finalists for the president's post by a
search committee composed of 12 of the 85 board members of the
council, which represents advertisers, agencies and media
companies. The committee was assisted by Gilbert, Farlie in New
York, an executive search company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for somebody with Ruth's enthusiasm, passion
for the mission and ability to work with a lot of different
constituencies,'' said Gregory Coleman, the 1998-99 chairman of the
council and president for U.S. magazine publishing at the Reader's
Digest Association in New York. He discussed the selection at a
breakfast Tuesday where he was joined by Ms. Conlon and Ms. Wooden.
</P>
<P>
   The changing of the guard comes at a crucial time for the
council, which has taken on ``social marketing'' causes that range
from buying War Bonds and preventing forest fires to fighting drug
use and encouraging mentors for children.
</P>
<P>
   While the amount of commercial time and advertising space
donated to campaigns produced by the council reached a record level
last year, rising 21 percent, to an estimated $1.2 billion,
compared with $995.8 million in 1997, members have an even more
ambitious goals: to persuade media outlets to donate time and space
worth $2 billion by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason to select as the next president someone with
media industry experience, Ms. Wooden said, because the
fragmentation of media outlets is making it more difficult to reach
the intended audiences for the council's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Conlon, who worked for two advertisers and an agency before
entering the publishing field, said: ``For the last six and a half
years, we've broadened our coverage at Broadcasting &AMP; Cable to
include the full scope of television, Internet and technology. As a
result, in a very competitive category, we were able to more than
double revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Another issue facing the council is the propensity for the
television networks to favor paid cause-related marketing campaigns
they create in partnership with advertisers over pro bono ads from
the council.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wooden described that as ``a problem that's turned into an
opportunity'' as the council has begun collaborating with networks
like ABC, CBS, Comedy Central and NBC on campaigns centered on
topics like teen-age pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Conlon, who recently completed a two-year term as chairwoman
of the International Radio and Television Society, cited another
potential problem: ``There's the ability of new consumer
electronics devices to skip forward through commercials. So we need
to have the relationships with the media to make sure our messages
get in front of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wehling, the 1997-98 chairman of the council who was the
head of the search committee, said in a telephone interview:
``Peggy stood out in terms of the breadth and quality of her
industry contacts. In particular, she has good relationships with
key broadcast and cable leaders. That's important as we attempt to
significantly increase our visibility in those media.''
</P>
<P>
   Wehling, who is the corporate officer for global marketing,
market research and government relations at Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. in
Cincinnati, praised Ms. Conlon as an ``all-around excellent''
choice who will help insure ``years of future growth'' for the
council.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Ms. Conlon bypasses the council's No. 2
executive, S. Murray Gaylord, who joined in June 1997 after working
at agencies like Scali, McCabe, Sloves and TBWA/Chiat/Day.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman declined to discuss whether Gaylord, the council's
executive vice president and chief operating officer, had been
considered for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, did Gaylord, who when asked about his plans in a
telephone interview Tuesday said, ``I'm not ready to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Conlon said she hoped that Gaylord would stay on.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wooden, 52, will work with Ms. Conlon for a month and then
join the National Parenting Association in New York as president,
effective July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wooden's predecessors at the council were Theodore Repplier,
who served from 1942 to 1966, and Robert Keim, who served from 1966

SPORTS COLUMN: JOHN FRANCO SAVORS HIS HOME PLATE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On his rare forays into the hinterlands, John Franco
has made an amazing discovery. The pizza is not as good in the
suburbs, and neither is the bread. It's a fact. Something about
being outside the five boroughs curdles the dough, or spoils it, or
whatever it is that goes wrong with dough.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason alone, Franco cannot leave. He is a true prince
of the city. He made the schlep across the ``Saturday Night Fever''
Bridge from Brooklyn to Staten Island in search of a back yard for
his two children, but that's as far from Bensonhurst as he cares to
live.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is the greatest city in the country, in the world,''
Franco said Tuesday, displaying normal New York moderation.
</P>
<P>
   For that plug alone, Franco deserves an award from New York, but
Tuesday Franco was given the key to the city. The son of a
sanitation worker, the kid from the projects, the St. John's boy
who came home was honored for his rather exciting body of work as
the ace relief pitcher of the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Franco reached 400 saves a couple weeks ago, and had 404 going
into Tuesday night's game with the San Diego Padres at blustery
Shea Stadium. His total was the second highest in major league
history, behind the 478 of Lee Smith, now retired.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to acting as the unofficial spokesman for the
countless pizzerias and delis of his hometown, Franco has also done
wonders for the cardiology profession, inducing thousands of
late-hour calls from patients shouting, ``Doctor, Doctor, I've got
arrhythmia,'' only to have the cardiologist say, ``Relax, Johnny'll
get the next guy,'' which he does, more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   Even Franco saw the humor of his epic ninth innings while Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani was reading a tribute to Franco inside City Hall,
in front of Mets officials and Franco relatives and pals from the
old neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four hundred times under that kind of pressure, where there's
almost no room for error,'' the mayor intoned.
</P>
<P>
   Franco twitched noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more pressure there is, the better he pitches,'' the mayor
continued.
</P>
<P>
   A nervous grin crossed Franco's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never given Mets fans a dull moment,'' added the
notorious Yankee fan.
</P>
<P>
   Franco raised his eyes to the heavens, as if to say, ``Man, you
got that right.''
</P>
<P>
   The key ceremony ended, and segued immediately into a mayoral
news conference. While the Mets' contingent was filing out, news
reporters began questioning Giuliani on why he had suggested the
city's school system be ``blown up,'' surely an interesting choice
of words given the recent tragedy in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   While this typical New York bombast was going on, Franco stood
in the hallway and recalled his childhood in a housing development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was lower-middle class, sure,'' Franco said with immense
pride. ``We'd wear sweatshirts and sweatpants to bed in the winter
because the heater didn't work, and there was no air conditioning
in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was about 10, he and his older brother, Jimmy, would
collect the tops of Borden's milk containers and exchange them for
Mets tickets _ 20 containers for a ticket was the going rate, he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would take the B train to Times Square and change to the 7
train to Flushing,'' he said. ``We'd sit in the upper deck.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite player was Tug McGraw, the ebullient lefty
reliever. Now another hyper lefty has become the all-time Mets
relief pitcher, in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough place,'' Franco admitted. ``When I came in here
with Cincinnati in 1986, you'd see the standing ovations for the
Mets. It was great. But you need a thick skin to play here.''
</P>
<P>
   He has heard the cheers, and he has heard the yowls when he let
a lead get away, and a few times he has seemed to aim a glare or
the odd gesture at the mob. But he understands.
</P>
<P>
   He wishes his parents could see all this, but Mary Franco died
of ovarian cancer in 1986, and 14 months later Jim Franco died of a
heart attack while driving his sanitation truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to buy him a condo and a car in Florida, so he
could go to spring training with me,'' Franco said. ``I get a tear
in my eye when I think about them. I can see losing one, but losing
two within 14 months. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Life goes on. He met his wife, Rose Morrone, when they were 15,
at a discotheque, in Brooklyn. There were house-hunting expeditions
to New Jersey and Long Island, ``but it just didn't feel right,''
Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   He's a city kid, who dreamed of playing for the Mets, and now he
does, and that feels right.

 WASHINGTON: he predicted.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association is declining comment on the
package until it holds its convention later this week. The sports
council and the rifle association parted ways recently when the
council backed a call that manufacturers voluntarily put safety
locks on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who lined up with the president on Tuesday blamed
the gun lobby outright for school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said the term ``school violence''
glossed over the problem. ``This isn't about schools,'' he said.
``It's about guns. This is about the insanely easy access
Americans, including American children, have to guns. This is about
the distorted interpretation of the Constitution that convinces
otherwise rational citizens that it's their inalienable right to be
armed to the teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   His language was sharper than that of either the president or
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who, in opening the White House event,
focused more broadly on cultural causes and tried to strike a
reassuring note.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us here are searching for answers to what happened in
Littleton,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``But that does not mean that we
are either hopeless or helpless in the face of this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to the availability of guns but also said a media
culture that ``glorifies violence on TV, in the movies, on the
Internet, in songs'' and in video games could desensitize children
so that they ``lose their empathy for fellow human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   The premise of Clinton's speech was that the Littleton shootings
grew out of both the culture of violence and the gun culture, but
he focused on the latter and told Americans to reach out to
sportsmen and appeal to their common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You change the culture,'' Clinton said, ``we'll change the
laws.''

U.S. AND RUSSIAN OFFICIALS MEET ON KOSOVO CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to correct spelling of `retaining' in 7th graf)  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Senior American and Russian officials met on Tuesday to
discuss competing notions of how Kosovo could be resettled and
administered once hostilities end, as Moscow moved increasingly
into a role as mediator in the lengthening Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Moscow for Germany, Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott gave a positive assessment of his meetings with
Viktor Chernomyrdin, a former prime minister who has been appointed
Russia's special envoy for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that Russia and the United States are
working together on this problem,'' Talbott said. ``The problem is
extremely complicated. It is important that urgent work continues,
and it will continue in the days to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, important disagreements were evident. The major
differences centered on how Kosovo would be administered, what kind
of force would keep the peace and how many Serbian troops might be
allowed to remain.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have been talking about setting up an
``internationally protected area'' in Kosovo that would be
nominally within Yugoslavia, but effectively controlled by allied
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow favors a different arrangement, one that harks back to
American proposals made at the peace talks outside Paris before
they collapsed and the bombing began. In Russia's approach, Kosovo
would be under international supervision for only a limited period
until security could be established, the refugees returned and a
new government elected.
</P>
<P>
   This plan appears to reflect Russia's anxiety about having NATO
establish protectorates in sovereign nations, and Yugoslavia's
preoccupation with retaining control over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin reaffirmed that argument in an interview on Russian
television in which he said, ``Kosovo is part of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Tuesday's discussions reflected differences over the
sort of force that might enter Kosovo once the hostilities ended.
</P>
<P>
   NATO favors an international force, with allied troops at its
core. A major component would be the British troops who are now
assembling in the thousands in neighboring Macedonia. The United
States has pledged to contribute 4,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a senior administration official said the
Russians spoke to Talbott about an international military force,
rather than just an international presence, that would enter Kosovo
and bring the refugees back. But the official said there was ``a
lot of ambiguity'' about what Moscow means by ``military force,''
for example, whether it means heavily armed soldiers or lightly
armed police.
</P>
<P>
   The official said Chernomyrdin repeated his earlier assessment
to the Americans that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
could accept an international force from nations like Russia, South
Africa, Ukraine, Nigeria, Algeria, Greece and other countries not
involved in the hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Belgrade also differ about the number of Serbian troops
that might remain in Kosovo after a settlement: virtually none, as
far as the alliance is concern; about 22,500 troops and Interior
Ministry police, according to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   During the discussions in Moscow on Tuesday, Russian officials
proposed a bombing pause to encourage diplomacy, but Talbott
rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such complications, Russian mediation has emerged as the
most promising avenue for a diplomatic solution, and the
businesslike tone of Tuesday's meeting suggested that a serious
process is under way. But it remains unclear how much influence
Russia really has over Belgrade, and how much leverage it is
prepared to use.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin sidestepped the question in his public comments on
Tuesday. ``We are intermediaries, not participants, and everybody
should realize it,'' he said. ``The thing is, only Russia can make
contact with Yugoslavia today.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the differences, a State Department official said the
talks were ``not strident.'' A NATO official said the Clinton
administration was mildly encouraged because Chernomyrdin was in a
``listening mode'' with Talbott and took a ``positive approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is not the only channel. U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan is due in Moscow on Wednesday. There have been suggestions
that he may appoint a special envoy for Kosovo, but it is not clear
if he is prepared to do so now.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Russia, as well as NATO, has much to gain by
negotiating a solution. The allies' air strikes have been a painful
thorn in the side of President Boris Yeltsin, who is trying to fend
off nationalist critics while maintaining a good working
relationship with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has been consumed with the Yugoslav issue, according to
Chernomyrdin, who has also been busy: Before his two-hour meeting
on Tuesday with Talbott, he talked on Monday by telephone with Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is the enormous gulf between NATO's
demands and the vague proposals that Milosevic is floating through
Russian intermediaries.

 Quick-Fix CEOs
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
iCEO is not your typical temp agency or executive search firm.
Instead of placing accountants or human resources experts into
companies for a few days or weeks, the new Woodside company plans
to drop veteran chief executives into fast-growing, high-tech
companies for short stints.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose name is short for interim chief executive
officer, is the latest sign of the times at the epicenter of
innovation: securing talented managers in a hot industry.
</P>
<P>
   The time it takes to develop e-products and get them to market
before another entrepreneur beats you to it has never been shorter.
Meanwhile, there is a shortage of experienced CEOs, and the time it
takes to recruit them has never been longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest lament of venture capital firms is not money or
good ideas, which are infinite,'' said Rich Brenner, founder of the
Brenner Group of Cupertino, another Silicon Valley management and
financial services firm that provides temp CEOs for startups. ``The
biggest constraint on growth is lack of qualified management
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bengston, director of Emerging Company Services at
PricewaterhouseCoopers in San Jose, suggests that typical CEO
searches in the valley ``take about five months if you can get a
headhunter to take an assignment at all; the best ones are
booked.''
</P>
<P>
   Part-time CEOS are the natural next step in the mushrooming
outsourcing industry as companies increasingly turn to private
consultants and outplacement firms to meet their hiring needs and
cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dun &AMP; Bradstreet's annual outsourcing survey, the
North America market accounts for 60 percent of worldwide revenues
for all temporary employees and consultants. For the 12 months
ending this month, that amounted to about $141 billion, up 21
percent from $116 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest growth area, says D&AMP;B, is information technology,
which accounts for 28 percent of all outsourcing expenditures and
is anticipated to grow by 26 percent this year. There also is
strong demand for outside finance and personnel services.
</P>
<P>
   Many venture capital firms have employed so-called
entrepreneurs-in-residence to help lead companies they invest in.
But these free-lance executives often stayed just long enough to
land a permanent job at one of the VC-backed startups.
</P>
<P>
   However, the new breed of corporate samurai don't always want to
make a long-term commitment to one corporate master.
</P>
<P>
   ICEO, which quietly started three months ago, is the brainchild
of Ron Coleman, 43, who built and then sold a medical software
company and became an angel investor, and his friend David Powell,
62, who founded an executive search firm of the same name in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   After working with venture capital firms to find permanent CEOs
for their high-tech startups, David Powell Inc. added permanent and
part-time financial services, including bookkeepers and chief
financial officers, and then human resource professionals.
</P>
<P>
   With Powell as chairman and Coleman as CEO, iCEO's mission is to
match proven CEOs with VC-backed startups that need bridge
leadership as much as bridge financing. Coleman maintains that
fill-in work suits many business leaders, who at 45 to 65 recently
retired or plan to do so but want to stay involved without making a
five-year commitment.
</P>
<P>
   That, in essence, sums up Coleman's recent predicament. After
earning a Ph.D. in microbiology in Ireland, Coleman did
post-doctorate work at Harvard, where he ran the university's first
automated DNA synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by the siren song of the biotech business boom, he then
got a Stanford MBA on a fellowship and founded de Medici Systems in
1989. Six years later, he sold the medical software company for an
undisclosed fortune and became an angel investor.
</P>
<P>
   But playing golf and puttering around his homes in Los Altos and
Carmel were not enough. ``I love the pace of business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His and Powell's idea is to represent executive stars much the
way International Management Group markets sports stars like Joe
Montana and Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The ``poster boy'' for interim CEOs, according to Coleman, is
Steve Jobs, who tackled Apple Computer while also leading Pixar.
While Jobs is not on iCEO's roster, Coleman said seven well-known
CEOs have signed up.
</P>
<P>
   The company is not yet ready to disclose their identities.
Coleman would only divulge that they have broad experience in five
different disciplines: the Internet, software, semiconductors,
networking/telecommunications and medical/biotech.
</P>
<P>
   One benefit for iCEO part-timers is that the company is working
with a stable of blue-chip venture capital firms including Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Mayfield Fund, Sequoia Capital and Sutter
Hill on their most promising newborns.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of betting on the success of just one, iCEO's band
of honchos will get to share in the success of all the startups
they help nurture.
</P>
<P>
   Just as venture firms spread their bets, iCEOs will participate
in what Coleman calls ``a diversified stock fund.'' Even though
each executive will work only one to five days a week for a few
months at each company, the daily fee will be a mix of cash and
stock. Each executive will keep half of the equity portion with the
other half going into a pool to be shared by all the iCEO
principals.
</P>
<P>
   ICEO's concept and innovative profit split is ``major cool,''
said financial consultant Jim Horan of El Sobrante, whose Web site
is &LR;  www.rentacfo.com &LR; . ``A lot of entrepreneurs have great ideas
but they are not long on life or business experience. Lots of
``dot-com'' and other startups are looking to buy or rent some gray
hairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Interim CEOs offer a variety of advantages for companies looking
for CEO help. Powell said that at any given time, Silicon Valley is
hunting for 200 CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said it can take nine months to land ``a full-time,
world-class'' chief executive, and many startups and their
investors don't feel comfortable waiting that long. Interim CEOs
also can address a host of urgent problems such as refining
marketing and financial strategies, signing joint venture
agreements or filling out the management team.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, iCEO expects to have 50 interim chief
executives on board. Some may get recruited for permanent jobs. If
that happens, iCEO, like traditional executive search firms, will
receive one-third of the salary and bonus in the first year of the
placed executive.
</P>
<P>
   ICEO isn't the only Silicon Valley management and financial
services firm. The Brenner Group also provides temp CEOs to
startups.
</P>
<P>
   The Brenner Group has 50 employees in Cupertino, including five
interim CEOs who coach high-tech companies and occasionally fill in
as acting bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Rich Brenner said the typical hourly fee of $250 to $400
an hour is often a mix of cash and stock, which, like iCEO's
format, is shared by the interim CEO and the firm's other
principals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hire people who have made a lifestyle change and fall into
one of two categories,'' said Brenner, who started the company in
1987. ``Some have reached for the brass ring, gotten it and want to
slow down a little. Others have worked for a variety of companies
and have realized the brass ring is elusive and they want a more
stable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, Tom Tomasetti has been one of
Brenner's roving CEOs. After toiling to turn around three faltering
high-tech companies, the last one Consilium Inc., Tomasetti was
ready for a change. ``It was a tough way to live,'' he said. ``I
was burned out.''
</P>
<P>
   At Brenner, he has coached a dozen companies and acted as
interim CEO at several of them, the most recent of which is Lumina
Decisions, a Los Gatos financial management software company.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Tomasetti began working two days a week at Lumina,
helping it better define and market its different software and
consulting businesses. Now the company is spinning off part of its
business to Ask Jeeves, a Berkeley search engine company, and
Tomasetti will be interim CEO of the core business.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Murdock, founder of San Jose's Murdock &AMP; Associates which
also provides interim and full-time executives to venture-capital
backed startups, suggests ``the jury is still out on interim CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The function is so critical _ it's the core of the company _
that I'm not sure you can outsource it.'' But if it's only to tide
a company over until it can land a full-time chief, Murdock said
interim CEOs could be ``a great business model.''

 Column: Robert Mondavi Believes His Company's Shares Are Poised  to
Surge 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Has Robert Mondavi been tasting too much of the family grape?
</P>
<P>
   The senior vintner of Napa Valley tells Street Smarts that
shares of the publicly held company that bears his name are going
to surge ``during the next 12 to 15 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi, who is chairman, says investors ``will begin to
understand the company much better, and (Mondavi) shares will
reflect that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our profits are going to be better, (and) we have great depth
with all of our international investments in Chile, Italy and
France,'' giving Mondavi broader brand diversification than many
privately held wineries, Mondavi said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   1999 has not been a vintage year for shareholder return. Mondavi
shares have turned sour, slipping 10.7 percent for the year. In
fact, yesterday they closed down $1.50 a share at $36.50. The stock
has been trying to rebound after having been crushed in August.
That's when Mondavi's Woodbridge brand ran into some severe
inventory problems causing shortages and weaker revenues.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Street likes Mondavi (no surprise there).
Eight out of the 10 sell-side analysts who follow Mondavi rate the
stock a ``buy,'' including Bonnie Kramer Tonneson of Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Tonneson upgraded her rating on Mondavi in December after the
company underwent some fundamental changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has been evolving into a more professional
organization, putting in some of the checks and balances expected
from a public company,'' Tonneson says. For example, management
shifted the responsibilities of Michael Mondavi, Robert's son, from
daily operator to that of a long-range strategist and brand
builder. What's more, Mondavi created brand teams similar to those
found at food companies and soap sellers, hoping to prevent
disastrous brand shortages such as the Woodbridge debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They, like the Beringers of the world, are focused on brand
building &UR;  &LR; _ which is a new phenomenon for the premium winemakers,''
says Tonneson, referring to Mondavi's primary publicly held
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premium wines, to date, have not been heavily promoted and
marketed to consumers. (Now) that they are, it gives consumers
confidence that they are making the wise choice,'' Tonneson says.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Beringer, the St. Helena winery reported quarterly
earnings yesterday that beat Wall Street's consensus estimates by 2
cents, according to Bloomberg. Earnings for its third quarter ended
March 31 were released after the close of the market. Beringer's
shares jumped almost two bucks to $44 in anticipation of the news.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Kraus, an analyst for First Security Van Kasper in San
Francisco, thinks Beringer's strong showing could help lift Mondavi
and other wine stocks. ``Wine stocks have been pretty flat,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, Kraus is still somewhat bearish on Mondavi.
She's one of the two analysts who rate the stock a ``hold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why the company's stock should trade above its
growth rate,'' meaning that the company's shares are expensive
compared to projections for future growth, Kraus says. Mondavi's
forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio is about 17, according to
Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   Wine companies have been able to raise prices at abnormally high
levels during the past two years, and they've managed to get away
with it, Kraus says. Now that there are fears of a grape glut,
vineyards have been slow to pass along lower costs to wine
drinkers. Thus, wineries need to focus on trimming their costs in
the event that the economy hits a speed bump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're in an extremely strong economy where people
are willing to spend a few extra bucks a bottle. But if the economy
should (falter), that could change,'' Kraus says.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Robert Mondavi contends that his company is doing
the things that Wall Street has asked of it, and now is time for
shareholders to taste the fruits of the company's labor.
</P>
<P>
   When Mondavi went public in 1993, ``we had to sell
(institutional investors) on this thing that we were a family
business,'' Mondavi recalls. Now, the Mondavi family has to
convince the Street that it knows how to manage its business _
period, he says.

 Rising Rents Hit Small Businesses
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I am a Canadian citizen currently working for a U.S.
company as a TN alien, which is a special nonimmigration visa
category for Canadian and Mexican professionals entering the
country under the North America Free Trade Agreement. With a few
friends who have permanent resident status, I am planning to set up
a biochemical business in California. How do I get a visa and gain
U.S. resident status?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  If you abandon your job, which gives you your current
TN (transnational) status, you lose your right to work in the
United States, according to San Francisco immigration attorney
Steve Shaiken. TN status is designed to help American companies
compete, not allow self-employed professionals from Canada or
Mexico to work in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But you have other options. One possibility, if you don't need
any sleep, is to stay in your current job and do the biochemical
business on the side.
</P>
<P>
   A better choice might be to file an ``alien entrepreneur''
petition (Form I-526) with the U.S. Immigration &AMP; Naturalization
Service ( &LR; www.ins.usdoj.gov &LR; ). If you invest enough money and hire
enough Americans _ generally $1 million and 10 employees _ you can
probably win a permanent visa. Shaiken says that you would need to
own at least 51 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is applying for a ``nonimmigrant investor''
visa, which allows citizens of other countries to manage or direct
a business in the United States if they have made a ``substantial''
investment. This amount is not specifically defined, but often
requires at least $150,000 to $200,000, according to Shaiken. This
type of visa is usually good for five years and can be renewed
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting your biochemical company, you would be well
advised to consult with the INS and a knowledgeable immigration
attorney.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: THE LOW-KEY PLEASURES OF MEDIUM-SIZED, OUTLYING
AIRPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (Duplication warning: also sent with `t' code)  
 (bl)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big-city airports like to advertise themselves as vibrant,
exciting transportation centers. But most business travelers
collect and compare horror stories, not fond memories, about major
airports, which tend to offer the ambiance of federal
minimum-security prisons _ without the amenities.
</P>
<P>
   But there are alternatives, especially for business travelers
with flexible flying schedules. At many medium-sized airports on
the edges of metropolitan areas, passengers are still treated more
like desirable customers than potentially dangerous detainees.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, John Wayne Airport, which handles about 8
million passengers a year in Santa Ana, Calif., in Orange County
about 35 miles south of Los Angeles International Airport (which
gets about 62 million passengers a year).
</P>
<P>
   Arriving there on a recent business trip to Los Angeles was like
going back in time to Pleasantville. Time elapsed, from landing on
a Continental flight from Newark, N.J., to driving a rental car off
the premises after getting directions to Los Angeles from a
courteous, red-coated airport volunteer: 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm in a train station instead of an airport,''
one businessman at a nearby table remarked last week over breakfast
in the main terminal's Orange Bar &AMP; Grille. Unharried passengers
sat leisurely at nearby tables set into cozy nooks, reading or
chatting as the sun streamed through a vaulted glass ceiling. The
coffee and tea were served in china cups, with free refills, by a
cheerful waitress who said she had worked there since the modern
terminal opened nine years ago ``and the place never changes, even
though it's busier every year.'' The tab for a sit-down breakfast
for two, including bran muffins, fresh fruit salad, tea and coffee:
$8.29.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terminal was actually designed to subtly evoke the airy,
welcoming look and feel of a train station,'' said Nghia Nguyen, a
spokeswoman for the airport, which did a survey showing that about
half of its passengers were business travelers. ``I'm glad to hear
that someone noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a 9-foot bronze statue of John Wayne himself inside the
terminal. The Duke is wearing a cowboy hat, purposefully striding
into the sun, looking as if he had a nice trip, wherever he went.
</P>
<P>
   Lire to Go
</P>
<P>
   It's always convenient to have a little local folding money in
your pocket when you land at a foreign destination. Now AAA, the
auto club, and American Express have a service, Travel Funds
Direct, that can deliver 65 different foreign currencies to your
home in cash or in American Express traveler's checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's convenient for tips and cabs when you first arrive,''
said Janie Graziani, the manager of public relations for AAA. Not
all AAA offices offer the service; she suggests calling your local
office to check. The only charge connected with the service is for
shipping, and that depends on how quickly you want the money
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Try Harder
</P>
<P>
   The scene: Miami International Airport, the Avis Rent a Car
counter. At 5:40 a.m., on March 21. about 75 travelers have already
dropped off their cars and are waiting anxiously for the shuttle
bus to the terminal for early flights. Still waiting at 6 a.m., two
worried customers go inside the office to make inquiries. ``I don't
drive the bus! Somebody else drives the bus!'' growls the young
woman on duty behind the counter. (The bus lumbers in 10 minutes
later).
</P>
<P>
   Side Trips
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than half of the drivers who use cell phones to call for
emergency road service can remember their own cell phone numbers
when asked, the AAA says.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel amenity most desired by business travelers? A
newspaper at the door in the morning, according to Lodging
Hospitality, a hotel trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers took children along on more than 32 million business
trips last year, according to the Travel Industry Association of
America. That is up 32 percent over 1997, but the jump isn't
because business travel has become more leisurely. Schedules for
both parents and children have become so tight that what used to be
family vacation time is now often tacked on the tail end of
business trips.
</P>
<P>
   Haute Cuisine
</P>
<P>
   For guests unhappy about airline food, some hotels are selling
fancy boxed lunches to take along. The Boca Raton Resort and Club
in Boca Raton, Fla., for example, will send you on your way with a
sandwich, pasta salad, fruit and cookie _ for $17. ``As the
airlines cut back more and more on their meal services, we began
actively encouraging our guests to order these meals for their
journey home,'' said Todd Shallan, the hotel's food and beverage
director.

WHITE HOUSE MAKES MOVE TO BREAK U.S.-CANADIAN SALMON IMPASSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON AND JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Tuesday named his one-time legal
counsel, Lloyd Cutler, as a special representative to help break
the lengthy impasse in U.S.-Canada salmon negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment marks the most vigorous effort yet by the White
House to revive the U.S.-Canada salmon treaty, which has been mired
in impasse and controversy for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks we have to get it resolved this year, and that
there is a window of opportunity,'' said George Frampton, director
of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Cutler will
report to Frampton.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing controversy has frequently disrupted U.S.-Canada
relations. Canada imposed an $1,100 ``licensing fee'' on
Alaska-bound fishing vessels in 1994. In 1997, a blockade by angry
Canadian fishermen kept the Alaska ferry ``Malaspina'' from leaving
Prince Rupert, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, controversy has impeded a binational effort to
conserve salmon that return from the north Pacific to spawn in
rivers of both countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dispute the Clinton-Gore administration wants to see
ended,'' Frampton said. Cutler voiced hope for an agreement by the
start of the salmon fishing season at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler is a specialist in arbitrating international disputes and
brings a long career of experience in high-level problem solving to
the table. He is also an experienced angler who has fished for
salmon in British Columbia's Campbell River and Alaska's Bristol
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Gary Locke said it is ``great news'' that
President Clinton has tapped ``a high-level person'' to oversee
efforts to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia Premier Glen Clark said in an interview: ``It
is good news that a `friend of Bill' has been named to head up the
negotiations. There has been a problem in lack of upper-level
involvement by the U.S. federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also hopes that Cutler's prominence as an elder
statesman will bring increased pressure on Northwest governors and
tribal officials to reach a deal with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler, 81, served as counsel to Presidents Clinton and Carter,
and he has served in senior or advisory capacities in five
administrations on issues ranging from urban housing to nuclear
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows what a high priority this administration places on
bringing these negotiations to a close,'' said Sen. Patty Murray,
D-Wash. ``If we do not get an international agreement over fishing,
everything else (in salmon conservation) is for naught. This is
absolutely a critical part of saving salmon.''
</P>
<P>
   Frampton agreed. ``We really need to settle issues with Canada
in order to make progress on U.S. domestic salmon restoration,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler will not lead the U.S. negotiating team, but rather will
serve as the White House liaison to the governors of Alaska,
Washington and Oregon, the 24 Treaty Indian tribes, and Congress.
He will be in contact with Canada's fisheries minister and will
help the American states settle what concessions each must make.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler will work with Congress to help pass any agreement, or
get money to help restore salmon runs in river systems along
Canada's Pacific Coast as well as the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The actual negotiations are being done by U.S. Negotiator James
Pipkin of the Interior Department, Deputy Negotiator Larry Rutter
of the National Marine Fisheries Service, and representatives of
the states and tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have been under way since January and are expected
to continue over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler said he expects to get to work immediately, and to visit
the Northwest in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that the negotiations are going quite well, that
the parties are close, and that there's at least a hope that at
long last this can be finished off in a way that satisfies all
three states, two federal governments, and the Indian tribes,'' he
said. ``They'd love to finish it by the time the salmon season
starts, but I'm in no position yet to say whether that's
feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Frampton added that ``for the first time ever, the three
governors and the tribes are all involved and engaged with the
administration in seeking a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, David Anderson,
called last year's talks ``dysfunctional,'' saying that at one
point there were 140 people meeting in seven separate rooms in
Portland, Ore., trying to forge an agreement on implementing the
treaty. But, speaking at a luncheon Tuesday at the Canadian Embassy
in Washington, he expressed optimism about this year's talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fishing season is fast approaching and for many of the
threatened salmon stocks, time is, in fact, running out,'' he said.
``Neither the patience of Canadians nor the health of the resource
will support the status quo ... for even another year.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said one remaining obstacle is the allocation of the
chinook harvest. He said it is a ``political impossibility'' that
Canada could accept a deal in which Alaska harvests the bulk of
chinook that spawn in Canada and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has steadily reduced its harvest of Northwest-bound
chinook, but still continues to catch the salmon at levels
considered excessive by Canadian and many Northwest fisheries
experts.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been a major stumbling block. At the White House,
Frampton acknowledged that getting an agreement ``will be
difficult. I don't think anyone thinks not.''
</P>
<P>
   But major progress was made last year, largely through
conservation cutbacks imposed on Canadian fishermen, and a set of
informal deals between Locke and Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians allowed greater numbers of chinook and coho salmon
to reach rivers in northern Puget Sound. In turn, U.S. fishermen
held off fishing for the early Stuart run, sockeye salmon that
migrate more than 800 miles upstream to spawn in a tributary of
Canada's Fraser River.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our ad hoc agreements last year have given greater
impetus for everyone to reach a comprehensive settlement this
year,'' Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton praised Canadian officials for their initiatives last
year. ``They did some very significant things,'' he said. ``When
one party steps into the water, it becomes easier for others to
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark argued that ``British Columbia had to bear all the costs
of conservation'' in last year's informal agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that in the rush to an agreement, Canada will
capitulate as it did in 1998,'' he said. Clark applauded Anderson
for taking a more forceful position on preserving Northwest-bound
chinook salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Canada talks are occurring as the Northwest gears up to
respond to the listing of multiple salmon species as threatened or
endangered. Congress is debating whether to approve a new fund that
to help the states conserve salmon.

 &HT;    Valhol will get to race
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The decision was electrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you won't find any of the jubilant racing folks using
that word around the Churchill Downs' stall of Valhol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just say it's put a real smile back on my face,'' Valhol owner
James Jackson said by phone from an Arkansas court room before
catching a flight to Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a Pulaski County (Ark.) Circuit Court ruling Tuesday
evening, Valhol _ a chestnut gelding some think is a horseflesh
version of the Energizer Bunny _ will run in Saturday's Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   And that gives this year's race a buzz like few others in the
storied 125 years of the event. Not that that's something racing
wants, because it involves the distinct possibility of cheating and
animal abuse and highlights an unseemly side of a sport trying hard
to polish its image.
</P>
<P>
   The taint here involves Valhol's shocking triumph in the
Arkansas Derby _ and whether jockey Billy Patin used an illegal
shocking device to jolt a 30-1 horse that never had a victory
straight into the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Before the April 10th Arkansas race, no one gave Valhol much
thought. He had raced just twice before and was yet to break his
maiden. His owner, trainer and especially Patin _ who never had won
a graded stakes race in 20 years of racing _ were all small-timers,
mostly from the lesser known tracks of Louisiana and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Valhol went off at 30-1, but from the gate, Patin was able to
keep him on the flank of the pace setter. On the far turn, Patin
moved his horse to the lead and quickly opened a four-length lead.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the stunning finish was nothing compared to the shock of
what ESPN recorded just afterward. As Patin eased Valhol beyond the
finish line into turn one, cameras caught a small object dropping
from the vicinity of Patin's hand near the horse's left shoulder.
Soon after an employee on a tractor found an electrical device in
the dirt on the track's first turn.
</P>
<P>
   Called buzzers or ``machines,'' these crude devices are the size
of a disposable lighter. Made with a pair of taped-together AAA
batteries, some wires and two exposed prongs, they shock a horse
when a jockey - with the buzzer hidden in his palm _ rubs them
across the animal's neck as part of the riding motion.
</P>
<P>
   Though the practice is banned, it's more prevalent than you
think. According to statistics from the Association of Racing
Commissions International, there have been 242 instances over the
past 25 years where commissions have investigated the use of
buzzers by trainers, grooms, exercise riders and jockeys _ a few
with prominent names. Violators can be banned for life.
</P>
<P>
   With all that was at stake, the Arkansas Racing Commission held
up payment of Valhol's $300,000 winner's purse until a hearing on
May 5. Although done supposedly to give Patin's lawyer the extra
time he requested to provide a defense, the hearing date hurt
Jackson and trainer Dallas Keen because it would come four days
after the running of Saturday's Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Valhol needed that $300,000 by this morning when entries are
drawn for this year's race. With 23 horses vying for the maximum 20
starting positions, the deciding factor will be each horse's graded
stakes earnings. Without the Arkansas cash, Valhol had just $38,400
_ last of all hopefuls. With the $300,000, he's a Derby certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's lawsuit cited a state law that said the Arkansas
commission had to distribute prize money within 96 hours of the
race. The court agreed and ordered the money be paid immediately.
</P>
<P>
   While the financial roadblock has been lifted, the taint on
Patin _ and possibly others _ has not. As to who did what, who knew
and who did not, it's all part of a growing Derby debate.
</P>
<P>
   When the charges first came to light, Patin told the Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette: ``I swear to God that I never did that.''
Initially, Jackson and Keen were vocal in their support of the
36-year-old jockey _ ``I don't think he used a buzzer,'' Keen said
late last week .''There are no marks on our horse.'' _ and Patin
was scheduled to ride Valhol in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   He exercised the horse during last week's early morning workouts
at Churchill, but as the controversy grew _ and the taped replays
of the race finally made Jackson say ``It looks absolutely bad,'' _
the owner said someone else would be in the irons should the horse
make the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a dark cloud over Billy, I had to tell him not to
bother to come to the barn anymore,'' a glum Keen said early
Tuesday morning as he stood in the rain outside Barn 42. ``It's too
bad because Billy's really a good guy, the kind who would give you
his last $10. He believes in this horse so much. He's walked it,
groomed it and sold me on it. He's done anything he could to get it
on its road to glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the first accusations came, I was crushed. It's turned
this whole trip here into something terrible. We shouldn't be in
the predicament we're in now. The instinct would be to point the
finger...but I won't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Patin makes an easy target. For 20 years, the Beaux Bridge, La.,
jockey has carved a meager living on small tracks for little money.
Along the way, there have been three suspensions in Louisiana and
one in Texas for violations of substance abuse rules.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, K.C., another jock with drug and alcohol problems,
was shot and killed outside of a New Orleans housing project.
Younger brother, Joseph Jr. was suspended six months by the
Louisiana Racing Commission in 1995 for possession of two
electrical buzzing devices found in his trunk in a jockey room.
</P>
<P>
   Buzzer incidents have occurred all over the racing world,
including Churchill Downs, where there were strong suspicions that
jockey George Atkins used an electrical device on 10th-place
finisher Hallieboy in the 1950 Derby. Two weeks later Atkins was
caught with a buzzer on another Churchill mount and suspended nine
years. In recent years there have been nearly twice as many buzzer
incidents in Louisiana as in California, New York and Kentucky
combined.
</P>
<P>
   There is a theory _ originally knocked about by Patin's own
lawyer _ that the jockey may have had a buzzer with him at the
Arkansas Derby, but ironically never used it when he found he was
on the ride of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``True vindication will come when we get to run on the first
Saturday in May,'' Jackson said Tuesday night. ``That's when Valhol
will show why we wanted him in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Patin meanwhile is in exile in Chicago, awaiting his May 5th
hearing. Not long after the Arkansas victory, he asked Keen for the
blanket of flowers that had been draped over Valhol in the winner's
circle. He took them to Louisiana where he put them on his
brother's grave.
</P>
<P>
   And now that they've become a funeral wreath, that's where they
belong. Thanks to Tuesday's court ruling, Valhol's Derby dream is
very much alive.

POLITICAL NOTES: MEL CARNAHAN, WILLIE BROWN, HAROLD STASSEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   In Missouri, Religion And Politics
</P>
<P>
   Back in January when Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri spared the
life of convicted murderer Darrell Mease, he explained that he did
so because he had received an ``extraordinary'' plea for mercy from
Pope John Paul II, who was then visiting St. Louis. The commutation
was a ``one-time act,'' the governor said, pointing out that in his
seven years in office he had approved more than two dozen
executions.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's explanation seems to have raised as many questions as
it answered _ no great surprise since he has set his sights on John
Ashcroft's seat in next year's U.S. Senate race, a contest that
could go either way.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls indicate that Carnahan, a moderate Democrat, is
within striking distance of Ashcroft, a Christian-right Republican.
But the polls also indicate that the governor's decision to commute
a murderer's death sentence to life imprisonment may have cost him
four times as many votes as he gained.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, another possible major factor in the race _
Ashcroft's early call for President Clinton to resign or be
impeached and convicted because of the Lewinsky matter _ appears to
have been a wash in terms of votes.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is a Southern Baptist in a state with large numbers
of Baptists and Roman Catholics, many in each group strong and
passionate supporters of the death penalty. That being the case,
mercy, not politics or religion, might very well have been the main
factor in his commutation decision, as he insists.
</P>
<P>
   But religion and politics, all mixed together, have since
entered the picture in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, who supports the death penalty but initially said
little about the governor's decision, has been increasingly
critical, declaring that a plea from a religious leader, no matter
how well intentioned, should not be allowed to change a court
decision or order.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, supporters of the senator, who opposes
abortion, have lately begun asking the governor, who supports
abortion rights, what he would do if the pope called on him to
condemn abortion.
</P>
<P>
   His answer: He remains his own man and a supporter of abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Come Saturday, Ashcroft will journey to St. Louis to hold a
hearing on victims' rights, with the star witnesses being members
of the family of the man Mease was convicted of murdering.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office contends the hearing is ``shameless
political exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator argues that its sole purpose is to guarantee that
the rights of victims are ``taken more seriously than they are at
present.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's Shadow In San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when term limits were about to force him out of
his job as speaker of the California Assembly, Willie Brown
professed to have no interest in returning to his hometown, San
Francisco, to run for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street lights, dog doo and parking meters are not my cup of
tea,'' he demurred after 15 years of holding down the speakership,
the second most powerful elective office in the nation's most
populous state.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown, consummate master of the political game, has never
been known to say never and truly mean it. And so we find him today
in his fourth year as mayor of the City by the Bay, running hard
for the right to serve four more years.
</P>
<P>
   Street lights, dog doo and parking meters are now very much his
cup of tea _ along with such other quality-of-life urban bothers as
loitering homeless people, public drunkenness, poky urban transit
and, more recently as the election campaign has heated up,
panhandling, jaywalking and speeding drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an all-out war on people who do bad things,'' Brown
declared recently when he announced that some of the 200 new police
officers he plans to put on San Francisco's mean streets will go
after jaywalkers and speeders.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like a page from Rudy Giuliani's New York City playbook?
</P>
<P>
   Brown is leading in the polls. But those polls also show that
many of his constituents are fed up _ tired of sidestepping the
homeless who confront them daily on the sidewalk and in parks,
tired of the litter in the gutter, tired of traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, a Democrat, counters that he is cracking down. Is he
also following the lead of the mayor of New York, a Republican
whose critics say he is overdoing the quality-of-life thing?
</P>
<P>
   There has been no contact between the two, Brown's office
insists.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Boden, the executive director of the San Francisco
Coalition on Homelessness, is not persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's head-over-heals enamored with Giuliani's policies,''
Boden said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   For Harold Stassen, There's No Giving Up
</P>
<P>
   He turned 92 this month and he makes his home at an
assisted-living center near Minneapolis. But don't count Harold
Stassen out, not yet.
</P>
<P>
   He first ran for political office in 1930, winning a job as a
county attorney in Minnesota and then going on in 1938, at the
tender age of 31, to become governor of the state, the ``Boy
Wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Stassen, a Republican, has run for president 10
times _ or is it 11? _ obviously unfazed by the fact that his first
run, in 1948, was his best run and that each succeeding run has
drawn almost as many titters as votes.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the year 2000?
</P>
<P>
   In March, he said he was ``leaving the option open.'' Then a few
days ago, he qualified that a bit, saying: ``I'm not running for
anything. I'm only walking.''
</P>
<P>
   But he qualified that, too. He threw in a ``right now.''

 Online Jokesters Get Sued
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Carolyn Said &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Business Wire, a New York service that distributes corporate press
releases, is suing three pranksters who posted a phony announcement
of a new online investment opportunity that attracted almost 2,000
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   The ersatz press release said a company named WebNode had won a
government contract to raise $4 billion to build a faster Internet
by selling ``nodes,'' or pieces of the new Internet, to the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   Business Wire distributed the release to Bay Area news
organizations and investors on April 1 and also posted it on its
Web site. It quickly retracted the release after receiving calls
from people who couldn't get through to WebNode by phone.
</P>
<P>
   However, almost 2,000 potential investors went to &LR;   &LR; the Web site
listed in the press release _  &LR; www.webnode.com &LR;  _ and attempted to
buy nodes.
</P>
<P>
   Business Wire said the only organization that published the
release was online service Wired News, which later retracted it.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Mitchell, one of the defendants, said the WebNode stunt
was an April Fool's Day hoax designed to mock investors' love
affair with Internet stocks and to illustrate the danger of online
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ultimate: Sell the actual Internet. After all, people
buy pieces of the Brooklyn Bridge,'' he said. ``We just wanted to
see if people would respond and to point out how easy it is to get
taken.''
</P>
<P>
   The pranksters paid Business Wire $260 to distribute the
release.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco federal court Monday against
Mitchell, William Ulrich and Janice Shell, alleges violations of
federal and state trademark laws, fraud, breach of contract,
defamation and conspiracy. It seeks unspecified damages and
injunctive relief.
</P>
<P>
   The WebNode stunt came amid growing concern about online fraud.
In the most widely publicized cyber hoax, an employee of PairGain
Technologies Ltd., a Southern California communications gear-maker,
allegedly faked an online Bloomberg article saying the company was
about to be acquired. The PairGain employee was arrested this month
and charged with stock fraud. Both the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Bloomberg sued the alleged author of the bogus
report, who apparently was hoping to drive up the price of his
PairGain stock.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the PairGain case, the WebNode pranksters weren't trying
to cash in. Although their Web site included an order form where
investors could list their names, addresses and number of nodes
they wanted to buy _ at $100 a pop _ it didn't include any
mechanism for collecting money.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, 38, is president of a Westport, Conn., firm called
Insurance Software Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell and others he met on an investment site formed a loose
group called FBN (Fly by Night) Associates. He said FBN
investigates online investment scams and conducts an annual April
Fool's prank _ last year's was about a fictitious Y2K company.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he is ``perplexed'' by the suit. ``Why would
(Business Wire) go after an April Fool's joke when there have been
actual people who lost money through other stocks proven to be
fraud?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Baron Tamraz, Business Wire executive vice president, said
the lawsuit aims to stop others from perpetrating similar pranks.
``We feel they've besmirched our good name and gone beyond the
boundaries of a joke,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tamraz said Business Wire has ``checks and balances'' to verify
releases, but she declined to say how the WebNode release slipped
out. ``Obviously, this will make us take a closer look at our
policies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analyst Jim Balderston of Zona Research in Redwood City
said he thinks the lawsuit could backfire on Business Wire. ``They
could put themselves in a position where they imply that they're
vouching for the validity of everything that they transmit,'' he
said. ``Due to no fault or shortcoming of Business Wire and PR
Newswire, I've read a lot of lies transmitted over them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Balderston also saw a tongue-in-cheek upside. ``If Business
Wire wins this case, they may be able to sue anyone who ever lies
in a press release,'' he said. ``You could generate a lot of money
that way.''

TEENS' BOMBS AND THREATS OF BOMBS RAISE CONCERNS ACROSS TEXAS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One week after the high school killings in Colorado, authorities
across Texas are reporting a spate of incidents that involve
violent threats by students and crude efforts to manufacture bombs.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven teen-agers are being held in Wimberley and
Wichita Falls alone, all of them on suspicion of making explosives,
some of which officials say were to be used to attack a school.
</P>
<P>
   In Port Aransas, high school officials suspended a teen-ager for
threatening a teacher. The boy's father then turned him over to
police after he found that his son had gathered bomb-making
information off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Houston area, a half dozen or so students are being
detained or disciplined for everything from plans to detonate bombs
on campus to threats to poems that employ violent prose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as school administrators can only take this very
seriously,'' said David Simmons, superintendent of the Wimberley
school district. ``The fact of the matter is that we realize what
the implications could be if we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   If the massacre at Littleton's Columbine High School has yielded
at least some copycat tactics, it also has given way to vigorous
responses by school administrators and authorities. But while
communities around the state seem to be applauding the zero
tolerance policies, others see the crackdown as a threat to kids'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to go after those people who can't defend
themselves,'' said Greg Gladden, a Houston lawyer and president of
the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas. ``And as a class,
juveniles cannot defend themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladden predicted that the aggressive actions on the part of
administrators and authorities across Texas would eventually
backfire, making rebels out of teen-agers who otherwise might learn
to resolve their differences with society.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood specialists, meanwhile, warned that such pre-emptive
strikes against youths might distance students already on the
fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids who will be harassed are the ones who are quite
alienated,'' said Jeffrey Arnett, a visiting professor and human
development specialist at the University of Maryland. ``This will
only deepen their alienation.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Arnett said he understands how school
officials are feeling in the wake of one of the worst school
tragedies in the nation's history, and that ``I can't criticize
them for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen people died in the Littleton ambush, including one
teacher, all at the hands of two disaffected students who showed up
at school April 20 armed with guns and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the apparent escalation in incidents involving kids and
bombs, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms reports that the
number of juvenile bombings dropped significantly between 1993 and
1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the Wimberley case, which involves four eighth-graders, it is
unclear how serious the teens were in their plan to carry out an
attack on the town's junior high school. A gag order has been
issued, but not before Hays County Sheriff Don Montague appeared on
national television saying the kids planned to kill nine people.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear how sophisticated the explosives were. A defense
attorney for one of the teen-agers, Ray Green, said a description
of the bomb as essentially a firecracker emptied into a pillbox was
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In Wichita Falls, four boys were found last weekend with
bomb-making materials in the back seat and trunk of their car. On
Tuesday a judge ordered that three of the four remain in custody.
The boys say they were experimenting with explosives but did not
intend to harm anyone.
</P>
<P>
   A bomb threat closed one of the city's three high schools
Tuesday, the second such threat to close a Wichita Falls high
school since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to Houston, a judge on Tuesday ordered a 12-year-old boy
to remain in custody while police investigate reports that he
planned to set off a bomb at an intermediate School in Montgomery
County's Willis school district.
</P>
<P>
   The boy is being held in the County Juvenile Detention center
after allegedly warning two classmates last week not to attend
classes because he planned to bomb Hardy Intermediate School, a
school district spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy's 680 students were sent to a neighboring school, but a
sweep of the building failed to turn up any explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, two 16-year-old Sugar Land boys also were being
detained after explosive devices were found in the trunk of their
car Friday outside Clements High School in the Fort Bend
Independent School District.
</P>
<P>
   In the Baytown area, a 13-year-old was expelled from school
after administrators recovered a poem he found on the Internet,
which included a line that asks for the courage to ``hide the
bodies of those I had to kill today.'' The boy now faces charges in
the juvenile system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this can't be taken lightly,'' said Dick
Duggan, principal at Highlands Junior High School, where the
incident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it should be taken so seriously as to pursue criminal
charges is to some a fair question. After all, they say, kids say
all sorts of things they don't mean.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett, the development specialist, said that violent fantasies
among kids are highly unlikely to become violent acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important not to exaggerate this,'' said Arnett. ``There
are millions of kids appalled by what happened in Colorado, just
like you and me.''

`STAR WARS' MOVIE TRAILER THREATENS CORPORATE E-MAIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Conventional wisdom has it that George Lucas'
``Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'' will be by far the
biggest force to hit Hollywood in years.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently that holds true for corporate computers as well. A
Dayton, Ohio-based Internet security firm is warning clients that a
30-megabyte trailer for the long-awaited film that is being sent
across the Internet via e-mail could bring corporate America's
messaging systems to a grinding halt.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've caught 28 of them in the last week or so, which is not a
lot,'' said Richard Bliss, vice president of marketing for the
security firm Allegro. ``But if six or seven people in a company
start sending it around the office it starts to chew up server
space real fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss' firm provides an e-mail filtering service to about 1,000
corporate clients, removing viruses, chain letters, spam and now
movie trailers from messages before they reach a company's computer
system.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss said that as the May 19 release date of the
science-fiction film approaches, copies of the trailer _ available
for download on the Internet since March _ likely will multiply,
degrading corporate e-mail systems much the way online holiday
greeting cards do each year in December.
</P>
<P>
   An even more chilling scenario, Bliss said, is if a computer
hacker were to attach to the trailer a virus that endlessly
replicates the large file or, like Monday's Chernobyl virus, wipes
out data on computer hard drives.

COLUMN: HOCKEY PIONEER TAKES THE SPORT TO ANOTHER LEVEL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Willie O'Ree sat in a glass-enclosed conference room
at National Hockey League headquarters, holding his own place in an
emotional and expectant week. Wayne Gretzky had retired the
previous Sunday, the Stanley Cup playoffs were beginning, and the
64-year-old O'Ree was in the midst of an East Coast swing,
preaching the hockey gospel.
</P>
<P>
   He would give the commencement speech for Ice Hockey in Harlem's
12th graduating class, then attend a two-day ice hockey tournament
in Newburgh, N.Y., as part of an initiative by the NHL and USA
Hockey diversity task force to help economically disadvantaged
students discover education through hockey. Thanks to O'Ree, who
was named director of youth development for the NHL in 1998, the
Harlems of the world are not as removed from the NHL as they once
were. He is a historic marker of the game, and for too many years
he was a missing mark.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Willie O'Ree and why is he important?
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, O'Ree's significance is recorded by two
crowning moments. The first and arguably the most significant
occurred on Jan. 18, 1958, when O'Ree became the first black man to
play in the National Hockey League. There was no drum roll, no
yearlong buildup as there had been 11 years earlier when Jackie
Robinson integrated Major League Baseball. The NHL, typically some
might argue, was a decade behind the other major sports. Canada's
hockey's divisions involved English vs. French, and the percentage
of blacks in the country was very small. But O'Ree said that there
were Canadian black players before him who were denied the
opportunity to play because of race.
</P>
<P>
   Still, O'Ree's historic moment was muted by a sport that, in the
1950s, was mostly an all-Canadian affair.
</P>
<P>
   O'Ree, a left wing with the Quebec Aces, was summoned by the
Boston Bruins as an emergency recall to meet the team in Montreal
for his first NHL game. He was 22 at the time, and didn't grasp the
significance of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, there are still incidents that remind us of the
racial divide in sports, even one so marginally integrated as
hockey. The latest came Monday night when Sandy McCarthy, a Flyers
forward who is part black and part Canadian Indian, accused
Toronto's Tie Domi of directing a racial slur at him during a
playoff game. Domi denied it, and said McCarthy spit at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like about the NHL was that they don't tolerate
those things anymore,'' O'Ree said.
</P>
<P>
   But back then, all O'Ree knew was that he was fulfilling every
Canadian boy's dream. In O'Ree's mind, the team's 5-3 victory at
Montreal was a far greater accomplishment than the individual act
of integrating the sport. He played one more game with Boston, then
returned to the minor league team, where he stayed for almost three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got the second call. On New Year's Day 1961, he scored
his first professional goal; it was also the first goal by a black
player in the NHL &UR; . &LR;  In one of those moments of a lifetime, Boston
Garden fans gave O'Ree a two-minute standing ovation to commemorate
the occasion. This time, O'Ree savored the moment; he practically
dove into the net to retrieve the puck.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, O'Ree thought he would be a Boston Bruin for life.
He would not. He finished out the season, playing in 43 games and
scoring four goals. Boston traded O'Ree to Montreal after the 1961
season and Montreal assigned him to their farm team, establishing
the pattern of a career that would last for 22 years and encompass
11 teams, though only one in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   O'Ree played in the American Hockey League, the Central Hockey
League, the Eastern Professional Hockey League, the Quebec League
and the Pacific League. Where there was hockey, there was O'Ree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just loved the game,'' he said. ``It gave me so much. All I
ever wanted to do was be a hockey player, then give something back
when I retired.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Ree was born in Fredericton, New Brunswick, in October 1935,
the youngest of Rosebud and Harry O'Ree's 12 children. As a boy,
O'Ree played five sports. Baseball was his best sport after hockey,
and he played shortstop and second base. When he was 14, his team
in Fredericton won the Westend championship and earned a trip to
New York. The Canadian boys were taken to Brooklyn and saw Jackie
Robinson play; this was 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about baseball, we didn't talk about hockey,'' O'Ree
recalled. ``He asked me how I liked baseball, I said fine. I said,
`I like playing hockey too,' '' O'Ree recalled. He also remembers
the quizzical look Robinson gave him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said: `There aren't any black hockey players; they play
football or baseball,' '' O'Ree said, recounting that conversation
of some 50 years ago. ``I said, `There are some blacks playing in
Canada.' That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, O'Ree integrated the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   But the defining moment of his life happened before O'Ree turned
pro and had nothing to do with race or racism. It, too, was a test
of spirit and character and determination.
</P>
<P>
   He was 19, playing with the Waterloo Kitchener Junior Canucks.
During a game in Quebec, O'Ree was in front of the net when a slap
shot was deflected and hit him in the face, breaking his nose, his
jaw and shattering the retina of his right eye. Two days later,
doctors told O'Ree that he would never play hockey again.
</P>
<P>
   O'Ree said he refused to accept the verdict: ``I was telling
myself: `How can he stand there and tell me what I can or cannot
be? He doesn't know how I feel inside. He doesn't know the goal I
set for myself and what I really want to do.' I was determined to
play hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think about was that I hadn't obtained my goal,''
O'Ree said. ``I was going to forget about what I can't see and deal
with what I can see.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Ree did play professionally. Poor eyesight, perhaps
exacerbated by racial issues, made his 1961 trip to the NHL his
last, but Willie O'Ree enjoyed a vibrant career in a sport he
loved. He now tells his story to students, not to boast, but to
bring home the importance of hard work and resiliency.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hockey League lost a legend recently when Wayne
Gretzky retired, but is fortunate to have rediscovered a treasure
before it was lost. In O'Ree, the NHL recaptured part of its
history. The league is stronger because of it.

TELECOM ITALIA, INTENT ON DEUTSCHE TELEKOM DEAL, REJECTS OLIVETTI 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Telecom Italia took new steps Tuesday to thwart hostile
suitor Olivetti SpA, formally rejecting its $65 billion offer and
selling control of a pay-television subsidiary that the rival
telephone company had assumed would be part of any takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The formal rejection of Olivetti's offer was made necessary when
Olivetti's bid was accepted for shareholder consideration last week
by Italian stock regulators. In a statement, Telecom Italia's board
said it would convey its decision to the regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Though the statement contained no hint of the decision, people
close to the company said the bid had been rejected in a 50-page
document that would be released to the public later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The same people said Telecom Italia would push ahead with plans
to merge with Deutsche Telekom in a stock-swap deal valued at $82
billion, which was negotiated last week as part of an attempt by
Italy's largest telephone company to frustrate Olivetti's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia also announced Tuesday that it is selling 65
percent of its pay-per-view television operation, Stream, to a
group of companies including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti, in a statement, protested that deal as an interference
with its planned bid, which formally begins on Friday and runs for
21 days.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a bid by Murdoch to acquire 80 percent of
Stream failed after the Italian government passed a law blocking
News Corp.'s right to bid for Italian soccer broadcasting rights.
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday's deal is made final, News Corp., Italy's Cecchi Gori
media group, and four Italian soccer teams will obtain the
broadcast rights to games of the four teams for a six-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Telecom Italia will retain 35 percent of Stream,
while gaining the strength of News Corp. to help it compete against
strong European rivals, like France's Canal Plus, which controls
Italy's leading pay-per-view company, Telepiu.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is typical of arrangements that Telecom Italia's chief
executive, Franco Bernabe, has proposed to reduce losses and
strengthen Telecom Italia through alliances. Under the deal,
Bernabe will have the right to appoint Stream's chairman, while
Murdoch will appoint the executives who run day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Bernabe's main concern this week has been the continuing
objections of the Italian government to his planned merger of
Telecom Italia with Deutsche Telekom. Rome has expressed deep
concern about the continued German government stake in Deutsche
Telekom, which will remain at 40 percent even after the combined
company is formed.
</P>
<P>
   Italian government officials, including the chief economic
adviser of Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, met German officials in
Frankfurt Tuesday to discuss the differences. Later this week,
Italy's treasury minister, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, is expected to
take time out from international monetary meetings he is attending
in Washington to discuss the problem with Germany's finance
minister, Hans Eichel. Ciampi is chairman of the International
Monetary Fund's interim committee.
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared to bet Tuesday that Bernabe and the Deutsche
Telekom chief, Ron Sommer, would fail in their effort to bring the
governments closer. On the Frankfurt exchange, Deutsche Telekom's
share price closed up 5.6 percent, at 37.90 euros, or $40.17, as
investors wagered that the merger would fail; in Milan, Telecom
Italia closed up 1.4 percent, at 9.94 euros.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema now finds himself in the curious situation of wielding
the Italian government's 3.4 percent `'golden share'' in Telecom
Italia as a weapon to interfere with management strategy because he
objects to the German government stake in Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a written assurance last week by Bonn that German policy
excludes interference in Deutsche Telekom management affairs,
Italian officials are seeking more explicit limits on German
government voting rights in the future company to assure parity
between Italian and German interests, and some kind of formal
commitment by Bonn to divest itself of Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Tuesday, Eichel said that Bonn could not speed the
sale of its stake in Deutsche Telekom `'in such a way that we put
pressure on the share price.'' But officials of the German and
Italian companies said the efforts of both governments to reach
some form of compromise reflected a fundamental interest in seeing
the merger proceed.

YUGOSLAVIAN MILITARY LARGELY UNSCATHED BY BOMBING, NATO SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After five weeks and 4,400 sorties, NATO's
bombardment of Yugoslavia appears to have had little effect on Serb
leader Slobodan Milosevic's control over his military forces, or on
his ability to wage war and terror in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the upbeat rhetoric, Tuesday's news briefing in Brussels
by NATO commander General Wesley Clark presented, wittingly or not,
the gloomiest picture to date of how far the air war has yet to go.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody said so explicitly, but the numbers Clark recited
indicate that:
</P>
<P>
   --Serbia has more than enough petroleum to keep its army
operational.
</P>
<P>
   --Milosevic is still able to communicate with his people and
command his troops in the field.
</P>
<P>
   --The strength of his forces in and around Kosovo may be
growing, not shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   --The morale of his troops may be down a bit, but not
disastrously so.
</P>
<P>
   It may nonetheless be true, as some US officials have recently
said, that political cracks have opened within Milosevic's ruling
circle. It may even be true that these rifts, if they exist, have
been caused by the bombing, especially of political and economic
targets.
</P>
<P>
   However, NATO's own numbers suggest that, as a military
campaign, the air war has fallen far short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   US and NATO officials have been emphasizing the attacks on
Serbia's oil refineries and storage sites, noting that a modern
mechanized army will eventually grind to a halt without oil.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clark said Tuesday that 10 tankers a day have been
steaming into the Yugoslav port at Bar, offloading oil ``24 hours a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The general said NATO planes have destroyed 33 percent of the
military's oil reserves, but that leaves two-thirds intact. And, he
added, ``I don't think anyone truly knows how much oil is present
in Yugoslavia. . . . It's probably squirreled away in many, many
locations.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO planes have dropped many ``smart'' bombs on Serbian command
and control sites along with communications targets, but Clark said
Tuesday that Milosevic's command system is ``very hardened and
redundant.'' It makes use of a wide array of technology, including
fiber optic cable, high-frequency radio communication, and
microwaves, all of it interconnected. There are also ``more than
100 radio relay sites around the country,'' he said, making it hard
for airstrikes to knock out transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are having trouble communicating,'' Clark said, but he
also conceded, ``They're working through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark also acknowledged that Milosevic is moving more and more
troops into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been reinforced in the last three or four days by an
influx of newly mobilized reservists to replace combat
casualties,'' he added, ``and they've also been reinforced by the
continuing assistance and movement of elements from the Yugoslav
2nd Army, which is based in Montenegro.''
</P>
<P>
   These troops are fighting the guerrillas of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, herding displaced ethnic Albanians still in Kosovo
around the region, and stengthening defensive positions along the
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said Serb troops stop moving when NATO planes fly
overhead, and ``the pace of their activities has been appreciably
affected'' as a result.
</P>
<P>
   However, he concluded, ``If you actually added up what's there .
. . you might actually find out that he's strengthened his forces
in there. And that's going to be the phenomenon until we can
further cut the lines of supply and go more intensively against his
forces. And we intend to be able to do that as we bring in more
assets and as the weather clears.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in ``more assets'' _ meaning more attack planes _ seems
to be taking a long time. In Washington Tuesday, Defense Secretary
William Cohen was asked about the status of the 300 additional US
aircraft that NATO requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Cohen replied, ``we're waiting for General Clark to
provide a detailed analysis of exactly how many aircraft he will
need, what types, where they'll be bedded down, and so forth. That
has not _ I have not received that yet. . . . The mix of the
aircraft is still being worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   At his briefing, Clark repeated the claim, made several times in
recent days, that the Serbian army's morale has been sinking, as
evidenced by reports of desertions. However, when asked for details
about the desertions, he said, ``It's right now not a crushing
problem, but it is a significant problem. And I think we'll see
more of that in the weeks to come.''
</P>
<P>
   For William M. Arkin, a former US Army intelligence officer,
Clark's time estimate was the key point. ``If Milosevic's forces
are still going to be around long enough for us to continue seeing
desertions for several more weeks, then it's not a serious
problem'' for Milosevic now, Arkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark blamed the weather for some of NATO's difficulties,
noting, ``On about two-thirds of the days, we've had more than half
of the strike sorties canceled'' because of poor visibility. ``So
when I show you the results, I'd ask you to keep this in mind.''
The bombardment to date, he said, has been ``only a fraction of
what is to come.''

 &HT;    PcOrder results please stock analysts
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ PcOrder.com passed its first test as a public
company _ pleasing financial analysts with its first quarterly
results.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin company, which makes software that manages the
purchase of personal computers and hundreds of related products
over the Internet, reported 70 percent revenue growth from the
first quarter a year ago and a smaller-than-expected net loss.
</P>
<P>
   The company lost $2.8 million, or 20 cents a share, on revenue
of $7.7 million, compared with a loss of $13,000, or less than 1
cent a share, on revenue of $4.5 million in the first quarter of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting start to a great stock,'' said Robert
Schwartz of SG Cowen Securities in Boston. ``They have a great
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are off to a flying start,'' said Lise Buyer with Credit
Suisse First Boston in Palo Alto, Calif. ``They did a terrific job
of keeping the top line (revenue) growing.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly results were the first for the company since it
raised $47 million by selling 2.53 million shares in its initial
public offering on Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Ross Cooley said the company expanded sales by
gaining new customers, forming strategic alliances and continuinged
development of its electronic commerce products. ``As the computer
industry grows Internet sales volumes, pcOrder.com will help set
the agenda for moving the industry to the Web,'' Cooley said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, pcOrder released ContentSource, a
subscriber-based system that enables large customers to gain access
to one of the industry's largest collections of product data and
prices from many companies.
</P>
<P>
   Egghead.com and Club Computer signed contracts for ContentSource
during the quarter. The company also sold its e-commerce systems to
two large resellers, Sarcom and Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The results were released after the close of stock market
trading. PcOrder's stock closed at $74 a share, up $2.31 1/4 in
Nasdaq trading. The stock has risen 252 percent from its $21
offering price.

TEXAS SENATE PASSES BILL TO CURTAIL ATTORNEY GENERAL'S HIRING OF
PRIVATE LAWYERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Minus the passion that inflamed much of the
debate over the high legal fees in the tobacco case, the Senate
Tuesday gave almost routine approval to a bill to curtail the
attorney general's independence in hiring outside lawyers in major
state suits.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which now goes to the House, was approved on a
voice vote after only brief discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 113 by Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, would
require key legislators to approve contingency contracts that the
attorney general negotiates with private lawyers for suits in which
the state's potential recovery is more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   It also would set limits on contingency fees and require that
all the money, including lawyers' fees, won by the state in a
lawsuit be deposited in the state treasury and appropriated by the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, it would require outside lawyers to keep time and
expense records and provide that those records would be subject to
public disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser said his bill would provide ``full disclosure and
accountability'' over the attorney general's dealings with outside
lawyers. It wouldn't affect the tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   ``No elected official should have the authority to unilaterally
award these types of lucrative contracts without legislative
approval,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser was one of several state officials, including Gov. George
W. Bush, who fought former Attorney General Dan Morales last year
over the $3.3 billion eventually awarded five private lawyers hired
by Morales to sue the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the governor nor anyone in the Legislature challenged
Morales when he filed the suit in 1996 and announced the fee
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor, several lawmakers and John Cornyn, then a
Republican candidate for attorney general, challenged the fees as
excessive after it became obvious the lawyers were going to reap a
huge payday.
</P>
<P>
   The suit ended with cigarette makers agreeing to pay the state
$17.3 billion during the next 25 years and to separately pay the
five lawyers' fees, which were set by a national arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, in a recent interview, said that he opposed the bill
and that the suit may never have been filed if his ability to hire
the outside lawyers had been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   But Cornyn, who succeeded Morales on Jan. 1, has endorsed the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said he had concerns about the constitutionality of
contingency fee contracts signed by the attorney general without
legislative oversight. He said damages recovered by the state in a
lawsuit should be subject to legislative appropriation.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser's bill initially would have empowered the governor and
the lieutenant governor to approve contingency contracts. But he
amended the measure on the Senate floor to give the oversight role
to the Legislative Budget Board.
</P>
<P>
   The LBB is chaired by the lieutenant governor and includes the
House speaker and eight other key lawmakers.

MATTEL-BOSS-MARKETPLACE, 4-27 -- Barbie was a tough sell in 1998,
but Jill Barad, in her office during a recent interview, had a good
year. While demand for Mattel Inc.'s biggest brand, Barbie, fell

paid to the toy maker's chairman and chief executive rose 14
percent to $4.75 million. (Monica Almeida/New York Times Photo)

trees in their forest last week. Stunned by the protest and the
news coverage it prompted, Chihuahua state officials recently
announced a halt to the illegal logging around the village in the
Sierra Madre, about 850 miles northwest of Mexico City. The banner
reads: ``Without Land or Resources, There Is No Future.'' (Wesley

to see Jason Williams play say he is the coolest white player they
have ever seen, and they view White Chocolate (his controversial
nickname) as evidence of Williams' embrace of, and acceptance in,
the hip-hop culture. Williams' game, though, is not merely about
flair. He is averaging 13 points, 6 assists and 3 rebounds a game,
and his production as a first-year player is rivaled only by
Toronto's Vince Carter. (Peter DaSilva/New York Times Photo)

COMMENTARY: IN THE D.C. MATRIX 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Right before the Littleton shootings, Al Gore was
telling everyone that he and Tipper just  &UR; loved &LR;  ``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand how the Father of the Internet could be
so taken with the imaginative hit movie that is a video game writ
large, a balletic and epic ode to violence about rebel hackers and
society misfits who fight back when evil computers take over the
world and reduce humans to AA batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores' taste in movies, while hip, is a telling reminder of
the difficulties and contradictions that can trip up politicians
when they start lecturing about changing the culture. Their
appreciation of ``The Matrix'' directly collides with the White
House effort this week to denounce the movie and video-game
``culture of violence,'' with Hillary slapping her pals in
Hollywood and Tipper resuming her role as pop cop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen and ask your child, `What movies do you like and why?
If you like a very violent movie and if you've seen it repeatedly,
does that mean that it's having undue influence on you?''' Mrs.
Gore asked on ``Meet the Press,'' adding, ``How about with violent
video games?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix,'' which has attracted an obsessively devoted
audience of young computer-savvy males, would seem to be the sort
of movie Mrs. Gore was describing. As the bullets fly and fly, the
shell casings glimmer alluringly in slow motion, giving a gorgeous
techno-sheen to the action. The violence has a terrible beauty and
the death seems merely virtual.
</P>
<P>
   There are eerie echoes to the dark underground world of the
teen-age Columbine killers, who laughingly treated death as virtual
entertainment: Keanu Reeves throws open his long black coat to
reveal an arsenal of pistols and machine guns. In this universe,
the small, secret band of black-clad computer pirates are the
heroes in a world gone mad. They must destroy the world to save it.
</P>
<P>
   At one late show in Washington this week, the similarities were
so striking to the audience that people began yelling out
``Columbine!'' and cheering as Keanu Reeves walks through a metal
detector, coolly pulls out his guns, and blows away a building full
of cops.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders are off the radar, as they continue to
treat the surfeit of guns as a family-values problem. Hillary and
Bill and Tipper and Al have the gun-control message right, but they
are not the most consistent messengers to preach about rooting out
the toxic forces in American culture. Their concern is too often
tailored not to offend their donors and pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton sounded hollow Tuesday when she said, as she
introduced her husband at a gun-control rally: ``Part of growing up
is learning how to control one's impulses. ''
</P>
<P>
   This is a White House not distinguished by its mastery of
impulse or its willingness to do the tough, unglamorous,
politically risky work that could buck our instant-gratification
culture and result in a repudiation of gun movies and guns. A week
after Columbine, the preaching is easy.
</P>
<P>
   After Bill Clinton sold the Lincoln bedroom to Hollywood
buddies, after Hillary became a Miramax flak, after Al Gore and
Jeffrey Katzenberg zestfully hugged, after Tipper soft-pedaled her
crusade to raise PG kids in an X-rated society for a decade after
Hollywood honchos told her husband it would hurt fund-raising, they
should spare us their opportunistic outrage.
</P>
<P>
   It's fine to like ``The Matrix.'' But you should not be
entertained and financed by the same culture that you demonize and
trash.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming Hollywood and the culture is a glib solution anyway.
It's much easier than doing the hard work of financing and mounting
a campaign for meaningful gun legislation, which might take years.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has ceased to be a place where big things get done,
or even sensible, moderate things. Those who don't think we need
that hard effort should consider the words of Mel Bernstein, the
owner of Dragon Arms, a gun shop in Colorado. Eric Harris, he said,
came there in March, wearing a trench coat, and tried to buy an
M-60 machine gun and a pistol equipped with a silencer.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein refused, saying too many kids come in wanting too
much. ``This is like Toys R Us to them.''

SUSPECT IN CHINA SPY CASE REPORTEDLY GOT SECRET BOMB CODE DATA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES RISEN and JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A scientist suspected of spying for China
improperly transferred huge amounts of secret data from a computer
system at a government laboratory, compromising virtually every
nuclear weapon in the United States arsenal, government and lab
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ millions of lines of computer code that approximate
how this country's atomic warheads work _ were downloaded from a
computer system at the Los Alamos, N.M., weapons lab that is open
only to those with top-level security clearances, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, then transferred the files to a
widely accessible computer network at the lab, where they were
stored under other file names, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan-born scientist transferred most of the secret data in
1994 and 1995, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   American experts said the data would be useful to any nuclear
power trying to replicate this country's atomic designs. But one
American scientist said the codes and accompanying data were not,
by themselves, sufficient to produce an exact copy of an American
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said there was evidence that the files were
accessed by someone after they were placed in the unclassified
network. Other evidence suggests that this was done by a person who
improperly used a password, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is continuing, and officials do not know
whether the data transferred by Lee was obtained by another
country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Lee became the focus of an FBI investigation into a
separate case, what American official believe was China's theft
from Los Alamos of design data for America's most advanced warhead,
the W-88. That theft apparently took place in the 1980s. China has
denied stealing the material.
</P>
<P>
   Now officials fear that a much broader array of nuclear test
data may have been moved to Beijing in the 1990s. Lee has not been
charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators did not discover the evidence of huge file
transfers until last month, when they examined Lee's office
computer in connection with their investigation of the earlier
theft at Los Alamos, a sprawling lab complex about 35 miles outside
Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   They then found evidence that Lee, who held one of the
government's highest security clearances, had been transferring
enormous files involving millions of lines of secret computer code,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee had been under investigation in the W-88 case for
nearly three years, Los Alamos officials failed to monitor his
computer use and let him retain his access to nuclear secrets until
late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was fired by the Energy Department for security violations
on March 8. His attorney, Mark Holscher of Los Angeles, did not
return a telephone call. In the past, Holscher has denied any
wrongdoing by his client.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was first told of the new evidence by Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson on March 31. During a subsequent meeting
at the White House residence in early April, the president told
Richardson to ``get to the bottom of it,'' Richardson recalled in
an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in March, before being briefed by Richardson, the
president said he had not been told of any evidence of espionage
during his administration.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the new evidence and with the president's
support, Richardson shut down the classified computer systems at
Los Alamos and two other major nuclear weapons laboratories this
month. He ordered changes in the computer security procedures to
make it more difficult to move nuclear secrets out of the
classified networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Wen Ho Lee transgressions cannot occur any more,''
Richardson said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders were told of the new evidence in
classified briefings last week.
</P>
<P>
   The huge scale of the security breach has shocked some
officials, and has prompted a new sense of urgency in the FBI to
solve the Los Alamos spy case. The bureau is now pouring additional
agents and resources into the investigation. The evidence of
transfers from his office computer provided the basis for an FBI
search of Lee's home on April 10, officials said. Lee is believed
to be still living in Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Select Committee on
Intelligence, said in an interview that the briefings on the new
evidence ``confirmed my worst fears that China's espionage is
ongoing, it's deep and we can't wish it away.''
</P>
<P>
   There were varying assessments of the gravity of the security
breach. One official familiar with the new evidence said, ``This is
much, much, much worse than the W-88 case.''
</P>
<P>
   But an Energy Department official said that because it remained
unclear whether China actually obtained the data, the case at this
point ``is serious but not of the scope of the W-88.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the huge data transfers were not detected until
the last few weeks has sparked outrage among officials who wonder
why computer use by a scientist already under suspicion as a spy
was not being closely watched by Los Alamos or the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   An internal investigation at the Energy Department into why Lee
retained access to American nuclear secrets while he was a spy
suspect was begun a month ago and is nearing completion. It is
likely to prompt disciplinary action against some lab and Energy
Department officials, according to a senior Energy Department
official.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials have told Congress that Lee and his wife, Sylvia,
had prior relationships with the bureau. In the early 1980s, Lee
volunteered information to the bureau, but officials would not
provide details. Mrs. Lee provided the bureau with information on
foreign visitors to Los Alamos from about 1987 to 1992, but her
information was not considered valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Clinton and his aides have portrayed Chinese nuclear
espionage as a problem that occurred during previous
administrations. Amid the furor over the administration's handling
of the earlier theft of the W-88 data from Los Alamos, the White
House has stressed that the espionage occurred in the 1980s, long
before Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
   But the new evidence raises the stakes of the congressional
investigations now under way into how the Los Alamos case was
handled after the W-88 theft was first detected in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The information improperly transferred by Lee included what Los
Alamos officials call the ``legacy'' codes. According to John
Browne, director of Los Alamos, the legacy codes consist of
computer data used to design nuclear weapons, analyze nuclear test
results and evaluate weapons materials and the safety
characteristics of America's nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are codes that integrate our best understanding of the
processes that go on in a nuclear weapon,'' Browne said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy codes can be used to help design nuclear weapons
through computer simulation, and so are valuable on their own. But
they become more valuable when combined with specific performance
data, which would then enable someone to generate a computer
simulation of American warhead designs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Lee transferred both the legacy codes and the
input data for specific U.S. warheads that go with the legacy
codes. The codes and performance data provide what a Los Alamos
scientist described as a ``rough approximation'' of the physical
processes that occur in a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Ray E. Kidder, a nuclear-weapons physicist at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California, said the combined data
was equivalent to a scientific blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got the source code and the input data, you can
reverse-engineer the thing and have a complete plan for nuclear
explosive part of the weapon,'' Kidder said.
</P>
<P>
   One lab official said investigators were still trying to
determine the extent of the security breach and exactly how many
warheads were involved in the data transfers.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy codes and the warhead data that goes with them could
be particularly valuable for a country, like China, that has signed
onto the nuclear test ban treaty and relies solely on computer
simulations to upgrade and maintain its nuclear arsenal. The legacy
codes are now used to maintain the American nuclear arsenal through
computer simulation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Lee's transfers occurred in 1994 and 1995, just before
China signed the test ban treaty in 1996, according to American
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But officials say Lee may have started transferring files out of
the classified computer network as early as 1983. So far, officials
have not found evidence of transfers after 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 59, began working at Los Alamos in 1978. His wife worked as
a secretary at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also traveled to China on several occasions while working at
Los Alamos. In June 1986 he delivered a paper on nuclear-weapons
related science at a symposium in Beijing with the approval of Los
Alamos officials. In June 1988 he delivered another paper at a
conference in Beijing, again with the lab's approval.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 U.S. intelligence officials began to suspect that China
had obtained design data from the W-88 warhead. In 1996 the FBI
began a criminal investigation of the W-88 theft, and Lee emerged
as the principal suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by 1997 the bureau's investigation was stalled. The
Department of Justice declined an FBI request to seek court
approval to gain surreptitious access to Lee's office computer,
officials said. Once the the request was rejected, officials of the
bureau and the Energy Department determined that they needed Lee's
approval to examine his office computer.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997 Lee was transferred to a new job at Los Alamos,
where he was responsible for updating legacy codes for five
American warheads. Although Los Alamos officials knew he was
already under investigation in the W-88 theft, they believed that
his continued access to the legacy codes would not be damaging
because they knew he had had access to them for years, lab and
Energy Department officials said. But Los Alamos officials also
assured the Energy Department that there were fire walls in place
to prevent the leakage of classified information, they added.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until last month, just a few days before he was
fired, that the FBI finally asked for and received Lee's
authorization to search his computer, officials said. Once the
bureau saw the transferred files in the unclassified computer
network, investigators realized their significance.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Richardson was briefed, and he then told the
president and shut down the lab's computer systems for two weeks.
But the FBI still encountered delays in winning Justice Department
approval to seek a court-ordered search of Lee's home, officials
said, and did not conduct the search until April 10.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has told Congress that it believes that the new
information of computer transfers is the strongest evidence they
have against Lee, officials said. The New York Times delayed
publication of this article for one day at the request of the FBI,
which said the latest disclosure could impede its inquiry.

BUSCH LEAGUE GOING BIG TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS BREWSTER  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Some of the stiffest competition this weekend
at the California Speedway is set for Friday afternoon _ and it
will have no impact on Sunday's featured race.
</P>
<P>
   And the reverse is also true. Some of the drivers who are
expected to compete in the NAPA California 500 will also have a
role in determining the winner of the Auto Club 300, the support
race for the Busch Grand National series. There are 56 cars entered
for Saturday's 150-lap race, and only 43 spots on the grid.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered the training ground for NASCAR's premier Winston
Cup Series, the Busch series has blossomed into a fertile race of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   The payout by Anheuser-Busch went from $650,000 in 1998 to $1.5
million this season. Saturday's purse at Fontana is a track-record
$1,059,416.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger points' fund has attracted a greater number of Cup
regulars, especially when the two series are part of the same
weekend. This week's race marks the ninth doubleheader in 10 Busch
races this year. And while the Busch series might be a training
ground, it's also very lucrative for Cup regulars.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 16 Cup drivers will attempt to make Saturday's field.
That's not good news for the Busch regulars. It is good news for
the promoter, in this case the California Speedway; the influx of
Cup regulars helps Saturday ticket sales, especially since Sunday
is a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that the Busch Grand National is a very viable series
that can go into areas and represent NASCAR very professionally,''
said Mike Helton, NASCAR president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   While there are stand-alone Busch races in Milwaukee, Nazareth
(Pa.) and Nashville, doubleheaders are more common.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is not limited to Fontana but has been on going
since February and is fueled by media reports that imply Winston
Cup regulars are taking championship points, money and headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Busch series could stand on its own. It is
bolstered by some of the top names in the sport _ Earnhardt, Petty,
Jarrett _ and is home to drivers destined to become household names
of the future _ Kenseth, Blaney and Dillon. Earnhardt is Dale Jr.,
the defending race and series champion. Adam Petty is a
fourth-generation NASCAR competitor whose father is Kyle Petty.
Richard Petty is his grandfather and Lee Petty, one of the NASCAR
pioneers, his great-grandfather. The same goes for Jason Jarrett,
Dale Jarrett's son and Ned Jarrett's grandson. Matt Kenseth could
very well make the jump to Winston Cup next year along with young
Earnhardt, an old friend.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Blaney left sprint cars to race in NASCAR while Mike Dillon
once substituted for Dale Earnhardt Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Randy LaJoie, a two-time Busch champion, is not a fan of seeing
the older, more experienced and better-financed drivers in the
Busch series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaquille O'Neal can't go back to college for the NCAA
Tournament,'' LaJoie said. ``Let us have our series back.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Earnhardt has mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double-edged sword. Of course it does cut into some of
the Busch regulars' programs, especially guys with new teams this
early in the season,'' said Earnhardt. ``It takes away from teams
that don't qualify, have provisionals or aren't eligible for
provisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But competing with Cup regulars gave Earnhardt Jr. the skills to
win the 1998 championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be anywhere near the driver I am today if not for
Mark Martin and Jeff Burton and those guys I raced against last
year,'' said Earnhardt. ``I learned a ton from those guys and
greatly benefited.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Atwood could be excused if he wants nothing to do with the
Cup drivers. He's 18 years old, although he aged considerably after
landing on top of his car and going for a wild ride in the season
opener last February at Daytona. But Atwood, like Earnhardt, enjoys
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't like it, but I do,'' Atwood said. ``I
want to learn all I can. The more I get behind those guys and race
with those guys, the better off I'll be.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bodine, winner of the inaugural Busch race in 1997, has a
different perspective. He is using the series in an effort to
return to Sunday racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the veteran side, I enjoy the competition,'' said Bodine.
``I was in Junior's shoes a few years ago and you learn from those
guys on and off the track. They are the best of the best and can
only make you better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine also understands the dynamics of watching the
less-experienced and lesser-financed teams go home after Friday's
qualifying session.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young guys need the experience, but they can't get in
the race. They can't get the experience,'' Bodine said. ``There is
no real clear-cut answer to the problem.''

 &HT;    Texas Senate OKs database of gang members
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service Staff
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas would establish a statewide database on
suspected criminal street gang members _ including people who
haven't been arrested _ under a bill that won Senate approval
Tuesday in the wake of school violence in Colorado and alleged
threats in this state.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which is part of an anti-gang package and now heads to
the House for consideration, was developed long before last week's
Colorado school shootings by two students.
</P>
<P>
   But a senator who supports the measure referred to the massacre
in Colorado and to recent allegations that junior high students in
Wimberley were planning an attack on their Central Texas school
with homemade bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the events in Colorado . . . the nation is searching for
answers, and we're all taking an introspective look at what we
do,'' said Senate Criminal Justice Committee Chairman Ken
Armbrister, D-Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one simple thread that constantly runs through. . . .
That single thread is shock. How could this exist in our community?
What we did today will go a long way to educating the people of
this state to the real problems of crime,'' Armbrister said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, including Gov. George W. Bush, said the measure
would provide an important tool for law enforcement officers around
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed unanimously after an amendment was narrowly
defeated on a 15-15 vote. It would have required a vote of the city
council or county commissioners court for a local law enforcement
agency to participate in the statewide database.
</P>
<P>
   Activists: Old factories foul air Smog-causing pollution from
Texas' older industrial plants can travel hundreds of miles by air,
affecting urban areas already struggling with air-quality problems,
environmentalists said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty old industrial plants in Texas are not just fouling
their own nest,'' Texas Sierra Club Director Ken Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   A plan pushed by Gov. George W. Bush _ and already approved by
the state Senate _ would allow companies to volunteer to reduce
emissions at their ``grandfathered'' older plants, which are exempt
from some state pollution regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say pollution reductions should be required by
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through air pollution carried by wind currents, these
grandfathered air polluters are adding to the air-quality problems
of Texas cities and suburbs over a hundred miles from the plants,''
Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bike helmet bill gets initial OK Children under 15 years old who

<TEXT>
<P>
   Signaling a continuation of its vigorous growth, America Online
Inc. on Tuesday reported profits of $420 million for the first
three months of the year, a figure that included a number of
one-time items.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the special items, the company earned $117 million in
the quarter, up 200 percent from the comparable period a year
earlier. That comes to 11 cents a share, 20 percent higher than the
9 cents analysts had estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The special items included a one-time pretax gain of $567
million from the sale of shares in Excite Inc. And AOL took a
charge of $103 million related to its acquisition of Netscape
Communication Corp., which was completed in March.
</P>
<P>
   The company's flagship online service added 1.8 million
subscribers in the three months, bringing the total to 16.9
million. The service continued to occupy more of members' time,
with the average account in use 55 minutes a day, up from 46
minutes a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both membership and advertising revenue was higher than I
expected,'' said Stephen Case, the company's chairman. The winter
months are always strong for the company as people who receive
computers for Christmas sign up for the service. Still, membership
is accelerating, Case said, adding, ``More and more people can
afford PCs as the prices come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising and payment from companies doing business on America
Online's services increased 119 percent, to $210 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company released its earnings report after the close of the
market. The shares had dropped $9 during the day to close at $153.
In after-hours trading, the shares rose as high as $157.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted that for the first time in recent years, America
Online's advertising revenue grew faster than that of Yahoo Inc.,
the largest advertising-supported Web service.
</P>
<P>
   America Online dominates the market for home users, while
services like Yahoo are used mostly by people in offices. ``If you
want nighttime coverage for your message, AOL is your only
choice,'' said Brian Oakes, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. ``If
you want to reach people in the daytime at their businesses, you
can choose from a lot of portals.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Braverman, an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery
Securities, said America Online had a backlog of $1.3 billion in
advertising sold for future periods. ``That comes out to $133
million a quarter for the next two and a quarter years,'' he said.
``That means that they essentially have half their nut covered
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, analysts said, the company is showing increasingly
strong financial performance. Its gross profit margin, Oakes said,
rose from 38 percent in the last quarter of 1998 to 41 percent in
the most recent quarter. ``They had a big kick in revenue and they
are running their network more efficiently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the company reported revenue of $1.3 billion, up 66
percent from a year ago. The bulk of that was $869 million in
subscription fees, which increased 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Case said that the company's Compuserve service had begun to
show a small increase in its base of 2 million subscribers after
years of steady declines. Still, the company has yet to come up
with a marketing message for a major promotion for the service, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Case declined to comment on reports that America Online was
considering backing Comcast Corp.'s battle with AT&AMP;T to buy
MediaOne Group, the cable company. Still, he indicated that America
Online wanted access to cable systems in order to offer high-speed
access to homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do things that support our strategy of building a
more ubiquitous medium,'' Case said, adding that the company had
the ability to make another big acquisition, even as it
incorporates Netscape. ``We have the management bandwidth, but we
will only do things if they make sense.''

CALBASAS WOMAN HONORED FOR BUSINESS ACHIEVEMENTS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lauren Raissen's husband loved pickles but she
didn't care for his breath afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to drive me absolutely crazy,'' said the 34-year-old
native South African who now lives in Calabasas northwest of
downtown Los Angeles. ``I told him it's the pickles or me.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the breath fresheners on the market worked. So the
Raissens set out to develop a better product.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Raissen is the president and chief financial officer of
Breath Asure. The Calabasas company markets five different breath
products and enjoys $25.5 million in annual sales. Not bad for a
mother of two and accountant who started the company out of her
garage.
</P>
<P>
   Working Woman magazine noticed. Raissen was named one of its top
500 businesswomen in the country in 1999. It's her second year to
be so honored.
</P>
<P>
   Her company ranked 291. She was listed alongside Oprah Winfrey,
Martha Stewart and Katherine Graham of the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The listings underscore the progress achieved by female-owned
businesses. Working Woman's 500 top companies generate nearly $72
billion in annual revenues; in the past decade, women-owned
businesses increased by 78 percent, according to the National
Foundation for Women Business Owners. Women provide jobs for one
out of every four workers, according to Working Woman.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, other honorees include Margaret Sahroian of Foothill
Nissan of La Crescenta, Herminia Dilbeck of Dilbeck James R. Gary &AMP;
Co. in La Crescenta, Lynda Resnick of Roll International in Los
Angeles and Dineh Mohajer of Hard Candy in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Raissen started the company when she was 27, hoping to build a
home-based business so she could stay home with her children. At
the time, her husband had an electrical contracting business where
she was second in command. When the family's second business,
Breath Asure, was launched, she told her husband that she didn't
want to play second fiddle this time.
</P>
<P>
   Since the company was founded in 1992, it has taken off.
First-year sales of $40,000 have soared to over $25 million
annually with 37 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Breath Asure became so successful that it eclipsed the family's
electrical contracting business, leading to the decision to
discontinue that venture.
</P>
<P>
   Raissen believes her greatest contributions have been keeping it
on a conservative growth track, creating a good working environment
and emphasizing teamwork and joint decision-making.

SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH PLAN SAVES MONEY, REPORTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Two independent groups commissioned by the
Massachusetts Medical Society to explore switching the state's
current health care system to a Canadian-style single-payer
approach have found that between $170 million and $1 billion a year
could be saved while coverage is extended to hundreds of thousands
of uninsured residents.
</P>
<P>
   The reports are notable not only for their findings, but also
for who commissioned them. The medical society, along with the
American Medical Association and other professional groups, has
long opposed a single-payer system.
</P>
<P>
   And in another twist: While the AMA rejected a 1996 request by
some members to even study the single-payer issue, the
Massachusetts society commissioned two such reviews in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The closely guarded reports, which have not been publicly
released but were obtained by the Globe, are slated to come up at
the Massachusetts society's annual House of Delegates meeting in
Boston next week.
</P>
<P>
   Some society members and other physicians say the reports'
findings support what they consider to be an urgent need to revamp
the current health system, given the rising number of uninsured and
still-escalating health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not working, and I think that doctors as a whole are
going to have to rethink their position,'' said Dr. Arnold S.
Relman, emeritus editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of
Medicine and a member of the society's House of Delegates.
</P>
<P>
   So closely guarded are the reports that Relman at first refused
to discuss them, until he was told the Globe independently obtained
copies and was preparing a story anyway. The two groups that did
the reports, a consulting firm known as the Lewin Group and a team
of researchers from Philadelphia and Boston University School of
Public Health, have also been asked not to talk about the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are not going to be satisfied. They're simply not
going to settle for what they have now,'' said Relman, who has long
supported a single-payer approach. ``It's just a crazy system.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David U. Himmelstein of the Physicians for a National Health
Program said the reports' findings do not surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to cover everybody in society at a reasonable
cost, the only way to do it is single payer,'' said Himmelstein, a
Harvard Medical School associate professor. ``The savings are on
administration and waste. Basically, you get more health care and
less bureaucracy from a single-payer system than from any other
alternative. That's why we've advocated it for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients and providers who have had to contend with the
patchwork quilt of multiple health insurance plans in this state
and the nation know about the costly paperwork they generate,
according to single-payer supporters. Each plan has its own set of
co-pays, deductibles, list of covered procedures and complicated
rules, as well as its own stack of claim forms.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 Massachusetts residents fed up with the
multiple-payer system here rallied on the State House steps in
support of a single-payer bill Tuesday, just before a Joint Health
Care Committee hearing on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Trimming the administrative overhead by creating one payer would
save about $3.6 billion in 1999 in Massachusetts, according to the
high-end estimate in the report by consultants Solutions for
Progress of Philadelphia and Alan Sager and Deborah Socolar of the
Boston University School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   That figure, plus aggressive savings elsewhere, add up to a
total $5 billion reduction out of the current $36 billion that
Massachusetts spends on health care each year, under this model.
</P>
<P>
   And it would cost only about $4 billion out of that $5 billion
saved to cover all the uninsured and expand health benefits to
those who already have insurance _ hence the high-end estimate of
an immediate $1 billion a year in savings from a single-payer
system in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   On the low-end, the Lewin Group report estimates a 1999 savings
of about $2.5 billion in Massachusetts from eliminating the extra
administrative expense of having multiple insurers, and few savings
from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that lower savings figure, the Lewin Group report
estimates it will take until the year 2005 before an overall
reduction is achieved from going to a single-payer system and
expanding coverage to everyone. The savings that year are estimated
to be about $170 million, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of the Massachusetts Medical Society and the
American Medical Association said their organizations, while
supporting measures to provide universal access to care, continue
to back a multiple-payer, or pluralistic, approach as the best way
to give Americans choice and preserve quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pluralistic, multipayer system, has been the preferred
policy. . .mostly because of the members' belief that patients
should have a choice of health insurance options,'' said Frank
Fortin, communications director for the 17,000-plus member state
medical society.
</P>
<P>
   Fortin said he could not comment on the contents of the
consultants' reports. It is up to the House of Delegates to decide
whether to publicly release the reports, which are considered
informational and not the basis for policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Dickey, president of the AMA, said that while there
may be administrative savings from a single-payer system, the
experience in Canada and other countries shows certain
disadvantages. ``Virtually all of them are privatizing a piece of
their system,'' Dickey said. ``They have a substantial waiting line
as they attempt to control expenditures of funds. They do so by
rationing the amount of care that they give.''
</P>
<P>
   While she said she ``looks forward to reading'' the studies
commissioned by the Massachusetts society, the AMA is ``currently
opposed to a single payer system'' while it is ``in support of
every American having access to care.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Association of HMOs did not return a phone
call Tuesday seeking comment on the reports on the single-payer
system.

ROGER TROUTMAN, 47, INFLUENTIAL FUNK MUSICIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (mk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Troutman, a renowned funk-music innovator who recorded
with his brothers in the band Zapp in the early '80s, died on
Sunday at the Good Samaritan Hospital and Health Center in Dayton,
Ohio. He was 47 and lived in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Troutman had been shot several times on Sunday and died during
surgery, Sgt. Gary White of the Dayton police department said.
Troutman's older brother Larry, a former bandmate and business
partner, was found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot
wound the same day in a car nearby. Police said they were
investigating the possibility of a murder-suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Zapp is probably best known for its use of the vocoder, or
talkbox, a device that makes vocals sound robotic, and for
influencing musicians from rockers like Lenny Kravitz to rappers
like Tupac Shakur. The group's music has been sampled on dozens of
hit rap singles.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Troutman grew up in Hamilton, Ohio. Influenced by James
Brown, Jimmy Reed, Duke Ellington and Jimi Hendrix, as well as by
the thriving regional funk scene, he formed Zapp in the late '70s
with three of his brothers _ Lester, Larry and Tony (who changed
his name to Zapp). Troutman used to say that he began using the
vocoder in concert in order to sing hits originally performed by
women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the band's mentors, George Clinton and Bootsy Collins
of Parliament-Funkadelic, took Zapp to Detroit to record its first
record for Warner Brothers records. ``Zapp'' is considered a
sprawling funk masterpiece and generated the robotic party anthem
``More Bounce to the Ounce.'' Before recording his next album,
Troutman appeared on the Funkadelic album ``The Electric Spanking
of War Babies'' and recorded a solo album.
</P>
<P>
   As the eccentric singer and guitarist became the musical leader
of the family band, his brothers helped turn Zapp into a family
business with Larry in charge. By the end of the '80s, Troutman
Enterprises encompassed a construction company, a bus company, a
recording studio, a touring operation, a booking agency and a music
production company. The family's strategy for long-term success was
to avoid crossing over to a white audience, to use the vocoder on
as many singles as possible and to deliver rousing live shows. In
concert, the band's members were master showmen, working crowds
into feverish excitement as Troutman donned flashier outfits and
guitars with nearly each song.
</P>
<P>
   Though Troutman's and Zapp's records alternately flopped and
generated hits (like ``Computer Love''), he never faded from the
pop eye. In the late '80s, new-wave bands like Scritti Politti
recorded hits with him. And in the early '90s, he was embraced as a
rap and rhythm-and-blues father figure. He lent his computerized
vocals to popular songs for 2Pac (``California Love,'' the video
for which he appeared in); H-Town (``A Thin Line Between Love and
Hate''); Johnny Gill (``It's Your Body''); and Eazy-E (``Eternal
E'').
</P>
<P>
   Troutman had been touring with Zapp and working on an album for
Reprise Records in the months before his death.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his mother, three brothers and two sisters.

GOOGS EXPECTS THE BOOS IN MINNESOTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ When Denver's Antonio McDyess made his first visit
to America West Arena this season, Phoenix forward Tom Gugliotta
had to laugh at the cascade of boos rained down on McDyess by the
fans that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get that in Minnesota,'' Gugliotta said at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Gugliotta makes his first return to the Twin Cities,
where he played four seasons and blossomed into the Minnesota
Timberwolves first NBA All-Star in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But like McDyess, Gugliotta spurned his old team _ despite
having to take less money to leave than he could have gotten to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   So Gugliotta figures he won't hear that familiar
``Goooooooooogs'' from the Target Center crowd tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably get booed, I would think,'' Gugliotta said. ``As
nice as those people are, they'll probably still boo me _ just
because of the fact that I made the decision to leave there.''
</P>
<P>
   And just as Phoenix followers wondered why McDyess would leave
the Suns for less money, Minnesota fans asked the same questions
about Gugliotta's decision. But Gugliotta said it was more about
winning games, and where he fit into the club's plan, than about
money.
</P>
<P>
   Was there anything the Timberwolves could have done that would
have convinced him to stay?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Gugliotta said. ``It was a tough decision, but
there probably wasn't anything they could have really done to
convince me. I felt there was a better opportunity, long term, here
(in Phoenix).''
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, the club was being built around forward Kevin
Garnett and point guard Stephon Marbury. After four years,
Gugliotta wanted to see more done to win immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt at times maybe I was just a holdover until KG and
Marbury were in their prime,'' said Gugliotta, who is 29 years old.
``I didn't want to play for something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'm 33, 34 years old, they're in their prime and I'm on
my way out _ if they don't trade me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think there was an urgency to win now. A couple years
ago (in the playoffs), Terry Porter was playing great for us, but
he didn't get any minutes because they wanted Steph to come along.
I'm like, `What about winning right now?' I can't blame them for
thinking that way. I just didn't want to be part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that Gugliotta didn't like playing with
Marbury. He has denied there was a problem, but he doesn't deny
that he suspected Marbury was not committed to the franchise for
the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always talked about how he wanted to play in New York, or
at least in a bigger market,'' Gugliotta said. ``He always talked
about that and about being closer to his family in New York. He was
young, and you couldn't always pay attention to some of the things
he was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Timberwolves eventually realized that Marbury wasn't
going to remain happy in Minnesota. He wanted to be paid more money
than Garnett, a dynamic and versatile big man. Marbury made it
known he wouldn't be satisfied as the second-highest paid player on
the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves traded him to New Jersey in a three-way deal
that sent Milwaukee point guard Terrell Brandon to Minnesota and
New Jersey playmaker Sam Cassell to the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he's got a lot of confidence in his ability,''
Gugliotta said of Marbury. ``He didn't think he should be second
highest (paid), but that's the way the rules were. There was
nothing else they could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gugliotta doesn't expect the Target Center crowd to
understand all of that, or care. He's prepared for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's if Gugliotta is even introduced. He missed
Monday night's game in Utah because of an ankle sprain and is
questionable for tonight's game. He also missed a game against his
former team April 7 in Phoenix because of a hyperextended knee.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta knows how these things work. He was traded by
Washington to Golden State after two seasons, then sent from the
Warriors to the Timberwolves in the same season. When a player is
traded, fans usually blame the team and there is a warm reception
on that first return.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is (different) because I made the decision to leave,''
Gugliotta said. ``They're proud people, and I don't think they
liked that very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gugliotta said he has fond memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed playing there, especially being there at the
beginning when the team wasn't any good and going through the
process, helping the organization win, seeing people come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first city I got attached to. In D.C., I was there
for two years, but that was so long ago, I forget how I felt.
Golden State, I was dying to get out of there. The people were
fine, but I didn't want to stay with that team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Minnesota, I played some of my best basketball. I've got
great memories. It was a good city and the people really took to
basketball. We were lucky. Pro sports there, you never know if a
franchise is going to succeed. They lost hockey. But there's a big
following for the T-Wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fellow they called ``Googs'' will likely hear from them
tonight. &QL;

MICROSOFT TO JOIN RESEARCH ON NEXT INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., which was forced to scramble to catch up after
a sluggish start on the Internet a few years ago, is moving to
insure that it is at the forefront of Internet research.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will announce Wednesday that it is joining the
research coalition that is leading the development of the
next-generation Internet _ a highly reliable network that can move
data at speeds 1,000 times faster than the fastest communications
lines used by corporations and universities today.
</P>
<P>
   The program, known as Internet2, is backed by 150 universities
and about 15 corporations, mostly telecommunications and network
equipment makers, including AT&AMP;T, 3Com and Cisco. Microsoft and IBM
are the software and hardware producers among Internet2's corporate
members.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's entry is expected to prompt other software companies
to join, said Doug Van Houweling, president of the University
Corporation for Advanced Internet Development, which oversees
Internet2 projects.
</P>
<P>
   The objective is to combine efforts of academia and business to
develop advanced Internet services including telemedicine,
interactive distance learning and digital libraries. Pilot projects
are expected to serve to persuade corporations to invest to build
the high-speed network and refine applications for business and
consumer markets. By involving corporations in early work on the
next-generation Internet, Van Houweling hopes to speed its
commercialization and use.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which will contribute more than $1 million a year in
cash, software and services, says its growing research group has
been increasingly working on software and services for high-speed
networks, so that joining Internet2 is a natural step. And because
Microsoft's software is used on most personal computers, it could
bring the next-generation Internet to millions of desktops quickly,
perhaps within five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coalition is a joint research effort that seeks to stumble
upon and create the next big applications on the Internet,'' said
Rick Rashid, vice president of Microsoft's research division. ``We
can help see a lot of that technology realized much more rapidly
and incorporated into our products in the long run.''

TILLMAN MOVING TO STRONG SAFETY DURING MINICAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals second-year pro  &UR; Pat Tillman will learn
a new position this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He is moving to strong safety from free safety and will work
there for the first time Friday morning at the start of a three-day
minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   With Tillman moving to strong safety, veteran  &UR; J.J. McCleskey,
who played cornerback and strong safety a year ago, will switch to
free safety. McCleskey also will continue to work at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told Pat that with a year under his belt, he has to learn
the other safety, and the best way is to have him practice there,''
secondary coach  &UR; Larry Marmie said. ``We feel he has a pretty good
grasp of free safety. Now he needs to learn strong safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Tillman, a seventh-round draft pick a year ago out of Arizona
State, said the switch is fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool,'' said Tillman, who started the first 11 games at
free safety last season before losing the job to  &UR; Kwamie Lassiter.
``I couldn't care less where I am. I just want to play. Certain
responsibilities will change. I know there is a little bit more man
coverage at strong safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals two safety spots are interchangeable, but at
strong safety, Tillman will be involved more in covering the tight
end.
</P>
<P>
   Marmie said he thinks McCleskey is more suited for free safety
because of his strong coverage skills ``in space'' and on deep
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter where I line up,'' McCleskey said. ``During
games, I play free safety, strong safety and cornerback. So, I have
to know everything. I'm a jack of all trades.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals will open training camp with Lassiter as the
starter at free safety and  &UR; Tommy Bennett as the starter at strong
safety. &QL; 
Irving released
</P>
<P>
   When the Cardinals didn't protect outside linebacker  &UR; Terry
Irving in the expansion draft, he knew his job on the team wasn't
secure.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals released Irving on Tuesday, making him an
unconditional free agent. The Cardinals also released veteran
cornerback  &UR; J.B. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Irving, a sixth-year pro, was inactive in nine of 16 games last
season.
</P>
<P>
   With his departure, the team saves his salary of $520,000 for
1999. But his signing bonus of $166,700 this season and next will
count against this year's salary cap. &QL; 
Back in the saddle
</P>
<P>
   Veteran defensive tackle  &UR; Bernard Wilson signed a one-year deal
on Tuesday. Details weren't disclosed, but it is believed to be
worth $400,000
</P>
<P>
   He will compete for a backup job behind starters  &UR; Eric Swann and
 &UR; Mark Smith. &QL; 
The only veteran defensive lineman unsigned is Smith, a third-year
pro whose rights are exclusively owned by the Cardinals. &QL; 
Fast starter
</P>
<P>
   Second-year wide receiver  &UR; Andy McCullough is tied for the NFL
Europe League lead in catches with 12.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, who plays for Frankfurt, is second in receiving
yards with 189 and also second in touchdowns with two.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough had seven receptions for a team-high 101 yards in
last weekend's 17-13 loss to Amsterdam. &QL; 
Great expectations

A HUMBLE LUKAS ELECTED TO HALL OF FAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Trainer D. Wayne Lukas was honored by
thoroughbred racing's Hall of Fame on Tuesday _ and reciprocated by
downplaying his belief his election was overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing's bigger than any individual,'' Lukas said at
Churchill Downs, where he'll send Cat Thief and Charismatic in
quest of his fourth Kentucky Derby victory. ``I don't want to be
one to take a stand against (the Hall of Fame's) parameters. This
is an honor for everybody in my organization. I think I'd be less
of a person if I didn't endorse it 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, 63, was elected over Neil Drysdale and Richard Mandella
by a panel of racing journalists in his first year on the ballot.
Trainers become eligible after 25 consecutive years in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   But Lukas and researchers contend he was saddling thoroughbreds
at least a decade before 1974, when he completed a switch from
quarterhorses.
</P>
<P>
   Also elected to the Hall of Fame were Northern California jockey
Russell Baze and the horses Exceller (``contemporary male''),
Miesque (``contemporary female'') and Gun Bow (``horse of
yesteryear'').
</P>
<P>
   Inductions will be held Aug. 9 in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Lukas,
who once indicated he'd boycott the ceremony, left no doubt he'll
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who is based in Southern California but has horses across
the nation, has dominated racing statistics in the 1980s and '90s,
training a record 19 champions, winning a record 13 Breeders' Cup
races and 10 Triple Crown races.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas' horses will soon pass $200 million in earnings. The only
other trainer to reach $100 million was Charlie Whittingham.
</P>
<P>
   Valhol can race: Valhol's owner has won the right to collect
$300,000 for a suspicious Arkansas Derby victory, and with it the
right to enter the gelding in the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Pulaski County, Ark., Circuit Judge John Plegge ruled in favor
of owner Jim Jackson, whose attorney argued the state racing
commission violated due process and its own precedent by
withholding the purse pending an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Valhol jockey Billy Patin faces a May 5 hearing after Arkansas
Derby videotape showed him dropping what appears to be a ``buzzer''
and an Oaklawn Park worker reported finding such an electronic
device on the track. The purse could then be stripped if Patin were
found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling in Little Rock was crucial, because without it Valhol
would have just $38,400 in graded-stakes earnings, too little to
break into the Kentucky Derby field if more than the maximum 20
horses are entered.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the draft: Post positions will be set this afternoon
with the same novel system as in 1998, with horses' connections
``drafting'' starting slots in a randomly selected order.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, one post-position number was inadvertently awarded
twice, forcing embarrassed Churchill Downs officials to order a
redraw.

RICH POOL OF TALENT AWAITS WNBA DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rich will get richer. The poor will get much richer.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is going to win in the WNBA draft except the collegiate
senior class. Other than expected No. 1 pick Chamique Holdsclaw,
collegians will be an afterthought in the four-round, 48-player
selection, originally scheduled Tuesday and now likely to be held
early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike 1997 and '98, when the battle between the American
Basketball League and WNBA was to sign the premier collegians, the
war now is over. Except for a five-state investigation into
possible unfair competitive practices by the NBA leading to
bankruptcy for the ABL in December, the WNBA has clear sailing once
its players ratify a four-year collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   And the 12-team league, which expands to 16 in 2000, is about to
benefit from an influx of talent that will not be seen again.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the ABL left 32 Kodak All-Americans, several of
those with U.S. Olympic or World Championships experience, out of a
job. Even those who haven't played overseas boast ABL seasoning,
which likely means the first round of the draft will go
collegiateless after the Washington Mystics select Holdsclaw.
</P>
<P>
   It can even be argued that the 6-foot-2 Holdsclaw, only the
fourth four-time Kodak All-American, is not the best value in a
draft that includes ABL posts Yolanda Griffith and Natalie
Williams, plus Natalia Zassoulskaia, who carried Russia past the
United States at the 1992 Olympics and almost did the same at the
'98 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Zassoulskaia's agent confirmed that the 6-4 forward will be in
the draft, although the league will not release a draft list until
it can formally sign players.
</P>
<P>
   But the 3-27 Mystics were not accorded nine national television
appearances, one more than league runner-up Phoenix, based solely
on its WNBA-leading attendance (15,910 average) and market size.
NBC, ESPN and Lifetime expect Holdsclaw, a three-time NCAA champion
at Tennessee with marquee appeal, to be the Mystics' choice as
first reinforcement for Nikki McCray, who defected from the ABL
after being that league's Most Valuable Player in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   ``Draft Chamique Holdsclaw,'' one reader told the ``Washington
Post'' last week. ``The Mystics already raised my season tickets by
25 percent. I might as well get something for my money.''
</P>
<P>
   At least in the first and second rounds, there will be plenty of
bang for the buck, especially since ABL players will be subject to
the rookie pay scale ($25,000 minimum, more for high draft picks)
for one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some coaches are like kids in a candy store,'' said Maura
McHugh, who coached Long Beach to a near-upset of Columbus in the
1998 ABL Finals, then worked in ABL personnel after the league
folded the StingRays. The former Arizona State coach now is an
assistant with the WNBA Sacramento Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unusual to have this number of experienced players
available in the draft, especially in the third year of a league.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Monarchs, 8-22 last season without injured
all-league guard Ruthie Bolton-Holifield last season after going
10-18 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   If neither Griffith nor Williams is allocated to one of the two
expansion teams before the draft, Sacramento will take one,
probably Griffith, with the second pick. The Monarchs then can come
back in the second round with the 14th pick overall to take a
starting caliber wing player.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Mercury opens its season with back-to-back games
against Sacramento, it will not be the same opponent Phoenix has
whipped eight times without a loss. Instead, the Monarchs lineup
could feature WNBA assist leader Ticha Penicheiro dishing to the
6-4 Griffith, the 1998 ABL Most Valuable Player runner-up;
Bolton-Holifield, second in WNBA scoring in 1997; and another
former ABL All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 40 of the 132 WNBA players this season can be from the ABL
under terms agreed to between the league and the Women's National
Basketball Players Association. The 10 existing teams can have a
maximum of three each, while expansion Minnesota and Orlando can
include as many as five on their 11-woman rosters.
</P>
<P>
   Count on Minnesota using all of its ABL slots. Lynx
Coach-General Manager Brian Agler won consecutive ABL titles in
Columbus and, some think, will create Columbus North in Minneapolis
by reuniting the Quest perimeter of Katie Smith and Tonya Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   A persistent rumor is that both expansion teams asked for Quest
point guard Shannon Johnson as their second allocated player,
forcing a coin flip that was won by Orlando. So the Miracle
received the first choice in allocation, expected to be Johnson,
and Minnesota likely will get Smith, now running short sprints on
her way back from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson, Smith, Holdsclaw and Griffith are off the board when
Utah picks third overall, the Starzz are faced with a dilemma
similar to last year's. Go with need, clearly a point guard, or
with a can't-miss inside force in Williams, the 1998 ABL Most
Valuable Player who was a high schooler in Salt Lake City?
</P>
<P>
   Utah opted for 7-2 Margo Dydek with the 1998 first overall pick.
Though ``Large Marge'' led the league in blocks and was fourth in
rebounding, she couldn't lift the Starzz (8-22) from the Western
Conference cellar.
</P>
<P>
   With the muscle of 6-2 Williams, Utah Coach Frank Layden could
trade 1997 WNBA All-Star Wendy Palmer and still have an improved
front line that includes Dydek; 6-5 Elena Baranova, the 1998 World
Championships MVP; and 6-2 Olympia Scott-Richardson, getting back
into shape after the birth of a daughter on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   And with its second-round pick, 15th overall, Utah still could
get an ABL point guard to push Tammi Reiss, perhaps Niesa Johnson
or Andrea Nagy.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran point guards will at a premium if 34-year-old Teresa
Edwards and Jennifer Azzi, 30, do not sign with the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   The pair recently declined invitations to the U.S. National Team
camp that continues through Tuesday in Colorado Springs, a surprise
decision from Azzi, one of six core-group members through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Should Azzi and Edwards bypass the WNBA, teams such as Utah, if
it goes small, Charlotte (No. 9 pick) and two-time defending
champion Houston (No. 12), which must cover for cancer-stricken
starter Kim Perrot, would be scrambling for Dawn Staley, 28, or
Debbie Black, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles (No. 4) covets Staley, in no small part because of
her friendship with center Lisa Leslie. Tonya Edwards, although
more of a shooting guard, could also go in the first six picks if
there is a run on guards.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the first round _ Detroit (No. 5), New York (No.
6), Phoenix (No. 10) and Cleveland (No. 11) _ inside players such
as Clarisse Machanguana, DeLisha Milton, Adrienne Goodson, Shalonda
Enis and Taj McWilliams are likely candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury, deepest of all WNBA teams despite the loss of
Brandy Reed in the expansion draft, needs perimeter scoring and
post depth due to the pregnancy of Michelle Griffiths. After the
first round, Coach-General Manager Cheryl Miller might opt for
collegians, both to make her team younger and tap into a pool too
inexperienced for those with greater immediate needs.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Holdsclaw, the premier collegians will include shooting
guard Dominique Canty of Alabama, posts Tamika Whitmore of Memphis
and Angie Braziel of Texas Tech, small forward Amanda Wilson of
Louisiana Tech and point Ukari Figgs of Purdue. &QL;

MALONE MAY AVOID DISCIPLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Although Utah's Karl Malone has a long history of
taking opponents out with flying elbows, it isn't likely he'll be
disciplined for sending Phoenix center Joe Kleine to a plastic
surgeon Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kleine flew with the Suns to Minneapolis after the Suns beat the
Jazz Monday night, but he returned to the Valley Tuesday after
determining that he wouldn't be able to play either tonight against
the Timberwolves or Thursday night in Denver against the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' veteran backup center was not available for comment,
but an NBA spokesman said the league is not likely to take action
against Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like it,'' said Evan Silverman, manager of the
NBA's sports media relations division. ``I don't think any action
will be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   But Silverman said Rod Thorn, the NBA's senior vice
president-basketball operations, was attending to personal business
in West Virginia Tuesday. Thorn, who determines disciplinary
actions taken by the league, also could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, a muscular 6-foot-9, 260-pound forward, has a history of
injuring players and has been accused twice this season of
attempting to intentionally injure.
</P>
<P>
   Houston guard Brent Price accused Malone of attempting to injure
him.
</P>
<P>
   Malone also collided with Phoenix center Luc Longley while
attempting to draw a foul, crashed his leg into Longley's and
hyperextended Longley's left knee. After viewing a replay, Longley
later said Malone's action ``looked pretty bloody flagrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said after Monday night's incident that it wasn't
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I supposed to do, not shoot?'' he said. ``That's just
the way I go up. That's the way I play. I don't try to hurt
anybody. But that's the way I've played for 14 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Longley and Phoenix guard Jason Kidd each said that Kleine
described the play as a cheap shot before being taken to a
hospital. Longley said Kleine isn't easily upset, but he was fuming
over Malone's play.
</P>
<P>
   Kleine was injured late in the first quarter of the Suns' win at
Utah when Malone went up with the ball. He slammed his left elbow
and upper arm into Kleine's face, then scored with his right hand.

ROENICK TO PRACTICE WITH COYOTES WEDNESDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS - Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick said Tuesday he
intends to participate in an optional skate with team members
today, just 13 days after his jaw was broken in three places on a
vicious check by Derian Hatcher in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't touched a stick since I was hurt,'' said Roenick,
who last week cut the cast off oof his broken right thumb that was
injured seconds before Hatcher's hit. ``I plan to skate more for
conditioning, but I plan to practice with the boys, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick was asked if his planned return to the ice today means
he might be available for a possible second-round series, likely
against Hatcher and the Dallas Stars?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' he said. ``It's hard to say. I'll know more after
I see my doctor (Dr. Reed Day) on Thursday. It will be my
second-week checkup since the injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher was handed a five-game playoff suspension, longest in
league history, for the hit. &QL;

HERBERT YOUNG, 112, WORLD WAR I VETERAN RECENTLY HONORED BY
FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Mass., Jamaica)   (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Herbert Young, who was decorated by the French
government in February for his service in World War I, died April
22 at his home in Harlem. He would have turned 113 next week.
</P>
<P>
   Young, a retired mechanic, was considered the oldest New Yorker
by the city's Department for the Aging.
</P>
<P>
   He was awarded a medal, which made him a knight in the Order of
the Legion of Honor, on Feb. 22 by the French consul general in New
York, Richard Duque, in the French consulate general in Manhattan.
Young saluted while ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' was played and
later raised a glass of champagne.
</P>
<P>
   France began awarding the medal that Young received last year to
living veterans of World War I to mark the 80th anniversary of the
end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Young was in a Pioneer Infantry regiment that was one
of the black U.S. Army units that served under the French flag in
World War I in what has been called an expression of racial
segregation by the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in March , he said: ``I went in the Army in the
last part of 1917, enlisted because I was lonely. All the rest of
the boys had gone to the service. When I went to France, they put
us with the French army; the U.S. Army didn't want us because we
were colored.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians Arthur E. Barbeau and Florette Henri wrote in their
book, ``The Unknown Soldiers: Black American Troops in World War
I'' (1974, Da Capo), that for the black Pioneer Infantry regiments
sent to that war, the U.S. military ``does not seem to have
seriously contemplated combat service; the pared-down infantry
training they were given indicates rather that their true function
was work.''
</P>
<P>
   With age, Young's vision became imperfect and he acquired a
hearing aid. But his memories of World War I remained vivid. In an
interview after the medal ceremony, he said that during long-ago
battles in France, ``I was scared all right, and anyone who says
otherwise is fibbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw boys die right in front of me, some of my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   His 76-year-old son, Oscar, said that his father was resentful
after the war ended. ``After all he did, he came back home, and a
black man couldn't do nothing,'' Oscar Young recalled. ``So he's
real proud today, and so are we.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's granddaughter Martha Jones said: ``It's a big honor.
Something he's waited for a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1886 and was brought to
the United States as a baby by his mother, and grew up in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Young was a corporal in 1918, when he served in a crucial Allied
counteroffensive in France that pushed the Germans back toward the
east. The Allied gain of terrain was precious, but also costly in
terms of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was about 350 men in our outfit,'' the 807th Pioneer
Infantry regiment, he said in the March interview, ``and I guess
about 12 came home, including me. God didn't want me yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the 807th was not a combat unit, and ``we went to the
front and built bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   But Young said in the interview that ``a lot of our men died
fighting,'' although most of the deaths in his unit came from
disease. He said he himself wielded bayonets against the enemy, and
was made sick by German poison gas. After World War I ended in
1918, he had to stay in Europe for nine months, and his duties
included burying the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then he returned to Massachusetts and worked as a civilian auto
mechanic. He first arrived in New York in the Depression and
managed to find work as a used-car mechanic for Pontiac. A
quarter-century ago he married his wife, Grace, when he was in his
late 80s and she was in her mid-20s. She survives.
</P>
<P>
   More information about survivors was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters asked Young in March how he had managed to live
so long, he said modestly, ``I took care of myself and stayed out
of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   After he received his French medal, he said he would give it to
his great-great-great-granddaughter Jasmine Holmes, who is 11. She
promised she would hand it on to her descendants.

ARBIT BLATAS, 90, SCULPTOR, PAINTER AND STAGE DESIGNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arbit Blatas, a Lithuanian-born artist whose career
bridged New York, Venice and the Paris of Picasso, Matisse, Braque,
Dufy, Bonnard, Vlaminck, Utrillo, Soutine and Cocteau _ all of whom
he rendered in paint, clay or bronze _ died Tuesday at his studio
home in Manhattan. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   A stylish dresser and prolific sculptor, stage designer and
vivid colorist whose works are seen in plazas, museums and
galleries the world over, Blatas continued to paint until a series
of hospitalizations in recent months. His last book of paintings,
``An Artist's Venice'' (Vendome Press), was published in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Blatas' portraits hang in the School of Paris halls of
the Museum of the Thirties, which opened last December in
Boulogne-Billancourt outside Paris. With his wife, Regina Resnik,
the mezzo soprano and stage director, Blatas was to have traveled
to his native city, Kaunas, this fall for a planned major
retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   He is particularly known for his 1979 series of seven bronze
tablets on a wall of Venice's Campo del Nuovo Ghetto commemorating
the night of Dec. 5, 1943, when the first 200 of the city's Jews in
the old foundry district were rounded up and marched out for
deportation and death. Another casting was later mounted in New
York in Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, facing the United Nations. Blatas
also did the stark black and white drawings that introduced
segments of the acclaimed 1978 television series ``The Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   With his penchant for European fashion and artist's eye for
splashes of color, the debonair and polyglot Blatas (he spoke
Russian, Polish, German, Yiddish, Hebrew, French, Italian and
English) kept a busy social schedule with Ms. Resnik, who had a
long career at the Metropolitan Opera. Over icy vodka and canapes,
they also frequently entertained in their skylit atelier in the
West 50s, where Blatas had settled after fleeing the Nazis in 1941
and where the floors and walls were crowded with his art and
posters of her opera triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Missing, however, was a trove of as many as 200 Blatas paintings
stolen from a West Side storage space in 1994 and never recovered,
despite investigations by the police and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1909 to Russian parents in Kaunas, Blatas, an only
child, was an accomplished painter by 15. He soon left for Paris
where he became the youngest member of the eminent group of French
and emigre artists that became known as the School of Paris. Among
his companions was Chaim Soutine, a fellow Lithuanian, whom Blatas
captured in bronze a half century later for a statue in the
Montparnasse square where they used to meet. He also produced a
life-size bronze of the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz that stands in
the garden of the Hotel de Ville in Boulogne. Lipchitz, in return,
did a bust of him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, the French government made him a chevalier and later
officer of the Legion of Honor for his contributions to French art
as a member of the School of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   After escaping the Nazis and settling in New York, Blatas
returned after the war to Paris where, with Picasso's help, he
found his father, a survivor of the Holocaust, languishing in a
hospital. His mother had died in the German concentration camp of
Stutthof in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, his gallery shows drew favorable notice for what
one reviewer in The New York Times called ``his quick lyrical
impressions'' and another his ``blunt realist manner ruffled by
expressionist brushwork.'' He also produced a celebrated series of
paintings on ``The Threepenny Opera,'' then in a long run at the
Theater de Lys in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Blatas, whose first marriage had ended many years before, met
Ms. Resnik in 1971 when she directed a film version of ``Carmen''
in Hamburg. They married in 1975. In addition to Ms. Resnik, he is
survived by a daughter from his first marriage, Dorothee Radji of
Gouvieux, France.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Ms. Resnik, Blatas designed nine productions for
the operatic stage, including ``Elektra'' for the Teatro La Fenice
in Venice, ``Salome'' for the Teatro San Carlos in Lisbon,
``Falstaff'' for the Grand Theater in Warsaw and ``The Queen of
Spades'' for the Sydney Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   He and Ms. Resnik usually spent part of every year in Venice,
where Blatas evoked the city in paintings of bright orange, red and
inky black.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surface of Venice is constantly metamorphosing,'' he told
the writer Erica Jong in 1986. ``Painting Venice is almost like
being a restorer, peeling off the layers to find the picture after
picture underneath.''

BAFFERT GOES FOR HISTORIC WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Bob Baffert says he doesn't think about
history. He's a jokester, a 44-year-old party boy, living from one
turf-club champagne toast to the next. Or so the world's hottest
thoroughbred trainer would like you to think.
</P>
<P>
   But whether he thought about it or not, Baffert took a major
step Tuesday, the penultimate step of the long winter and spring,
toward Kentucky Derby history.
</P>
<P>
   Between rain showers at Churchill Downs, the two Derby favorites
splashed through their final serious tuneups for Saturday's race,
in which they'll try to make Baffert the first person to win the
classic horse race three years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge and Prime Timber didn't record the fastest
workouts of the morning, but they danced off the soupy track
afterwards in apparent health and fitness. If Baffert had been the
least bit nervous behind his Hollywood sunglasses, he could heave a
sigh of relief after watching that from the grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over. Now we can start partying down and
enjoying the festivities,'' he said after driving to his
backstretch barn. ``From here on it's just a matter of keeping 'em
happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in position to win another one,'' declared Baffert, who
won the past two Derbies with Silver Charm and Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Baffert's work is not quite done. He must finally
decide in the next two days whether to run one of his two star
fillies in the Derby or keep both with their own sex in Friday's
Kentucky Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said Silverbulletday, the champion 2-year-old filly of
'98, will settle for the Oaks, though her owner Mike Pegram pointed
out that ``he's been known to change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram _ who has already won a Derby with Real Quiet _ said he's
leaving the choice on Silverbulletday to Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe,'' Pegram admitted, ``I might have the
favorite in the Kentucky Derby and not run her.''
</P>
<P>
   The other filly, Excellent Meeting, has worked out so well here
that it's hard for Baffert to say no to the Derby for her. But
owners John and Betty Mabee have said they're ``90 percent''
against subjecting her to that strain. Baffert expected to discuss
it with the San Diego couple again after they arrived in Louisville
later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The best guess is that they'll put up an extra $30,000 to enter
Excellent Meeting in the Derby as well as the Oaks, but scratch her
from the Derby unless something unforeseen knocks out the Mabees'
General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the decision is fraught with potential regret.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when it comes to double-edged decisions, Baffert has
been juggling knives since the start of '99, when he counted an
unwieldy roster of six Triple Crown candidates in his Santa Anita
barn.
</P>
<P>
   After his success with Silver Charm and Real Quiet _ which
followed Cavonnier's unlucky second in '96 _ Baffert is the trainer
of choice for rich owners with Derby dreams. This year so many
signed on that it was as if the Derby became his to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert never believed that. Having also experienced hard
losses, like Cavonnier's Derby and like Silver Charm's and Real
Quiet's Belmont Stakes, he knew that all he could do was prepare
the horses for the race. The rest would be up to the horses. And
luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really think about winning it,'' he said. ``You
think about getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   There were moments along the way when he appeared to feel the
pressure. Like when he shoved Chris McCarron's agent in an argument
over Baffert's abrupt switch to Gary Stevens as the rider for
General Challenge before the gelding won the Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I snapped,'' Baffert told a Daily Racing Form interviewer
recently.
</P>
<P>
   So, since arriving in Kentucky a couple of weeks ago, Baffert
has returned to his quipster roots, joking to deflect the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the barn Tuesday, he walked briskly past a
crowd of reporters, then did a stagy double take and said, ``There
something goin' on here?''
</P>
<P>
   Only this: Baffert trying to do what four other trainers, four
jockeys, four owners and six breeders have failed to do in 124
years, which is to turn back-to-back Derby victories into
threepeats.
</P>
<P>
   Friends here say he's (begin ital)very(end ital) confident of
his chances to make history Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He'd prefer they didn't put it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think about history. I didn't think I'd get this
far,'' said Baffert, who grew up with horses in Arizona, learned to
train with quarterhorses at Los Alamitos Race Course in Orange
County, and started with one thoroughbred 10 years ago. ``I haven't
thought about the future. I don't set goals. You've got to keep the
excitement down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's going to be hard to do. &QL;

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ An 18-year-old woman who attended the prom
with Dylan Klebold three days before he and Eric Harris carried out
the assault at Columbine High School bought at least two of the
firearms used in the attack, the authorities said Tuesday as they
announced that 51 pipe bombs _ nearly twice as many as first
mentioned _ had been found in and around the school and at the
Harris home.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Robyn Anderson, who did not respond to requests for
comment, was interviewed by the police on Monday and released. She
bought two long guns at a local gun show she attended recently with
the two gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, her prom date, the
police said, and is being considered a witness, not a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson could face criminal charges if she knew how her
friends intended to use the weapons, officials said. ``If we feel
she has committed a criminal act,'' she will be returned to
custody, said Sgt. Jim Parr of the Jefferson County Sheriff's
Department. ``As far as I know, she's still cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Parr and Steve Davis, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department,
declined to say how many of the pipe bombs had been detonated or
which ones had been found in the school, the adjacent parking lot,
or at Harris' home.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sowell, a salesman at the Hugh M. Woods hardware store
here, said in an interview with KMGH, the local ABC affiliate, that
he had sold bomb-making materials, including propane tanks, screws
and nails, to Klebold and Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Sowell said they came in as many as a dozen times, wearing
trench coats and heavy boots, and once copied some keys. ``When I
asked them what are you using it for, they said, `school,''' Sowell
said. ``Maybe if I pushed it a little further, I would have learned
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the additional bombs came on the one-week
anniversary of the rampage here, which left one teacher and 14
students _ including the two gunmen _ dead and a community in shock
and mourning. This middle-class suburb south of Denver, and indeed
much of Colorado, came to halt at 11:21 a.m. on Tuesday to mark the
moment the shooting began, with a blackout on local television and
radio stations as church bells tolled 15 times, one for each of the
slain. Two more students were buried on Tuesday in funerals that
drew thousands, part of an overflowing calendar of grief that will
continue through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the first hints of normalcy began to appear, as
teachers met to plan next week's return to classes for Columbine's
nearly 2,000 students, and the girls' soccer team played the first
interscholastic athletic event since the devastating attack on the
school.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though the parents of the two young men who
plotted the massacre for at least a year remained in seclusion, new
details began to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who kept a journal outlining plans for the attack and
appears to have been the mastermind, had hoped to join the Marines
but was rejected because of a medical reason just days before he
and his best friend stormed onto campus carrying guns and bombs,
officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a retired Air Force pilot, Harris was recruited as
part of a routine telephone canvass and did well at a preliminary
interview, but was rejected after a meeting at his home April 15,
when his ``parents divulged a medical factor,'' according to Lt.
Jeff Sammons, a spokesman for the Marine Corps Recruiting Command
in Quantico, Va. The Marines would not disclose the medical reason,
but the parent of a friend of Harris' said the young man had been
on psychiatric medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Eric's case, the system worked,'' Sammons said. ``We caught
someone who didn't qualify for the Marine Corps.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reliance on certain prescription drugs, reasons
for a medical disqualification include asthma, flat feet, and some
allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Good, whose son Nathan Dykeman was a friend of both
Harris and Klebold, said that Harris had been seeing a
psychiatrist. ``Eric did have a few problems, Eric was in
counseling,'' Good said in an interview on Tuesday. ``When we heard
about it we were like, so, so he's seeing a psychiatrist? So the
parents think he needs someone to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   Good said that he has known Klebold and his parents for years,
and that no one could have predicted the attack. ``Now everyone
wants to point fingers, at the parents, at the schools _ the
Sheriff's Department should have known something, the school should
have known something,'' he said. ``The most horrifying thing of
this that people should be horrified and scared to death of, is
that these kids did not show any signs of this. It's terrifying. We
knew a different Dylan.''
</P>
<P>
   Good praised Susan and Thomas Klebold as excellent parents, and
criticized politicians and law-enforcement officials who have
questioned their responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was no broken family, this was no abusive family, no
anything,'' he said. ``These people spent time with their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Klebold considered his two sons his best friends, Good
said, noting that earlier this month he spent five days with Dylan
touring the University of Arizona, which the 17-year-old senior had
hoped to enroll in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked about the future and everything,'' he added.
``This guy knew his kid, and loved his kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Just three days before the attack, Dykeman attended the prom
with Klebold as part of a group of four couples who shared a
limousine, and saw Harris at the post-prom party. ``They all had a
great time,'' Good said. Though the parents of both shooters have
remained in seclusion, he said he had spoken to the Klebolds on
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're forgetting that family _ those two families are by
themselves,'' he said. ``Their life has been forever turned upside
down and it will never heal. They're looking for explanations,
they're looking through everything: Was that a sign, was that a
sign, did I miss something? They're second-guessing their entire
lives.''

</P>
<P>
   Agony was also on display at the funerals for Matthew Kechter, a
16-year-old sophomore on the football team, and Corey DePooter, 17,
a fly-fisherman who, like one of his killers, hoped to join the
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   DePooter was described as ``virtuous, selfless and heroic,'' and
said to have brought ``joy, happiness and occasional hilarity''
into those of the lives around him. The crowd sang, ``We Shall
Overcome,'' declaring, ``We are not afraid, we are not afraid, we
are not afraid today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the neatest guy,'' said Jenny Davis, who sat in front
of DePooter in language arts class. ``It hurts a lot that he's
gone, but I know he's always going to be here in spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kechter's funeral Mass, many of the mourners wore ribbons
with his football number, 70, on their lapels. A poster of John
Elway and several football jerseys were part of a floral shrine to
his memory in the church entranceway.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty burly boy-men stood as the Rev. Ken Leone urged the
Columbine High football squad to adopt Matthew's younger brother,
Adam, as their own. They recalled his smile, his sense of humor,
his hard work and his generous love for others. ``He had tremendous
pride in being a Columbine Rebel,'' Kechter's parents wrote in a
letter read at the service by his aunt and uncle. ``The best gift
you can give to Matt is finding the courage and the strength to
rebuild your school and your community.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the many funerals, school officials have decided to
restart classes on Monday rather than Thursday, as originally
planned. The students will attend their rival Chatfield High
School, which is three miles away, in an afternoon session, while
Chatfield students squeeze their day into five morning hours.
</P>
<P>
   With many of the students' backpacks and teachers' grade books
still inside Columbine, which is locked as a crime scene and said
to resemble a war zone, it is unclear how much academic work will
actually get done between now and graduation on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very sad, very tired, but they are very anxious to
get back with their students,'' Barbara Monseu, a school district
administrator, said of Columbine's 158 teachers. ``It's a very
important next step in the process of healing. They need to be back
together again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Monseu said it would be up to teachers whether to have tests
and assign papers, or simply hold bonding sessions and try as best
as they can to factor the disruption into grades. ``I believe it
will be a very smooth transition,'' she said. ``It will be a very
special graduation for these students.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition had already begun on Tuesday afternoon, where
about 75 fans gathered to watch the girls' varsity soccer team beat
the Golden Demons, 3-0. There was a moment of silence before
kickoff and the flag remained at half-staff on the field, where
there was increased security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to put all this into perspective and get back to
normal,'' said Jeanne Carrone, 17, a junior. ``It seems like the
longer we all spend thinking about it, the harder it will be to go
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Crawford, a 16-year-old junior, agreed. ``I'll be glad
when we can all go to games and dances,'' Crawford said, ``and not
be thinking about everything that's happened.''

THE NEW YORK TIMES BANS CIGARETTE ADS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joining a small group of newspapers, The New York
Times will ban cigarette advertising in its pages, effective
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper decided to impose the ban because of concerns
about the harmful effects of cigarette smoking, said Nancy Nielsen,
a spokeswoman for The New York Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deciding on the acceptance of advertising often means we have
to weigh the pros and cons of competing and sometimes conflicting
values,'' Ms. Nielsen said, adding that ``we don't want to expose
our readers to advertising that may be dangerous to their health.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year cigarette advertising amounted to less than 1 percent
of the newspaper's $1 billion in advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The last cigarette ad in the Times _ a full-page color
advertisement for Carlton cigarettes, made by the Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco unit of British American Tobacco PLC _ was
published on Monday in the Metro section of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy comes as the tobacco industry faces a prohibition
on cigarette billboard advertising this month, part of a $206
billion agreement the industry reached with 46 states to resolve
the states' claims for health costs. Some tobacco companies have
begun to look for other advertising alternatives, including
magazines and newspapers. They are already barred from television
and radio advertising.
</P>
<P>
   With the ban, the Times enters the anti-smoking side of a
long-running debate within American journalism. Most American
newspaper publishers contend that it is their duty to maintain a
free flow of information that requires they adopt as few
restrictions as possible on the advertising of legal products.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Smith, a spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson, said that The
Times' actions have symbolic, rather than practical, weight,
because it is a large national newspaper. More than a dozen other
American newspapers refuse cigarette advertising, among them The
Seattle Times, The Deseret News of Salt Lake City, and The
Christian Science Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder issued guidelines in 1995 to its chain of papers,
suggesting they avoid cigarette ads that use cartoon-like
characters or catchy slogans like ``alive with pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Times' new policy ``pathetic,'' Smith said, ``Isn't
it ironic that a publication that trumpets freedom of the press
would trample on the freedom of commercial expression?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new policy, the newspaper will still accept tobacco
company advertisements that do not promote smoking _ such as an ad
for a festival a company is sponsoring.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also does not accept advertising for a variety of
other legal products, like handguns, Mace or tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   The ban only applies to The New York Times, not any of the
company's other newspaper properties, which include The Boston
Globe. ``All of our newspaper properties have the autonomy to make
decisions about the advertising they accept,'' Ms. Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., publisher of the Times and chairman of
the company, said that he did not consider cigarette advertising a
free-speech issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment gives the press the right to publish what
it chooses to,'' he said. ``It doesn't force the press to publish
something, whether that's a news story or an advertisement. We
continue to support the right of other publications to run any
advertisement they feel is appropriate for their audience.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The military commander of NATO acknowledged
on Tuesday that five weeks of intensive allied bombing had failed
to reduce the size of the Yugoslav force in Kosovo or its
operations against Albanians there.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a press briefing, Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO commander,
insisted that the bombing had crippled the air defenses of the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and was gradually wearing
away what Yugoslav army and police forces needed to carry on their
attacks. But Clark said persistently unfavorable weather conditions
had kept the bombing from having full effect on the forces on the
ground in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bringing in reinforcements continually,'' Clark said of
Milosevic. ``If you actually added up what's there on any given
day, you might actually find out that he's strengthened his forces
in there. And that's going to be a phenomenon until we can further
cut the lines of supply and go more intensively against his
forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The briefing seemed to underscore the limitations of the allied
strategy, reaffirmed at last weekend's NATO summit meeting in
Washington, of using bombs but not ground troops to try to stop a
sweeping ``ethnic cleansing'' operation by Milosevic's Yugoslav
army, police and irregular paramilitary forces on the ground in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said these forces usually numbered around 40,000, about as
many as there were before the bombing started.
</P>
<P>
   Since the allies started the bombing on March 24, Clark said,
the Serb forces have driven 700,000 ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo
and left another 820,000 homeless inside their own country. And the
Serbs show no signs of stopping their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been reinforced in the last three or four days by an
influx of newly mobilized reservists to replace combat casualties,
and they've also been reinforced by the continuing assistance and
movement of elements of the Yugoslav 2nd Army, which is based in
Montenegro and has been fighting from across the border,'' the
general said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are systematically taking apart President Milosevic's
structure and power,'' Clark said. ``I can't give you a prediction
on how long he's going to endure this kind of punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the punishment the allies are meting out has been mitigated
by bad weather that have forced the allies to cancel more than 50
percent of all planned bombing missions on 20 of the 35 days since
the air campaign started last month.
</P>
<P>
   (Belgrade experienced heavy NATO bombing early Wednesday
morning, hours after NATO bombs had killed at least 20 civilians in
the southern Serbian city of Surdulica, Serbian state television
and Western news agencies said.
 &UR;  &LR; (Local officials said as many as 300 houses were destroyed in
Tuesday's attack on Surdulica, 200 miles south of this capital,
near the Bulgarian border; they also said 11 people were wounded
and 30 were missing.
</P>
<P>
   (NATO released a statement that acknowledged that its planes
struck a military target in the city, but did not directly answer
questions about civilian deaths. ``NATO aircraft carried out a
successful attack against an army barracks in Surdulica,'' the
statement said. ``NATO does not target civilians, but we cannot
exclude harm to civilians or to civilian property during our air
operations over Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   (If the Surdulica figures are confirmed, the strike would be
among the worst cases of civilian casualties, ranking with the
deaths of Albanian refugees in a column in Kosovo and the bombings
of a passenger train in Grdelica and of a residential area in
Aleksinac.)
</P>
<P>
   As the weather clears, Clark said, the attacks will be stepped
up. ``It's been only a fraction of what is to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming more success in attacking strategic targets that
underpin Milosevic's hold on power through the army and police
forces, Clark said that 4,423 bombing missions so far had rendered
Yugoslav air defenses ``ineffective,'' with more than 70 aircraft
destroyed and 25 percent to 40 percent of Yugoslav surface to air
missile batteries destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather has not kept the allies from attacking large fixed
targets, like the television tower on top of the 23-story
headquarters building of Milosevic's Socialist Party in Belgrade
that finally crumpled on Tuesday after the second air attack in a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has it kept them from launching guided missiles and guided
bombs against roads and bridges the Serbian army and police need to
move around the country, like the bridge across the Danube River at
Backa Palanka that Clark said had also been destroyed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the general said that the military communications network
had so many built-in redundancies that it had suffered only
``moderate to severe damage'' so far.
</P>
<P>
   And though allied bombing had destroyed virtually all of
Yugoslavia's ability to refine raw petroleum, Clark said, military
analysts believed that the air campaign had so far managed to
destroy only about a third of the army's military fuel reserves.
</P>
<P>
   To choke the flow of fuel even further, the alliance's military
authorities submitted detailed plans to NATO's political
decision-makers on Tuesday as to how allied warships would enforce
an embargo on oil and fuel deliveries by ship to Yugoslav ports in
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Allied defense ministers in Washington commissioned plans last
weekend for what they called a ``visit and search regime'' that
would allow allied navy ships to intercept and interrogate merchant
vessels bound for Bar and other Montenegrin ports about what they
were carrying.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 European Union countries called on European oil companies
last week to halt all oil deliveries to Yugoslavia, but in the
absence of a U.N. Security Council embargo, some allies,
principally France, do not see how NATO can impose a blockade on
all such shipments from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any visit and search regime, of course, has to have the
appropriate rules of engagement to be able to use the threat of
force,'' Clark said on Tuesday. ``It has to be an enforcement
regime. This will be, if it's approved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But whether France and the other allies would approve was not a
foregone conclusion on Tuesday, according to Western diplomats. One
said that France was also concerned about the effects of crippling
or cutting off the principal port of Montenegro, which, though it
is part of Yugoslavia, has distanced itself from Milosevic and his
actions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For Clark, the main thing was to stop what he said were as many
as 16 oil tankers a day offloading fuel and other supplies in Bar
around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be an effort to make it a cooperative
regime,'' he said. ``We're going to encourage shippers to contact
us for pre-clearance, but essentially a naval regime like this is
precisely what it suggests. We intend with any authority granted to
us to stop the onward flow of oil to Serbia.''

MAYOR DEFENDS ATTACK ON SCHOOLS BUT SAYS HE MEANT TO HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reacting to Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew's charges
that he was being ``reckless'' and ``destructive'' in attacking the
school system, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Tuesday that he was
trying to save the system, not destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, speaking to reporters at City Hall, said he did not
regret his remarks last week that the school system was
``dysfunctional'' and ``should be blown up.'' But he said that his
meaning had been misunderstood, that he was using a common
expression that had been used by Robert F. Wagner Jr., who was a
widely admired president of the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, in an uncharacteristically subdued mood, seemed to be
trying to tone down the war of words that has erupted in recent
weeks between him and Crew.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor did not give ground on the issues that have so
angered Crew: Giuliani's campaign to dismantle the Board of
Education, and to establish an experimental program of school
vouchers for 3,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am focused completely on how can we reform the school
system,'' Giuliani told reporters at City Hall. ``And so far, the
response of the chancellor and the school system has been a very
rigid defense of the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani defended his intentions a day after Crew issued a
passionate letter to 600 civic, educational and political leaders,
calling on them to fight the mayor's proposals and accusing
Giuliani of engaging in ``rhetoric of destruction'' that was an
insult to the school system and everyone in it.
</P>
<P>
   Crew declined to comment Tuesday on the mayor's remarks. But a
spokeswoman, Karen Crowe, said he hoped to talk to the mayor
privately and ``initiate a constructive dialogue about meaningful
change in the system.''

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ In a rare victory for environmentalists, a
Connecticut judge issued an order Tuesday barring the restarting of
the Millstone 2 nuclear reactor on Long Island Sound, just one day
before the generator was to produce commercial power for the first
time in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bishop, the general counsel of the Nuclear Energy
Institute, a trade group for the nuclear power industry, said this
was apparently the first time a court had prevented the restarting
of a nuclear plant once it had received its operating permit.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the plant, Northeast Utilities, fired up the
reactor Monday for low-power testing, and said it would continue to
run in that mode, despite the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Robert Hale of Superior Court in Hartford, granted a
temporary restraining order preventing Northeast Utilities from
fully restarting the plant until he rules on a lawsuit filed by a
Long Island environmental group, Fish Unlimited, and several other
organizations. The suit contends that the reactor would devastate
the local supply of flounder and other fish that are drawn into the
giant water intake pipes that are used to cool steam from the
generator.
</P>
<P>
   The suit maintains that bigger fish are killed when they smash
into screens designed to keep out trash and seaweed, and larvae die
after they are sucked through the grate.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups called the ruling a major victory because
it almost certainly pushes the commercial restart of the plant past
June 15, when the spawning season for flounder ends. In their suit,
the environmental groups claim that the number of breeding female
flounder in the Niantic River, near the plant, has been reduced to
4,000 in 1993 from 200,000 in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``A power plant is the biggest predator there is,'' said William
Smith, the executive director of Fish Unlimited, based on Shelter
Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The Critical Mass Energy Project, part of Ralph Nader's
organization, Public Citizen, said the ruling raised hopes that the
plant would never reopen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer the reactor is shut down, hopefully the management
at NU will read the handwriting on the wall and realize it's
pouring good money after bad to restart an aged reactor,'' said
James Riccio, a staff attorney for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Millstone 2, one of the country's 103 active reactors, began
operating in 1975 and has been shut down since Feb. 20, 1996. The
reactor sits between two others. Millstone 1 is being
decommissioned, and Millstone 3 is operating. The plants were
ordered shut down by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1996
because of design, safety and paperwork problems.
</P>
<P>
   At Hillyer's Tackle Shop, near the reactors at Waterford in
southeastern Connecticut, the news was greeted with whistles. Jon
Hillyer, the owner, said that in the late 1960's two anglers could
easily catch 20 to 40 flounder in an afternoon. Now, they might
come back with two. ``That plant is like a big vacuum cleaner,
sucking up Long Island Sound,'' Hillyer said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Northeast Utilities, Terrence McIntosh, said the
ruling could lead to blackouts or brownouts this summer, if the
company could not meet its power needs. One alternative, he said,
would be to fire up one of its dormant fossil-fuel plants, which
would mean more air pollution. McIntosh also defended the company's
efforts to protect fish, saying Northeast Utilities uses ``the best
technology available to minimize the effect on the marine life out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe that Millstone Unit 2 is a safe plant and
should be able to operate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate solution to the fish-killing problem is a cooling
tower, which recirculates the water and uses air to cool it. That
could cost as much as $80 million. But an intermediate method,
called a fish return system, would cost just $2 million. It uses a
ladder and a sluiceway to return fish that are caught on the
screens. McIntosh said the company was ``strongly considering
that.'' Such a system is currently in operation on Millstone 3.
</P>
<P>
   Smith of Fish Unlimited criticized the company for starting up
the plant, even at low power, on Monday, at a time when Judge Hale
was hearing evidence in the group's suit against the utility.
Calling the move ``incredibly arrogant,'' Smith said: ``They're
killing an incredible number of fish right now. In good faith, they
should power down.'' Northeast Utilities said it would not do so,
because it wanted to stick as closely to its schedule as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Hale offered few clues to the reasons for issuing the temporary
restraining order, writing that the environmental groups ``have
made out a prima facie case,'' but adding that the utility also had
presented ``a strong front.'' Northeast Utilities said it was
disappointed by the ruling, but would abide by it and would not
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer for Riverkeeper, a group
dedicated to cleaning Long Island Sound, said the ruling was a
pleasant surprise, since utilities have so many resources that they
are hard to fight. ``If a fisherman out on Long Island Sound caught
an undersized flounder out of season, they would be fined $250 a
fish,'' Kennedy said. ``Millstone wants the right to break the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups, which include Don't Waste Connecticut,
based in New Haven, and three Long Island organizations, concede
that the fish issue is not unique to nuclear plants; fossil-fuel
generators pose a similar risk.
</P>
<P>
   The state's utility-deregulation law requires the company to put
its nuclear assets up for auction by 2004, but McIntosh said the
company planned to bid on the Millstone plants. ``They're a
valuable asset to the company,'' he said.

PAYDAY FOR VALHOL GIVES HIM DERBY SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Valhol, the Arkansas Derby winner whose jockey
may or may not have used an illegal electric device during the
race, will get to run in the Kentucky Derby after all, although not
with the same jockey.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Rock, Ark., Monday, Pulaski County Circuit Judge John
Plegge ordered the Arkansas Racing Commission to pay Valhol's
owner, Jim Jackson, the $300,000 winner's purse from the Arkansas
Derby despite arguments by the commission that the Kentucky Derby
would be tainted if Valhol ran in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Valhol will now have sufficient stakes earnings to qualify for
Saturday's Kentucky Derby, which is expected to have a full field
of 20 horses for its 125th running.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas racing officials had withheld the $300,000 from Jackson
while they investigated whether Valhol's jockey, Billy Patin,
applied an illegal electrical device to the horse to make it run
faster in the April 10 race at Oaklawn.
</P>
<P>
   Plegge admitted he knew nothing about horse racing, but said
that state racing officials were denying Jackson a chance at the
Kentucky Derby when there was ``absolutely no evidence'' that he
had done anything wrong in the Arkansas Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge said it pretty plain,'' said Valhol's trainer,
Dallas Keen, who remained here training the horse while Jackson was
in Arkansas. ``We've got the money and will enter the horse. We're
glad this is finally over.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson could not be reached for comment, though one of his
lawyers, Jeff Kuebler, described him as ecstatic. With the money
from the Arkansas Derby, Valhol vaults from 22d to 12th on the
earnings list of probable starters. Because more than 20 horses
appear ready to enter the Kentucky Derby, stakes earnings becomes
the cutoff to determine who gets in and who doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   As Wednesday's entry deadline approaches, the fate of Etbaur,
who is the 21st horse on the earnings list, is in the hands of Bob
Baffert, who is trying to win an unprecedented third consecutive
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert will enter two colts, General Challenge and Prime
Timber, who are the probable favorites in the race. But he said he
may also enter the filly Excellent Meeting. The filly is already
slated for the Kentucky Oaks on Friday as the likely second choice
in the race, but she might run against the colts instead, depending
on the post position draw.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if Excellent Meeting is entered in the Derby and
then scratched, it wouldn't help Etbaur or its owners, Kaaren and
Hays Biggs of Springdale, Ark. Once the field is drawn Wednesday,
Churchill Downs does not allow replacements for scratched horses.
</P>
<P>
   One definite is that Valhol's jockey, Patin, won't be riding in
the world's most famous race. He has a hearing before Arkansas
racing stewards on May 5 dealing with the buzzer allegations and
has returned to his native Louisiana to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Willie Martinez will ride Valhol, and Tuesday he was
aboard for a crisp 49-second workout over four furlongs. ``Our
horse worked real good today and he did it easy,'' Keen said.
``Willie was excited. I was excited. Jackson is excited. We're
ready for the race.''

LUKAS EMBRACES ELECTION INTO HALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ It was maybe 10 years too late by his own
reckoning, but the trainer D. Wayne Lukas was finally elected to
thoroughbred racing's Hall of Fame Tuesday _ as he was preparing
two horses for his 19th consecutive Kentucky Derby, three of which
he has won, and as he was approaching the historic pinnacle of $200
million in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Ten gray years became the center of a dispute in recent years,
even while Lukas was yielding his role in the center of the Derby
spotlight to Bob Baffert. The Hall of Fame stipulates that a
trainer must be licensed for 25 years to qualify. Lukas insisted
that he was training both quarter horses and thoroughbreds in the
middle '60s, when he was also coaching basketball in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute became moot Wednesday at Churchill Downs, where
Lukas won the Kentucky Derby in 1988 with Winning Colors, in 1995
with Thunder Gulch and in 1996 with Grindstone, and where he will
shoot the works again on Saturday in the 125th Derby with Cat Thief
and Charismatic. So, were bygones at last bygones?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think bitter is kind of a harsh word,'' said Lukas, dressed
in his best winner's-circle style and, at 63, looking as fit as his
race horses. ``The Hall of Fame is bigger than any individual. I
had my reasons for being upset. But this is an honor. And I think
now that I'm in, I'd be less of a person if I didn't embrace it.''
</P>
<P>
   Length of service apart, Lukas has achieved more than any other
trainer in history: he has trained 19 national champions and won 13
Breeders' Cup races; both are records. He has led all trainers in
earnings in 14 of the last 17 years. He won six consecutive Triple
Crown races, starting in 1994 and ending in 1996. He has won the
Preakness four times and the Belmont three times. And he has won 7
percent of all graded stakes run in North America over the last 20
years, 513 entering this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1974, when the Hall of Fame started counting, Lukas has
saddled 20,038 horses and won 3,725 times. When he finally appeared
on the ballot this year, for the first time, he was swept into the
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   At the induction ceremony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., on Aug. 9,
Lukas will be joined by Russell Baze, the Northern California
jockey who led the nation's jockeys in victories five years in a
row, and by three star horses from the past: Exceller, Miesque and
Gun Bow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hall of Fame is the Hall of Fame,'' Lukas said. ``Their
read was that I didn't train horses in the early 1960's. Yes, there
were some breaks when I was training both quarter horses and
thoroughbreds. But they date my work from 1974. So be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he basked in the glow of his work, which revolutionized the
sport. He trained horses on a national scale with stables at major
tracks run by deputies who became clones of the well-dressed,
well-spoken master back in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody got here by themselves,'' he said. ``I had some great
clients, and they gave me their horses and backed it up with their
bankrolls. There also were six of my guys, our alumni, out there on
their own now: Mark Hennig, Kieran McLaughlin, Dallas Stewart,
Bobby Barnett, Todd Pletcher and Randy Bradshaw. I'm proud of them.
Two of them are going to lead horses against me Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant Stewart, with Kimberlite Pipe, and Barnett, with Answer
Lively. But the trainer most feared by Lukas and everybody else is
Baffert, who won the last two runnings of the Derby, missed a third
by a nose and approaches this Derby with the two favorites, General
Challenge and Prime Timber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob's on a ride,'' Lukas said of the trainer who now
overshadows him. ``He's enjoying the best, and so be it. It's
difficult to get here, and more difficult to sustain. We had a
great ride, too. We got on a run in the Triple Crown. But these
things run in cycles. Nobody gets here by themselves. You need the
clients. You need to give them a chance to get their money back.
Most of all, you need the horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was asked about the possibility that the already loaded
Baffert might also start the standout filly Excellent Meeting in
the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I wouldn't run Excellent Meeting in the Derby,'' Lukas
said. ``It's one thing to have a filly cruising in front of 19
colts. It's another to surround your filly with 19 colts for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never just went to the Derby with a filly; we tested them
against colts at Santa Anita. I like horses who've been tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not money. It's not some genius on a computer figuring
marriages made in heaven. It's the horse. You've got to have the
horse.''

 &HT;    Florida deputy arrested for bank robbery
 &HT;    By Lillian Weis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Palm Beach County sheriff's deputies
followed the license tag of a bank robbery suspect to a suburban
Lake Worth home Tuesday, and found a Broward County deputy already
there _ with red dye on his clothes and in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Broward Sheriff's deputy Ramon Notario, 40, was arrested on one
count of bank robbery and was being held at the Palm Beach County
Jail Tuesday night without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said a man entered a NationsBank branch at about
12:30 p.m. He told tellers he had a gun. He demanded money.
</P>
<P>
   They handed him a bag of cash with a dye pack, timed to explode
onto the bills and the suspect. He drove away, but a witness wrote
down the tag of the man's beige Toyota, Palm Beach County Sheriff's
spokesman Paul Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County Sheriff's deputy Christine Kimball was waiting
in line at a nearby McDonald's drive-thru when the police radio
announced the robbery. She left the line, sped to the bank, then
radioed the tag to dispatchers.
</P>
<P>
   Other deputies spotted the car, stained inside. Notario was at
home with dye-stained clothes, authorities said.

   Notario, a road patrol deputy who covers southern Broward
County, was suspended Tuesday, Broward Sheriff's spokesman Kirk
Englehardt said. He will be paid only for the next three days, in
accordance with a union contract, Englehardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Notario, a Broward County deputy for 10 years, had been on paid
sick leave since September for medical reasons, Engelhardt said. He
would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said Notario was injured in a diving accident several
months ago and has stayed at home since then.
</P>
<P>
   They described him as helpful and friendly, lending tools to
others, for example, and helping one neighbor with computer
problems. He was quiet, they said, spending much of his free time
with his wife and young son and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   About three years ago, Notario sold vacuum cleaners to others in
the neighborhood, neighbor Luis Ramos said. He told some neighbors
he wanted to leave police work, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that prompted anyone to think he would do
anything like that,'' he said. ``Especially someone like him who's
been in the police force. It's shocking.''

 &HT;    Violent games come under fire after Colorado shootings
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The shooting deaths of 14 students and a teacher
at a high school in Littleton, Colo., last week is fueling a
renewed focus on violence in video games after it was learned that
the two teen-agers responsible for the attack were avid players of
Doom and Duke Nuke 'Em, popular ultra-violent games.
</P>
<P>
   Game companies, including some of Austin's largest, are keeping
quiet in an effort to avoid fanning the controversy, although a
spokesman said the industry is being scapegoated in the search for
a rational explanation for a terrible event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Video games didn't teach these kids to be neo-Nazis. They
didn't teach them to make pipe bombs,'' said Doug Lowenstein,
president of the Interactive Digital Software Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Hertzler, chief executive of Blue Byte Software, a
local game company, said the industry has gone too far. ``I think
that the game industry is pushing it. It's almost like game makers
are trying to make a name for themselves by making content more
violent and twisted than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Hertzler, whose company creates fantasy and strategy games, said
the violence and gore in some games push the limits beyond even the
worst horror movies.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Origin Systems, Digital Anvil in Austin and
Acclaim Entertainment, parent of Iguana Entertainment here, said
they had received numerous phone calls in the wake of the Littleton
shootings but declined to comment. Some of the imagery and sound in
games like Doom, Requiem: Avenging Angel, Unreal and Quake II, a
genre of games called ``first-person shooters,'' rival the most
nightmarish work Hollywood special-effects artists can conjure. A
minimal story line often masks the true purpose of the game:
navigate dark gothic tunnels, sewers or airbases destroying nearly
everything that breathes in your path. Torsos are shredded by
bullets and plasma rifles. Limbs are shot out of their sockets.
Heads are blasted off like golf balls from tees.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate reward is often escape or a final battle with a
nearly unbeatable monster. The games are fast-paced and slick,
designed to quicken the player's pulse, horrify the senses with a
feeling of impending doom and throw the meanest and ugliest
monsters at the user. They make Mortal Kombat, which inspired
congressional hearings in 1993 and a voluntary industry rating
system, look like Ms. Pac Man.
</P>
<P>
   The game industry has soared to $5.5 billion on sales of 200
million games a year. Lowenstein said the outcry over the
first-person shooter games is disproportionate to the genre's place
in the market. He said such games account for only 8 percent of the
market, lagging behind racing games, flight simulators and strategy
games. The best-selling CD-ROM game of all time is Myst, a
relatively non-violent fantasy. However, few games of that type
have duplicated its success or that of the multiple incarnations of
Quake, Doom and Duke Nuke' Em.
</P>
<P>
   Origin Systems has tried to compete with shooters by offering
games in which virtues beyond brute strength are celebrated and
violence has an identifiable consequence. But when Origin launched
an elaborate interactive world called Ultima Online about two years
ago, the game was plagued for months by players who banded together
and killed others, disrupting the balance of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Colorado shootings, game makers were bracing for
another round of criticism: Two weeks ago, parents of three girls
killed in a 1997 Kentucky high school shooting filed a $130 million
lawsuit against several game companies and the producers of the
film ``The Basketball Diaries,'' which they say influenced Michael
Carneal to commit the murders. Acclaim is one of the defendants
named in the suit over games it publishes including Turok: Dinosaur
Hunter, another first-person shooter. Many players, however, see
the games as mindless escape and say they can separate the gruesome
fantasies from reality.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Jackson, a student at Our Lady's Family Center, an Austin
organization for at-risk youth, has been playing video games since
he was 7. Some of his favorites are Duke Nuke'Em and Doom, the same
games played by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the teens
responsible for the Colorado killings.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says he doesn't think video games contributed to the
Colorado attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play them all the time, and they don't do anything,'' the
17-year-old said. ``It's just an excuse to blame it on. People can
be influenced by a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years, U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-. Conn., has
released a yearly ``video game report card'' alerting parents to
violence in games. Few studies, however, have examined the
long-term effects of violence in games on children.
</P>
<P>
   That may change this fall, when University of Texas at Austin
researchers release their findings from a new study. UT's Center
for Research on the Influences of Television on Children conducted
a survey on the effects of 700 video games on 3,500 children in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Professor John Wright, director of the center, said that
although the study is not yet concluded, the group has found
parallels between video game violence and television violence,
which past studies have shown encourages aggression in kids. ``The
general findings with television is absolutely rock solid,'' he
said. ``The link between television and violence is as strong as
the link between smoking and cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright points out, however, that video games and television
violence alone are not enough to compel a child to violence. ``The
main cause undoubtedly is something more powerful than that. But
(video games and television) are natural amplifiers. Out on the
edge, there's a handful of people who are over the threshold and
ready to commit an act of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright favors parental control over censorship. But he worries
that Littleton won't be the last incident of its kind and that
video games play a part, however small, in the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bit in Mortal Kombat in which you beat up a woman,
are told to 'finish her' and then stick your hand through her chest
and pull out her heart. Then you are congratulated. That is just
about as formulaic a recipe for psychopathy than anything I've
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Becky Taylor, president of Terrace Mountain Systems, an Austin
software consulting company, said she keeps violent games away from
her 8-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   She lets him play games like Flight Simulator, which ``engages
your brain'' and teaches dexterity, but Star Wars is as close to a
shoot-em-ups as she permits.
</P>
<P>
   Working in software, Taylor said she's been disappointed that
other genres have not matured as rapidly as the popular, violent
games. ``I think attention needs to be paid to this blurring of the
line between reality and the computer generated realm. The energies
and fantasies reinforced by some of these games are not positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Taylor feels she's responsible for what's on her
son's screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buck stops with mom and dad,'' Taylor said. ``My son
doesn't even know what Doom is.''

LOIS RIVKIN, 69; LINKED SCHOOLS AND MUSEUMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Colo., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lois Borwick Herman Rivkin, the founder and president
of an organization linking business organizations and cultural
institutions to New York City Public Schools, died Tuesday at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rivkin had lymphoma for the last six and a half years, her
husband, Donald Rivkin, said. Though she had undergone eight
courses of painful chemotherapy, she continued her work for the
organization, Friends of the Public Schools, until early this year.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew noted that during her
illness, she displayed the same energy she had shown in 1988 when
she founded the organization that sought to introduce public school
students to the city's cultural and business communities and vice
versa. ``After each hospitalization, she would reappear regularly
in my office and in so many classrooms that indeed, she seemed to
be everywhere,'' said Crew. ``Children were Lois Rivkin's reason to
live.``
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Friends of the Public Schools grew out of volunteer
work Mrs. Rivkin did in promoting the city's lesser-known cultural
attractions during the Statue of Liberty centennial in 1986. At
that time she organized a group called the View from the Torch,
which produced maps and treasure hunts to spotlight hundreds of
museums, libraries, parks and cultural sites in all five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Though she was born in Denver and attended Goucher College in
Baltimore, she arrived in New York in 1952 to work for the Carnegie
Endowment for Peace and very quickly became what her husband
described as ``the most passionate of New Yorkers.`` Her
involvement with the View From the Torch project convinced her that
the there was very little interaction between business and arts
communities and the public schools. She committed herself to
establishing such ties, certain that they would enrich the entire
city.
</P>
<P>
   Among its initiatives, Friends of the Public Schools has
organized an annual display of art by public school students at
Sotheby's. It has arranged to have student chefs cater corporate
conferences and civic observances and arranged for students to
present choral and instrumental concerts throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rivkin was also a founder of the National Museum of Women
in the Arts, and in 1976 she served as the coordinator of
volunteers at the Democratic National Convention in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband of 45 years, she is survived by two
sons, David of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Daniel of Paris; a daughter,
Judith Davison of New York; a brother, Harry Herman of Washington,
and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   She had received a number of honors including citations from the
city and the Board of Education. On Feb. 16, the Citizens Committee
for New York City presented her with a special New Yorker for New
York Award. Some 1,200 people turned out that night, and one of the
attendees noted how vital Mrs. Rivkin appeared despite her illness.
``She even danced,'' he said.

CAO HUOXING, 75; WROTE PATRIOTIC CHINESE MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cao Huoxing, a Chinese farmer's son who wrote a Communist song
that has become familiar to hundreds of millions of Chinese, died
April 16 in Tianjin, in northern China, the official New China News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   He was 75 and had been chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau
of Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Cao was born in Pingshan county in Hebei Province, in northern
China. He was a composer from the age of 16 and reportedly wrote
more than 1,500 songs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943 he wrote the song for which he is best known, ``Without
the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China.'' At that time,
during World War II, China was divided into areas controlled by the
Japanese invaders, the Nationalist government and Communist forces.
The Communists won a civil war with the Nationalists and took power
in all of mainland China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The words are somewhat less impassioned than the text of the
song by Tien Han and Nie Erh that was approved as the Communist
national anthem in 1949. The anthem, originally a call to arms
against the Japanese, includes the lines, ``For we throw ourselves
with courage on the enemy/Forward, forward, forward!''
</P>
<P>
   The words of the more solemn song that was adopted in 1929 as
Nationalist China's national anthem, based on words spoken by Sun
Yat-sen with music by Cheng Mao-yun, include, ``Be earnest and
brave, your country to save/One heart, one soul, one mind, one
goal!''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 Cao set off with 25 artists of the China Tianjin Song
and Dance Troupe to appear at music festivals in Britain and
elsewhere outside his homeland. The troupe's repertory included the
nonpolitical dance numbers ``Flower Drum Dance'' and ``Merry Golden
Fish.''

 &HT;    Representatives square off on tax cuts
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Republican legislators backing a plan to
increase teacher pay and cut school property taxes are misleading
Texans when they say the proposal would cut taxes by $1 billion, a
key House Democrat said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Paul Sadler, who's overseeing similar proposals in the
House, said the GOP proposal scheduled for Senate debate today
would actually cut taxes by no more than $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the money, Sadler said, might prevent future tax
increases, but won't cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it can _ by any definition _ be called $1
billion in tax cuts,'' Sadler, from Henderson, said of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The amount and nature of the tax cuts is key because Gov. George
W. Bush, who's expected to seek the GOP presidential nomination,
has been pushing for $2 billion in property tax cuts. He's likely
to tout his tax-cutting efforts in the presidential race should he
decide to run.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, a spokeswoman for the governor, said whether the
pending Senate bill cuts taxes by $1 billion or not is a matter
between Sadler and Sen. Teel Bivins, the bill's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, she said, is that Bush wants to cut property
taxes and still backs his $2 billion proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins, R-Amarillo, is standing behind his bill, Senate Bill 4,
and its $1 billion in property tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler late Monday outlined a plan to cut local school property
taxes by about $500 million, giving more money to schools and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said he's unlikely to support any plan with less than $1
billion in property tax cuts, in part because fellow Senate
Republicans wouldn't back it.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's optimistic about a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But the differences between the proposals could have
far-reaching implications, said Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount
Pleasant. He raised the possibility that the issue won't be decided
before the end of the session May 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of issue that has all the ingredients of
special session,'' he said. ``Already Bivins feels they have
compromised as far as they can go. (Sadler's) plan would imply
having to compromise more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said his plan is only an idea and the numbers in it could
change. But he believes senators are amenable to a plan that has
less than $1 billion in property tax cuts because that is what is
in Senate Bill 4.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said many of the so-called tax cut measures in Bivins'
bill might prevent local school property taxes from going up, but
wouldn't lower taxes. He added that those measures can be called
tax prevention or tax relief, but not tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins originally filed a plan to cut local school property
taxes by about $1.35 billion and to increase teachers' take-home
pay by $1 billion through an increase in the state's share of
teachers' retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   That plan couldn't muster the support needed to get to full
Senate debate and Bivins agreed to the pending proposal. He says it
puts $1.7 billion in additional money toward teachers' compensation
and $1 billion toward local school property tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said only a portion of the tax cut plan actually cuts
existing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the property tax portions of Senate Bill 4 would
work:
</P>
<P>
   $600 million would help schools pay debt related to existing
school buildings. Sadler says that counts as true tax cuts because
districts with high tax rates would have to lower them by an amount
equal to the new state dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Districts that have relatively lower tax rates also would have
to reduce their rates, though not by a dollar-for-dollar amount,
Bivins said.
</P>
<P>
   $150 million would help schools with new building debt. Sadler
said lawmakers in 1997 put $200 million toward new building debt,
but didn't call it tax cuts. Bush this year proposed another $200
million for the program and listed it as new education spending,
not tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   $125 million, contained in the proposed state budget, would
prevent schools from losing local tax dollars because of declining
property values. That is related to the drop in oil and gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   $100 million would keep schools from losing money because of a
higher homestead tax exemption enacted in 1997. Sadler said
lawmakers approved similar spending in 1997 and didn't call it tax
cuts. He also said the program prevents tax increases but doesn't
cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   $50 million would go to help schools that are growing more
quickly that others. Sadler said that helps districts avoid raising
taxes but doesn't cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler applauded the ``old debt'' portion of the bill because
it's likely to help hundreds of districts.
</P>
<P>
   He warned, however, that the rest of the ``tax cut'' measures
don't cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a right to his opinion,'' Bivins said.

FOR NOW, MAYOR LOSES HIS GRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will not be doing any
gladhanding for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, it seems, injured his hand while _ what else? _
shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tuesday that a man with a too-firm grip had aggravated a
two-week-old injury he had been trying to ignore. ``I injured it
walking out of the bathroom,'' the mayor said Tuesday. ``I didn't
do anything about it, and I kept shaking hands.''
</P>
<P>
   As any elected official would.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened is, on Sunday, at Yankee Stadium, while I was at
the Joe DiMaggio memorial, I shook about 100 hands, and it started
swelling up,'' the mayor said. ``One particular man actually did
this to me,'' the mayor said. ``I don't know who he is.'' But he
knew the man's too-firm handshake the moment he felt it. ``He
grabbed my hand in exactly the place it had been injured and I
virtually made a slight little moan and almost fainted.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had a doctor examine his hand on Monday. The
diagnosis, as relayed by the mayor: ``Something happened to the
ligament.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor's advice was to forgo heavy handshaking for a while.
Giuliani, a former prosecutor, had his own lawyerly strategy for
what to do until he gets his grip strength back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thinking of putting in a workman's compensation claim
because part of my job description is that I have to shake hands,''
the mayor said. He added, ``I can't say that I was injured in the
act of shaking hands, but my injury was substantially made much
worse by shaking hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Glamour Amid the Stacks
</P>
<P>
   It has been 75 years since the Morgan Library first opened its
very heavy doors to the public. On Monday the Morgan celebrated its
anniversary by handing out magenta feather boas and gardenia
boutonnieres and escorting its newly accessorized A-list guests in
for drinks (martinis, Manhattans, cosmopolitans and Champagne) and
hors d'oeuvres (oysters, tiny savory pastries and caviar).
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women shed the boas along the way, but not Marian
Frelinghuysen, a longtime donor to the Morgan. She said she was
keeping hers to give to her granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   At the dinner that followed, one table became the
everybody-loves-Brooke table, as in Brooke Astor, the nonagenarian
philanthropist. Charles Pierce, the director of the Morgan, said,
``Brooke was extraordinarily kind to Barbara and me when we first
moved to New York.'' Frederick A. Melhado, sitting next to Mrs.
Astor, observed, ``It's still Edith Wharton's town. Nothing has
changed. Everybody still knows everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer stopped by (on his fourth engagement of the
evening) and chatted with Mrs. Astor for a few minutes. Then, after
he made a short speech about the Morgan (``This library has been a
jewel for all of New York''), the music started. Several couples
demonstrated the Charleston. Mrs. Astor and Melhado danced a few
turns of a somewhat slower step, and left.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Curtin
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly the most formidable dressing room I've ever
been in,'' the playwright and performer David Hare said.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, it was his own dressing room after the Monday
evening performance of his one-man show, ``Via Dolorosa,'' at the
Booth Theater on West 45th Street. Two women who figured in his
performance, Leah Rabin and Judi Dench, had been in the audience
and had gone backstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Via Dolorosa'' touches on the assassination of Mrs. Rabin's
husband, Yitzhak Rabin, who was the Prime Minister of Israel. ``The
audience did not know she was there,'' Hare said, ``but the most
extraordinary respectful silence fell over the house. I think they
sensed my own feeling about what an extraordinarily moving moment
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Miss Dench, Hare usually mentions her in the opening
minutes of the show. The line usually gets a laugh. On Monday, it
drew applause. That tipped off Hare, who had not known that she
would be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been saying to me for some time now that I must write a
play in which we can act,'' he said. After seeing ``Via Dolorosa,''
though, she seemed to have cooled on that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Mmm, I don't think I want to be in a play with you.
You don't act. There's not a single choice you make in the course
of an evening that any professional actor would make. It's moving,
but I don't feel that what I do and what you do have any
professional kinship.'''

UCLA'S REDSHIRTS BLOOM IN SPRING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The safeties are struggling, no quarterback has
emerged, and two players have retired. But it hasn't been a lost
spring for UCLA, not at all, because several redshirt freshmen from
the heralded class of '98 have impressed coach Bob Toledo:
</P>
<P>
   _Defensive end Rusty Williams. Playing for the suspended Santi
Hall, Williams has continued the highly charged play that made him
scout-team defensive player of the year in '98. His energy is
limitless _ the coaches say he has ``a great motor'' _ and it's
contagious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been real impressed with Rusty,'' cornerback Marques
Anderson said. ``He brings a lot of positive energy.''
</P>
<P>
   _Offensive tackle Blake Worley and guard Mike Saffer. Worley was
handed Kris Farris' former spot because of attrition and injuries,
and he's made the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the season started today, he'd be the starting left
tackle,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Saffer is merely UCLA's most gifted lineman since Jonathan
Ogden.
</P>
<P>
   _Defensive tackle Steve Morgan, who has made a smooth conversion
from guard. At 295 pounds, he gives the Bruins four massive
defensive tackles _ more than they've had, combined, in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   _Cornerback Joe Hunter, who has recovered from a tentative start
to challenge for a spot in the rotation. He has good speed and hits
harder than his 170-pound frame would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times early in the the spring when he was a little
unsure and played softer than we'd like,'' defensive coordinator
Bob Field said. ``But as he builds confidence, you can see he'll be
a good player.''
</P>
<P>
   _Defensive tackle Sean Phillips. He redshirted last season while
classmates Anthony Fletcher and Ken Kocher played as true freshmen.
But the discrepancy in development had nothing to do with ability
and everything to do with age: Phillips did not turn 18 until
January, making him UCLA's youngest player by four months.
</P>
<P>
   Stronger and more mature emotionally, Phillips has shown the
form _ albeit inconsistently _ that made him a Parade All-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made (begin ital)a lot(end ital) of progress,'' Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees: Ramogi Huma, a junior linebacker, was forced to quit
because of lingering hip problems. Mark Verti, a junior fullback,
has a herniated disc in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Both departures leave the Bruins thin at those positions. Huma
is the second linebacker to quit since last season, following
oft-injured Mike Wiley. Without Verti, the Bruins are searching for
a reserve fullback behind starter Durell Price.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stanley and Adam Geitner are the only candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both have made a lot of progress,'' Toledo said. ``They're
good blockers and they can catch the ball, and they're good on
special teams.''

 &HT;    26,990 see Braves blow lead in 8th
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The most dependable component of the Atlanta bullpen
shifted Tuesday night. Rudy Seanez coughed one up.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Pirates stopped a four-game losing streak at
Seanez's expense, scoring three times in the eighth inning for a
5-3 victory in an unceremonious opener to a nine-game homestand.
The Braves lost for just the third time in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by a run, Pirates tied it 3-3 in the eighth when Mike
Benjamin drew the night's first walk off starter Odalis Perez to
lead off the inning. Benjamin stole second and subsequently scored
on pinch-hitter Keith Osik's single up the middle. Perez was pulled
two outs later with men on first and second, having allowed seven
hits with two walks (both in the eighth) and five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Seanez threw just one pitch, which Kevin Young singled to left
to bring in Pat Meares for a 4-3 lead. Jason Kendall, staggering
through an 0-for-15 slump, drove Seanez's third pitch into left to
score Brian Giles for a two-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played before 26,990, the smallest crowd in Turner
Field's three-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Schmidt, who had beaten the Braves only once in five
starts since Atlanta sent him to Pittsburgh in the Denny Neagle
trade, pitched well early. He limited the Braves to two hits (both
by Brian Jordan) through the first five innings, no little feat
against a club that just hit .305 on its recent extended road trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves got to him in the sixth with three straight
singles. The second, which broke an 0-for-10 streak by Bret Boone,
moved Otis Nixon to third, where Chipper Jones drove him in for a
2-1 lead with a chopper up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates might have avoided further damage when Javy Lopez
hit a potential inning-ending double play ball to third baseman Ed
Sprague. But he threw the ball into right field for his sixth
error, allowing Boone to score a a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan got the Braves started by continuing with his torrid
start. He doubled in the second inning and tripled in the fourth,
giving him 14 extra-base hits in his first 19 games as a Brave.

FOR NOW, MAYOR LOSES HIS GRIP  
 GLAMOUR AMID THE STACKS 
BACKSTAGE WITH HARE
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will not be doing any
gladhanding for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, it seems, injured his hand while _ what else? _
shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tuesday that a man with a too-firm grip had aggravated a
two-week-old injury he had been trying to ignore. ``I injured it
walking out of the bathroom,'' the mayor said Tuesday. ``I didn't
do anything about it, and I kept shaking hands.''
</P>
<P>
   As any elected official would.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened is, on Sunday, at Yankee Stadium, while I was at
the Joe DiMaggio memorial, I shook about 100 hands, and it started
swelling up,'' the mayor said. ``One particular man actually did
this to me,'' the mayor said. ``I don't know who he is.'' But he
knew the man's too-firm handshake the moment he felt it. ``He
grabbed my hand in exactly the place it had been injured and I
virtually made a slight little moan and almost fainted.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had a doctor examine his hand on Monday. The
diagnosis, as relayed by the mayor: ``Something happened to the
ligament.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor's advice was to forgo heavy handshaking for a while.
Giuliani, a former prosecutor, had his own lawyerly strategy for
what to do until he gets his grip strength back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thinking of putting in a workman's compensation claim
because part of my job description is that I have to shake hands,''
the mayor said. He added, ``I can't say that I was injured in the
act of shaking hands, but my injury was substantially made much
worse by shaking hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Magenta Boas and Caviar
</P>
<P>
   It has been 75 years since the Morgan Library first opened its
very heavy doors to the public. On Monday the Morgan celebrated its
anniversary by handing out magenta feather boas and gardenia
boutonnieres and escorting its newly accessorized A-list guests in
for drinks (martinis, Manhattans, cosmopolitans and Champagne) and
hors d'oeuvres (oysters, tiny savory pastries and caviar).
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women shed the boas along the way, but not Marian
Frelinghuysen, a longtime donor to the Morgan. She said she was
keeping hers to give to her granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   At the dinner that followed, one table became the
everybody-loves-Brooke table, as in Brooke Astor, the nonagenarian
philanthropist. Charles Pierce, the director of the Morgan, said,
``Brooke was extraordinarily kind to Barbara and me when we first
moved to New York.'' Frederick Melhado, sitting next to Mrs. Astor,
observed, ``It's still Edith Wharton's town. Nothing has changed.
Everybody still knows everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., stopped by (on his fourth
engagement of the evening) and chatted with Mrs. Astor for a few
minutes. Then, after he made a short speech about the Morgan
(``This library has been a jewel for all of New York''), the music
started. Several couples demonstrated the Charleston. Mrs. Astor
and Melhado danced a few turns of a somewhat slower step, and left.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Curtin
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly the most formidable dressing room I've ever
been in,'' the playwright and performer David Hare said.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, it was his own dressing room after the Monday
evening performance of his one-man show, ``Via Dolorosa,'' at the
Booth Theater on West 45th Street. Two women who figured in his
performance, Leah Rabin and Judi Dench, had been in the audience
and had gone backstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Via Dolorosa'' touches on the assassination of Mrs. Rabin's
husband, Yitzhak Rabin, who was the prime minister of Israel. ``The
audience did not know she was there,'' Hare said, ``but the most
extraordinary respectful silence fell over the house. I think they
sensed my own feeling about what an extraordinarily moving moment
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Miss Dench, Hare usually mentions her in the opening
minutes of the show. The line usually gets a laugh. On Monday, it
drew applause. That tipped off Hare, who had not known that she
would be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been saying to me for some time now that I must write a
play in which we can act,'' he said. After seeing ``Via Dolorosa,''
though, she seemed to have cooled on that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Mmm, I don't think I want to be in a play with you.
You don't act. There's not a single choice you make in the course
of an evening that any professional actor would make. It's moving,
but I don't feel that what I do and what you do have any
professional kinship.'''

 &HT;    Texas lawmakers approve controversial hate crimes billBy Scott
S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After an emotional debate that held lawmakers
spellbound, the Texas House on Tuesday for the first time approved
a hate crimes bill that specifically mentions the groups it is
designed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of the bill, spurred in part by last June's grisly
slaying of James Byrd Jr., would stiffen penalties for crimes
motivated by bias against a person's race, religion or national
origin. It also would cover crimes based on ``sexual preference,''
which may signal a sea change in a House that in the past has
balked at protecting homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of that category may create a sticky situation for
Gov. George W. Bush: Signing the bill almost surely would open him
up to attacks from the right as he seeks a middle road to the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The House, which gave tentative approve to the bill Tuesday, is
expected to give final approval today. It is pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked out on the House floor in 1991 with people moving
their desks because they wouldn't sit next to me, and people saying
they didn't want to have their pictures taken with me in the
picture,'' said Austin Rep. Glen Maxey, the only openly gay member
of the Legislature. ``It's amazing to me, the demeanor of this
Legislature _ it says very good things about Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, filed House Bill 938 in
memory of Byrd, the black man from Jasper, Texas who was dragged to
his death behind a pickup truck manned by two white supremacists.
The bill would stiffen penalties and allow civil damages for crimes
motivated by prejudice. It also would require the attorney general
to assist counties in prosecuting such crimes, provide grants to
help them pay for such cases, and require specialized training of
peace officers in the investigation and documentation of such
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Verrett, a nephew of the slain man who watched Tuesday's
debate from the House gallery, said he is convinced the legislation
will make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I'm very proud to be a Texan,'' Verrett said. `` I'm
very proud to be here in person to see this outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 83-61 vote, Thompson said Byrd's slaying ``had the
greatest impact on the passage of this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has said he is undecided whether to support a hate
crimes measure but opposes special rights based on sexual
orientation, appeared no closer to a decision on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I supported hate crimes legislation last session,'' Bush said
in Dallas. ``I just want to see how the bill goes. It's early in
the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two percent of Texans support harsher penalties for
crimes motivated by hate, according to a recent Texas Poll, and 76
percent of them believe homosexuals should be covered by a hate
crimes law.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote was a first for the House. In 1993, the Texas
Senate passed hate crimes legislation covering race, color,
disability, religion, national origin, ancestry and sexual
orientation. But House members refused to sign off on the sexual
orientation protection. Rather than exclude that group, supporters
eliminated all mention of categories and instead pushed through a
bill covering ``crimes motivated by bias or prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   The House in 1995 killed a bill similar to the one approved
Tuesday, and the 1993 law is still on the books.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, who is carrying
Thompson's bill in the Senate this time around, said Tuesday's
House action should give it a boost. Senate supporters are still
scrambling for the votes to bring that legislation to the Senate
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Usually when the House debates a bill, dozens of members are
talking on their desk phones, milling in the aisles or lounging
around the edges of the chamber. Not this time: members were rooted
silently to their seats for the duration of the debate, which
lasted longer than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   For many supporters, the debate was personal. Rep. Steve Wolens,
D-Dallas, talked about the insults he endured as a Jewish kid
growing up in the 1950's in tiny Corsicana, Texas. Rep. Pete
Gallego, D-Alpine, recalled a boyhood lesson on the term
``greaser,'' a pejorative term for Hispanics. And Rep. Harold
Dutton, D-Houston, said his son recently told him about a racial
slur directed at him at school.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Paul Moreno, D-El Paso, suggested that some lawmakers
opposed the bill because they had never encountered prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have never experienced discrimination _ never. In this
beautiful city of Austin, Texas, when I was in my third year in UT
law school, I was denied a home simply because I was a Mexican.
Don't tell me that doesn't hurt,'' Moreno said. ``Discrimination is
very very difficult to understand unless you have experienced it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Suzanna Hupp, who opposed the bill, also had a personal
tale to tell. Hupp, whose parents were among the 22 people killed
in a 1991 massacre in a Killeen Luby's, said she was offended by
the idea that a court could weigh the deaths of the individual
victims differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time believing that any person's life in that
restaurant that day was worth more than anyone else's,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Wayne Christian, R-Center, who represents Jasper, said
differentiating between groups was the root of the tragedy there.
Christian, referring to the subsequent removal of the fence
dividing the black and white graves in the town's cemetery, said
lawmakers were ``erecting fences'' by singling out specific groups
for protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not within the power of us in the Legislature to stop
hate,'' Christian said. ``Only God can change the heart of man _
not legislation.'' Rep. Joe Nixon, R-Houston said lawmakers
``cannot mandate nor prosecute thoughts or feelings.'' Nixon argued
that it is illogical to separate crimes motivated by hate from
those spurred by greed, jealousy, ignorance or lust. He also
contended that the legislation infringes on free speech and
violates the U.S. Constitution's equal protection clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill creates and provides disproportionate protection to
special classes of victims and inequitable punishments for a
special class of offenders,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dutton noted that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 also singles
out certain groups for protection. And Wolens insisted that the
bill ``will protect the speech of hate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill does not deal with the deed of the word or
propaganda, but with the deed of the act,'' Wolens said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and other supporters of the bill pointed out that the
Legislature has already passed laws that distinguish between the
victims of the same crimes, increasing penalties for the murders of
public servants, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The House cleared its traditional sexual orientation hurdle
surprisingly easily. Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, added an
amendment substituting the term ``sexual preference'' for ``sexual
orientation,'' saying the change made it clear that heterosexuals
as well as homosexuals would be covered. Supporters of the bill,
who were hard-pressed to define the difference between the two
terms, didn't object.
</P>
<P>
   There was little opposition when Rep. Charlie Howard, who
opposed the bill, amended it to add ``status as a pregnant woman,''
and gender to the list of categories covered under the bill. But
when the Sugar Land Republican, citing the recent Littleton school
shootings, attempted to add ``status as a student athlete'' to the
list, supporters pounced on him for trying to make a mockery of the
legislation.

NATO HITS MILOSEVIC'S HEADQUARTERS AGAIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
and GREG McDONALD 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO struck again Tuesday at the headquarters of
Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party as alliance leaders suggested
that diplomatic overtures by Russia would not change the peace
terms for the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to insist on the conditions that NATO has set
out,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott met with a special Russian envoy, but no
concrete results were reported.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO continued to revisit targets hit earlier in the
monthlong bombardment against Milosevic's forces, an errant strike
apparently hit a residential area in southern Serbia, killing at
least 17 civilians and destroying up to 50 homes.
</P>
<P>
   As earlier requested by the Pentagon, President Clinton
authorized the call-up of 33,102 reservists.
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday is expected to defeat a call to declare
war against Yugoslavia but could pass a measure demanding that
Clinton seek authorization if he decides to commit ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders readied a $13 billion spending
bill to finance the Balkan fighting, more than twice the amount
Clinton sought.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the reserves called up were from Air Force units that
can help ready U.S. warplanes for pounding Serb targets. None was
from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The three U.S. soldiers held captive in Yugoslavia were examined
Tuesday by a doctor from the International Committee of the Red
Cross and were allowed to send out messages that Red Cross
spokesman Chris Bowers said would be delivered ``straight to their
families.''
</P>
<P>
   The captives are Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville;
Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; and Staff Sgt.
Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers said a Red Cross representative met with the men in
private, as called for in the Geneva Conventions on treatment of
war prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson said he would visit Belgrade
to seek the servicemen's release, despite signs from the Clinton
administration that his intervention was not welcomed and could be
dangerous. The White House refused to guarantee Jackson safe
passage.
</P>
<P>
   In military action in Yugoslavia, NATO hit for at least the
second time the 23-story Usce Center building in Belgrade, which
houses offices of Milosevic's Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   When the building was struck last week, NATO called it the
``nerve center'' of Milosevic's autocratic regime. It is also the
site of a television transmitter, which apparently was struck in
the latest attack.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO spokesman acknowledged that a Yugoslav army barracks in
the southern Serbian city of Surdulica, 200 miles south of
Belgrade, also was targeted Tuesday. But said he had no information
on whether any of the bombs went astray.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported up to 600 houses were damaged
there by a missile attack that missed the barracks, and several
children were among at least 17 dead, the worst civilian toll since
the NATO mission began.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather continued to hamper NATO air attacks, but allied
military spokesmen said attrition is taking a toll on Milosevic's
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these attacks are cumulatively starting to add up,'' U.S.
Air Force Major Gen. Charles Wald said. ``His forces are starting
to take a pretty good hit, in the field particularly. But you add
that up to the fact that he can't sustain the force, he has no
ammunition, his command and control is going down.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's top military commander, said
Milosevic faced ``increasing numbers of desertions and declining
morale among the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook said in London that ``desertion is now running at several
hundreds per week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The response of the (Yugoslav) reserves to mobilization has
been so poor that the special police are now going from door to
door,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark said at the daily NATO briefing in Brussels, Belgium,
that Serb reinforcements are arriving in Kosovo regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The allies also put a squeeze on Milosevic's personal finances.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the European Union had
decided unanimously to freeze any personal bank accounts in its
territory belonging to Milosevic ``and his cronies.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Talbott reported no breakthroughs and said talks with
Russian leaders would continue. He spoke in person or by phone with
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the former prime minister who is President
Boris Yeltsin's special envoy for the Balkan fighting, Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Foreign Minister Ivan Ivanov.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's call-up order was his first formal activation notice
since February 1998, when he summoned forces because of
developments in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The extra forces were needed, the Pentagon said, because of the
recent addition of U.S. refueling aircraft to NATO's Balkan
contingent.
</P>
<P>
   The reservists will be in place, either in the United States or
Europe, for when better weather arrives as expected in the summer.
They will join about 1,000 reservists who have volunteered since
the Balkan campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the first units affected by the call-up are in
Alabama, Arizona, California, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said Clinton ``fully recognizes this
disrupts lives, but this is what reservists train for. This is what
their mission is. From time to time, they are called.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Republican appropriations chiefs prepared to
offer bills that would more than double Clinton's emergency request
of $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact on military readiness of the pace of operations in
and around Kosovo is significant, and those funds must be
replenished,'' said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, arguing for the $13 billion figure.
</P>
<P>
   White House budget chief Jacob Lew argued that Clinton's $6
billion proposal ``does protect military readiness in the Balkans
and around the world.''

NEW YORK TO PAY $2.75 MILLION TO A MAN WHO SAID POLICE BEAT HIM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Giuliani administration has agreed to pay $2.75
million to a man who said he had been beaten on his way to work by
at least five police officers because he fit the profile of a black
suspect they were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The city agreed to the unusually large settlement with Harold
Dusenbury, 42, of Willingboro, N.J., even though prosecutors said
at the time that the officers had committed no wrongdoing in the
1996 case and the Police Department concluded that the officers had
done nothing to warrant being disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   City lawyers denied Tuesday that the settlement had anything to
do with the politicized environment in New York City since the
police shooting of a West African immigrant, Amadou Diallo, in
February.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for Dusenbury disputed that view, saying the Diallo
case was ``one of the things that drove the settlement,'' along
with the compelling facts of Dusenbury's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to go to trial, with this case in this
atmosphere,'' said the lawyer, Jonathan C. Moore, ``particularly
with Harold Dusenbury, who is the most shining example of somebody
who was just trying to do the right thing all his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusenbury, an electrician, commuted each morning from his home
in Willingboro, about 20 miles south of Trenton, to a construction
site in Greenwich Village, where a Kmart store was being built. On
his 40th birthday, July 25, 1996, Dusenbury arrived in the city
about 6:45 a.m. and was walking on Eighth Street, wearing a T-shirt
and dungarees and carrying a plastic bag containing his work
clothes and his tools.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the police were broadcasting a description of
a fleeing suspect, a ``black male in T-shirt and jeans,'' who had
brandished a knife in Washington Square Park. A police car that was
cruising along Eighth Street jumped the curb and forced Dusenbury
to stop, the lawsuit said. One officer leaped toward him and
slammed his forehead against a metal security gate, then tried to
handcuff him, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments, the suit asserted, at least four other officers
arrived and crowded around Dusenbury, striking him and kicking his
head and calling him a drug dealer and using racial slurs, the
complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit Dusenbury filed against the city claimed that he had
suffered permanent physical harm, including brain injuries, and had
been unable to resume work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a racist issue first,'' Dusenbury said in a
telephone interview Tuesday. ``Otherwise, there would have been
some degree of respect, as indicated on their automobiles _
respect, professionalism, courtesy.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael L. Spiegel, another lawyer for Dusenbury, said the
evidence pointed to ``profiling carried to its most dangerous
extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When this officer assaulted Harold,'' he said, ``the only
possible explanation was that he was in a state of such racist rage
that he selected the only black man that he saw on the street to
assault.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a police spokeswoman, said Tuesday night that all
of the officers had been cleared of misconduct by the Police
Department and the Manhattan district attorney's office. She added:
``Nobody would argue that this wasn't a tragic mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office closed its investigation after
concluding that the police had made a mistake _ ``a regrettable
one,'' as a senior prosecutor, Daniel J. Castleman, said at the
time, ``and they acknowledged that from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached Tuesday, Castleman, the chief of investigations for the
district attorney, said that based on the evidence his office had
seen, the civil settlement ``seemed to be the appropriate venue for
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter A. Lerner, an assistant corporation counsel for the city,
said the city would admit no wrongdoing by the police. He said that
if the suit had gone to trial, the city would have shown that
Dusenbury resisted orders by the police, and that the seriousness
and permanence of his injuries was ``a cloudy issue.''

AIRPORT SECURITY TO BE TIGHTENED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVEN GOLDSMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sea-Tac Airport managers promised Tuesday to add
police patrols, improve lighting, upgrade emergency call boxes and
take other steps to heighten security in the huge parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   The measures come after a Post-Intelligencer series on security
gaps in the garage, and the port's payment of $2.6 million to
settle a shooting victim's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some fear recently, and we want to have that
alleviated,'' Gina Marie Lindsey, aviation director, told Port of
Seattle commissioners Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The P-I reported in March that unlike the lots at most other
major airports surveyed, the Sea-Tac garage had infrequent police
patrols, no emergency panic buttons and lighting that fell far
short of current industry standards.
</P>
<P>
   Measures unveiled Tuesday would correct some of those
conditions, but Lindsey said the 10,000-stall garage already was
relatively safe.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrades, she said, are intended not only to make travelers
feel more secure, but to smooth their way through an increasingly
crowded facility.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said public fear generated by the P-I series had
helped initiate or speed up several changes:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Stepping up patrols so there is one police officer
somewhere in the eight-story garage at least half of each day.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the garage was not patrolled at all many days,
except on a spot basis.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Circulating electric carts topped by flashing lights
carrying customer-service agents. They will be able to direct lost
motorists and lend a uniformed presence in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Offering Block Watch-style training in coming weeks to
airport and airline workers to help them spot security problems and
know how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Modifying emergency telephones in the next three weeks to
transmit to dispatchers the caller's exact location.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Replacing the lamps in older sections of the garage and
redesigning the garage's lighting to eliminate severe contrast
between dark and light areas.
</P>
<P>
   Only the lighting project was given a specific pricetag: $4.5
million, an allocation that will require approval by the port
commission in about two months.
</P>
<P>
   Studies on how to improve the lighting had long been under way,
Lindsey said, but the project probably would not have been launched
for another year without the recent publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The added police patrols in the garage began about four weeks
ago, she said. The other safety measures will be launched as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, port officials also are studying
longer-term security changes such as installing a network of
security cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The only cameras now in the garage are used to check maintenance
conditions around the elevators. In the coming weeks, Lindsey said,
the facilities personnel who monitor those cameras will be trained
to spot and report security problems, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey presented the security improvements as part of a larger
package of ``customer-service'' upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-story airport garage _ which Sea-Tac officials believe
to be the largest single parking structure in the nation _ is
bulging at the seams. It handled four million cars last year, which
carried many of the 25.8 million people who flew through Sea-Tac.
Last year, the structure generated a $34 million profit.
</P>
<P>
   The garage regularly fills up twice a week _ typically midday
Wednesdays and Thursdays _ and the congestion is only getting
worse.
</P>
<P>
   A hotline (206-433-5308) alerts motorists to sold-out
situations, alternative parking locales, and other conditions. The
airport's website (www.portseattle.org/seatac) will be upgraded by
late May to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials also promise to have in place by October a
speedy pay-on-the-way-to-your-car exit system, and to add 3,000 new
parking stalls by July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As to security, port Police Chief Patrick Kasnick said the
airport garage is as safe as the surrounding community.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting crimes involving its rental cars, he said Sea-Tac's
garage has one-fourth as much crime as nearby Southcenter Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Though the P-I and the port's own 1995 study both found that
Sea-Tac logged more crimes per passenger than eight comparable
airports, Lindsey said the comparisons with other airports are
``just flat-out not reliable'' because of variations in conditions
and reporting practices.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's main airport, for example, is in an isolated area with
controlled access roads, while Sea-Tac sits amid a bustling urban
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey said Sea-Tac's garage-crime numbers also look
inordinately high because the garage's in-house car-rental facility
generates crime reports every time there's a theft or late return.
Few other airport garages have in-hour car-rental operations, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Port officials agreed two weeks ago to pay $2.6 million to the
software engineer who was shot by a robber in the garage. No fault
was admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Soheila Motamed was disabled in the Dec. 15, 1996, botched
robbery attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman had been involved in another robbery in the same
garage five days before, and Motamed's lawsuit alleged that port
officials did not step up patrols or issue any warnings after the
first incident.
</P>
<P>
   For several years before the incidents, a half-dozen of the
port's own veteran police officers had made written pleas for
stepped-up security at the garage, according to documents in the
court file.
</P>
<P>
   Motamed's suit was to have gone to trial in May before the port
agreed to pay the settlement to close the case.
</P>
<P>
   Motamed was hospitalized for months after the shooting and must
still, at age 42, walk with a cane. After the settlement, she said
she hoped the case would lead to better security in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   Kasnick, the police chief, said even without the new measures
the garage is as safe as any other urban locale.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if people are fearful of crime,'' he said, ``it's as real
to them as if a crime was happening.''

BAFFERT GOES FOR HISTORIC WIN
</HEADLINE>
 CX-BAFFERT IS 46-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Bob Baffert says he doesn't think about
history. He's a jokester, a 46-year-old party boy, living from one
turf-club champagne toast to the next. Or so the world's hottest
thoroughbred trainer would like you to think.
</P>
<P>
   But whether he thought about it or not, Baffert took a major
step Tuesday, the penultimate step of the long winter and spring,
toward Kentucky Derby history.
</P>
<P>
   Between rain showers at Churchill Downs, the two Derby favorites
splashed through their final serious tuneups for Saturday's race,
in which they'll try to make Baffert the first person to win the
classic horse race three years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge and Prime Timber didn't record the fastest
workouts of the morning, but they danced off the soupy track
afterwards in apparent health and fitness. If Baffert had been the
least bit nervous behind his Hollywood sunglasses, he could heave a
sigh of relief after watching that from the grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over. Now we can start partying down and
enjoying the festivities,'' he said after driving to his
backstretch barn. ``From here on it's just a matter of keeping 'em
happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in position to win another one,'' declared Baffert, who
won the past two Derbies with Silver Charm and Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Baffert's work is not quite done. He must finally
decide in the next two days whether to run one of his two star
fillies in the Derby or keep both with their own sex in Friday's
Kentucky Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said Silverbulletday, the champion 2-year-old filly of
'98, will settle for the Oaks, though her owner Mike Pegram pointed
out that ``he's been known to change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram _ who has already won a Derby with Real Quiet _ said he's
leaving the choice on Silverbulletday to Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe,'' Pegram admitted, ``I might have the
favorite in the Kentucky Derby and not run her.''
</P>
<P>
   The other filly, Excellent Meeting, has worked out so well here
that it's hard for Baffert to say no to the Derby for her. But
owners John and Betty Mabee have said they're ``90 percent''
against subjecting her to that strain. Baffert expected to discuss
it with the San Diego couple again after they arrived in Louisville
later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The best guess is that they'll put up an extra $30,000 to enter
Excellent Meeting in the Derby as well as the Oaks, but scratch her
from the Derby unless something unforeseen knocks out the Mabees'
General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the decision is fraught with potential regret.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when it comes to double-edged decisions, Baffert has
been juggling knives since the start of '99, when he counted an
unwieldy roster of six Triple Crown candidates in his Santa Anita
barn.
</P>
<P>
   After his success with Silver Charm and Real Quiet _ which
followed Cavonnier's unlucky second in '96 _ Baffert is the trainer
of choice for rich owners with Derby dreams. This year so many
signed on that it was as if the Derby became his to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert never believed that. Having also experienced hard
losses, like Cavonnier's Derby and like Silver Charm's and Real
Quiet's Belmont Stakes, he knew that all he could do was prepare
the horses for the race. The rest would be up to the horses. And
luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really think about winning it,'' he said. ``You
think about getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   There were moments along the way when he appeared to feel the
pressure. Like when he shoved Chris McCarron's agent in an argument
over Baffert's abrupt switch to Gary Stevens as the rider for
General Challenge before the gelding won the Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I snapped,'' Baffert told a Daily Racing Form interviewer
recently.
</P>
<P>
   So, since arriving in Kentucky a couple of weeks ago, Baffert
has returned to his quipster roots, joking to deflect the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the barn Tuesday, he walked briskly past a
crowd of reporters, then did a stagy double take and said, ``There
something goin' on here?''
</P>
<P>
   Only this: Baffert trying to do what four other trainers, four
jockeys, four owners and six breeders have failed to do in 124
years, which is to turn back-to-back Derby victories into
threepeats.
</P>
<P>
   Friends here say he's (begin ital)very(end ital) confident of
his chances to make history Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He'd prefer they didn't put it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think about history. I didn't think I'd get this
far,'' said Baffert, who grew up with horses in Arizona, learned to
train with quarterhorses at Los Alamitos Race Course in Orange
County, and started with one thoroughbred 10 years ago. ``I haven't
thought about the future. I don't set goals. You've got to keep the
excitement down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's going to be hard to do. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A GUN CONTROL MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 28:
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado school massacre has generated what amounts to a
national conversation about causes and cures, raising issues as
simple as school security, as delicate as parental responsibility
and as complex as the biological and cultural roots of teen-age
violence. This discussion could well lead to a more alert and safer
society. But there is one blindingly obvious issue that should be
addressed right away _ the issue of gun control. Congress, nervous
about the gun lobby, is divided on the subject. The public, we
suspect, is not divided at all _ at least on the matter of keeping
guns and explosives out of the hands of young people. Our own view
is that the Colorado tragedy has provided the right moment to take
the issue of gun control off automatic pilot, where it has been for
for years, and move it forward in a dramatic way.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton seems to have sensed that such a moment may be
at hand, that the country may be at one of those rare turning
points where the weight of public shock and anger creates the
necessary conditions for major legislative change. Yesterday he
offered a solid package of gun control measures. The package _ a
mixture of old measures ignored by Congress and several new
initiatives _ offers no guarantee against a repetition of the
Colorado horror. No law can do that. What these measures would do
is reduce the risk by making it harder for disturbed young people
to obtain guns and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Such change will not come easy in this Congress. The Republican
leaders, House Speaker Dennis Hastert and the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott, have expressed their wish for a national forum
on ``youth and culture,'' a clear indication that they would prefer
to talk about anything other than gun control. The Democrats, many
of whom attribute their congressional losses in 1994 to that year's
vote to ban assault weapons, seem equally skittish. ``I'm not sure
that gun control is what we need, '' declared their leader in the
Senate, Tom Daschle, who preferred to dilate about violence on the
Internet and in the media.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton's package is one around which the public and
Congress, if it will only open its eyes and ears, can usefully
rally. Its key elements deserve thorough debate and an up-or-down
vote in both Houses of Congress by mid-summer. We can think of no
better legislative gift to the students who will be returning to
school next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Several provisions are aimed at closing off the ways that young
people now lay their hands on weapons. One would raise the minimum
age for possessing handguns to 21. Federal law prohibits federally
licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to anyone under 21, but
allows 18- to 20-year-olds to possess handguns and even to buy them
from unlicensed sellers, such as an older friend, which may be how
the Colorado shooters obtained some of their arsenal. Another
proposal would ban juvenile possession of semiautomatic assault
rifles, as well as imports of high-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   A third provision would hold parents criminally liable when they
``knowingly or recklessly'' allow a child access to a weapon that
later causes death or injury. Sixteen states already have such
laws, and they have helped reduce violence. A fourth provision
would require dealers, manufacturers and importers to provide a
child safety lock with every gun. This proposal could be
strengthened by requiring that the locks be pre-installed at the
factory. Congress could go a step further by underwriting ``smart
gun'' technology to prevent the firing of weapons by people other
than authorized users.
</P>
<P>
   The president also recommended updating the 1993 Brady law,
which requires a background check of handgun buyers and has
prevented more than a quarter of a million felons from obtaining
handguns. Clinton would extend the Brady background check to the
sale of explosives, and close a big loophole that allows people to
evade a check by buying guns at gun shows or flea markets. At the
same time, Congress needs to plug another loophole identified by
Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, by prohibiting gun sales over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton endorsed for the first time the notion of limiting
individual gun purchases to one a month _ an antidote, already in
effect in some states, to illegal traffickers who make bulk
purchases in states with weak gun control laws and then sell guns
to youngsters in states with strong laws, like New York.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big package. But this is the right time to push it.
The National Rifle Association is at least temporarily on the run,
in the states and in the courts. And the public is eager for
change.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Right before the Littleton shootings, Al Gore was
telling everyone that he and Tipper just  &UR; loved &LR;  ``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand how the Father of the Internet could be
so taken with the imaginative hit movie that is a video game writ
large, a balletic and epic ode to violence about rebel hackers and
society misfits who fight back when evil computers take over the
world and reduce humans to AA batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores' taste in movies, while hip, is a telling reminder of
the difficulties and contradictions that can trip up politicians
when they start lecturing about changing the culture. Their
appreciation of ``The Matrix'' directly collides with the White
House effort this week to denounce the movie and video-game
``culture of violence,'' with Hillary slapping her pals in
Hollywood and Tipper resuming her role as pop cop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen and ask your child, `What movies do you like and why?
If you like a very violent movie and if you've seen it repeatedly,
does that mean that it's having undue influence on you?''' Mrs.
Gore asked on ``Meet the Press,'' adding, ``How about with violent
video games?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix,'' which has attracted an obsessively devoted
audience of young computer-savvy males, would seem to be the sort
of movie Mrs. Gore was describing. As the bullets fly and fly, the
shell casings glimmer alluringly in slow motion, giving a gorgeous
techno-sheen to the action. The violence has a terrible beauty and
the death seems merely virtual.
</P>
<P>
   There are eerie echoes to the dark underground world of the
teen-age Columbine killers, who laughingly treated death as virtual
entertainment: Keanu Reeves throws open his long black coat to
reveal an arsenal of pistols and machine guns. In this universe,
the small, secret band of black-clad computer pirates must save a
world gone mad.
</P>
<P>
   At one late show in Washington this week, the similarities were
so striking to the audience that people began yelling out
``Columbine!'' and cheering as Keanu Reeves walked through a metal
detector, coolly pulled out his guns, and blew away a building full
of cops.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders are off the radar, as they continue to
treat the surfeit of guns as a family-values problem. Hillary and
Bill and Tipper and Al have the gun-control message right, but they
are not the most consistent messengers to preach about rooting out
the toxic forces in American culture. Their concern is too often
tailored not to offend their donors and pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Hillary Clinton sounded hollow Tuesday when she said, as she
introduced her husband at a gun-control rally: ``Part of growing up
is learning how to control one's impulses. ''
</P>
<P>
   This is a White House not distinguished by its mastery of
impulse or its willingness to do the tough, unglamorous,
politically risky work that could buck our instant-gratification
culture and result in a repudiation of gun movies and guns. A week
after Columbine, the preaching is easy.
</P>
<P>
   After Bill Clinton sold the Lincoln bedroom to Hollywood
buddies, after Hillary became a Miramax flak, after Al Gore and
Jeffrey Katzenberg zestfully hugged, after Tipper soft-pedaled her
crusade to raise PG kids in an X-rated society for a decade after
Hollywood honchos told her husband it would hurt fund-raising, they
should spare us their opportunistic outrage.
</P>
<P>
   It's fine to like ``The Matrix.'' But you should not be
entertained and financed by the same culture that you demonize and
trash.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming Hollywood and the culture is a glib solution anyway.
It's much easier than doing the hard work of financing and mounting
a campaign for meaningful gun legislation, which might take years.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has ceased to be a place where big things get done,
or even sensible, moderate things. Those who don't think we need
that hard effort should consider the words of Mel Bernstein, the
owner of Dragon Arms, a gun shop in Colorado. Some kids in trench
coats had come in recently, he said, and asked for guns.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein refused, saying too many kids come in wanting too
much. ``This is like Toys `R' Us to them.''

EDITORIAL: CHINA'S MUFFLED PROTESTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 28:
</P>
<P>
   The large, silent demonstration in Beijing last Sunday by
members of a spiritual sect was the biggest protest in China's
capital since the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square
10 years ago. Yet China's leaders allowed the peaceful sit-in to go
on all day right outside the top leadership's compound, and there
are reports that Prime Minister Zhu Rongji met with several members
of the group. The government has responded cautiously because the
group represents a popular social movement. China's leaders are
hoping to control a phenomenon whose ancient antecedents brought
down several Chinese dynasties, and which presents a challenge of
uncertain dimensions to Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates that Buddhist Law, the nonviolent sect
that staged the protest, has 70 million adherents in China. Members
practice a form of qigong, an ancient Chinese belief in the healing
and even supernatural powers of harnessing a specific bodily
energy. The Buddhist Law sect mixes qigong with Buddhism and
opposes consumerism, rock music, television, extramarital sex and
use of alcohol. Its leader, Li Hongzhi, was pressured to leave
China and now lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Qigong has not always been associated with nonviolent
activities. In the third century a qigong-style movement that used
faith healing and predicted the end of the world took over a fourth
of the country and helped bring about the fall of the Han dynasty.
Similar movements in the Middle Ages and late 18th century led to
violent upheavals. Qigong was also central to the Boxer Rebellion
against foreigners early this century, as the fighters believed
qigong protected them from bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in a time of rapid modernization, unemployment, mass
migration to the cities and a relaxation of Communist Party control
of people's private lives, qigong is once again growing. It is so
popular, and such a part of Chinese history, that many party
leaders themselves practice some form of it. They cannot simply
dismiss it as foreign, their typical slur on the democracy
movement.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the Communist Party began trying to attract
support by adopting aspects of popular ancient doctrines, like
Confucianism and qigong. The party endorsed the ancient notion that
qigong beliefs were part of Chinese medicine. The leadership's
strategy this week seems to be similar. It wants to avoid
responding harshly, which could alienate millions, and is trying to
befriend the sect's leaders and use its support to increase the
party's legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   While normally any organized challenge to the Communist Party is
something to applaud in China, students of Chinese history are wary
of Buddhist Law. Hundreds of qigong organizations have sprung up
around China in recent years. Some are simply health and exercise
groups, but others are being used by demagogues. Especially if the
economy slows, China can expect even more rapid growth in a
movement symptomatic of people's search for meaning in a time of
uncertainty. Whether it will be constructive for China remains to
be seen.  &QL;

MAINE'S HIGH COURT REJECTS BID TO USE SCHOOL VOUCHERS FOR RELIGIOUS
SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Fla., Ohio, Vt.)  (With FLA-SCHOOL-VOUCHERS) 
 (nk) 
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Maine Supreme Court has denied a constitutional
appeal by five families who wanted to use taxpayer money to send
their children to church-affiliated schools. In a 5-1 decision, the
court upheld the state's policy of restricting publicly financed
vouchers to nonreligious schools.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, the most recent from a flurry of school choice
cases across the nation, could bring the issue a step closer to the
Supreme Court. The ruling comes almost a year after the Wisconsin
Supreme Court came to a different decision on the voucher issue,
ruling that a Milwaukee program can allow parents to use vouchers
to pay tuition at church-affiliated schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This now creates a split in authority among state supreme
courts on the constitutionality of school choice that makes it much
more likely that the United States Supreme Court will take a case
and resolve the issue,'' said Clint Bolick, litigation director for
the Institute of Justice, a libertarian public policy law firm that
represented the Maine parents.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, parents who live in towns without public schools can
use publicly financed vouchers to attend private schools that are
not church affiliated. Five families from rural Raymond, Me., which
has no high school, sued their school district for the right to use
vouchers to send their children to a private, all-male Catholic
school in Portland. They maintained that the program violated their
freedom of religion and other rights. An appeals court denied the
request, and the state Supreme Court upheld the decision on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choice alone,'' the decision said, ``cannot overcome the fact
that the tuition program would directly pay religious schools for
programs that include and advance religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the principle of the separation of church and
state, the decision continued, ``None of the Supreme Court's
decisions to date have ever intimated that such direct subsidies of
religious schools could survive an Establishment Clause
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Both opponents and supporters of vouchers are hoping this case _
or one of the others in litigation in Vermont or Ohio _ will reach
the highest court and lead to the creation of a national standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the case,'' said the Rev. Barry Lynn, executive
director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State,
``more than any other that makes it crystal clear that vouchers aid
religious schools and that violated the Constitution. It says it
directly and without any fudging or equivocation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bolick called this court's interpretation of constitutional
law ``an aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 14,000 students in about half of Maine's school districts
attend public schools outside their own districts and approved
private schools under the $70 million tuition program. In August, a
federal court ruled against a group of families in Minot, Me., in a
similar school voucher case. That case is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs have 90 days to decide whether to appeal the case
to the U.S. Supreme Court. Bolick said an appeal was likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very anxious for the Supreme Court to remove any
lingering doubt about the constitutionality of school choice
programs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 state legislatures have dealt with proposals on school
vouchers, scholarship programs, tuition tax credits and other kinds
of aid involving religious schools this year, Lynn said. ``This is
probably the most ever.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld a program allowing
low-income students to use vouchers at religious schools. In
November, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the decision.
</P>
<P>
   State supreme courts in Vermont or Ohio have heard arguments on
school voucher cases, and the Florida Legislature is poised to
approve the first statewide school choice program, a program that
libertarian groups have vowed to fight.

 &HT;    Chinese spying `pervasive,' panel's report will reveal
 &HT;    (EDS: Cox News Service EXCLUSIVE _ please credit.)
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chinese spying at American nuclear laboratories has
been more widespread than originally believed and aroused
suspicions in the Energy Department earlier than previously
reported, according to the chairman of a special House committee
probing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pervasive,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.), who
was appointed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich last summer to
investigate whether sensitive technology was transferred to the
Chinese during the launches of commercial satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Cox says the committee will spell out in its
yet-to-be-declassified 700-page report that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Spying at the Los Alamos laboratory, where the atomic bomb was
developed, was first suspected by a Department of Energy
intelligence officer in 1992, three years earlier than previously
reported and four years before the White House was briefed on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   _ In addition to gathering sensitive information at Los Alamos,
spies working for the People's Republic of China obtained
classified U.S. nuclear weapons information at four other American
laboratories. Cox declined to identify the labs.
</P>
<P>
   _ China has obtained design information on nuclear warheads in
addition to the much publicized acquisition of information about
the Trident II (W-88), the most sophisticated weapon in the U.S.
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Interagency conflicts among the Justice Department, the CIA
and the Energy Department led to delays in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Loose controls over sales of supercomputers have resulted in
the Chinese obtaining sophisticated technology to conduct ``virtual
weapons tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich selected Cox to investigate American technology
transfers to China after allegations surfaced that the Chinese had
made campaign contributions to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   But 75 witnesses and 24 hearings later, the findings are less
about the Clinton administration and more about how the Chinese
have infiltrated American laboratories, taking with them top secret
information about how to manufacture nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The committee unraveled a trail of espionage and national
security concerns that date back to the Carter administration and
continued throughout Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an investigation of the Clinton administration;
this was an investigation of espionage by the People's Republic of
China,'' Cox said. ``It happens that the espionage has gone on
through several administrations and continues on to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee recommended the administration conduct an
overall assessment of the espionage damage.
</P>
<P>
   A one-page, declassified summary of that assessment, which
contains few details, concluded: ``China obtained, by espionage,
classified U.S. nuclear weapons information that probably
accelerated its program to develop future nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox and ranking Democratic Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington gave
their findings to the president last week during a 90-minute
briefing in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   George Tenet, the director of the CIA, and Robert Walpole, a CIA
expert on strategic and nuclear programs, briefed House and Senate
members on the threat of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Samore, a senior official of the National Security Council
who was at the briefing, said there is good evidence that China
obtained nuclear weapons information from U.S. laboratories in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that this might be ongoing, which is why the
president ordered that security be strengthened at the labs,''
Samore said.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee's findings leave unanswered questions about
U.S. policy toward China, according to Cox.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Energy Department more than a year before it heeded
the FBI's 1997 recommendations to strengthen security at weapons
laboratories and restrict the Chinese suspect's access to
classified information.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics contend the Clinton administration hesitated
because it was trying to craft trade policy with China and did not
want to hear about possible lapses in security at nuclear labs.
</P>
<P>
   The White House flatly disputed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are trying to use this to undercut our policy
toward China,'' said Jim Kennedy, special counsel to the president.
``The two issues are not connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Samore points to a presidential directive from February 1998
ordering strengthening of security at laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   But that directive was too late, Cox said. It is an example of
how the departments did not communicate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a number of dysfunctions'' between agencies, Cox
said. ``The Justice Department does not share information with the
intelligence community really as completely as it should.''
</P>
<P>
   Take the Los Alamos espionage case as an example, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Espionage was first suspected in 1992 by Notra Trulock, an
intelligence official at the Energy Department, who alerted
superiors. Trulock was subpoenaed to testify several times before
the Cox committee.
</P>
<P>
   During that testimony, the committee learned that Trulock did
not share evidence of spying with the FBI until late 1995 and early
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department and the FBI began an investigation. By
April of 1996, they had enough information to brief Sandy Berger,
who at the time was President Clinton's deputy national security
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Samore said Berger's briefing in April 1996 was focused on the
loss of information pertaining to the Trident II (W-88). Soon
afterward, the Justice Department opened an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In July of 1997, Trulock delivered a more expansive briefing at
the White House, Samore said. As a result, Clinton ordered security
tightened at all labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acted very appropriately, very decisively,'' Samore said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's committee has drafted a batch of 10 bills that he hopes
Congress will enact to improve national security and clamp down on
the Chinese spy network.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee has drafted other recommendations on the
espionage problem, among them a call for the president to deliver
an espionage assessment to the leadership of the House and the
Senate every six months.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have warned about the transfer of technology to China
say the report's recommendations should be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are clearly moving in the direction of having
hundreds of warheads aimed at the U.S. _ all mounted on systems
that will be much more difficult for the U.S. to target or
defend,'' said Henry Sokolski, executive director of the
Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan
think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese will also have the capability to improve their
weapons reaching throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger question _ if the milk is spilled, how do we deal
with the consequences?'' Sokolski said. ``I don't know how we will
clean it up.''

EDITORIAL: SPRING GIVE-AWAY AT THE CITY COUNCIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 28:
</P>
<P>
   Politicians' urge to bestow giveaways on potential campaign
benefactors seems especially strong in the spring, when legislators
start preparing for summer vacation by passing outrageous benefits
for special-interest groups. Right now, the New York City Council
is considering a raid on the treasury on behalf of the corrections
officers' union that could cost $100 million a year and undermine
the collective bargaining process.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reinvesting the pension plan's stock-market profits
in the pension system, the union wants to use the money to increase
retirees' benefits. The Giuliani administration estimates such a
change would eventually cost $100 million a year, to pay for the
added benefits. City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, who is planning
to support the measure, claims the price tag would be less.
</P>
<P>
   Generous pension programs are fine things, but they are supposed
to be won through collective bargaining. Unfortunately in New York,
politically powerful unions have long since learned that they can
short-circuit collective bargaining and win these benefits directly
from legislators. The Giuliani administration says it is
particularly incensed about the City Council's plan because police
and fire unions won similar supplemental benefits at the bargaining
table. The corrections officers, having chosen to use their
negotiating chips for different things, now want Vallone to help
them have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the corrections union pension system requires
action by the State Legislature at the request of the City Council.
Both political parties in the State Legislature are hopelessly
craven in dealing with such special-interest legislation. They
recently passed a bill decreeing that when any state corrections
officer develops heart trouble, it will automatically be considered
a job-related disability. But the City Council, under Vallone, has
sometimes shown more restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The council may take up the pension bill today. If Vallone does
indeed push it through, it will be a disturbing sign that his
mayoral ambitions are already starting to undermine his hard-won
reputation for fiscal prudence.

TONY GWYNN CLOSES IN ON HIS 3,000TH HIT

 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The date was July 19, 1982, and the Cincinnati Reds
were playing the Padres in San Diego. The Reds had a first baseman
named Pete Rose. The Padres had a rookie center fielder, Tony
Gwynn. He was playing in his first major league game. In his first
three times at bat, Gwynn didn't get a hit, but in the eighth
inning, he lined a pitch from Sid Monge into the left-center-field
gap for a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose is trailing the play,'' Gwynn recalled vividly on
Tuesday. ``They flash on the board, `Tony Gwynn's first big league
hit.' He shook my hand and congratulated me and said, `Don't catch
me after one night.' I thought, boy, wouldn't it be great to have a
career like his, to be able to do some of the things that he was
able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years earlier, Rose had collected his 3,000th hit. ``From
that day on,'' Gwynn said, ``I felt if I was going to be as good as
I thought I could be that's where I had to get to. So for me, being
this close to it is a real kick.''
</P>
<P>
   When the season began, Gwynn needed 72 hits to reach 3,000. He
has hit so well in the early weeks that if someone nods off, he
might miss the magic hit. In the Padres' first 19 games, he has
amassed 29 hits (none against the Mets at Shea Stadium on Tuesday
night) for a .397 average.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Boggs and Cal Ripken, the other two players within striking
distance of 3,000 when the season began, have not fared as well.
Boggs, with 15 hits in the Devil Rays' 20 games, needs 63 hits.
Ripken, with only five hits and a spot on the disabled list, is 117
away from the plateau that only 21 players have reached.
</P>
<P>
   At the rate Gwynn is hitting, he will take his place in the
ultra-select circle before the end of May. And he will do it with
no false modesty. He has long wanted this, and he will relish every
second of the experience when he slaps No. 3,000 to left field for
a single, or whatever the hit is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a goal of mine for a long time,'' he said, sitting
at his locker hours before the Mets' game, already engaging in his
second long interview of the day with more to come. If there's a
select circle for words, the amiable Gwynn joined it a long time
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first day in the big leagues I thought, `Hey, maybe I can
get there,''' he said. ``No question it feels good. Throughout my
career I've had people who doubted that I could get there, that I
could be healthy enough to get there, whether my body type was
going to allow me to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The first 2,957 hits, Gwynn said, have required longevity,
consistency and will. ``I've had a passion to go out and play and
do the things that I felt I could do,'' he said. ``Even today that
hasn't changed. I still have passion for the game. I still love to
prepare and do all the other stuff I do.''
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of joining Rose and the others, Gwynn described his
feeling as ``kind of a chest stuck out, yeah, I'm going to get
there type of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a big deal for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The right fielder, who will be 39 years old on May 9, is
proudest of two elements of his hit-filled 18-year career: He has
played it entirely with one team, and he has got all of his hits in
the National League, where, he noted, a player can't rest
occasionally as the designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big thrill to be the first one to do it in the National
League since Lou Brock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brock reached 3,000 in 1979. Carl Yastrzemski, Rod Carew, Robin
Yount, George Brett, Dave Winfield, Eddie Murray and Paul Molitor
have followed. All or most of their hits came in the American
League, some of them as designated hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Gwynn has anything against being a designated hitter.
He said he would definitely consider serving in that role if the
Padres want to end his career with them before he is ready to end
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loyalty is a two-way street,'' said Gwynn, whose contract ends
after next season. ``They got to want you. You got to want to stay.
I think they know where I'm coming from. I'm not sure where they're
coming from. I'd like to finish my career in a Padres uniform. I
think they would like me to, but when is going to be the
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once, Gwynn said, has he considered leaving the Padres, and
that was after the 1993 season, when the team jettisoned its
high-priced players and started over with youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   His father, he recalled, urged him to ask to be traded, but he
resisted, deciding San Diego was where he belonged. But theirs
became an unfinished argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died a couple days later, never really giving me a chance
to explain to him why I decided to stay,'' Gwynn said. Charles
Gwynn, 61, took ill that winter, his son explained, the flu leading
to a massive _ and fatal _ heart attack. In the intervening years,
the son has made certain to include the father in his experiences,
good and bad. Periodically, Tony gazes skyward and has a one-sided
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year in the World Series,'' Gwynn related, ``I'm standing
out in right field at Yankee Stadium before they came to bat in the
first inning looking up to the sky. I know people were wondering
what's he looking at it. All my years in the big leagues I dreamed
about playing at Yankee Stadium. I told my dad, `If you could be
here, I know you would have loved seeing this place because it's
awesome.'''
</P>
<P>
   There were times, too, last year, he said, when he looked up and
told his father he stunk. He added, ``I don't hear words coming
back, but I imagine what he would be saying.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly knows what his father would say about the impending
celebration in his career. ``Being there for 3,000, he would really
have a kick,'' Gwynn said. ``I told him early on that's what I
wanted to do. He told me if you work hard enough you can get there.
There haven't been a lot of believers that I could get there, but
he was one. He would really have gotten a kick out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Gwynn will not miss out when it happens. As soon as
Gwynn gets to first base, he will look skyward. The conversation
will be worth hearing.  &QL;

 &HT;    Chinese spying `pervasive,' panel's report will reveal
 &HT;    (EDS: Cox News Service EXCLUSIVE _ please credit. Also moved to
(a) General news category.)
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chinese spying at American nuclear laboratories has
been more widespread than originally believed and aroused
suspicions in the Energy Department earlier than previously
reported, according to the chairman of a special House committee
probing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pervasive,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.), who
was appointed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich last summer to
investigate whether sensitive technology was transferred to the
Chinese during the launches of commercial satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Cox says the committee will spell out in its
yet-to-be-declassified 700-page report that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Spying at the Los Alamos laboratory, where the atomic bomb was
developed, was first suspected by a Department of Energy
intelligence officer in 1992, three years earlier than previously
reported and four years before the White House was briefed on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   _ In addition to gathering sensitive information at Los Alamos,
spies working for the People's Republic of China obtained
classified U.S. nuclear weapons information at four other American
laboratories. Cox declined to identify the labs.
</P>
<P>
   _ China has obtained design information on nuclear warheads in
addition to the much publicized acquisition of information about
the Trident II (W-88), the most sophisticated weapon in the U.S.
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Interagency conflicts among the Justice Department, the CIA
and the Energy Department led to delays in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Loose controls over sales of supercomputers have resulted in
the Chinese obtaining sophisticated technology to conduct ``virtual
weapons tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich selected Cox to investigate American technology
transfers to China after allegations surfaced that the Chinese had
made campaign contributions to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   But 75 witnesses and 24 hearings later, the findings are less
about the Clinton administration and more about how the Chinese
have infiltrated American laboratories, taking with them top secret
information about how to manufacture nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The committee unraveled a trail of espionage and national
security concerns that date back to the Carter administration and
continued throughout Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an investigation of the Clinton administration;
this was an investigation of espionage by the People's Republic of
China,'' Cox said. ``It happens that the espionage has gone on
through several administrations and continues on to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee recommended the administration conduct an
overall assessment of the espionage damage.
</P>
<P>
   A one-page, declassified summary of that assessment, which
contains few details, concluded: ``China obtained, by espionage,
classified U.S. nuclear weapons information that probably
accelerated its program to develop future nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox and ranking Democratic Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington gave
their findings to the president last week during a 90-minute
briefing in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   George Tenet, the director of the CIA, and Robert Walpole, a CIA
expert on strategic and nuclear programs, briefed House and Senate
members on the threat of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Samore, a senior official of the National Security Council
who was at the briefing, said there is good evidence that China
obtained nuclear weapons information from U.S. laboratories in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that this might be ongoing, which is why the
president ordered that security be strengthened at the labs,''
Samore said.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee's findings leave unanswered questions about
U.S. policy toward China, according to Cox.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Energy Department more than a year before it heeded
the FBI's 1997 recommendations to strengthen security at weapons
laboratories and restrict the Chinese suspect's access to
classified information.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics contend the Clinton administration hesitated
because it was trying to craft trade policy with China and did not
want to hear about possible lapses in security at nuclear labs.
</P>
<P>
   The White House flatly disputed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are trying to use this to undercut our policy
toward China,'' said Jim Kennedy, special counsel to the president.
``The two issues are not connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Samore points to a presidential directive from February 1998
ordering strengthening of security at laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   But that directive was too late, Cox said. It is an example of
how the departments did not communicate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a number of dysfunctions'' between agencies, Cox
said. ``The Justice Department does not share information with the
intelligence community really as completely as it should.''
</P>
<P>
   Take the Los Alamos espionage case as an example, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Espionage was first suspected in 1992 by Notra Trulock, an
intelligence official at the Energy Department, who alerted
superiors. Trulock was subpoenaed to testify several times before
the Cox committee.
</P>
<P>
   During that testimony, the committee learned that Trulock did
not share evidence of spying with the FBI until late 1995 and early
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department and the FBI began an investigation. By
April of 1996, they had enough information to brief Sandy Berger,
who at the time was President Clinton's deputy national security
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Samore said Berger's briefing in April 1996 was focused on the
loss of information pertaining to the Trident II (W-88). Soon
afterward, the Justice Department opened an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In July of 1997, Trulock delivered a more expansive briefing at
the White House, Samore said. As a result, Clinton ordered security
tightened at all labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acted very appropriately, very decisively,'' Samore said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's committee has drafted a batch of 10 bills that he hopes
Congress will enact to improve national security and clamp down on
the Chinese spy network.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee has drafted other recommendations on the
espionage problem, among them a call for the president to deliver
an espionage assessment to the leadership of the House and the
Senate every six months.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have warned about the transfer of technology to China
say the report's recommendations should be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are clearly moving in the direction of having
hundreds of warheads aimed at the U.S. _ all mounted on systems
that will be much more difficult for the U.S. to target or
defend,'' said Henry Sokolski, executive director of the
Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan
think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese will also have the capability to improve their
weapons reaching throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger question _ if the milk is spilled, how do we deal
with the consequences?'' Sokolski said. ``I don't know how we will
clean it up.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JOHN FRANCO SAVORS HIS HOME PLATE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: UPDATES 5th graf, Franco reached ..., with Franco not
pitching in Mets' loss on Tuesday night; Pickup 6th graf pvs, In
addition ...) 
 (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On his rare forays into the hinterlands, John Franco
has made an amazing discovery. The pizza is not as good in the
suburbs, and neither is the bread. It's a fact. Something about
being outside the five boroughs curdles the dough, or spoils it, or
whatever it is that goes wrong with dough.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason alone, Franco cannot leave. He is a true prince
of the city. He made the schlep across the ``Saturday Night Fever''
Bridge from Brooklyn to Staten Island in search of a back yard for
his two children, but that's as far from Bensonhurst as he cares to
live.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is the greatest city in the country, in the world,''
Franco said Tuesday, displaying normal New York moderation.
</P>
<P>
   For that plug alone, Franco deserves an award from New York, but
Tuesday Franco was given the key to the city. The son of a
sanitation worker, the kid from the projects, the St. John's boy
who came home was honored for his rather exciting body of work as
the ace relief pitcher of the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Franco reached 400 saves a couple weeks ago, and now has 404. He
did not pitch Tuesday night in the Mets' 6-2 loss to the San Diego
Padres at blustery Shea Stadium. His total is the second highest in
major league history, behind the 478 of Lee Smith, now retired.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to acting as the unofficial spokesman for the
countless pizzerias and delis of his hometown, Franco has also done
wonders for the cardiology profession, inducing thousands of
late-hour calls from patients shouting, ``Doctor, Doctor, I've got
arrhythmia,'' only to have the cardiologist say, ``Relax, Johnny'll
get the next guy,'' which he does, more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   Even Franco saw the humor of his epic ninth innings while Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani was reading a tribute to Franco inside City Hall,
in front of Mets officials and Franco relatives and pals from the
old neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four hundred times under that kind of pressure, where there's
almost no room for error,'' the mayor intoned.
</P>
<P>
   Franco twitched noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more pressure there is, the better he pitches,'' the mayor
continued.
</P>
<P>
   A nervous grin crossed Franco's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never given Mets fans a dull moment,'' added the
notorious Yankee fan.
</P>
<P>
   Franco raised his eyes to the heavens, as if to say, ``Man, you
got that right.''
</P>
<P>
   The key ceremony ended, and segued immediately into a mayoral
news conference. While the Mets' contingent was filing out, news
reporters began questioning Giuliani on why he had suggested the
city's school system be ``blown up,'' surely an interesting choice
of words given the recent tragedy in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   While this typical New York bombast was going on, Franco stood
in the hallway and recalled his childhood in a housing development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was lower-middle class, sure,'' Franco said with immense
pride. ``We'd wear sweatshirts and sweatpants to bed in the winter
because the heater didn't work, and there was no air conditioning
in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was about 10, he and his older brother, Jimmy, would
collect the tops of Borden's milk containers and exchange them for
Mets tickets _ 20 containers for a ticket was the going rate, he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would take the B train to Times Square and change to the 7
train to Flushing,'' he said. ``We'd sit in the upper deck.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite player was Tug McGraw, the ebullient lefty
reliever. Now another hyper lefty has become the all-time Mets
relief pitcher, in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough place,'' Franco admitted. ``When I came in here
with Cincinnati in 1986, you'd see the standing ovations for the
Mets. It was great. But you need a thick skin to play here.''
</P>
<P>
   He has heard the cheers, and he has heard the yowls when he let
a lead get away, and a few times he has seemed to aim a glare or
the odd gesture at the mob. But he understands.
</P>
<P>
   He wishes his parents could see all this, but Mary Franco died
of ovarian cancer in 1986, and 14 months later Jim Franco died of a
heart attack while driving his sanitation truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to buy him a condo and a car in Florida, so he
could go to spring training with me,'' Franco said. ``I get a tear
in my eye when I think about them. I can see losing one, but losing
two within 14 months. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Life goes on. He met his wife, Rose Morrone, when they were 15,
at a discotheque, in Brooklyn. There were house-hunting expeditions
to New Jersey and Long Island, ``but it just didn't feel right,''
Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   He's a city kid, who dreamed of playing for the Mets, and now he
does, and that feels right.

DEVILS GLADLY ACCEPT GIFTS FROM BARRASSO
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ In the previous two seasons, the Devils were
frustrated during the playoffs by the goaltending of the Rangers'
Mike Richter and Ottawa's Damian Rhodes. Tuesday night, they
finally ran into an ineffective goaltender as the Penguins' Tom
Barrasso allowed a couple of soft goals in the Devils' 4-2 victory
at the Civic Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils evened the four-of-seven-game opening-round series at
two games each. Game 5 will be played in the Continental Arena on
Friday night and Game 6 here Sunday. If a seventh is necessary, it
will be held in New Jersey next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils ended a streak of seven consecutive road playoff
losses that began with their surprising 1997 second-round ouster by
the Rangers and extended into last year's first-round elimination
by the Senators.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rolston, Randy McKay, Sergei Brylin and Scott Stevens beat
Barrasso.
</P>
<P>
   Jaromir Jagr, the Penguins' star, was sidelined for the third
straight game with a strained groin. Center Martin Straka, who
scored three goals in the Penguins' 4-2 victory in Game 3, was
knocked off the puck nearly every time he touched it. Martin
Brodeur, the Devils' goalie, had a rather easy night, but allowed
goals to Jan Hrdina and Rob Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur faced only 18 shots while Barrasso faced 39.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils scored 1 minute 38 seconds into the game when
Rolston's blistering shot from just inside the blue line went in
between Barasso's pads with the Penguins on a power play. It was
Rolston's sixth short-handed goal of the season and the league-high
15th allowed by Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, we got some big breaks tonight,'' Rolston said.
``I was surprised that I beat him from so far. We wanted to throw
pucks at him and force him to make the saves.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolston's goal, which came while the Devils were killing a
holding penalty to McKay, provided the first sign that Barrasso
would not be stealing a game for his team.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Bombardir, a Devils defenseman, said: ``We challenged
ourselves before the game to raise it to a higher level and we came
out and played hard. Now we've got to get the momentum back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hrdina brought the Penguins even just 72 seconds later when he
beat Brodeur from close range on the left after a cross-ice pass
from Brown during the same penalty to McKay.
</P>
<P>
   McKay atoned for his penalty with 42 seconds left in the period.
Standing in front of Barrasso, McKay deflected Brylin's shot into
the net, then seemed surprised that the puck went in.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-one seconds after the first intermission, the Devils
extended their lead to 3-1 when Brylin's shot from the left circle
beat Barrasso on another soft goal.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur wasn't much sharper at the other end on Brown's first
goal in the series. His glove reaction was slow as Brown's shot
from the left circle sailed into the net at 7:28.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens restored the Devils' two-goal lead in the third period
by scoring three seconds before the end of a power play on a shot
from near the blue line on which Barrasso was screened by McKay.
That goal, at 2:50, followed a penalty on Pittsburgh for having men
many men on the ice after during a poor line change.
</P>
<P>
   Barrasso's best moment came with 9:44 left when he denied Brylin
on a breakaway and then covered up Holik's rebound by falling on
his back. But the damage had already been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between today and Sunday was that we played for
60 minutes,'' said Bobby Holik, the Devils' center, who had three
assists. ``We got a good effort from everybody and it makes us
happy. Now we have to carry the same effort to our home ice.''

MONDESI UNHAPPY WITH SWITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Dodgers manager Davey Johnson wants to jump-start a
stagnant offense, so he moved right fielder Raul Mondesi out of the
cleanup spot.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who says the Dodgers lack confidence in him, wasn't
pleased about the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to (move in the lineup) after two or three weeks
when the season is six months long,'' Mondesi said before hitting a
two-run homer to give the Dodgers a 3-2 win against Milwaukee on
Tuesday. ``It happens every year. The same (stuff). How come they
change me? Every year it's the same (stuff). That's why when they
talked about (a possible) trade four months ago, I said, `Fine.' I
don't care anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who added he doesn't want to be traded, batted fifth
while Eric Karros moved up a slot and hit in his familiar fourth
spot. But even after getting two hits and scoring twice, Mondesi
wasn't going to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't show what you can do in two or three weeks,''
Mondesi said. ``If I was hitting .150 with one homer and two RBI,
that's fine, but I feel good. Whatever they want, that's fine. I
just want to play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi leads the Dodgers with eight homers and 16 RBI, with
four homers and six RBI in the last 14 games. None of the Dodgers
are hitting well with runners on second or third, including
Mondesi. He's batting .263, but just .174 with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, Johnson tried to bat Mondesi third but scrapped
that plan quickly when Mondesi failed to show patience at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   However, through the first three weeks of the season, the right
fielder is taking more pitches. He's tied for fifth in the National
League with 15 walks and is averaging 3.96 pitches per plate
appearance. Last year Mondesi averaged 3.51.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mondi's pressing a little bit,'' Johnson said. ``It's
not that he's done a bad job hitting cleanup. I thought maybe just
a little bit of a change, maybe for a few days, and see how it
goes. I think, by and large, he may have tried to hit the ball out
of the ballpark. It's a mental thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida bill clears hurdle: The Florida Senate voted unanimously
to send a bill to Gov. Jeb Bush that would provide $7.5 million to
Indian River County and Vero Beach in their quest to buy Dodgertown
and keep the Dodgers in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be provided over two years. The $7.5 million is
crucial in Vero Beach's quest to keep the Dodgers, who have trained
there for 51 years. The Florida community needs to raise
approximately $20 million to purchase Dodgertown from the Dodgers.
The money would also be used for renovation of the complex.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are also exploring a move to the Fort McDowell
Indian Reservation just outside of Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Dodgers catcher Rick Wilkins cleared
waivers and reported to Triple-A Albuquerque.... Third baseman
Adrian Beltre left the game in the ninth after a ball hit his knee
earlier in the game, but he's not expected to miss any time....
Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield returned to Milwaukee for the
first time since being traded to San Diego before the 1992
season.... When L.A.'s Eric Young was thrown out trying to steal
second in the eighth inning by Dave Nilsson, it was the first time
in 18 attempts a Brewers catcher has thrown out a would-be base
stealer.... None of the three games against Milwaukee are on
television, a combination of scheduling conflicts with hockey and
basketball, an early start Thursday (11 a.m. in Los Angeles) and
the lack of Brewers television appeal, a Dodgers official said.

   STANKOVIC I REFUGEE CAMP, Macedonia _ Those who want food by
noon know to be up well before dawn, for the bread lines have
become impossibly long. The wait is normally in the rain.
Latecomers seem to leave without milk and with only two bananas
instead of the usual four. The old plead with the young to save
them a spot and spare them the wearying ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Portable toilets were tried _ colorful booths that said Toi Toi
on the side with the first ``i'' dotted in the shape of a heart.
Refugees quit using them after a week when the sensory assault
became too foul to endure. They now go outdoors, standing over
holes cut into a wood platform. Privacy is provided by sheets of
plastic, though at night the Macedonian policemen seem to take
pleasure in watching female silhouettes lit up through the curtains
with a searchlight.
</P>
<P>
   Water is carried in plastic jugs from a few central spigots.
There are no metal pans. To heat the water, the jugs are placed
over a fire made with scraps of wood, but it is hard to get it warm
enough before the flames burn through the plastic and the water
pours out
</P>
<P>
   Tents come in beige or green in cone shapes, A-frames or
rectangles. Early on, they were put up with adequate space between
them, as in a Boy Scout campground. Now, they are crammed
side-by-side and the camp is a heaving metropolis of fabric.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, 4,000 more Kosovo Albanian refugees arrived at the
Macedonian border, a spurt in an exodus that has brought 11,000
people in the past four days and, United Nations aid workers say,
158,000 in little more than a month. About 61,000 of the refugees
are living in tent cities, and the supply of people has once again
outstripped the supply of emergency shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have passed the breaking point,'' said Paula Ghedini,
spokeswoman for the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees. ``New arrivals will be sleeping in the open.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not a shortage of tents but a lack of allotted
space to put them. There are eight camps at present, and the
Macedonian government has approved land for only one more _ in
Cegrane, 45 miles west of Skopje, the capital. This new settlement
was supposed to be ready by Thursday, but there have been
infuriating delays in construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Macedonians gave the job to a local contractor,'' said Ron
Redmond, another refugee agency spokesman. ``These guys put in an
eight-hour day and then go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Several international aid groups are ready to finish the job
more rapidly, he said, but the government has so far stuck with its
choice for the work.
</P>
<P>
   Places like Stankovic, at the foot of the lush green mountains
northwest of Skopje, are overwhelmed. Nearly half of those residing
in the camps are here in this one, living an unsightly existence in
the incongruity of a beautiful location.
</P>
<P>
   Laundry is strung between virtually all the tents, though it is
hard to tell whether the clothes have been hung out for washing or
drying. While an April day in these mountains includes searing heat
and bracing cold, all temperatures seem to arrive with rain.
</P>
<P>
   Mud is attached to every shoe like plaster. ``I would give
anything to have a real bath,'' said Magribe Neziri, a teacher who
said she was chased from her village by the Serbs on April 17. ``I
am grateful for the camps, but I do have complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   She had spent six hours waiting to use one of the few
telephones. The line went dead just before her turn came. ``It
should not be so hard to get to a telephone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But these are irritations, not perils. Disease is at bay.
Medical care is available. No one is starving. This is not a camp
of putrefying corpses like those sheltering the refugees from
Rwanda after mass killings in 1994, or an assemblage of the
starving as in Ethiopia 10 years before that.
</P>
<P>
   Camp life is hard but hardly horrific. A society is taking shape
here _ a demonstration of both human flaws and fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   A woman fashioned a broom out of a leafy branch in order to
sweep the loose dirt off the hard dirt in front of her tent.
Children without toys found playful uses for plastic bottles and
carved hopscotch squares into the ground. Boys met girls and they
made love, paying a fee to an entrepreneur who has turned his tent
into a motel.
</P>
<P>
   Several refugees who had volunteered to help the aid agencies
have undertaken small businesses with donated goods. Some of them
proudly confessed their misdeeds if not their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are hiding the best food, these rascals,'' complained
Zemrije Bela, a woman from Kacanik waiting in a bread line in the
rain. ``I have heard that things are being brought into this camp
and we are not getting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other volunteers described with chagrin what goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them steal boxes of chocolates, cheese, bananas and
juice,'' said Ganc Broqi, a 20-year-old from Pec. ``Oh yes, and
blankets. These all can be sold or traded or given away. Some
people stockpile these items, just to have them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most sought-after thing is finding a way out of the
camp, usually available only to those with relatives already in the
country. There are other ways to depart, though they can be costly
for people who have fled their homes with few possessions. At least
one Macedonian garbage crew charges $80 for a ride out, one
employee said. And refugees say that some policemen charge $100.
</P>
<P>
   The camp is many things _ the smell of rotting orange peel,
teen-agers trying to play volleyball without a net, gray woolen
blankets used to carpet a floor, 200 women washing clothes by
taking turns among four faucets, shafts of light streaming in
through the flaps of the tents, a little boy who has stopped eating
out of fear.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a hothouse of hatred, the seeds of which have been
carried in from Kosovo. Refugees tell their stories to each other,
trading tragedies, cursing Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the troubles of people here are caused by the Serbs, who
are beasts,'' said Ibrahim Pllashniku of Pristina. ``Who else but
beasts come into your house, hold a knife to your throat and steal
your money?''
</P>
<P>
   Pllashniku's tribulations were made more difficult by the
paralysis his wife suffers in her legs and left arm. In the final
part of their journey to the border, he had to carry her for
several miles, then return to get her wheel chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot go to the bathroom by myself anymore,'' his elderly
wife whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Hamit Beqiri, a big, robust man and father of two, said he was
taken captive by Serbian soldiers, and they made him and 30 other
men build fortifications against NATO air raids. He escaped by
bribing three of the guards with most of his life savings
</P>
<P>
   ``Are Serbs good people?'' he asked his 5-year-old son, Egzon.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, confused, said, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who stole our money, burned our house and took our car?'' the
father asked impatiently.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Egzon was in tune. ``The filthy Serbs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what should you do if you meet a Serb like Slobodan
Milosevic?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will kill him,'' the boy said.
