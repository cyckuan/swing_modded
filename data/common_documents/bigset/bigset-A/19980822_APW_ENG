	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While an unrelenting push has put
Serb special forces within earshot of some rebel outposts, the
guerillas in dusty villages in central Kosovo shrug off their
recent defeats.
	   ``We might have lost some battles, but we will win the war,''
Agim Kuci, the lanky commander of Kosovo Liberation Army forces in
southwest Kosovo, said Friday. ``We have founded an army that will
free all of Kosovo and is prepared to die for it!''
	   A string of defeats for the ethnic Albanian militants, fighting
to wrest control of Kosovo province from Serbia, culminated last
weekend in the fall of Junik, a village near Albania and their main
organizational, logistical and weapons-distribution center.
	   With the rebels also on the defensive in the central Drenica
region, the cradle of their insurgency, the territory they control
has shrunk dramatically.
	   Plumes of smoke drifted into the sky Friday above Drenica.
Houses were burning in villages taken long ago by the Serbs,
evidence to the Kosovo fighters that their enemy wanted to destroy,
not just defeat, the province's Albanian community.
	   In Malisevo, once a main rebel center, the roads were filled
with armored vehicles of the army of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
	   The start of enemy-held territory begins southwest of town,
where a checkpoint is manned by ethnic Albanians with submachine
guns. Some are dressed in camouflage uniforms bearing the black
eagle emblem of their guerrilla movement.
	   Their regional headquarters is little more than a mile away in a
village they refuse to identify for security reasons.
	   There, Kuci, the KLA commander, explained why he thinks the
Serbs face ultimate defeat, despite overwhelming firepower.
	   ``They are throwing in everything they have _ planes, tanks,
artillery, heavy machine guns _ to gain just a tiny bit of
ground,'' he says. ``That's not something they will be able to
sustain. In time, we will see their forces diminishing, even as our
forces gain in strength.''
	   The numbers are indeed on the KLA's side.
	   Kosovo is in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic. Ethnic
Albanians make up more than 90 percent of the province's
population, forcing the Serbs to bring in forces from the rest of
Serbia. Many are reluctant to fight.
	   But the guerrillas can recruit from a large pool of young and
enthusiastic homegrown supporters. Adem Demaci, the KLA political
spokesman, said Friday that the KLA force has grown to 30,000 in
recent weeks.
	   He said the Serb crackdown has turned an untested force into
``an experienced army which no longer knows fear and can easily
fight the Serbs'' through guerrilla tactics ``much more dangerous''
than classic warfare.
	   Many of the dozens of fighters sighted during a tour of the
region southwest of Malisevo were in their teens or early 20s.
Their weapons were old Kalashnikov submachine guns or Chinese-made
bolt-action rifles smuggled from Albania. But their enthusiasm was
high.
	   ``I left my wife in Switzerland to come back and fight,'' said
Bekhim Hajdari, 28. ``And I will die for my homeland if I need
to.''

Pakistan distances itself from U.S. strikes _ but not too far
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's precarious position was
never clearer than on the dark, rainy night when the missiles of
one ally roared across its skies to strike the territory of
another.
	   In the morning light, Pakistani officials carefully navigated a
middle course, distancing itself from the United States without
straying too close to Afghanistan.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said the attacks on Afghanistan as
well as Sudan Thursday were aimed at rooting out extremist
violence, personified in Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, who is
convinced America threatens Islam. Bin Laden is accused of
directing worldwide attacks from hide-outs in Afghanistan .
	   ``Irrespective of the motive of these strikes,'' Pakistani
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz told his senate Friday, ``the act of
violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of these
Islamic countries cannot but be a matter of grave concern to the
people of Pakistan who justifiably feel outraged.''
	   But Aziz was also quick to note his country's firm opposition
``to terrorism in all its manifestations.''
	   ``Clearly Pakistan is caught between two allies,'' said Maleeha
Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington. ``Whatever it
does there are costs. It's not an enviable position to be in.''
	   On terrorism, Pakistan has hinted at frustration with
Afghanistan's Taliban rulers.
	   In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Aziz said
Pakistan was trying to use its influence to persuade the Taliban to
adopt a more responsible international stance on terrorism.
	   ``People do overestimate our leverage on the Taliban,'' the
foreign minister added.
	   Some say Pakistan nurtured, if not created, the Taliban in hopes
that by influencing the course of Afghanistan, it would be a power
in central Asia. It is one of the few countries to recognize the
Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan.
	   The United States has offered no such recognition to the
Taliban. While Washington and Islamabad differ sharply on
Afghanistan, they have been close partners in other areas, and
Washington is an important donor to this poor Islamic country.
	   In the 1980s, Pakistan and the United States supported Afghan
groups against Soviet invaders and a Moscow-installed government.
	   But when the communists were defeated, Washington began to worry
about the potential for terrorism brewing among war-hardened Arabs
who had come to the region to help the Afghans. At U.S. urging,
Pakistan expelled hundreds of the men known as Arab Afghans from
its Afghan border town of Peshawar.
	   In 1995, Pakistan extradited Ramzi Yusuf, the convicted
mastermind of the New York World Trade Center bombing and an Arab
Afghan, to the United States.
	   Two years later, Pakistan allowed U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents to operate on its soil, capturing Mir Aimal
Kasi and spiriting him back to the United States, where he was
convicted of murder in a 1993 shooting spree outside CIA
headquarters.
	   Each case sparked criticism _ sometimes violent _ in Pakistan.
Politicians here must answer to a vocal minority at home that often
portrays the United States as an enemy of Islam.
	   Already weakened by an economic crisis and other domestic
issues, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government cannot afford to
appear to have abandoned an Islamic neighbor. Particularly one like
the Taliban, whose extreme form of Islam mirrors that of some of
the most prominent Islamist parties in Pakistan and could threaten
the government.
	   The specter of day after day of protests like the anti-American
demonstrations that erupted across Pakistan Friday is sobering to
anyone who wants to convince the outside world Pakistan is a safe
place to invest and visit _ and an image the government does not
want.

Bomb found in Indonesia's tallest building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Police defused a small bomb that was
discovered in Indonesia's tallest building, newspapers reported
Saturday.
	   The explosive device was found by a security guard at 3 a.m.
Friday near a toilet door on the ground floor of the 50-story Wisna
BNI 46 tower, authorities said.
	   There were no claims of responsibility and police declined to
speculate on who may have planted the bomb.
	   The device was placed in a 10 by 20 centimeter (4 by 8 inches)
box and was equipped with a timer, The Jakarta Post quoted Col.
Jacky Uly, commander of the national police bomb squad, as saying.
	   The bomb was set to explode at 3 p.m. Friday, 12 hours after it
was found, Jacky said.
	   The office tower houses operations of Bank Indonesia, the
central bank, which has been at the center of efforts to revive the
nation's paralyzed economy.
	   The city's American Club, a fashionable restaurant and the
offices of about 100 companies are also in the building.

 &UR; Eds: INCLUDES Astros-Brewers, second game of Cardinals-Mets
doubleheader. Will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa hit his 49th home run Friday and the
Chicago Cubs rallied for two runs in the bottom of the ninth inning
to beat the San Francisco Giants 6-5.
	   Trailing 5-4 in the bottom of the ninth, Sosa singled with one
out off Robb Nen (7-4) and Mark Grace walked. Henry Rodriguez then
lofted a broken bat single to right to drive in Sosa and tie the
game.
	   Jose Hernandez singled down the right-field line over a drawn in
infield as Nen blew his fourth save in 35 opportunities.
	   Felix Heredia (1-3) got two outs for the victory.
	   Sosa moved within two of Mark McGwire's major league home run
lead. His 49 homers ties Andrew Dawson for second most in club
history, a mark Dawson set in 1987.
	   The club and National League record is 56 set by Hack Wilson in
1930.
	   Kerry Wood, without a victory in four starts since July 31,
allowed five hits and three runs in six innings and gave up Jeff
Kent's two-run homer in the sixth, his 21st.
 &UR; Braves 5, Padres 4 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, John Smoltz survived a shaky beginning for his
seventh straight win and Atlanta maintained its exclusive hold on
the top record in the NL.
	   The Braves pushed their lead over the Padres back to two games
in a race that could be significant in October. For the first time,
the team with the best record is assured of home-field advantage
throughout the league playoffs.
	   Smoltz (12-2) fell behind 3-0 in the first inning but bounced
back to retire 11 in a row before tiring in the seventh. The
right-hander, who hasn't lost since June 26, allowed eight hits and
four walks but struck out eight.
	   The Braves bullpen was outstanding. John Rocker came on with one
out in the seventh and threw one pitch, getting Steve Finley to hit
into a double play with two runners on.
	   Rudy Seanez struck out the side in the eighth and Kerry
Ligtenberg pitched the ninth for his 21st save. Atlanta's new
closer has not allowed an earned run in 19 games.
	   Andres Galarraga spurred the Atlanta comeback with his 39th
homer, a two-run shot off Joey Hamilton (10-11).
 &UR; Cardinals 10, Mets 5, 1st game &QC; 
 &UR; Mets 1, Cardinals 0, 2nd game &QC; 
	   In New York, Mark McGwire did not get any closer to Roger Maris
in this doubleheader.
	   After getting a pinch-hit, RBI double in a 10-5 first-game win
over the New York Mets, McGwire struck out three times and walked
as the St. Louis Cardinals lost the second game 1-0.
	   McGwire, who homered twice Wednesday and two more times in
Thursday's doubleheader to reach 51, has 34 games remaining to
reach Maris' record of 61.
	   Armando Reynoso (5-0) won his fifth consecutive start since
coming off the disabled list, allowing three hits in seven innings
with seven strikeouts and six walks. Turk Wendell pitched the
eighth and John Franco finished for his 28th save.
	   Edgardo Alfonzo's 10th homer of the season came in the first
inning against Manny Aybar (3-7), activated between games.
	   New York, which played seven games in a four-day span, dropped
into a tie in the wild-card race with the Chicago Cubs.
	   In the opener, Matt Morris (4-3) shut down the Mets for seven
innings and hit a tiebreaking single.
	   Hideo Nomo (5-11) lost his third straight start.
 &UR; Astros 5, Brewers 2 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Richard Hidalgo hit a two-run homer and Jeff
Bagwell scored three times, leading the Houston Astros over the
Milwaukee Brewers.
	   The NL Central-leading Astros won for the 15th time in 21 games.
They have won seven of nine against Milwaukee this season.
	   Sean Bergman (11-6), who had two no-decisions and a loss in his
last three starts, allowed seven hits and two runs in 6 2-3
innings.
	   Jay Powell pitched the final 2 1-3 innings for his fifth save.
	   Bill Pulsipher (1-1) gave up six hits, five walks and three runs
in 5 1-3 innings.
 &UR; Dodgers 5, Marlins 1 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Chan Ho Park pitched eight innings and Raul Mondesi
hit a three-run homer for Los Angeles.
	   Adrian Beltre drove in the Dodgers' first two runs with a single
and a homer.
	   Park (11-7), who came into the game with a 6.14 career ERA
against Florida, allowed four hits and one run for his first
victory since July 30.
	   Mondesi hit his 28th homer with two out in the ninth following
singles by pinch-hitter Jim Eisenreich, a former Marlin, and Eric
Young.
	   Livan Hernandez (10-9) pitched his eighth complete game but gave
up two homers, increasing his total to 29 allowed this season. He
also drove in the Marlins' run with a single.
 &UR; Pirates 14, Reds 2 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Jason Kendall and Al Martin each hit two-run
homers as Pittsburgh had their biggest offensive game of the
season.
	   The Pirates posted a season-high for runs and had 17 hits in
winning their fifth straight game. They have reached double figures
in hits in seven of the last eight games and have hit 16 home runs
in 11 games.
	   Chris Peters (7-8) pitched the first seven innings to win his
third consecutive decision. He gave up six hits and two runs with
one walk and four strikeouts.
	   Reds starter Brett Tomko (11-9) pitched 2 1-3 innings, allowing
six runs and seven hits.
	   Tony Womack drove in three runs and Kevin Young went 3-for-5 for
the Pirates.
 &UR; Phillies 1, Diamondbacks 0 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Mark Portugal recorded his 100th career
victory, helping himself with an alert defensive play.
	   Portugal (8-3) pitched 7 1-3 innings, allowing five singles and
three walks. He struck out six and improved to 100-81 lifetime.
	   The 12-year veteran won for the first time at Veterans Stadium
since he signed with the Phillies in 1997, a span of 10 starts. He
missed most of last year because of elbow trouble.
	   Mark Lewis hit an RBI single with two outs in the fourth off
Omar Daal (6-8), and Portugal and the Phillies bullpen made the run
stand up.
 &UR; Rockies 3, Expos 2 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Vinny Castilla hit his 37th homer with two outs in
the top of the ninth to lift Colorado.
	   Castilla homered off Ugueth Urbina (4-3) to send Montreal to its
ninth loss in 11 games.
	   Dave Veres (1-1) got four outs for the victory as the Rockies
won their sixth straight over the Expos. Montreal put the tying run
at third but pinch-hitter Robert Perez popped out to Veres.

	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ David Wells pitched a six-hitter and
Tino Martinez homered twice Friday night as the New York Yankees
snapped a rare two-game losing streak with 5-0 victory over the
Texas Rangers.
	   Wells (16-2) finally solved the Rangers, who had rallied from
nine- and three-run deficits to beat him this season. He struck out
seven and walked one in his fourth shutout.
	   Wells, who entered with a 12.46 ERA against the Rangers this
year, has won eight straight decisions.
	   The Yankees, who have lost two in a row seven times this year,
have lost three straight just once _ the first three games of the
season.
	   Chuck Knoblauch and Derek Jeter also homered for New York.
	   Knoblauch hit the third pitch from Esteban Loaiza (1-3) into the
left-field seats for his 17th homer, the most by a Yankees second
baseman since Joe Gordon hit 17 in 1943.
	   Martinez, who went 3-for-4, hit a solo homer in the fourth
inning to make it 2-0 and give him 100 RBIs for the third
consecutive season. He is the first Yankee to do it since Don
Mattingly had at least 100 RBIs from 1984-87.
 &UR; Red Sox 9, Twins 2 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Damon Buford and Nomar Garciaparra each hit
three-run homers and Steve Avery pitched a season-high seven
innings for Boston.
	   Garciaparra went 3-for-5 with four RBIs and Mo Vaughn drove in
two runs for the Red Sox. Four Twins pitchers helped Boston with
eight walks and two wild pitches.
	   Avery (9-5) allowed four hits, walked three and struck out one.
He avenged a loss to the Twins last Sunday when he was tagged for
six runs and nine hits in three innings. It was his first
appearance in the Metrodome since Oct. 26, 1991, when he started
Game 6 of the World Series for Atlanta.
	   Minnesota rookie starter Eric Milton (7-10) allowed just one hit
and three runs but walked five in just 1 2-3 innings.
	   The Twins have lost 15 of 20 in August.
 &UR; Indians 6, Orioles 3 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Jaret Wright beat Baltimore for the second time in
five days and Cleveland took the luster off a big night for Cal
Ripken.
	   Ripken grounded an opposite-field single to right in the seventh
inning for his 2,849th career hit, eclipsing the Orioles franchise
record held by Brooks Robinson. Ripken received a lengthy standing
ovation from the sellout crowd of 48,374, the largest to attend a
regular-season game in the seven-year history of Camden Yards.
	   Rafael Palmeiro and Willie Greene homered for the Orioles, who
lost a second straight game for the first time in August. Baltimore
is 30-10 since the All-Star break but 3-3 in its last six.
	   Wright (11-7) allowed three runs and five hits in 6 2-3 innings,
walking two and striking out three.
	   He received a hand from Kenny Lofton, who reached far over the
center-field wall to steal a homer from Roberto Alomar in the
sixth.
 &UR; Royals 6, Devil Rays 5, 11 innings &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Johnny Damon and Hal Morris both
drove in runs in the 11th inning for Kansas City.
	   The Royals rallied for two runs in the ninth against Roberto
Hernandez to tie it at 4, then won it in the 10th off Esteban Yan
(4-4).
	   Damon hit a one-out single off second baseman Miguel Cairo's
glove and Morris added a sacrifice fly.
	   Matt Whisenant (2-1) worked a scoreless 10th inning for the win.
Jeff Montgomery pitched the 11th for his 27th save.

Two people killed in stampede near presidential palace

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ At least two people were killed in a
stampede Saturday outside a presidential palace office that offers
jobs and help for the poor, authorities and witnesses said.
	   The staff at the Jose Reyes Memorial Medical Center said two
women died on arrival at the emergency room and two elderly women
were confined for treatment of bruises and cuts.
	   Dozens of others were hurt in the stampede. Umbrellas, slippers,
thermos bottles, towels and other personal belongings littered the
street after the melee.
	   Ana Turla, a 29-year-old unemployed resident of suburban
Malabon, said the stampede occurred around 8 a.m. (0000 GMT) as
hundreds rushed through the gates to the Presidential Action
Center.
	   She said she was in a line for women with her sister and her
sister's sister-in-law and 64-year-old mother-in-law when a group
of men broke out of their own line and pushed people in front of
the gate, setting off the stampede.
	   ``All we were thinking of was saving the old woman,'' she said.
	   The Presidential Action Center was established soon after
President Joseph Estrada took office on June 30.
	   Since then, thousands of poor people hoping to get jobs, free
housing, legal and medical assistance have flocked to the center
near the Malacanang presidential palace.
	   They are asked to fill forms to write down what they want from
the Estrada government.
	   Miss Turla, who wants a house for her sickly mother, said they
have been waiting for the forms since 9 p.m. Friday (1300 GMT). The
waiting crowd swelled to several thousands by daybreak.
	   ``I don't think the president will make promises he cannot
fulfill,'' she said.
	   Estrada, a college drop-out and former actor, won the May 11
election on a pro-poor platform.

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Goats meander through waist-high grass in
the ruins of an old Portuguese jail on East Timor's rugged, lonely
coast. Shrubs sprout from ledges of crumbling stone.
	   Yet, in this isolated place, an attendant diligently pulled out
a guest book for a couple of visitors to sign. The last scrawled
entry was six weeks old.
	   Tourists are few in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony riven
by conflict and short of facilities for travelers. Indonesia barred
most foreign visitors until 1989, 14 years after invading and
wiping out all but a few cells of armed resistance.
	   As political reform sweeps Indonesia, local officials hope
tensions will ease in East Timor, tempting foreign divers and
hikers to check out its coral reefs, white-sand beaches and rocky
hills.
	   Maybe people curious about the territory's troubled history will
come too, they say. Tens of thousands of people died in the 1970s
in fighting and ensuing famine and disease, sullying Indonesia's
image and prompting international sympathy for the East Timorese.
	   ``We can sell the war,'' says Basilio Araujo of the East Timor
Investment Coordinating Board, a local government division.
However, East Timor's fragile political situation is likely to
deter many tourists for now.
	   In recent weeks, Indonesian soldiers shot and killed two
pro-independence demonstrators and several thousand non-East
Timorese settlers fled the territory, complaining of harassment by
the indigenous population. Separatist rebels still hide out in the
mountains.
	   Despite the turbulence, momentum for dialogue is building,
fueled by Indonesia's withdrawal of some troops.
	   On Aug. 5, Portugal and Indonesia agreed to discuss granting
East Timor autonomy after two days of talks brokered by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The agreement calls for a solution by
the end of this year.
	   Annan described the deal as ``progress,'' but said it was not a
major breakthrough.
	   No mention was made of East Timorese demands for a referendum on
independence among the province's 800,000 people.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie earlier ruled out independence
for East Timor, but offered a compromise that would entail a
measure of autonomy.
	   Jittery at times, Dili is usually a sleepy town. Palm trees,
rusting barges and a few Portuguese cannon line the waterfront.
Shops close their shutters for several hours every sweltering
afternoon and the streets empty.
	   Portuguese rose wine is cheap _ as is everything else with the
drastic devaluation of the Indonesian rupiah _ and seafood is
plentiful. The one-star Turismo and Mahkota hotels offer double
rooms for 110,500 rupiah (dlrs 8.50) a night.
	   Diners can choose a fish from a freezer at one simple restaurant
on the beach. The wait is lengthy: Many things, even the
mosquitoes, move at a leisurely pace in East Timor.
	   At the city's main marketplace, only a charred facade remains
after fire gutted the colonial-era building last year. Now colorful
tents and kiosks have sprung up amid the ruins.
	   Dili falls quiet at night. The only disco in town closed in the
tense days after soldiers fired on a crowd of pro-independence
demonstrators in 1991, killing dozens.
	   A few open-air, Spartan restaurants on the beach offer delicious
grilled fish and squid. A meal costs no more than a couple of
dollars.
	   A bottle of Portuguese-made Mateus rose wine costs 35,100 rupiah
(dlrs 2.70) in the hotel restaurants, less in the few stores that
offer it. Other wines are scarce.
	   One restaurant in Dili offering Portuguese food is Bidau Massau.
Pujasera restaurant offers dishes from the Indonesian island of
Java, and then there's the Rotterdam Steak House, which serves
steak.
	   A quarter-century ago, East Timor was a popular destination for
backpackers from neighboring Australia who stopped by on the way to
other Indonesian islands. About 1,000 foreigners with tourist visas
visited East Timor last year.
	   With Australian aid, officials now plan to renovate a handful of
Portuguese guest houses. In April, a diving company based in
Darwin, Australia, ferried eight tourists to East Timor's coral
reefs for the first time. Another trip is scheduled in November.
	   Eager for upbeat publicity, the governor's office still hands
out copies of a 1996 book extolling Indonesia's economic
development of impoverished East Timor in the wake of Portuguese
neglect. It comes complete with typographical errors.
	   ``The massage of the minister of home affairs,'' reads the title
of one introductory note.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; If You Go ...
	   GETTING THERE: There are no direct international flights to East
Timor. A roundtrip flight to the provincial capital of Dili from
the resort island of Bali on the national carrier Garuda costs
13,000 rupiah (dlrs 102). There is one flight a day. Bali is about
halfway between Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, and Dili.
	   TOURS: Tours of East Timor can be organized through Sumaflo
Agung Tour and Travel, phone 62-390-21477 or 62-390-22477. Fax:
62-390-23066. (390 is the Dili code. If inside Indonesia, callers
should dial 0390).
	   TAXIS: Renting a taxi in Dili costs between 14,950 rupiah (dlrs
1.15) and 19,500 rupiah (dlrs 1.50) an hour. Haggling on the rate
for out-of-town trips is suggested.
	   INFORMATION: East Timor tourism officials can be reached at
62-811-384-631 (a cell phone: 62 is the country code). Fax.
62-390-21010, 62-390-23366.

Japanese arrested filming Thai women with see-through camera
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two Japanese tourists were arrested
videotaping Thai women at a shopping mall with a ``see-through''
video camera hidden in a shopping bag, police said Saturday.
	   Toshinobu Oinuma and his brother Toru, both residents of Tokyo,
were arrested Friday evening and charged with attempting to produce
a pornographic video.
	   Department stores have been pulling off their shelves the models
of video cameras that allow filming in extremely low light after
they were found to also see through clothing.
	   Police said the video contained more than 60 minutes of scenes
in which young Thai women's bodies could be seen through their
clothing, although not very clearly.
	   Police believe the video was intended for commercial purposes in
Japan.
	   The accused will stand trial in Bangkok. It will be up to a
court to send them back to Japan or serve jail time in Thailand,
said the officer.

Perfume Museums: French teaching tourists about their fragrances

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Strolling the boulevards of Paris, tourists these
days are following their noses to a decidedly French institution,
the perfume museum.
	   Or to one of the new super-sized perfumeries that have sprung up
across the city like wildflowers. The Sephora perfumery opened its
doors to fragrance-lovers in France in 1993 and has since expanded
to 54 boutiques.
	   At center stage at the Sephora store on the Avenue des Champs
Elysees, one can watch the ``nose'' at the ``organ,'' the master
perfumer with a supersensitive smeller at work at a semicircular
display of hundreds of bottles of essences.
	   Perfume, you see, is not just a product to be bought and sold,
it's something to be studied.
	   ``The idea of Sephora was to help the customers see the
olfactory world and to know exactly what perfume is,'' says Pascale
Le Marechal, Sephora's spokeswoman. ``We help to develop a culture
around the perfume.''
	   The perfume organ is considered the starting point of any
first-time visit.
	   ``You are able to smell the perfumes of life here,'' Le Marechal
says. ``We let you smell the scents of coffee, tea, chalk, flowers.
Little by little, we find the scents of our childhood.''
	   The organ at Perfumer Fragonard's contains 1,000 fragrances and
the nose can detect 300 to 400 at the same time. The average person
can distinguish only six to eight.
	   Serge Kalouguine, one of the world's 200 or so noses, has been
working for Fragonard's factory in Grasse, France, for more than 30
years. He affirms the French reputation as leader in the industry.
	   ``It's by tradition,'' he says. ``The majority of perfumes got
started here. It's also a question of prestige and quality.''
	   And for the French, it is an object of pride.
	   ``Perfume is very important for us because it is part of our
patrimony,'' Kalouguine says. ``It represents the country.''
	   To learn more about the creation and history of fragrances, one
of Fragonard's two perfume museums in Paris is the place to start.
	   Guides explain Fragonard's distillation method: Flower petals
are placed in a distillation machine, steam passes through the
flowers to capture the scent, and a vapor is produced. The cooled
vapor liquefies and trickles out of a spigot at the bottom of the
machine.
	   To make a perfume, 20 percent of the essence is used; an eau de
toilette takes 15 percent essence, and a cologne is made up of 6
percent. Flower water and alcohol finish the composition.
	   Five to six tons of flower petals are used to make just two
pounds of essence.
	   At Fragonard, the current perfume trends are the fresh floral
category and the fruit-scented category such as grapefruit.
	   Le Marechal says Sephora's customer of today asks for
transparent perfumes that remind one of lightness and purity. That
also goes for the bottle's design.
	   As for the future, ``perfumes will be in every domain,''
Kalouguine says. ``From perfumed gasoline to movie theaters
perfumed with scents to coordinate with the film.''

Whitewater rafting is booming in West Virginia
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THURMOND, West Virginia (AP) _ Jon Dragan, a stranger to these
parts, watched the water spraying violently over the rocks in the
fast-moving New River. He had an itch to run those whitewater
rapids.
	   The locals laughed and shook their heads.
	   ``They said nobody goes down there,'' Dragan recalls. ``People
who do it, they die.''
	   It was 1964 and Dragan, just 18, took the risk. He had no idea
how far that first raft run would take him.
	   Today, nearly 250,000 people raft the New, Gauley and three
other West Virginia rivers, ranging in difficulty from Class I for
beginners to Class V for experts. About 40 rafting businesses
generate nearly dlrs 75 million a year.
	   And Rose Shleser of Waimamalo, Hawaii, proved this summer that
knowing how to swim isn't even necessary today.
	   ``I think it's great. It wasn't as scary as I expected,'' she
said after running that same section Dragan braved more than 30
years ago.
	   But it wasn't exactly a snooze, either. Heavy rains had left the
river 12 feet (4 meters) above normal, resulting in what Dragan
calls ``Grand Canyon-style'' whitewater.
	   Shleser watched as one raft flipped and a rafter hit his head on
a rock. She also saw another raft dump nearly its entire crew
overboard, including the guide.
	   Still, she plans to go again.
	   ``I say go for it. Just go for it,'' Shleser said while perched
on a rock, eating a picnic lunch on the riverbank. ``I'm always
reluctant, but I do a lot of water sports. I dog paddle and feel
what the life vest is like in the water.''
	   The rafting network initially consisted of about 200 people who
bounced around the country, navigating tough rivers in primitive
Army surplus rafts that required bailing, unlike the self-bailing
rafts of today.
	   ``I look back and think, 'Boy we were really stupid to use those
inadequate rafts,''' Dragan says.
	   Dragan and his younger brothers, Tom and Chris, started
Wildwater Expeditions Unlimited in 1968 _ West Virginia's first
commercial whitewater rafting business. Tom and Chris were still
teen-agers.
	   But the Dragans, of Monessen, Pennsylvania, didn't pick the New
River just because it was close to Pennsylvania's Youghiogheny
River, their first run.
	   Instead, Jon Dragan spent two years searching for the wildest,
most diverse whitewater one river could spit at him.
	   ``It had to be a year-round river, not with just good whitewater
in May and June, but all through the summer,'' he says. ``The
changeability, that's what really keeps people coming back. The New
River is always changing.''
	   Then there is the nearby Gauley River and the lush New River
Gorge.
	   The gorge is an estimated 65 million years old and holds
remnants of coal towns, a railroad depot and foundations of
once-prominent houses located along the river.
	   The New River Gorge Bridge, the world's longest steel arch span
at 1,700 feet (520 meters), also greets rafters at the end of their
journey down the Lower New.
	   While the New is the most popular, the Gauley is the toughest.
Visitors come from all over the world every fall during a 22-day
period known as Gauley Season.
	   Starting Sept. 11, the Summersville Dam is opened, allowing
thousands of gallons to pour into the river. The result: the only
Eastern river with 100 rapids, enough to give any thrill-seeker a
paddling and adrenaline workout.
	   The end of this year's Gauley Season also corresponds with
Bridge Day on Oct. 17. Hundreds of parachutists leap off the bridge
on the only day it's legal to do so.
	   Thousands of sightseers also take advantage of the prime
whitewater on Bridge Day weekend.
	   Rafting did not begin to get attention until the early 1970s.
	   Dave Arnold, managing director of Class VI River Runners and a
state tourism commissioner, says the sport got a boost from the
invention of self-bailing rafts and the addition of a kayaking
event in the 1972 Munich Olympics.
	   James Dickey's novel and the ensuing film, ``Deliverance,''
didn't hurt either.
	   ``When we first started, the whole scene was only extreme,''
Arnold says. ``Basically, now if you've got a Visa card and a pair
of tennis shoes and you're not afraid of water, you can go.''
	   And even if rafters or beginning kayakers aren't into the
``big'' Class IV and V rapids of the New and Gauley rivers, West
Virginia's Eastern Panhandle offers plenty of calmer Class I, II
and III rapids on the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers.
	   The Cheat River in the northern part of the state also is a
popular run in the spring when the water is high. But as the
weather warms, the water slows _ perfect for lazy afternoon floats.
	   ``We're very fortunate in West Virginia to have the caliber of
whitewater we have,'' Jon Dragan says. ``In less than a half a
day's drive, you can go from mild to wild.''
	   Chris Dragan, the only brother who still owns a share in
Wildwater, says rafting has its risks.
	   ``It's not a roller-coaster ride where you get strapped in, ride
and get off,'' Chris said. ``You're always dealing with Mother
Nature and just about the time you think you're getting good, the
river comes up and slaps you in the face and it tells you: 'I let
you come out and play, but the river's still in charge.'''

	    &UR; If You Go ...
	   There are about two dozen whitewater rafting outfitters on the
Ocoee River in Tennessee. Prices vary depending on time of year and
day of the week. Expect to pay about dlrs 40 per person, and to pay
in advance. Many outfitters charge you a cancellation fee in case
you chicken out.
	   Here are few outfitters:
	   Ocoee Outdoors: 1-800-533-7767.
	   Southeastern Expeditions: 1-800-868-7232.
	   Quest Expeditions: 1-800-277-4537.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   There are a variety of choices for whitewater rafting in the
South, depending on what you are looking for and your expertise.
	   The Ocoee River: A fun river in Eastern Tennessee with Class III
and IV rapids that turn beginners into rafters out of necessity.
The five-mile (8-kilometer) trip takes anywhere from 1 1-2 and 2
hours as rafters drop 275 feet (84 meters). Children must be at
least 12 and since the river is dam-controlled, it runs 116 days a
year.
	   The Chattooga: This river along the Georgia-South Carolina
border became famous in the film ``Deliverance.'' It is a
challenging river that contains Class II-IV rapids.
	   Big Pigeon: Not as intense as the Chattooga or the Ocoee, it
gives adults an exciting ride on its upper part, and allows
children as young 6 to raft in the lower river.
	   The Nolichucky: Catch this deep-canyon river in Tennessee
between March and July when the river is at its highest and most
exiciting with Class III-IV rapids.
	   The Hiwassee: This is a multipurpose big river, known as much
for its trout fishing as for its leisurely rapids. It's perfect for
family outings. It's about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the Ocoee.

Indonesian investigators visit more alleged mass grave sites
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALI KOTARUMALOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEDAN, Indonesia (AP) _ After digging up eight sets of bones,
human rights workers headed Saturday to more sites in northern
Indonesia believed to contain the remains of people killed by the
military.
	   Indonesian troops are accused of committing atrocities,
including arbitrary killings and torture, during the late 1980s and
1990s in Aceh province on Sumatra island.
	   The soldiers were trying to put down separatist guerrillas who
were fighting for an Islamic state. The number of insurgents
dwindled under the crackdown, but resentment toward the Indonesian
military runs deep among many Acehnese.
	   On Friday, grieving widows and torture victims looked on as
investigators dug up bones from remote grave sites. Two skeletons
found at one spot had holes in their skulls, probably bullet
wounds, forensic doctors said.
	   Local residents said some of the victims were Muslim teachers.
	   A four-man team from Indonesia's National Human Rights
Commission and a group of volunteers with shovels were led to
several alleged mass graves by villagers.
	   The team said it was only taking samples of human remains from
several grave sites, which locals allege contain dozens of
skeletons.
	   ``We need evidence,'' the Kompas newspaper quoted chief
investigator Baharuddin Lopa as saying.
	   The bones will be subjected to forensic tests to determine
whether they were of execution victims, officials said. Mass
exhumations would be made later.
	   The investigation into the Aceh graves is the latest sign of a
new openness in Indonesia since former autocratic President Suharto
resigned after nationwide riots in May.
	   His successor, B.J. Habibie, has promised greater human rights
for Indonesia's 202 million people.
	   Indonesia's military commander, Gen. Wiranto, has also publicly
apologized for human rights violations in Aceh and ordered the
withdrawal of about 1,000 troops. However, thousands remain
deployed in Aceh, 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of
Jakarta.

Warrant issued for fourteen Thai police charged with murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Bangkok, Thailand (AP) _ Thai authorities have issued arrest
warrants for 14 police officers suspected of murdering three men,
the police department said Saturday.
	   The officers were charged with premeditated murder and the
cover-up of their crime, said a police official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The charged detectives are from a special operations unit based
in Prachuab Khiri Khan, 230 kilometers (143 miles) south of
Bangkok. The most senior officer being sought is Col. Boonchoke
Pariyathin, who could not be reached for comment.
	   Police say the three men were killed at a check point near Hua
Hin, a popular seaside resort in the province. They would not
comment on a possible motivation. Their charred corpses were found
by a bush behind a school.

Report: Government orders soft-drink makers to reduce sugar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Soft-drink manufacturers that
continue to heap extravagant amounts of sugar into their canned
drinks will be shut down, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Such companies have ignored the government's recently launched
``Less Sugar, Please'' nationwide campaign to reduce sugar in their
products, Health Minister Dr. Chua Jui Meng was reported as saying
by The Star daily.
	   About 600,000 people out of the country's population of 22
million suffer from diabetes, but some bottle drinks contain as
much as nine teaspoonfuls of sugar each, Chua said.
	   ``They showed no interest to voluntarily reducing the among of
sugar in soft drinks,'' he said, accusing profit-driven companies
of adding sugar to their products because they believe Malaysians
have a sweet tooth.
	   Soft-drinks manufacturers that refused to cut down on sugar will
have their licenses canceled, Chua warned.
	   Domestic sugar consumption has dropped 21 percent in the first
six months of this year, but industrial use of sugar had increased
by 15 percent in the same period.
	   Malaysians on average consume about 30 teaspoons of sugar a day
each in raw form or through processed food, double the amount
recommended by the ministry, Chua said.

ARLINGTON, Texas: 27th save.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Mariners 5, White Sox 4 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Seattle, Russ Davis delivered an RBI double in the eighth
inning as the Seattle Mariners rediscovered the longball and
snapped a three-game losing streak with a victory over the Chicago
White Sox.
	   After going a season-high four games without a home run, the
Mariners got home runs from Jay Buhner and Edgar Martinez to take a
4-3 lead. Seattle leads the majors with 188 homers.
	   Albert Belle hit his 38th home run for the White Sox, tying it
in the seventh against Jeff Fassero.
	   After Buhner walked with one out in the eighth against Keith
Foulke (3-2), Davis lined a shot high off the fence in right field.
Davis was thrown out trying to stretch the hit into a triple.
	   Jose Paniagua (1-0) earned the win in relief and Mike Timlin
pitched the ninth for his 11th save.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. went 0-for-4 and remained stuck on 42 home runs.
He has only one in his last 20 games, a stretch of 81 at-bats.
 &UR; Athletics 4, Tigers 2
	   In Oakland, California, Mike Oquist won for the first time in
more than a month by pitching six strong innings as the Oakland
Athletics beat the Detroit Tigers for their fourth straight
victory.
	   Oquist (7-10) withstood solo homers by Tony Clark and Juan
Encarnacion to snap his personal five-game losing streak and
register his first win since July 13.
	   Tim Worrell pitched 2 1-3 scoreless innings and Bill Taylor got
two outs for his 26th save.
	   Oakland got to Bryce Florie (6-7) for three runs in the first
inning.
 &UR; Blue Jays 9, Angels 4
	   In Anaheim, California, Carlos Delgado homered twice and Jose
Canseco hit a two-run shot to lead the Toronto Blue Jays over the
Anaheim Angels, who played the game under protest.
	   Chris Carpenter (9-6) won his third consecutive start, allowing
two earned runs and five hits in seven innings.
	   After loading the bases with none out in the second inning, the
Angels tied it 1-1 as Tim Salmon scored on shortstop Alex
Gonzalez's one-out fielding error.
	   Gary DiSarcina followed with a fly to right that Shawn Green
lost in the lights, allowing Jim Edmonds to come home with what the
Angels thought was their second run. Carpenter backed up the plate
on the wide throw by Green and threw to third for the force on
Garret Anderson, who inexplicably broke back to second as Matt
Walbeck retreated to first _ where DiSarcina already was.
	   Third baseman Tony Fernandez, who took Carpenter's throw for the
second out, relayed to second baseman Craig Grebeck for the
inning-ending force. The umpires ruled that the run didn't count
because both outs were recorded on force plays.
	   Angels manager Terry Collins argued with plate umpire Greg Kosc
and crew chief Larry Barnett before announcing the protest.
	   The Blue Jays scored three runs in the third to take a 4-1 lead
against Jeff Juden (0-2).

Two people killed in stampede near presidential palace

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Men breaking into line set off a
stampede Saturday at a presidential office that offers jobs and
help for the poor, killing at least two people and injuring dozens,
authorities and witnesses said.
	   The staff at the Jose Reyes Memorial Medical Center said two
women died on arrival at the emergency room and two elderly women
have been hospitalized for bruises and cuts.
	   Dozens of people were hurt in the stampede. Umbrellas, slippers,
thermos bottles, towels and other personal belongings littered the
street after the melee.
	   President Joseph Estrada directed officials to check hospitals
to make sure those injured are properly cared for, presidential
spokesman Fernando Barican said.
	   Estrada, who was surprised and saddened by the stampede, has
ordered a review of the security procedures to prevent a
recurrence, he said.
	   ``This is the problem of trying to provide both openness and
access and at the same time providing a more orderly system to have
access,'' Barican said.
	   Ana Turla, a 29-year-old unemployed resident of suburban
Malabon, said the stampede occurred around 8 a.m. (0000 GMT) as
hundreds rushed through the gates to the Presidential Action
Center.
	   She said she was in a line for women with her sister and her
sister's sister-in-law and 64-year-old mother-in-law when a group
of men broke out of their own line and pushed people in front of
the gate, setting off the stampede.
	   ``All we were thinking of was saving the old woman,'' she said.
	   The Presidential Action Center was established soon after
Estrada took office on June 30.
	   Since then, thousands of poor people hoping to get jobs, free
housing, legal and medical assistance have flocked to the center
near the Malacanang presidential palace.
	   They are asked to fill forms to write down what they want from
the Estrada government.
	   Miss Turla, who wants a house for her sickly mother, said they
have been waiting for the forms since 9 p.m. Friday (1300 GMT). The
waiting crowd swelled to several thousands by daybreak.
	   ``I don't think the president will make promises he cannot
fulfill,'' she said.
	   Estrada, a college drop-out and former actor, won the May 11
election on a pro-poor platform.

Political honeymoon for Paraguay's new president lasted only days

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ Talk about a short honeymoon.
	   Less than a week ago, Raul Cubas was inaugurated as Paraguay's
president. Now Cubas is facing calls for impeachment _ and even his
brothers disapprove of his fledgling administration.
	   The uproar stems from Cubas' decision to free Gen. Lino Oviedo,
a friend and former presidential candidate who was jailed last year
in the middle of the election campaign after a power struggle
within the long-ruling Colorado Party. Cubas took over the party's
nomination and won the presidency in elections in May.
	   The decision to free Oviedo has infuriated many in the party.
Congressional detractors have called for Cubas' removal from
office.
	   ``He (Cubas) freed the man that could begin a diabolical plan to
persecute everyone who he thinks is not with him,'' said lawmaker
Juan Carlos Galaverna.
	   Oviedo ran into trouble after former President Juan Carlos
Wasmosy demanded his resignation as the army's commander in 1996.
	   Oviedo refused, and not long after he won the Colorado Party's
presidential nomination in a September 1997 primary, he was brought
before a military tribunal and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
	   Cubas, who was the Colorado Party's vice presidential nominee,
became the presidential candidate after the Supreme Court upheld
Oviedo's prison term just weeks before the elections.
	   Cubas' campaign was largely seen as an extension of the vigorous
campaign run by Oviedo, who had traveled Paraguay's countryside
giving rousing speeches in the indigenous Guarani language.
	   ``Cubas is not really a leader and he doesn't have a strong
political base,'' political analyst Carlos Martini said.
	   Cubas took office Aug. 15 and gave a well-received economic
address last Monday. But the next day, Cubas signed a decree
overriding Oviedo's sentence.
	   Cubas said his decision shouldn't have come as a surprise.
Granting freedom to Oviedo was part of his campaign platform.
	   ``I've used the constitutional power given to presidents to
fulfill a campaign promise,'' he explained during a news conference
this week.
	   Hundreds of Oviedo supporters took to the streets upon hearing
of his release, shouting slogans such as ``President Lino!'' That
jubilation was not shared by other factions in the Colorado Party _
most notably Cubas' brothers.
	   ``I hope that in a moment of illumination my brother will annul
this decree,'' said Emilio Cubas, a former Colorado senator.
Another brother, Carlos Cubas, resigned as economic minister in
protest Tuesday.
	   Colorado Party members vowed to seek impeachment. But a vote to
start such proceedings would require a two-thirds majority in both
chambers of Congress to move forward.
	   Congressional members also asked the Supreme Court to rule on
the legality of Cubas' decision.
	   Many Paraguayans said political infighting would only distract
the country from solving its problems, including a protracted
economic crisis and an international image tarred by perceptions of
rampant corruption.
	   ``The people in power are always fighting and it's the people in
the streets that always have to pay,'' said Javier Benitez, a
35-year-old electrician.
	   Maribel Gomez, 17, agreed.
	   ``It's makes no difference to me whether Oviedo is in jail or
free,'' said Gomez, a student. ``I think the most important thing
the government needs to be doing is creating jobs.''

Rainsy says violence will not deter Cambodian opposition

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ After attending the funeral of a
grenade attack victim on Saturday, a defiant Sam Rainsy said
violence and threats will not weaken his resolve to expose last
month's Cambodian election as a farce.
	   ``I condemn all acts of violence,'' the opposition politician
said. ``But we should not be deterred by threats. We should
continue in our struggle.''
	   Late Thursday, several shots were fired and a grenade was thrown
at the Interior Ministry where Sam Rainsy and supporters were
protesting against alleged election irregularities.
	   Sieng Sean, a driver for Kyodo News, a Japanese news agency, was
killed. Sam Rainsy, who was several hundred meters (yards) away,
was unharmed.
	   Claiming he was the intended target of the attack, Sam Rainsy
said he would continue challenging the results of last month's
parliamentary elections.
	   On Saturday he handed out leaflets at markets, urging vendors to
attend a rally to protest election fraud at the Olympic Stadium
Sunday. Ten opposition parties will take part in the demonstration.
	   Sam Rainsy said he thought the purpose of the most recent round
of violence was to intimidate people into not attending the rally.
The attack also heightened his own security concerns, he said.
	   ``Of course one has to be always worried,'' he said as vendors
cautiously gathered around him.
	   ``Threats and blackmail are the most effective weapons of
dictators,'' he said. ``We cannot succumb to fear.''
	   After Thursday's attack, Sam Rainsy and his supporters were
questioned by police for about two hours inside the Interior
Ministry, often at gunpoint.
	   On state television Friday night, national police chief Hok
Lundy _ a close ally of Cambodian leader Hun Sen _ accused Sam
Rainsy of provoking the attack, and said he bears ultimate
responsibility for Sieng Sean's death.
	   He hinted that Sam Rainsy could be tried for Sieng Sean's death.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority in last
month's parliamentary elections, but not the two-thirds needed to
form a government.
	   Sam Rainsy's party and his opposition ally, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh's Funcinpec Party, together won 58 seats in the 122-seat
parliament.
	   They have been invited by Hun Sen to form a coalition government
but have so far refused, saying they will not recognize the
election results until allegations of irregularities in the voting
and counting process are investigated.
	   The National Election Committee has rejected most of the
opposition's complaints as ``baseless.'' The opposition has
appealed the findings to the Constitutional Council.
	   The opposition's persistence in challenging election results has
raised new concerns about political stability in Cambodia.
	   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International called
for restraint and calm among opposing political factions.
	   ``More violence is not going to solve Cambodia's current
political problems,'' Amnesty International said Saturday.
``Everyone involved in the political process has a responsibility
to prevent an escalation in tension.
	   ``It is in everyone's interest to ensure that the political
process _ already severely tainted _ does not descend even further
into violence,'' the rights group said.

Investigators stage raids but keep quiet on any new clues

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Searching for clues in the East Africa
embassy bombings, authorities staged a pair of raids, but were
tight-lipped about what evidence, if any, was uncovered.
	   Two weeks after twin bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, investigators on the ground were still describing their
probe as being in the preliminary stages _ even after the United
States staged cruise missile strikes it said were in response to
the embassy attacks.
	   Neither the Kenyan nor Tanzanian governments made any public
comment about Thursday's U.S. strikes on targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan, which the Clinton administration said were tied to
terrorist activity.
	   Instead, American and Kenyan investigators widened their net. On
Friday in the Indian Ocean coast town of Malindi, five gloved FBI
agents and two Kenyan police officials made a three-hour search of
a slum house.
	   Witnesses said the homeowner, who is a driver for the Labor
Ministry named Hassan Omar Hassan, was taken into custody.
	   That came on the heels of another raid, this one in the Kenyan
capital.
	   The FBI and Kenyan police raided the Nairobi offices of a Saudi
Arabian charity, the Mercy International Relief Agency, in
connection with the bombing, hauling away documents, computers and
cash, an employee said Friday.
	   A Kenyan employee, Shaban Hassan, remained in police custody a
day after Thursday's raid, said Abdullah Ahmed, a charity
secretary. The Sudanese director, Mohammed Abdullah, has been
missing for three weeks, Ahmed said.
	   A Sudanese, along with a Saudi, was arrested at the Afghan
border last Saturday. Both were still being questioned, and have
not been publicly named.
	   According to local media reports here, one suspect, identified
by U.S. and Kenyan officials as Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, had said one
of his accomplices was named ``Abdullah.''
	   The FBI and Kenyan police refused to comment on either raid.
	   FBI Director Louis Freeh, who flew back to Washington Friday
after visiting the two bombed-out embassies and conferring with
field agents, said he had made ``no final conclusions'' about who
carried out the bombings.
	   The embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were the targets Aug.
7 of car bombings in which 257 people died, all but 10 of them in
Kenya.
	   Freeh, speaking to reporters at the Nairobi airport, declined to
say whether evidence developed during U.S. inquiries at the bomb
scenes led to Thursday's American missile strikes.
	   Freeh also refused to say whether there was any direct physical
evidence connecting bin Laden to the embassy attacks.
	   The two bombings could have involved ``many, many people in
different places at different times,'' the FBI director said.

Malaysian press, officials condemn U.S. missile attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Calling the United States a
power-obsessed ``war maker,'' a widely-read Malaysian newspaper on
Saturday condemned America's missile attacks on Sudan and
Afghanistan.
	   ``Its action is nothing more than an international bully who
muscles its will on the whole world,'' said an editorial published
in the government-linked New Straits Times daily.
	   ``The mere suspicion that the groups were responsible for the
recent embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania does not warrant it to
take justice into its own hands,'' said the paper.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's Thursday decision to strike a
purported chemical weapons plant in Sudan and suspected terrorist
targets in Afghanistan has drawn the ire of many officials in
Muslim-dominated Malaysia.
	   ``How are we to know it was done in self-defense when there is
no one to determine that?'' Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told
reporters late Friday.
	   ``If I can decide where I want to attack, the world will be in
chaos,'' said Mahathir.
	   Mahathir has been waging a verbal war against foreign currency
traders, blaming them for destroying Asia's economic boom and
devaluing his nation's currency by more than 40 percent.
	   Malaysian activists also voiced their opposition.
	   ``It is hypocritical for the U.S. to accuse Sudan and
Afghanistan of supporting terrorism,'' said Mohamed Idris, chairman
of the Malaysian-based Third World Network.
	   Echoing remarks made by many Malaysian officials, Mohamed said
the United States had no right to impose its military might on
another nation.

Flooding displaces more than 1 million in northeast China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARBIN, China (AP) _ Days of surging river waters undermined a
dike protecting a provincial capital Saturday, forcing residents to
flee and adding to the swelling numbers of homeless from floods
devastating China.
	   Fearful for the safety of Harbin city's 9 million people,
military commanders sent frogmen into the raging Songhua River
Friday to plug the leaking levee. But foundations under a riverside
pumping station and apartment complex gave way overnight, state
television reported.
	   Nearby residents had to be evacuated, although the TV report
gave no figures. Video footage showed a crack running down the
two-story pumping station building, part of which sank 30
centimeters (a foot) into the soggy ground.
	   More than a million people in northeast China have been
displaced, their homes submerged by the Songhua and Nen rivers, the
official China Youth Daily reported.
	   Those refugees form a new batch of homeless left by China's
worst flooding in 44 years. Officials have said more than 2,000
people have died nationwide and millions left homeless. But those
numbers are two weeks old, before rains lashed the northeast.
	   Damage has been more widespread in central China. The Yangtze
River, China's longest, has stood above the emergency stage for
more than a month, weakening embankments. Rains along the Yangtze's
upper reaches have formed a new surge of high waters that is
expected to roar down the river over the next week.
	   Soldiers in Jiujiang city repaired a dike that burst two weeks
ago just before the last flood crest entered the area Thursday
night, the China Daily reported. The newspaper described the breach
as the worst accident of the flood season. Officials insisted there
were no casualties.
	   With local clinics and hospitals in many parts of the country
under water, health officials face a shortage of medicines and
equipment to check the outbreaks of diseases.
	   Health Minister Zhang Wenkang warned Friday that colds, stomach
illnesses, dysentery, hepatitis and diseases carried by waterborne
parasites are on the rise and the trend is likely to worsen over
the next three months, state media reported.
	   Relief officials are worried many flood victims in the
northeast, known in the West as Manchuria, may not be able to move
back into their homes before the onset of winter in mid-October,
the China Youth Daily said.
	   More than 230,000 soldiers and paramilitary police were now in
the northeast fighting the floods, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   Trucks brought more soldiers into Harbin, Heilongjiang's
provincial capital, on Saturday morning to reinforce the levee as
the Songhua River swelled to ever higher record levels.
	   ``As long as the dikes are all right, we are all right and our
homes are safe,'' read one banner in the city.
	   The rising Nen River, 150 kilometers (100 miles) to the
northwest, on Thursday night began spilling over a dike that formed
the last line of defense for the Daqing oil field and its nearby
city, newspapers said.
	   Flooding surrounded the oil field, China's largest, on three
sides, washed away a highway and inundated nearly half the area's
farmland.
	   With 1,443 oil wells swamped and 282 of them shut down, oil
workers struggled to maintain production, the Xinhua News Agency
said.
	   More threatening to the oil field was a brimming reservoir on
its eastern edge.
	   ``If the weather gods don't smile and we get another torrential
soaking, it might unleash flooding,'' the Liberation Daily said.

With protests, marches, Sudan seeks to rally weary people
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ With protests and marches, Sudan's
beleaguered government has sought to rally a people weary of war
and economic hardship against an American attack that destroyed a
factory in the Sudanese capital.
	   While Khartoum residents expressed surprise at the Thursday
missile strike, many said they thought there was little their
government could do.
	   ``We are not strong enough to face the west,'' said Mamoun
Rahama, a 29-year-old who works at a textile factory near the
destroyed plant. ``We cannot face a greater force.''
	   Sudanese flocked to a rally Friday after Muslim prayers outside
the office of Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir in the muddy
streets of Khartoum. Crowds shouted ``Down, Down USA!'' and burned
an American flag.
	   The podium at the rally hit on a theme sounded time and again by
Sudanese: U.S. President Clinton launched the attack to draw
attention from his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House
intern. The podium was decorated with pictures of Clinton and
Lewinsky and bore the slogan ``Clinton: Screw Monica, not Sudan.''
	   Another rally was planned in the capital Saturday.
	   ``Clinton and America will have to pay,'' el-Bashir told the
crowd. ``Sudan is for Islam, and we will not be bullied by
Americans.''
	   He said Sudan could ``prove that the factory is specifically for
pharmaceutical production'' and not chemical weapons as described
by U.S. officials.
	   Sudan planned to lodge complaints with the Arab League and the
Organization of African Unity, and its diplomats asked the Security
Council Friday to convene an urgent meeting to consider a U.N.
investigation into the attack.
	   The government, he said, was ``opening all training camps'' for
volunteers for the national militia, a move Sudan's Islamic leaders
have often taken in response to a surge in fighting in the 15-year
civil war or when tension rises with its east African neighbors.
	   The Islamic leaders in Sudan, where as many as nine out of ten
of the country's 28 million people live in poverty, oversee a
network of well-organized cadres who can bring thousands into the
streets. Their security network is pervasive, keeping a close eye
on dissent.
	   Ten people were wounded, including four in critical condition,
in the strike in an industrial area of north Khartoum, hospital
officials said. Damage was estimated at dlrs 100 million, said
Sidahmed Hajj Hamed, administrative director at the factory.
	   Clinton ordered the Thursday attack on the factory in
retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es-Salaam, Tanzania. U.S. missiles also
struck suspected camps of Muslim militant Osama bin Laden in
Afghanistan.
	   El-Bashir said that the factory _ El-Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. _ was hit by six Tomahawk cruise missiles. He said a
seventh fell short of the target, but did not indicate if it did
any damage.
	   The factory was virtually destroyed. Brown glass jars sat in
piles amid crushed red bricks and twisted sheet metal. Soldiers in
green helmets and civil defense guards in surgical masks milled
around the site, which was enveloped by a white haze caused by
smoldering fires.
	   A white box for latex gloves and blue cartons for antibiotics
lay soaking in pools of water from Friday's rains. A metal door was
hurled to the ground by the explosion.
	   There was little security, and visitors, including foreigners,
were allowed to enter the wrecked factory at all hours unhindered.
	   The U.S. government said the factory produced precursors for
chemical weapons. State-run Sudan Television said that the factory,
which opened in 1996, produced about half of the medicine in Sudan,
Africa's largest country and one of its poorest. It described its
main products as antibiotics and drugs to treat malaria and
tuberculosis.
	   ``This is for medicine,'' said Mohammed Ali el-Bashir, a civil
defense guard, pointing to a collapsed floor propped up by still
standing pillars. ``That was for medicine.''
	   ``The factory was only there to help a pitiful people,'' he
said.
	   Civil defense workers said the fires burned until Friday night
and their pungent fumes hung over the site like a cloud. Some
workers said they had arrived the night before to help move
chemicals away from the fires, working 24 hours or more.
	   ``God destroy America,'' said Taher Ibrahim Moussa, one of the
soldiers at the site. ``America is the terrorist state.''
	   In Cairo, a Sudanese opposition group accused the government of
backing what it described as terrorism and said it had provided
refuge to followers of bin Laden, who lived in Sudan for five years
before he was forced to move to Afghanistan.

Suu Kyi's health improving as standoff continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
health was improving as she entered the 11th day Saturday of her
standoff with Myanmar's military government over her right to
travel freely, her colleagues said.
	   Myanmar, also knowns as Burma, remained quiet following an
announcement Friday by Suu Kyi's party, the National League for
Democracy, that it would convene the parliament elected in 1990 in
the near future.
	   Analysts in Yangon expect the military government will respond
with arrests of elected lawmakers before the NLD can hold a
parliament session.
	   So far, the military has not responded publicly to the NLD's
call. However, past attempts by the NLD to bring its party's
lawmakers together for a meeting were met with mass arrests.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly in the 1990
vote. The military refused to honor the election result, despite
repeated United Nations resolutions calling for it to do so.
	   Suu Kyi's party, stepping up its campaign to bring democracy to
Myanmar through nonviolent means, had set Aug. 21 as the deadline
for the military to allow parliament to meet.
	   The military, which has ruled Myanmar since 1962, has refused.
	   It has also refused to let Suu Kyi travel to the provinces and
meet her party's lawmakers and other supporters. She was stopped
last Wednesday for the fourth time in two months at a checkpoint 32
kilometers (19 miles) west of Yangon by the authorities.
	   She and three colleagues are encamped in a van stocked with food
and water. Her party said, however, the provisions are nearly
exhausted.
	   The military has forced the van on to a small wooden bridge over
a stream. It has attempted to ridicule the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize
winner's protest by setting up a table, chairs and umbrella just
outside the vehicle.
	   The government ended the last standoff by force, seizing Suu
Kyi's car, restraining her and driving her back to Yangon against
her will.
	   Earlier this week, Suu Kyi's doctors, who have visited her daily
in her van at the site of the impasse, said her health was failing.
She was suffering from low blood pressure and her eyes had turned
yellow, causing them to suspect she may have contracted jaundice or
another disease, they said.
	   ``Her blood pressure is back to normal, although blood tests
showed that her kidneys have been slightly affected,'' the NLD said
in a statement Saturday, adding that Suu Kyi's spirits are high.
	   Meanwhile, the All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exiled
students group, called on Suu Kyi to end her protest so she can
conserve her health for the struggle for democracy.
	   About 30 exiled Myanmar students began a hunger strike Saturday
outside the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok. Along with about 70 of
their colleagues, they have been protesting there for more than a
week, demanding the military allow parliament to convene.

Teen accused of trying to rob Thai bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A 14-year-old Thai boy is suspected of
attempting to rob a bank Saturday allegedly to obtain money for
drugs, Thai television reported.
	   After failing to break into an automatic teller machine, the
boy, whose name was not released by police, threw a rock through
the door of a bank in Bangkok, they said.
	   Police responded to the bank's alarm and arrested the boy, whom
they said appeared to have been sniffing glue.
	   The boy told Independent Television that he broke into the bank
to search for money and valuables because he was desperate to buy
drugs and to pay for his way home.
	   He said he wanted to return to his family in Phangna province,
590 kilometers (366 miles) south of Bangkok.
	   Police said the boy appeared to be a drug addict. He would be
sent to a foster home after an investigation, a police officer told
ITV.

Report: three detainees confess to bin Laden links

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Three men being held by Kenyan authorities
in connection with the U.S. embassy bombing have confessed to links
with renegade Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, a Nairobi
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The report in the Nation newspaper also publicly identified two
of the suspects for the first time: a Yemeni named Khalid Salim and
a Lebanese man named Abdallah Nacha. U.S. and Kenyan officials had
already identified a third man in custody, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh.
	   Neither Kenyan police nor American FBI officials would comment
on the newspaper report, which said the three were the same men who
had been seen filming the American embassy in Nairobi days before
the Aug. 7 blast.
	   The newspaper printed what it said was a photograph of the
Yemeni man, Salim, smiling with his hands raised and clasped, and
said he had been identified by three witnesses as the man who threw
a grenade at embassy guards just before the massive explosion.
	   The report did not say how it obtained the photo or when it was
taken.
	   The three told police they had planned the bombing while using
the cover of being fish merchants, based in the Indian Ocean port
city of Mombasa and financed by bin Laden, according to the report.
	   Such a line of work would provide a ready explanation for
transporting cargo between the coastal region and the capital, and
for frequenting downtown Nairobi, with its concentration of hotels
and restaurants.
	   The report, coupled with a raid on Friday, suggested that
Mombasa and its environs were becoming a focus of the probe.
	   Witnesses had reported that FBI agents and Kenyan police raided
a home in the nearby coast town of Malindi, conducting a three-hour
search of a house in a slum district and detaining the homeowner,
identified as Hassan Omar Hassan.
	   Both U.S. and Kenyan officials also declined to comment on that
raid.
	   On the political front, both the Kenyan and Tanzanian
governments remained conspicuously silent about U.S. cruise missile
strikes on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan, which the Clinton
administration said had bin Laden links.
	   Even before the U.S. strikes, many Kenyans had expressed fears
of their country becoming the venue for fresh attacks by those who
carried out the embassy bombings.
	   President Clinton said the missile strikes were in response to
the twin car bombings of U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam in which 257 people died, all but 10 of them in Kenya. More
than 5,000 people were hurt.
	   ``America, like any other country, has the right to protect its
citizens,'' an editorial said Saturday in the East Africa Standard.
``But America must also ensure that the innocent are not made to
suffer because of its quarrel with its enemies.''

Bonnie becomes hurricane
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES US-Tropical Weather and Mexico-Pacific Storm;
UPDATES information from both stories with Bonnie becoming
hurricane. At 0600 GMT Bonnie was located near latitude 21.8 north,
longitude 68.7 west. Charley was centered near 27.5 north latitude,
96.3 west longitude. NEW to some points. &QL;

	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Bonnie strengthened into the Atlantic
season's first hurricane Saturday and headed toward sparsely
populated Bahamian islands, on a route that could threaten the
southeastern United States.
	   Another storm was gaining strength in the Pacific Ocean.
	   ``It's definitely going to happen. The southeastern portion (of
the Bahamas) is going to be hit today,'' meteorologist Dave Chorney
said from the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   Bahamian radio warned the islands' fishing fleet and yachters to
make for safe port. The islands' meteorological department said
Bonnie would hit landfall in the southeast later Saturday and pass
by Long Island, Eleuthera and the Abacos over the next 48 to 72
hours.
	   The small islands would have little effect on Hurricane Bonnie,
which is expected to gather strength Saturday.
	   ``Definitely, it's getting stronger,'' said Jerry Jarrell,
director of National Hurricane Center. ``People along the
southeastern U.S. should pay attention to its progress.'' He said
winds could reach 100 mph (160 kph) by Monday though Chorney said
the worst thunderstorms were on the northern side of Bonnie, in the
open Atlantic.
	   Bonnie was about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of Puerto Rico
early Saturday with top winds near 75 mph (121 kph), just over the
hurricane threshold of 74 mph (120 kph).
	   For Bonnie, the government of the Bahamas issued a tropical
storm warning and a hurricane watch for the southeastern Bahamas
and the Turks and Caicos Islands and a hurricane watch for the
central Bahamas.
	   North Florida is more likely than any other region to be hit if
the storm reaches shore. Still, the storm could veer out to sea and
miss the U.S. coast entirely, Jarrell said.
	   Another weather system, Tropical Storm Charley, threatened parts
of Texas. Tropical storm warnings were posted from Brownsville to
High Island, near Galveston, after a tropical depression formed in
the western Gulf of Mexico.
	   The system generated sustained winds of more than 39 mph (63
kph) by Friday afternoon, enough to make it a tropical storm. Early
Saturday, the storm was center about 50 miles (80 kilometers)
southeast of Port Aransas, Texas.
	   Hundreds of workers were evacuated Friday from offshore oil rigs
as a safety precaution, Coast Guard Petty Officer Rusty Miller
said.
	   Also Friday, a storm in the Pacific Ocean reached hurricane
strength but remained far off the Mexican coast. Hurricane Howard
was 400 miles (645 kilometers) south-southwest of Acapulco late
Friday night and was slowly moving northwest.
	   Howard had sustained winds of 98 mph (158 kph) and gusts up to
121 mph (195 kph). Authorities closed the Acapulco port and warned
ships to be cautious of high waves along the southwestern Mexican
coast.
	   The Atlantic Basin typically has nine tropical storms each year
with six of them becoming hurricanes, two of them intense. In 1997,
there were seven named storms, three hurricanes and one intense
hurricane.

Egypt's Nobel laureate bares his soul _ and stirs a storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo CAI101 &QL; 
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Renowned Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz
first got into trouble by backing peace with Israel. Then the Nobel
laureate was declared a heretic by Islamic radicals and was stabbed
in an assassination attempt.
	   Now, at age 86, Mahfouz is creating an even bigger fuss, raising
wrath both in Egypt and the Arab world with his criticism of an
Arab icon, the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.
	   In a new autobiography, Mahfouz declares Nasser was a dictator
who brought Egypt social and economic disaster and _ worse _ failed
to bring it democracy.
	   Nasser's greatest triumph, the nationalization of the Suez
Canal, was ``a victory by ... media and propaganda,'' Mahfouz
wrote.
	   ``On the military side, we were defeated'' in the ensuing 1956
war when Britain, France and Israel invaded Egypt, he added. ``On
the political side, it was a great loss because it put Egypt in
direct conflict with the superpowers.''
	   The outspoken criticism has stirred up a storm, but also a
debate.
	   Since the June publication of ``Naguib Mahfouz, Pages from his
Memoirs,'' Cairo newspapers have almost daily printed diatribes
against Mahfouz or praise for his revisionist views _ and for his
honesty.
	   His ideas have been debated in the Arab world's most prominent
newspaper, the London-based daily Al-Hayat, and on the popular
Al-Jazeera television watched throughout the region.
	   Mahfouz's personal revelations brought shock, too. Publicly
confessing to smoking hashish and having sex outside marriage is
not expected of a man revered as the literary pharaoh of deeply
Muslim Egypt.
	   Interestingly, the behavior is like that of the patriarch of an
Old Cairo merchant family whose fortunes are chronicled in
Mahfouz's most famous work, the three novels of his ``Cairo
Trilogy'' published in 1956-57. In them, the father adheres to
conservative Muslim social mores at home, but also drinks alcohol,
smokes hashish and goes to brothels.
	   But the harshest reaction has been to Mahfouz's judgment that
the social and economic progress credited to Nasser is mere myth.
	   Critics say Mahfouz, a supporter of the liberal Wafd Party, is
just settling scores because Nasser's ouster of the monarchy in
1952 also toppled a Wafd government and sent the party into
political exile.
	   They also question why Mahfouz waited so long to denounce the
Egyptian leader, who died in 1970.
	   ``It has always been said Mahfouz was hypocritical towards the
rulers and indeed the book reveals he was. The evidence is he did
not say Nasser was a dictator until after his death,'' Egyptian
novelist Sonallah Ibrahim wrote in a Cairo weekly.
	   In his book, Mahfouz says he first had mixed feelings about
Nasser's military coup that Egyptians call their 1952 revolution _
``love and support'' but also anger at the treatment of the Wafd.
	   Eventually he concluded that Wafd's downfall was but one sign of
Nasser's ``denial of democracy and ... unilateral rule'' and that
the leader's much-praised social policies were a disaster.
	   In a rare interview with a Western news organization, Mahfouz
told The Associated Press that Nasser's promise of free education
had churned out ``graduates with a degree in ignorance'' since
Egypt didn't have the resources to teach millions of students.
	   The government's turning over of farms to peasants proved a
catastrophe that split Egypt's farmland into tiny, unprofitable
plots and shattered its agricultural potential, Mahfouz said.
	   ``We have this huge land and huge river yet we're unable to feed
ourselves,'' he said, sitting at a coffee house along the Nile.
	   Despite the furor over his book, Mahfouz maintained he revealed
nothing that most Egyptians did not already know.
	   ``These were events which we all lived through, and whether they
were right or wrong, they are now history from which we should
learn,'' he said.
	   Mahfouz, who has written 34 novels and whose tales of life in
Cairo's medieval lanes won the 1988 Nobel Prize in literature, is
used to controversy.
	   His support of Egypt's 1979 peace accord with Israel was scorned
by most Arab intellectuals. His allegorical novel ``Children of
Gebelawi'' enraged Muslim fundamentalists, who said it violated
Islam's ban on depicting the prophet Mohammed and other holy
figures.
	   Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the Egyptian cleric jailed in the
United States for a 1993 plot to bomb New York landmarks, called
for Mahfouz's death over the book. In 1994, knife-wielding
attackers tried to kill the novelist outside his home.
	   He was seriously wounded in the neck and right arm. Since
Mahfouz writes in longhand Arabic script, he still has trouble
working. His autobiography resulted from 50 hours of taped
dictation.
	   Even some critics of Mahfouz's attack on Nasser express
admiration for his outspokenness.
	   ``We should thank Mahfouz for his confessions because he is
teaching us on how to be more courageous and more sincere about
ourselves,'' said Salah Fadl, a professor of literary criticism at
Cairo University.
	   But novelist Adel Hamoudeh doubts that conservative Egypt can
accept its most famous writer's revelations, especially his brothel
visits and smoking hashish.
	   ``The question remains: are we ready to see ourselves naked
before our eyes,'' Hamoudeh said.

Yokohama team wins Japanese National Baseball Tournament

<TEXT>
	   NISHINOMIYA, Japan (AP) _ Yokohama High won Japan's annual high
school baseball tournament Saturday, powered by Daisuke Matsuzaka's
no-hitter to shut out Kyoto Seisho 3-0.
	   Yokohama also won this year's spring tournament in March and
became only the fifth school to triumph in both highly publicized
baseball tournaments in the same year.
	   In Saturday's game, Matsuzaka struck out 11 in 9 innings. He was
the 22nd pitcher to throw a no-hitter shut-out in tournament play
history, but the only second hurler to do it in the final game
since 1939.
	   ``This is my happiest day ever,'' Matsuzaka told Japan's
national television network, NHK, after the game.
	   The tournaments are summer favorites in Japan. TVs in bars and
restaurants all over the nation are constantly tuned to the games,
which are seen not as youthful fun but as dead serious competitions
and displays of determination and sacrifice.
	   Before a near-capacity crowd of 55,000 at Koshien Stadium in
western Japan, Tsutomu Matsumoto hit a solo homer in the fourth,
and Yokohama High School also added a second run in the fifth and
another in the eighth.
	   A record 4,102 high school teams competed in the summer
tournament, with 55 of them playing in the finals of the 80th
National High School Baseball Championships.
	   After the tournament ended Saturday, the Japan High School
Baseball Association said a Japanese high school all-star team led
by Yokohama High School players will participate in an eight-nation
tournament in Osaka, western Japan, Sept. 4-13, playing with their
counterparts from South Korea, the Philippines, Mongolia,
Indonesia, Taiwan, China and Australia.
	   It will be the third such baseball tournament by players, aged
16-18, and held every two years from Asia and Oceania area. The
eight-nation tournament last was held in Manila in 1996.

Fresh landslides hamper rescue work in Himalayan village
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Rescue workers ran for cover from boulders
hurtling down a remote Himalayan village Saturday, where 202 people
were already feared killed in an earlier landslide.
	   Hopes faded of finding more survivors in the mountain village of
Malpa, buried under mounds of rocks and mud.
	   No one was reported injured Saturday from the latest of nearly a
dozen landslides that have rumbled down the mountains of northern
India this season, lashed by heavy monsoon rains for three weeks.
The total number of dead reached 239.
	   The rain stopped Friday, but dense fog blocked a helicopter
rescue of 18 survivors from Malpa, 300 kilometers (185 miles) east
of New Delhi, said Ashok Kumar, the Uttar Pradesh state relief
commissioner.
	   Rescuers have found 32 bodies so far. The survivors, most of
them injured by falling rocks and mud, are being treated by two
doctors attached to paramilitary forces in the village.
	   On Saturday, Indian air force helicopters flew food and
medicines to Pithoragarh, a nearby town, from where they will be
carried on packs 60 kilometers (40 miles) to the devastated
village, Press Trust of India news agency said.
	   After waiting for two days, anxious relatives of those feared
killed traveled by bus to Pithoragarh. They will be taken to the
devastated village as soon as the weather clears, Kumar said.
	   Among those feared killed were 60 Hindu pilgrims headed to a
sacred lake across the Chinese border in Tibet. Porters and local
villagers were also missing.
	   Nearly 200 rescue workers have been looking for victims in the
sludge and along the banks of the Kali River. But fresh landslides
Friday evening forced them to suspend their efforts.
	   Authorities have evacuated more than 30,000 people to higher
ground from 30 nearby towns and villages facing a flood threat
after a blockage in the Mandakini River.
	   Army and civil engineers have decided not to dynamite the
blockage caused by falling boulders and mudslides. Removing the
blockage would have made the water level shoot up by as much as 26
feet (8 meters) downstream, engulfing 30 town and villages.

Chinese newspaper: Indonesian riot probe a credibility test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China urged Indonesia's police chief Saturday to
stop threatening activists looking into rapes, beatings and other
brutality against Indonesian Chinese in May riots.
	   The national police chief Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi should be out
digging up evidence instead of hurling accusations, the official
China Daily newspaper said in an editorial.
	   Women's groups allege 168 women and girls were raped during the
riots that ultimately ended the long reign of President Suharto.
Many of the victims were ethnic Chinese, resented for their
affluence and influence over Indonesia's now crippled economy.
	   Roesmanhadi earlier this month warned groups investigating the
violence that they may be charged with ``spreading false reports''
if they did not substantiate their claims. Indonesian newspapers
have reported that some victims have received threats by police.
	   The China Daily called the Indonesian police's conduct
``improper'' and a hindrance to a government investigation. The
newspaper called the probe a test of the credibility of Suharto's
successor, B.J. Habibie.
	   China has demanded the Indonesian government punish those
responsible and protect Indonesians of Chinese descent.
	   Pictures of purported rape victims circulating on the Internet
and reprinted in Chinese newspapers stirred public opinion,
provoking calls for stronger action by Jakarta.
	   More than 100 Beijing students protested outside the Indonesian
Embassy on Monday. A group of 40 women writers also demanded a U.N.
investigation and suggested the Chinese government had reacted
faintheartedly to the tragedy.
	   Indonesian police have been ``turning a blind eye to the gory
pictures of the rapes and the testimonies of victims lodged on the
Internet,'' China Daily said.
	   ``The threat can only bring fear to the victims and prevent them
from giving testimonies,'' it added.

Kido surges ahead in New Caterpillar-Mitsubishi Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAKONE, Japan (AP) _ Fuki Kido carded a 3-under-par 70 Saturday
and took a one-stroke lead over Chikayo Yamazaki going into the
final round of the New Caterpillar-Mitsubishi Ladies.
	   Kido, winner of the Mizuno Ladies two weeks ago, fired a round
of four birdies and a bogey en route to a 5-under 141 total.
	   Yamazaki, a one-shot leader overnight, shot a level-par 73 for
142. She had three birdies and three bogeys in negotiating the
windswept, hilly 6,662-yard (6,062-meter), par-73 Shizuoka Country
Hamaoka Course.
	   ``I wasn't putting very well, especially on the front nine,''
said Yamazaki, in contention for her first title of the season and
eighth overall. ``I hope I'll have a better round tomorrow, but I'm
not thinking about the result. I'll just let it happen.''
	   Kido, seeking her fifth career victory, said she's driving it
straighter, keeping the ball in the fairway off the tee on all but
two holes. ``But my iron shots were somewhat erratic, and I reached
the greens in regulation on about half of the holes,'' she said.
	   Kyoko Ono shot a 70 and was alone in third place at 144. Another
stroke back at 145 was Aki Takamura, who fired a 75. Defending
champion Takayo Bando struggled to a 78 for a share of 36th at 151.
	   Akiko Fukushima, the Japan tour's top player in the last two
years, has skipped the tournament to take part in the U.S. LPGA
Tour's qualifying tournament.
	   Of a total of 95, 61 players made the cut at 7-over 153.
	   The 60 million yen (dlrs 420,000) event pays the winner 10.8
million yen (dlrs 75,500).

Taiwan pauses for commemoration of battle with China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Veterans gathered on the heavily fortified
island of Kinmen on Saturday, the eve of the 40th anniversary of a
bloody artillery battle with China that was one of the major flash
points of the Cold War.
	   Throughout the week, veterans, most in their sixties and
seventies, have visited the graves of fallen comrades and attended
commemorations of the battle on Kinmen, also known as Quemoy, that
blazed for 44 days in 1958.
	   Taiwan's government has given special attention to this year's
anniversary. Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling called for
vigilance against China at a ceremony Friday, saying Beijing's
willingness to attack Taiwan has not diminished despite growing
ties between the sides.
	   His speech was a poignant reminder of how Taiwan's open society
and routine interchange with China have obscured concerns over an
attack across the Taiwan Strait, even though Beijing has stuck to
its threat to use force to reunify Taiwan with the mainland.
	   The battle, which began on August 23, 1958, is cited by Taiwan
as a key point of divergence between the Nationalists who fled
China in 1949 and Mao Tse-tung's communist successor regime on the
mainland.
	   Whereas China descended into catastrophic economic
collectivization, xenophobia and political paralysis, the
successful defense of Kinmen lent Taiwan a sense of security that
opened the way to export-led growth and universal education, the
twin foundations of the island's rise to prosperity, the Defense
Ministry said in a statement issued to mark the anniversary.
	   China lobbed 470,000 shells at the island during the massive
artillery assault, killing 600 residents and soldiers and injuring
2,000 more. Some 5,000 homes were destroyed during the initial
battle.
	   With the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet standing watch, the
Nationalists moved in reinforcements under cover of dark and the
island's defenses held. After 44 days, China called a temporary
halt to shelling, then moved to a strategy of every-other-day
artillery exchanges with Nationalist gunners that continued until
1978.
	   The Nationalists had held on to Kinmen during their retreat from
China both for its strategic importance in guarding the Taiwan
Strait and its significance as a physical reminder of their
determination to retake all of China.
	   That aim has been exchanged for one of putting Taiwanese in
charge of their own destiny and leaving reunification to future
generations.
	   Today, Kinmen's residents hawk kitchen cleavers fashioned from
recovered bomb shells to tourists, and a thriving, though illegal,
trade has sprung up with the mainland, less than 3 kilometers (1.8
miles) away.
	   Kinmen remains heavily fortified but the military plays a much
less visible role in island life, allowing minefields to be cleared
for housing developments and former underground navy bases to be
opened up to visitors.

Witnesses see fire in the sky, then feel strike of U.S. missiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIANSHAH, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistani who was in Afghanistan on
the night of a U.S. attack said he saw fire in the sky, then felt
the missiles strike what Washington says was a training camp for
Islamic militants from around the world.
	   ``There was panic and screaming, and people running everywhere.
I remember nothing after that, because I passed out,'' Muhammed
Furqan told The Associated Press Saturday from his hospital bed in
Mianshah, a Pakistani town near the targeted base. He had wounds on
his legs, chest and head he said were received in the attack.
	   Furqan said he had arrived just a week ago at the camp near
Khost, 150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of the Afghan capital of
Kabul and just across the border from Pakistan. He said he was
engaged in ``religious studies'' there.
	   The commander of the base, Badshah Gul, said that when he heard
explosions he thought the men were engaged in their usual Friday
night drill of hurling explosives at targets.
	   ``But the explosions were so big that they lit the sky for a
while, and I began to realize what actually happened,'' Gul told
the Pakistan national newspaper The News.
	   Rehmat Ali, a 20-year-old who was injured in the attack, said he
heard fighter planes before the bombs.
	   ``As the fighter aircraft flew past our camp, the whole area got
lit up, and almost simultaneously the place got bombed,'' Ali told
The News from his hospital bed in the Afghan border town of
Peshawar.
	   U.S. officials said the missiles, which sound like jets, were
fired from ships in the Arabian sea. Pakistani officials have said
no U.S. planes crossed their airspace for the attack.
	   Six people injured in the attack died in hospitals in Pakistan
Friday. Earlier, Taliban officials had put the toll at 21, for a
total of 27.
	   There was a near-simultaneous U.S. attack on a target in Sudan,
which Washington accuses of sponsoring terrorism. U.S. officials
said they were unsure how much damage had been caused by the
strikes, which were meant to disrupt Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden's alleged terrorist activities against the United States.
	   Pakistani government sources said bin Laden would have been
having coffee at the targeted Afghan base at the time of the attack
if he hadn't changed his plans for security reasons.
	   Taliban officials have said bin Laden was unharmed, and he has
reportedly issued new threats against the United States. He had
reportedly been taking special precautions after Washington named
him as the primary suspect in the Aug. 7, U.S. Embassy bombings in
Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Information pieced together from witnesses, Pakistani government
sources and newspaper reports, suggests that bin Laden dropped
plans to meet with key commanders from Pakistan and elsewhere late
Thursday on the advice of his security men.
	   Pakistan reportedly had intimate knowledge of bin Laden's
movements, and knew he was due to speak at the Khost camp, known as
the Zhawar Kili Al-Badr base, on Thursday.
	   Kuwait's Al-Watan newspaper, quoting unidentified sources in
London Saturday, reported Pakistan leaked to bin Laden news about
an impending U.S. strike. The sources said the leak was aimed at
limiting casualties, so that bin Laden would have less
justification for a counterattack.
	   A Pakistani government source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of the U.S.
Central Command, was in Peshawar the day before the attack to meet
with Pakistani officials.
	   Other Pakistani sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Zinni came with a team of U.S. intelligence experts whose task
was to pinpoint the camps and determine bin Laden's exact
whereabouts.
	   By all accounts, had things gone normally that night bin Laden
would have had dinner with commanders, then sit down to sip coffee
in the open, a habit among many Arabs.

 &UR; Congolese rebels say they shot down two Zimbabwean warplanes

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila said Saturday they had shot down two Zimbabwean jet
fighters southwest of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   ``Just this morning, we have shot down two of their jet
fighters,'' Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister who
defected to the rebels, said. ``And this is just a warning.''
	   ``It should be understood that the people of Congo are ready to
resist any foreign aggression.''
	   Karaha did not specify where the planes were shot down or what
happened to the pilots. No independent confirmation was possible.
	   He accused Zimbabwe of sending 900 troops to help Kabila's
embattled government ward off rebels advances and said 500 of them
had been sent to the frontlines in western Congo.
	   ``We shall continue to resist,'' he said.
	   Karaha said until Kabila agreed to a cease-fire and to a
negotiated political solution which the rebel coalition had
proposed on Wednesday, the rebels would continue to march on
several fronts.
	   ``We're marching on Kinshasa. We're marching on Kisangani. We're
marching on Katanga,'' he said. Kisangani, in north central Congo,
is the nation's third-largest city. tral Congo. Katanga region in
the southeast is home to Kabila.

Parliamentary leader sides with Yeltsin, Kiriyenko
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the upper house of Russia's parliament
stood up for President Boris Yeltsin and his government Saturday,
saying he opposed efforts in the lower chamber to dismiss them, a
news agency reported.
	   ``I think it would be premature to dismiss the government,''
Yegor Stroyev said, according to Interfax. ``The difficulties and
mistakes we are now suffering from are the result of long
irresponsible work by the previous government, and errors regarding
the (bond) market.''
	   The State Duma, the lower and more left-leaning house of
parliament, passed a resolution Friday calling on Yeltsin to
resign, and all factions in the Duma called for Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko to resign.
	   The government usually receives more support from the upper
house of parliament, which is drawn from the ranks of regional
leaders who are more likely to be in Yeltsin's camp.
	   Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev praised the Duma for
seeking Yeltsin's resignation.
	   ``The president should now think about his country, his own
future and his legacy,'' Gorbachev told Interfax. Gorbachev rarely
misses an opportunity to attack his old rival, but his opinion
carries little weight in Russia these days.
	   Gorbachev said he had no plans to run for president in 2000,
when the next elections are scheduled.

Chinese police break major fraud case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After an 18-month investigation, Chinese police
have recovered half of the 347 million yuan (dlrs 42 million) lost
in one of China's biggest bank fraud cases, the Xinhua News Agency
reported Saturday.
	   Investigators trekked over half of China and traveled to the
United States, tracking the money and the culprits, the news agency
said.
	   Most of the money came from accounts in the Bank of China's
branch in central Henan province's Xingyang city. Xinhua said
assistant bank manager Chen Jianmin and Ren Chengjian, head of the
Three Benevolence Enterprise Group, pocketed money in fixed deposit
accounts.
	   Police put Chen under house arrest at the investigation's start
on Jan. 31, 1997, but Ren fled, Xinhua said. It added that
investigators persuaded Ren to return to China from the United
States in February. At least three others have been arrested.
	   The suspects managed to squander an unrecoverable 162 million
yuan (dlrs 19.6 million) out of the stolen funds, the news agency
said.
	   Xinhua described the investigation as part of a nationwide
effort to end pervasive corruption and clean up the banking system.

Report: South Korean man defects to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean man has defected to
North Korea by crossing the heavily armed buffer zone separating
the two countries, the North's media reported Saturday.
	   The official Korea Central News Agency said Pak Song-hun, 29,
crossed the mine-infested Demilitarized Zone near the east coast on
Friday.
	   Pak was from Wando County in South Korea's southwestern tip and
had worked as a construction worker in Seoul, KCNA said.
	   KCNA said the defector lost his job recently and was
dissatisfied with South Korean society.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the report by South
Korean authorities.
	   The Koreas have been bitter enemies since the division of their
peninsula into the communist North and the capitalist South in
1945. Their border is the world's most heavily armed.
	   It's rare for a South Korean to defect to North Korea. About 200
North Koreans have escaped to South Korea in the past three years,
reporting widespread hunger.

Italians sweep men's marathon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's marathon &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Stefano Baldini overcame rainy and
windy conditions to lead an Italian medal sweep in the men's
marathon Saturday at the European Championship.
	   Baldini, who was running stride for stride with fellow Italian
Danilo Goffi at the 40-kilometer mark, pulled away before entering
the Nep stadium and won in 2 hours 12 minutes 01 second.
	   Goffi was second in 2:12.11, and another Italian, Vincenzo
Modica, took the bronze in 2:12.53.
	   After a week of mostly sunshine and warm weather in the
Hungarian capital, the conditions cooled considerably after a night
of storms.
	   Baldini and Goffi ran easily, however, and both were fresh
enough to celebrate by hugging each other after the
42.195-kilometer race.
	   Winner of the world half-marathon title in 1996, Baldini, 27,
was second in the 1997 London Marathon and third in the New York
race that same year.
	   Baldini is the eighth of 10 brothers, and his older brother
Marco is also a marathon runner.
	   While the Italians ruled the longest distance, in Europe at
least, no one can measure up to British men sprinters.
	   Since the retirement of Linford Christie, no Briton _ and no
European for that matter _ has come close to challenging the North
American, African and Caribbean runners.
	   In Europe, Britons continue to rule.
	   Iwan Thomas completed a British sweep of the men's sprints when
he won the 400 meters on Friday in 44.52 seconds, a championship
record.
	   Minutes earlier, Doug Walker led a 1-2-3 British triumph in the
200. Britain also had had a gold-silver sweep in the 100 on
Wednesday.
	   Britain was not the only nation picking up multiple medals on a
day of nine finals.
	   Poland and Germany also won two golds each to pull level with
Britain and Ukraine on three golds through four days of
competition. Russia leads the medal table with four golds and 13
overall.
	   Thomas led coming out of the turn and held on, as Robert
Mackowiak of Poland passed Mark Richardson to prevent another 1-2
British finish. Mackowiak clocked 45.04 and Richardson 45.14.
	   ``I thought I had run a bit too hard in my semifinal so I didn't
know if I'd be able to hold on,'' Thomas said. ``I didn't know how
far ahead I was in the home straight.''
	   ``But I knew it was going to take a good runner to beat me
tonight,'' he said.
	   Walker, No. 1 in Europe this season, clocked 20.53 seconds to
win ahead of Doug Turner, second in 20.64. Julius Golding snatched
the bronze in 20.72.
	   ``This is great, I have finally won something big,'' Walker
said. ``I got what I came to Budapest for, so that's good.''
	   Led by Christie, the British team had also swept the sprints in
1990 and took two four years ago, losing only the 200.
	   Britons were left-empty-handed in the women's sprints.
	   Irina Privalova of Russia won a Slavic battle in the 200,
surging ahead in the last 30 meters to beat Zhanna Pintusevich of
Ukraine, the world champion.
	   ``This is amazing,'' Privalova said after retaining one of her
two titles. She lost the 100 to Christine Arron of France.
	   Privalova, coming off major leg injuries and surgery, clocked
22.62 seconds. Pintusevich took the silver at 22.74, while Melanie
Paschke of Germany snatched the bronze in 22.78.
	   Grit Breuer of Germany won her first major individual gold medal
since coming back from a doping ban when she captured the women's
400 meters in 49.93.
	   ``I always thought the gold would be mine today,'' Breuer said.
	   Breuer, 26, who had won the European title for the first time in
1990 when she was still a junior, came back from a three-year
doping ban in 1995.
	   Artur Partyka of Poland, who has had silvers at the Olympics,
world and European championships, finally captured his first gold
by clearing 2.34 meters in the men's high jump.
	   His compatriot Robert Korzeniowski won the men's 50-kilometer
walk to add the European to his Olympic and world titles.
	   Other winners were: Ionela Tirlea of Romania in the women's
400-meter hurdles; Franka Dietzsch of Germany in the women's
discus; and Anzhela Balakhonova of Ukraine in the women's pole
vault.

Japanese turn out in droves for samba festival

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of Japanese lined the streets
in downtown Tokyo on Saturday to watch revelers in elaborate _ and
skimpy _ costumes dance in the city's annual Rio-style samba
festival.
	   Nearly 400,000 spectators crowded the main drag in Tokyo's
traditional Asakusa district Saturday afternoon to see the show,
now in its 18th year. The turnout was 5 percent higher than last
year, police said.
	   ``I think it was interesting to get to see something of the
culture of Brazil,'' said Karla Bridges of Nicaragua.
	   The growing number of Brazilians living in Japan _ now more than
200,000 _ were the architects of the two-day festival, which
started on Friday. The party attracts people from all over the
country, and similar festivals are held in more than a dozen other
Japanese cities.
	   Some 3,000 dancers joined the parade, including Sanba clubs from
Brazil and 31 teams from around Japan. There are more than 100
samba schools in Japan, the biggest with more than 800 members.
	   Japanese samba lovers have created a small but dedicated market
for samba music here, making rare recordings easier to find in
Tokyo than in Rio, where shops rarely sell anything older than the
latest hits.
	   Ties between Japan and Brazil go back nearly a century. This
year's festival marked the 90th anniversary of Japanese immigration
to the South American country.

Congolese rebels say they shot down two Zimbabwean warplanes

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila said Saturday they had shot down two Zimbabwean jet
fighters southwest of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   ``Just this morning, we have shot down two of their jet
fighters,'' Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister who
defected to the rebels, said. ``And this is just a warning.''
	   ``It should be understood that the people of Congo are ready to
resist any foreign aggression.''
	   Karaha did not specify where the planes were shot down or what
happened to the pilots. No independent confirmation was possible.
	   He accused Zimbabwe of sending 900 troops to help Kabila's
embattled government ward off rebels advances and said 500 of them
had been sent to the frontlines in western Congo.
	   ``We shall continue to resist,'' he said.
	   Karaha said until Kabila agreed to a cease-fire and to a
negotiated political solution which the rebel coalition had
proposed on Wednesday, the rebels would continue to march on
several fronts.
	   ``We're marching on Kinshasa. We're marching on Kisangani. We're
marching on Katanga,'' he said. Kisangani, in north central Congo,
is the nation's third-largest city. Katanga region in the southeast
is home to Kabila, and he is believed to be directing war efforts
from there.
	   ``We're ready for negotiations with Kabila, but instead he is
sending jet fighters on us,'' Karaha said.
	   Karaha said he expected the peace summit in Pretoria, organized
by South African President Nelson Mandela in a bid to avert a
deepening crisis in sub-Saharan Africa, to persuade Kabila to
negotiate with the rebels and prevent foreign intervention.
	   ``We hope that the summit can pursuade Zimbabwe to withdraw
their troops,'' Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, the leader of the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition said. ``We also hope that the summit
will arrive at achieving a formula that will permit the finding of
a peaceful solution to the problem.''
	   But in Kinshasa, Information Minister Didier Mumegi told
reporters that Kabila may ask for a postponement, and if the
meeting is not postponed, it would have to go on without him.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis fighters and
disenchanted members of the Congolese army _ accuse Kabila of
power-grabbing, tribalism and mismanagement of the vast African
nation.
	   Kabila, in turn, accuses Rwanda and Uganda of sponsoring the
revolt and appealed for help from Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola.
Both Rwanda and Uganda denied the charge.
	   Karaha said he hoped Angola would not get involved.
	   ``We are natural allies. We don't have problems with Angola,''
he said.
	   Karaha also accused Kabila of ordering the execution of 20,000
ethnic Tutsis in Moba in southeastern Congo, a move which he said
promoted the rebels to move on to the Lake Tanganyika port of
Kalemie to prevent the killing.
	   ``We have to intervene to prevent Kabila from killing people,''
Karaha said.

Mugabe to boycott Congolese peace summit in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ President Robert Mugabe, whose nation
has sent troops to support embattled Congolese leader Laurent
Kabila, will not attend a peace summit called by South Africa, his
office said Saturday.
	   There was no immediate reaction from Zimbabwean officials to a
Congolese rebel claim that they shot down two Zimbabwean jet
fighters on Saturday.
	   State airline officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said an airline jet was commandeered by the Zimbabwean military to
fly about 250 soldiers to Kinshasa. Diplomats said up to 600 troops
were believed to have left Harare since Thursday.
	   Mugabe spokesman George Charamba refused to say how many
Zimbabwean troops were being sent to Congo.
	   The Herald newspaper quoted unidentified witnesses saying a
Russian built cargo plane was loaded with ``a variety of war
equipment'' at an air force base outside Harare and was headed for
the Congolese capital.
	   It said Zimbabwe's intervention aimed to make the war
``unwinnable for the rebels'' and force negotiations to end the
conflict.
	   Mugabe felt the peace talks scheduled to begin Saturday in
Pretoria, South Africa's capital, was ``too limited'' and did not
include countries which _ like Zimbabwe _ support military
intervention in Congo, Charamba said.
	   Mugabe made his view known to South African Vice President Thabo
Mbeki in a telephone conversation late Friday, the spokesman said.
	   South Africa invited the presidents of Congo, Uganda, Rwanda and
Zimbabwe for talks in hopes of averting the spread of the Congo
war.
	   The war in the central African country to topple Kabila has sent
shock waves far beyond its borders.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of supporting Congo rebels with
troops and weapons.

Algeria, under fire for own anti-terror tactics, chides U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The Algerian government said Saturday
that anti-terrorist action should follow international law, a
veiled critique of this week's U.S. air strikes while Algiers faces
criticism for its own anti-insurgency tactics.
	   All anti-terrorist action ``must be carried out within the
framework of international law,'' said the statement read on state
radio and printed in pro-government newspapers Saturday.
	   The surprise U.S. strikes Thursday against targets in
Afghanistan and Sudan, identified by Washington as sites of
terrorist activity, drew angry protests in a number of Arab
countries.
	   The strikes were in retaliation for the terrorist bombings of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania the week before.
	   At the same time, Algeria is under fire for its tactics in
fighting a 6 1/2-year-old Muslim insurgency that has left more than
75,000 people dead. A U.N. fact-finding team is preparing a report
of its findings from a visit last month.
	   The Algerian Foreign Ministry statement cited ``the necessity
for a global and concerted response by the international
community.'' It called for ``the rapid conclusion, under auspices
of the United Nations, of an overall international convention on
fighting terrorism.''
	   The statement noted ``the transnational character of terrorism
and the threat it poses to the stability of states and
international security.''
	   While Egypt didn't criticize or outright support the U.S.
strikes, it called Friday for a meeting on international terrorism.

Congolese rebels say they shot down two Zimbabwean warplanes

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila said Saturday they had shot down two Zimbabwean jet
fighters southwest of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   ``Just this morning, we have shot down two of their jet
fighters,'' Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister who
defected to the rebels, said. ``And this is just a warning.''
	   ``It should be understood that the people of Congo are ready to
resist any foreign aggression.''
	   Karaha did not specify where the planes were shot down or what
happened to the pilots. No independent confirmation was possible.
	   He accused Zimbabwe of sending 900 troops to help Kabila's
embattled government ward off rebels advances and said 500 of them
had been sent to the frontlines in western Congo.
	   ``We shall continue to resist,'' he said.
	   Karaha said until Kabila agreed to a cease-fire and to a
negotiated political solution which the rebel coalition had
proposed on Wednesday, the rebels would continue to march on
several fronts.
	   ``We're marching on Kinshasa. We're marching on Kisangani. We're
marching on Katanga,'' he said. Kisangani, in north central Congo,
is the nation's third-largest city. Katanga region in the southeast
is home to Kabila, and he is believed to be directing war efforts
from there.
	   ``We're ready for negotiations with Kabila, but instead he is
sending jet fighters on us,'' Karaha said.
	   Karaha said he expected the peace summit in Pretoria, organized
by South African President Nelson Mandela in a bid to avert a
deepening crisis in sub-Saharan Africa, to persuade Kabila to
negotiate with the rebels and prevent foreign intervention.
	   ``We hope that the summit can pursuade Zimbabwe to withdraw
their troops,'' Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, the leader of the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition said. ``We also hope that the summit
will arrive at achieving a formula that will permit the finding of
a peaceful solution to the problem.''
	   But in Kinshasa, Information Minister Didier Mumengi told
reporters that Kabila may ask for a postponement, and if the
meeting is not postponed, it would have to go on without him.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis fighters and
disenchanted members of the Congolese army _ accuse Kabila of
power-grabbing, tribalism and mismanagement of the vast African
nation.
	   Kabila, in turn, accuses Rwanda and Uganda of sponsoring the
revolt and appealed for help from Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola.
Both Rwanda and Uganda denied the charge.
	   Karaha said he hoped Angola would not get involved.
	   ``We are natural allies. We don't have problems with Angola,''
he said.
	   Karaha also accused Kabila of ordering the execution of 20,000
ethnic Tutsis in Moba in southeastern Congo, a move which he said
promoted the rebels to move on to the Lake Tanganyika port of
Kalemie to prevent the killing.
	   ``We have to intervene to prevent Kabila from killing people,''
Karaha said.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ President Robert Mugabe, whose nation
has sent troops to support embattled Congolese leader Laurent
Kabila, is snubbing a peace summit called by South Africa, his
office said Saturday.
	   There was no immediate official reaction from Zimbabwean
officials to a Congolese rebel claim that they shot down two
Zimbabwean jet fighters on Saturday.
	   But a duty officer at the Zimbabwe Air Force operations center
said: ``I don't think it can be right. We don't have any fighters
up there.''
	   The officer refused to give his name, saying he wasn't
authorized to give out information.
	   Zimbabwe is believed to have squadron of Chinese-made MiG-21
interceptors with limited range and Spanish-made Casa transport
planes suitable for dropping paratroopers. Although Zimbabwe has
sent soldiers to Congo, there have been no reports it has sent
warplanes.

Report: gunmen raid jail, free prisoners, seize weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A band of men in military uniforms raided
a government prison in an eastern town, freeing 110 prisoners and
seizing guns and ammunition, a government-owned newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   Wardens from the prison near Mbale, 250 kilometers (150 miles)
east of Kampala, were quoted by the New Vision newspaper as saying
the attackers described themselves as rebels fighting the
government of President Yoweri Museveni.
	   It did not say what faction the attackers claimed to represent,
but the Ugandan military is already fighting several well-armed
guerrilla bands in the northern and eastern parts of the country.
	   Government offices were closed Saturday and no officials could
be reached for comment on the report.
	   The attackers staged their raid just as prisoners were about to
be taken out for a day of manual labor in surrounding villages, the
newspaper said.
	   When wardens opened the front gate, they found themselves
confronting an armed band, according to the account. It did not
report any exchange of fire, or provide details about the arms
seized by the attackers.
	   Mathias Akabwai, the Mbale district commissioner, was quoted by
the newspaper as saying the raiders belonged to the same group that
struck a police station near the town last weekend, killing one
policeman and injuring another.

Italian military officer dies of wounds in Kabul attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian soldier wounded by unidentified gunmen in
the Afghan capital of Kabul died Saturday, the Italian defense
ministry said.
	   The United Nations said Friday that the Italian and a French man
were shot as they drove in Kabul.
	   The shooting occurred a day after a U.S. cruise missile attack
on a suspected terrorist base in Afghanistan that reportedly killed
24 people.
	   It was not clear if the attack was related to Thursday's U.S.
missile strikes.
	   The Italian defense ministry had said Friday that Lt. Col.
Carmine Calo, posted in Kabul since July as part of the U.N.
observer force, was hit by a ricocheting bullet as he was traveling
in a U.N. vehicle to his post. Calo died in a Kabul civilian
hospital of complications from his wounds, the ministery said.
	   The French foreign mnistry on Friday said the Frenchman, Eric
Lavertu, a civilian U.N. worker, was wounded in the hand.
	   Foreigners had been advised Wednesday to leave Afghanistan.
Those still in Kabul stayed out of sight Friday while the United
Nations and other agencies arranged evacuations.
	   U.S. officials said Thursday's missile attacks were meant to
disrupt the infrastructure of a guerrilla organization run by Osama
bin Laden, an anti-American Islamic militant whom U.S. officials
suspect of involvement in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Mexico readies for financially austere year
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Mexican government is preparing for some
fiscal belt-tightening in the face of global economic turmoil and
stagnation in oil prices.
	   The Mexican peso tumbled to an all-time low of almost 10 pesos
to the dollar on Friday, while Mexico's stock market dropped to its
lowest level since December 1996.
	   Finance Undersecretary Santiago Levy said the government's 1999
budget draft would be affected.
	   ``Generally, it will be an austere budget, because as we have
seen, there has been an important drop in oil prices and we do not
expect they will recover aggressively next year,'' he told
reporters.
	   Falling oil prices have already prompted the government to make
three budget cuts so far this year, totaling dlrs 3.6 billion, or
about 8 percent of planned spending.
	   Oil sales account for a third of government revenues.
	   Mexico's central bank has stepped in to try to stabilize the
economy.
	   Over the last weeks, the bank has drastically restricted
Mexico's monetary supply in an effort to prompt higher interest
rates, which could discourage investors from trading pesos for
dollars.
	   Massive capital flight caused major financial crises during the
last three administrations, leading to major devaluations,
inflation and higher unemployment.
	   Levy met with a congressional commission to begin negotiations
on the 1999 federal budget draft, which the government must submit
to the lower house by Nov. 15.
	   Since last year's midterm elections, when the opposition gained
control of the lower house of Congress, the administration of
President Ernesto Zedillo has repeatedly clashed with opposition
parties on a number of economic proposals, including a dlrs 65
billion bank bailout plan.
	   The political fallout of Zedillo's bank bailout proposal, and
the prospect of higher inflation and reduced government spending,
could hurt the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in the 2000
presidential elections.

Cyprus cabaret owner wounded in gang shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMASSOL, Cyprus (AP) - A cabaret owner was shot and wounded
before dawn Saturday in the fourth gang attack in about a month.
	   Vangelis Christodoulou, 35, was shot and seriously wounded by a
man with a shotgun as he was leaving his cabaret, a police
statement said. A man was later detained in connection with the
shooting, the statement added. Police said the shooting was related
to recent gang violence.
	   Christodoulou's shooting followed the Monday attack against pub
owner Lemis Neoptolemou. He was injured when a remote-controlled
bomb exploded as he was leaving his pub in Limassol's nightclub
district, only a short distance from Christodoulou's cabaret.
	   Neoptolemou had been a prosecution witness in the trial of three
brothers of the Aeroporos family, Limassol's most notorious
underworld clan. They were tried for the attempted murder in May
last year of Andonis Fanieros, the reputed underworld leader of
Larnaca, a town 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of Limassol.
	   The Aeroporos brothers were acquitted in the Fanieros case in
June. In late July, one of the brothers, Andros, 32, was shot and
killed as he was leaving a Limassol nightclub.
	   On Aug. 9, Andonis Fanieros' son, Loucas, 31, escaped unhurt
when his car was sprayed with bullets outside a Larnaca nightclub.
	   Justice and Police Minister Nicos Koshis ordered greatly
increased police patrols and surveillance in Limassol after the
Aeroporos murder, fearing a fresh outbreak of gang warfare.

Journalist begins 20-month prison sentence for libel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A journalist in northwest Romania has
started a ten-month prison term after being convicted in April on a
libel charge for criticizing a local judge, Romanian media reported
Saturday.
	   Cornel Sabou, editor in chief of Trans Pres, a small private
news agency in the northwest city of Baia Mare, was arrested and
taken to jail Friday to start his sentence, the news agency
Mediafax reported.
	   He was convicted and sentenced by a court in April. Sabou was
also fined 500,000 lei (dlrs 57) and ordered to pay 300 million lei
(dlrs 34,000) in damages. A colleague was also fined 500,000 in
connection with the case.
	   In post-Communist Romania, officials are unaccustomed to
criticism in the free-wheeling press. Justice officials are often
suspected to be corrupt. They are accused of delaying some cases
for years while rushing through others in which they have a vested
interest.
	   Last year, Sabou, 26, wrote a series of articles accusing judge
Mariana Iancu of forgery and of allegedly using her position to
exert influence on a local level, the daily National reported.
	   The judge was demoted after the articles appeared, but continued
to work in the city in a lower position.
	   It was second case in recent weeks in which a journalist were
convicted for allegedly libeling a justice official.
	   Two journalists were sentenced to a prison term, deprived of
civil rights for one year and ordered to pay damages equal to dlrs
170,000 after a judge sued them for allegedly libeling her husband.
They are free pending an appeal.

	   The outlawed group made its announcement hours before the people
of Ireland, north and south alike, prepared to observe a minute's
silence in memory of the 28 people slain in last weekend's car bomb
in Omagh. That attack was carried out by different anti-British
gang nicknamed the ``Real IRA.''
	   The INLA statement will come as a significant boost to restoring
confidence in Northern Ireland's search for peace.
	   The paramilitary group's last admitted violent act was June 25,

of its political representatives, the Irish Republican Socialist
Party _ means that only one anti-British group, the Continuity IRA,
has yet to call a truce.
	   ``We acknowledge and admit faults and grievous errors in our
prosecution of the war,'' the statement said.
	   ``Innocent people were killed and injured and at times our
actions as a liberation army fell far short of what they should
have been,'' it added. ``or this we as republicans, as socialists
and as revolutionaries offer a sincere and heartfelt apology.''

Flight from Guam to Tokyo hits turbulence, minor injuries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Continental Micronesia jet hit air turbulence on
a flight from the U.S. territory of Guam to Tokyo on Saturday,
slightly injuring two or three people aboard, police said.
	   Minoru Matsumura, an airport police spokesman, said the injured
headed for a clinic on their own after arriving on Flight 967 at
New Tokyo International Airport at Narita on Saturday evening.
	   Narita is 65 kilometers (40 miles), northeast of Tokyo.
	   The spokesman said it was not immediately clear where the flight
hit the turbulence, exactly how many were injured or whether those
hurt were passengers or crew members.
	   In December, sudden turbulence hit a United Airlines jet as it
was flying over the Pacific from Tokyo to Honolulu. A 32-year-old
woman died of a head injury and more than 100 others were hurt.

Congolese rebels say they shot down two Zimbabwean warplanes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 5-6 with reaction to claim &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila said Saturday they had shot down two Zimbabwean jet
fighters southwest of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   ``Just this morning, we have shot down two of their jet
fighters,'' Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister who
defected to the rebels, said. ``And this is just a warning.''
	   ``It should be understood that the people of Congo are ready to
resist any foreign aggression.''
	   Karaha did not specify where the planes were shot down or what
happened to the pilots. No independent confirmation was possible.
	   There was no immediate official reaction from Zimbabwean
officials to the report, but a duty officer at the Zimbabwe Air
Force operations center said he doubted the report because he knew
of no Zimbabwean aircraft in Congo. The officer refused to give his
name, saying he wasn't authorized to give out information.
	   State-controlled television and radio in Kinshasa made no
mention of the rebel claims of downing the two fighter jets.
Government officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Karaha accused Zimbabwe of sending 900 troops to help Kabila's
embattled government ward off rebels advances and said 500 of them
had been sent to the frontlines in western Congo.
	   ``We shall continue to resist,'' he said.
	   Karaha said until Kabila agreed to a cease-fire and to a
negotiated political solution which the rebel coalition had
proposed on Wednesday, the rebels would continue to march on
several fronts.
	   ``We're marching on Kinshasa. We're marching on Kisangani. We're
marching on Katanga,'' he said. Kisangani, in north central Congo,
is the nation's third-largest city. Katanga region in the southeast
is home to Kabila, and he is believed to be directing war efforts
from there.
	   ``We're ready for negotiations with Kabila, but instead he is
sending jet fighters on us,'' Karaha said.
	   Karaha said he expected the peace summit in Pretoria, organized
by South African President Nelson Mandela in a bid to avert a
deepening crisis in sub-Saharan Africa, to persuade Kabila to
negotiate with the rebels and prevent foreign intervention.
	   ``We hope that the summit can pursuade Zimbabwe to withdraw
their troops,'' Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, the leader of the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition said. ``We also hope that the summit
will arrive at achieving a formula that will permit the finding of
a peaceful solution to the problem.''
	   But in Kinshasa, Information Minister Didier Mumengi told
reporters that Kabila may ask for a postponement, and if the
meeting is not postponed, it would have to go on without him.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis fighters and
disenchanted members of the Congolese army _ accuse Kabila of
power-grabbing, tribalism and mismanagement of the vast African
nation.
	   Kabila, in turn, accuses Rwanda and Uganda of sponsoring the
revolt and appealed for help from Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola.
Both Rwanda and Uganda denied the charge.
	   Karaha said he hoped Angola would not get involved.
	   ``We are natural allies. We don't have problems with Angola,''
he said.
	   Karaha also accused Kabila of ordering the execution of 20,000
ethnic Tutsis in Moba in southeastern Congo, a move which he said
promoted the rebels to move on to the Lake Tanganyika port of
Kalemie to prevent the killing.
	   ``We have to intervene to prevent Kabila from killing people,''
Karaha said.

Three smugglers sentenced, army troops accused for first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TANGIERS, Morocco (AP) _ A court has convicted three
emigrant-smugglers and for the first time fingered Moroccan army
officers for allegedly aiding a clandestine boat people operation
across the Mediterranean.
	   North Africans, mainly from Morocco, have long sought to get to
Europe by paying smugglers to take them across the Mediterranean to
Spain in often unseaworthy boats. Dozens have drowned in recent
sinkings.
	   The court on Friday convicted the three men of complicity and
sentenced them to prison terms of one to two years, while the
ringleader and other accomplices remained at large.
	   It acquitted seven members of the army, also accused of
complicity. But it was the first time the army was linked to
illegal emigration since Moroccan troops were deployed on the
Mediterranean coast in the early 1990s in an effort to stem the
tide.
	   Three of them _ two sergeants and a corporal _ were accused of
actively participating the week before in the nighttime sailing of
a boatload of 20 emigrants from a beach near Tangiers.
	   The emigrants were arrested Aug. 14 as they made their way
toward Spain after paying the smugglers between 4,000 and 8,000
dirham (dlrs 400-800). The emigrants were given a suspended
one-month sentence and fined 500 dirhams (dlrs 50).

Irish National Liberation Army announces cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES URGENT series, RAISES group's apology for violence;
EDITS pvs to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Prewss Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Irish National Liberation
Army, a small but vicious anti-British gang opposed to the Belfast
peace agreement, announced a cease-fire Saturday and apologized for
killing innocent people.
	   The outlawed group made its announcement hours before the people
of Ireland, north and south alike, prepared to observe a minute's
silence in memory of the 28 people slain in last weekend's car bomb
in Omagh. That attack was carried out by different anti-British
gang nicknamed the ``Real IRA.''
	   The INLA statement will come as a significant boost to restoring
confidence in Northern Ireland's search for peace.
	   The paramilitary group's last admitted violent act was June 25,
when a car bomb destroyed part of the border town of
Newtownhamilton, wounding 11 people.
	   The development follows the Irish Republican Army cease-fire of
July 1997 and the announcement Wednesday by the Real IRA dissidents
to observe their own ``suspension'' of attacks in British-ruled
Northern Ireland.
	   The INLA statement _ announced at the west Belfast headquarters
of its political representatives, the Irish Republican Socialist
Party _ means that only one anti-British group, the Continuity IRA,
has yet to call a truce.
	   ``We acknowledge and admit faults and grievous errors in our
prosecution of the war,'' the statement said.
	   ``Innocent people were killed and injured and at times our
actions as a liberation army fell far short of what they should
have been,'' it added. ``or this we as republicans, as socialists
and as revolutionaries offer a sincere and heartfelt apology.''
	   The INLA has killed more than 150 people since its foundation in
1975 during the IRA's first lengthy truce.
	   Its goal, like the IRA's, was to abolish Northern Ireland as a
Protestant-majority state linked with Britain. Its deadliest attack
came in 1982 when it bombed a rural disco frequented by off-duty
British troops, killing 11 soldiers and six Protestant women.
	   The INLA frequently suffered from fratricial in-fighting. Its
former commander, Gino Gallagher, was assassinated in Belfast last
year by comrades arguing about how to split the proceeds from
drug-dealing and other criminal rackets.
	   The leaders of Ireland's four largest Christian denominations _
Catholic, Presbyterian, Anglican and Methodist _ have called for
Ireland's 5.2 million people to fall silent at 3:10 p.m. (1410GMT),
exactly one week after a car bomb planted by the Real IRA killed 28
people and wounded more than 330 in the town 70 miles (110 kms)
west of Belfast.
	   Omagh itself was the focus of Saturday's ``Acts of Prayerful
Reflection.''
	   ``We want to say with as loud a voice as possible that evil is
not going to defeat us and that good will prevail,'' said a
Presbyterian minister in Omagh, the Rev. Robert Herron.
	   Ministers will lead ecumenical prayers in public places in at
least 40 other towns across Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic.
	   ``We must all go out in huge numbers if we can. It will be an
important act of solidarity at this difficult time,'' said Irish
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who will visit patients in Omagh's
Tyrone County Hospital after attending the ceremony.
	   In a symbol of new life amid so much death, a 21-year-old
Protestant woman, Nicola Emery, who suffered leg wounds in the
blast gave birth Friday in another hospital to a 7-pound, 6-ounce
(3.3 kg) baby girl.
	   ``I hope that the wee girl can grow up without any violence,
without bombs and can be safe,'' said Michael Mulholland, the
baby's father.
	   Public revulsion against the dissidents who refused to accept
the IRA's July 1997 truce was demonstrated Friday in the Irish
Republic border town of Dundalk, where several hundred people
rallied in support of the Omagh victims.
	   Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, the political activist most
prominently associated with the dissidents, was prevented from
opening up her picture-frame and printing shop in a Dundalk
shopping mall.
	   Mall managers complained they were losing business and change
dthe local on her shop. Two security guards kicked her out after
she refused to leave.

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila said Saturday they had shot down two Zimbabwean jet
fighters southwest of Kinshasa and moved to within 30 kilometers
(15 miles) of the capital.
	   ``Just this morning, we have shot down two of their jet
fighters,'' Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister who
defected to the rebels, said. ``And this is just a warning.''
	   He said rebels forces had advanced to Kasangulu, 30 kilometers
(19 miles) southwest of Kinshasa, after the government forces there
ran away. The report could not be confirmed independently.
	   ``It should be understood that the people of Congo are ready to
resist any foreign aggression.''

Singapore stops short of condoning U.S. bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Singapore government condemned acts of
terrorism on Saturday but stopped short of condoning the U.S.
decision to bomb targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   ``Singapore believes that the only effective response to such
acts of terrorism is for the international community to work
together to take firm action against terrorism,'' said a statement
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
	   It did not elaborate on whether the Singapore government
actually opposed the surprise air strikes, which were launched on
Thursday against targets identified by Washington as sites of
terrorist activity.
	   The U.S. retaliation for the terrorist bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania has drawn a mixed global response, from angry protests in
a number of Arab countries to open support from a number of allies.
	   In its statement commenting on both the terrorist actions and
the U.S. retaliation, Singapore said that it ``regrets the loss of
lives,'' and has ``consistently supported international cooperation
in the fight against terrorism.''
	   The ministry went on to strongly condemn terrorism, which
``undermines the principles of international law and the
maintenance of the international order,'' provoking ``a cycle of
violence that only harms the innocent.''
	   The Southeast Asian nation is an ally with the United States,
which maintains naval logistics operations in the country.

Thailand's prime minister says name all involved in bank scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Bangkok, Thailand (AP) _ Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said
the names of those involved in a bad loan scandal at a troubled
Thai bank should be made public if the law permits, local papers
reported Saturday.
	   Scandal erupted at the Bangkok Bank of Commerce in 1996 after
bank directors revealed they bad debts approaching dlrs 3 billion,
and said several politicians had borrowed money on fake collateral
and never repaid.
	   BBC was taken over by the government and will be merged into
another bank under the Chuan government's bank restructuring plan.
BBC employees have been calling on the central bank governor to
reveal the names of the politicians who allegedly looted the bank.
	   The governor has refused, saying it is a political matter
whether or not to reveal the names, and so politicians should
decide.
	   Chuan said politicians should not be singled out because
borrowing is a private matter, as well as the refusal to pay,
according to the Bangkok Post.
	   He said it was still unsure that whether the law permits the
disclosure of borrowers' names.
	   Most of the politicians who borrowed from the bank do not come
from Chuan's Democrat Party.

Hanson supporter says Asian nations poor on race relations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Asian countries have an ``appalling
record on race relations'' and have no right to accuse right-wing
Australian politician Pauline Hanson of racism, a spokesman for her
party said Saturday.
	   One Nation spokesman David Oldfield said the idea that people in
Asia could be worried that the anti-immigration Hanson is a racist
is ``laughable for two reasons.''
	   ``The first is that Pauline Hanson is not a racist,'' said
Oldfield. ``The second is that Asia itself has an appalling record
in race relations and does not have a credible position to comment
on any other nation.''
	   Oldfield was responding to Queensland premier Peter Beattie, who
said Saturday that Hanson had generated far greater racist fears in
Asia than most Australians were aware.
	   ``The damage was more significant than I thought,'' Beattie said
after returning from a five-day visit to Hong Kong and Japan. ``The
visit hopefully put a lot of minds at rest in Asia and repaired a
large part of the damage caused by One Nation.''
	   Hanson's One Nation party made its election debut at the June 13
poll which brought Beattie's Labor Party to power. One Nation, a
populist party which critics say is anti-Asian and anti-Aboriginal,
captured 11 seats and 23 percent of the vote.
	   Hanson was elected to the federal Parliament as an independent
in 1996, and later formed One Nation. She claims Australia is in
danger of becoming ``Asianized,'' wants to drastically cut
immigration levels, opposes special welfare payments to Aborigines
and advocates economic protectionism.
	   But Oldfield said impressions abroad that Hanson is racist are
misguided.
	   ``Those who have opposed her have used racism as a dishonest
form of weapon against her,'' he said. ``She is not responsible for
the perceptions they have created inside or outside of Australia.''

With protests, marches, Sudan seeks to rally weary people
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details from rally, one of the wounded dying of
injuries &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Chanting ``God is greater than America,''
thousands of Sudanese gathered outside the presidential palace
Saturday to protest the U.S. attack against a factory in Khartoum.
	   In the midst of the crowd hung a yellow banner reading ``Forward
ever, backward never. Yesterday Nairobi, tomorrow the White House''
_ a reference to the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi,
Kenya.
	   President Clinton ordered a missile attack Thursday against a
factory in Sudan in retaliation for the bombing in Nairobi and one
the same day in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. U.S. missiles also struck
suspected camps of Muslim militant Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   One of the 10 people wounded in the Sudan strike has died,
state-run Sudan Television said.
	   Sudan's beleaguered government has sought to rally a people
weary of war and economic hardship against the attack.
	   Saturday's crowd denounced America and Sudanese opposition
figures that the government considers traitors.
	   One soldier in green camouflage and a red head band that read
``No, no to America'' collected donations for the government's war
against southern rebels.
	   A 15-year-old boy in camouflage, who would only identify himself
as Holy Warrior Mustafa, said ``God willing, we will carry weapons
and defend our country.''
	   One banner hit on a theme sounded time and again by Sudanese:
U.S. President Clinton launched the attack to draw attention from
his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern.
	   It said: ``No war for Monica.''
	   Schools let students out early to attend the rally outside the
office of President Omar el-Bashir. Government ministries asked
employees to attend the protest, which lasted about three hours.
	   While Khartoum residents expressed surprise at the missile
strike, many said they thought there was little their government
could do.
	   ``We are not strong enough to face the west,'' Mamoun Rahama,
said a 29-year-old who works at a textile factory near the
destroyed plant. ``We cannot face a greater force.''
	   El-Bashir told a Friday rally that Sudan could ``prove that the
factory is specifically for pharmaceutical production'' and not
chemical weapons as described by U.S. officials.
	   Sudan planned to lodge complaints with the Arab League and the
Organization of African Unity, and its diplomats asked the Security
Council Friday to convene an urgent meeting to consider a U.N.
investigation into the attack.
	   The Islamic leaders in Sudan, where as many as nine out of 10 of
the country's 28 million people live in poverty, oversee a network
of well-organized cadres which can bring thousands into the
streets. Their security network is pervasive, keeping a close eye
on dissent.
	   The factory that was struck _ El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries
Co. _ was hit by six Tomahawk cruise missiles.
	   It was virtually destroyed. Brown glass jars sat in piles amid
crushed red bricks and twisted sheet metal. Civil defense workers
said fires at the site burned until Friday night and their pungent
fumes hung over the site like a cloud.
	   The U.S. government said the factory produced precursors for
chemical weapons. State-run Sudan Television said that the factory,
which opened in 1996, produced about half of the medicine in Sudan,
Africa's largest country and one of its poorest. It described its
main products as antibiotics and drugs to treat malaria and
tuberculosis.
	   In Cairo, a Sudanese opposition group accused the government of
backing what it described as terrorism and said it had provided
refuge to followers of bin Laden, who lived in Sudan for five years
before he was forced to move to Afghanistan.

After 90-year journey, Tolstoy letters return to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three letters, whose 90-year journey could be the
stuff of an epic novel, have made their way back to a museum
dedicated to the man who wrote them: Leo Tolstoy.
	   The letters were written to a young Ukrainian follower of
Tolstoy between 1906 and 1909, and carried by his descendants as
they were tossed by the political currents of the century.
	   The Sheerman family was persecuted by the Soviet Union and
emigrated to Nazi Germany to serve as laborers during World War II.
After the war, the descendants of Vladimir Sheerman emigrated to
Argentina, where they live today.
	   ``And for all this time and through all these troubles and
misfortunes, members of my family carried these papers. For a time
I couldn't understand why they bothered,'' said Vladimir's
granddaughter, 75-year-old Maria Sheerman.
	   She spoke Friday at a ceremony to turn over the letters to the
Leo Tolstoy State Museum, the Moscow Times reported Saturday. She
and her husband, Constantino Jendreievsky, came from Buenos Aires
at the invitation of the Russian Culture Ministry.
	   Vladimir Sheerman was a young landowner who, captivated by
Tolstoy's theories of communal property, decided to give away his
land to his peasants and establish a commune.
	   In one of the letters donated to the museum, the author of ``War
and Peace'' councils the young man to think twice about his
decision because he might live to regret it. The letters ended the
year before Tolstoy's death in 1910.
	   Sheerman went ahead and gave away the property, alienating the
czarist regime, which sent him into exile for two years. Nor did it
endear him to the Bolshevik leaders who took over the country in
1917 and deemed him a class enemy. He ultimately died in 1939,
after wandering the country to avoid Stalinist persecution.
	   His descendants say they hope the trip will allow them to learn
more about the family's past. The museum has already one step in
that direction by offering them access to the letters Maria's
grandfather wrote to Tolstoy.

Jospin gets record approval rating; Chirac's lofty score also rises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: For release at 1600 GMT; time set by source
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin is still
riding high in the polls, reaching a record approval rating of 63
percent in a new survey released Saturday. Conservative President
Jacques Chirac got his third-highest score.
	   Benefiting from a gradual economic recovery, Jospin's rating
rose four points since last month, said the IFOP polling agency. It
was Jospin's highest IFOP score since taking office in June last
year.
	   Chirac's positive rating, 62 percent, was up three points from
the month before.
	   It was Chirac's third-highest score since the 63 and 64 percent
ratings he received in late 1995, said IFOP, which conducted the
survey for the newspaper Journal de Dimanche.
	   Chirac and Jospin have both enjoyed strong public support in
recent months as unemployment fell below 12 percent and 1998 growth
is expected at around 3 percent.
	   Pollsters have also pointed to an upbeat national mood during
summer vacation and after the French hosted and won the World Cup
of soccer in July.
	   Pollsters caution that the leaders' public support could wane
when the French return to work next month and unions threaten
protests against austerity measures and a 35-hour work week plan
Jospin has had trouble convincing businesses to accept.
	   Elected in May 1995, Chirac stumbled last year when he called
early parliamentary elections in which Jospin's leftist coalition
defeated the president's conservatives, fording Chirac to share
power.
	   But the public has generally approved of the ``cohabitation''
between Chirac and the moderate Jospin, who has proceeded with
privatizations and budgetary austerity to prepare for the euro
currency next year.
	   The poll was conducted Aug. 20-21 and surveyed a nationally
representative sampling of 927 French adults. No margin of error
was given, but French polls of that magnitude usually carry an
error margin of 2-3 percent.

Congo peace talks being held in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The presidents of Rwanda and
Uganda, accused by Congo President Laurent Kabila of supporting
rebels in his country, arrived here on Saturday for peace talks
with Kabila's envoy.
	   Congolese Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo was to represent
Kabila at Saturday's talks, said President Nelson Mandela's
spokesman, Parks Mankahlana.
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu and Kongolo were to open the talks Saturday afternoon
after having lunch at Mandela's residence, Mankahlana said.
	   Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who has sent troops to Congo
to back Kabila, was invited to the meeting but boycotted it because
it didn't include countries _ like Zimbabwe _ which support
military intervention in Congo, Mugabe's office said.
	   The meeting was to be followed Sunday by a full meeting of
Southern African Development Community on the crisis in Central
Africa, Mankahlana said.
	   The 14-member SADC summit is aimed at resolving a split within
the group on how best to deal with the crisis. Mandela has ruled
out military intervention in the Congo war.

Rwanda; Kabila envoy not having arrived &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's plans to hold a
summit to end the Congo crisis hit a snag Saturday when two key
figures failed to appear.
	   Only two heads of state of the four invited showed up: the
presidents of Rwanda and Uganda. Congo accuses Rwanda and Uganda of
supporting rebels in the country.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila declined to come and was instead
reportedly sending his justice minister, Mwenze Kongolo. But by
late Saturday afternoon _ well beyond the time when the peace talks
were to have begun _ Kongolo hadn't arrived.
	   Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe _ who is backing Kabila with
troops _ boycotted the meeting because it didn't include other
countries which support military intervention in Congo.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela was having ``an exhange
of views'' with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan
President Pasteur Bizimungu, according to Mandela's spokesman,
Parks Mankahlana.
	   But without the participation of the opposing sides, little
stood to be achieved.
	   Reporters were kept away from the meeting site, a residence for
visiting VIPs in Pretoria, the capital.
	   On Sunday, the Southern African Development Community planned to
hold a meeting in Pretoria to resolve a split within the 14-nation
group on how best to deal with the Congo crisis.
	   While Zimbabwe and reportedly Angola and sending troops to back
Kabila, South Africa has ruled out military intervention and wants
other countries to take the same stance.

Some 500 Muslims return to their pre-war homes in southern town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPLJINA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Some 500 Muslims returned to
their pre-war homes in this tense, Croat-held southern town
Saturday, local officials reported.
	   They stressed that there were no incidents during the return _ a
significant development, because several Muslim houses were
destroyed and many Muslim returnees harassed in the town over the
past three years.
	   Most of the Muslim families fled Capljina, where Bosnian Croats
took control during the war in 1993, and found refuge in towns and
villages to the north.
	   The return to Capljina was part of a local project for the
return of Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims to their homes in
southern Bosnia.
	   Several thousand refugees have returned to this region over the
past weeks. According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
this is a part of the overall figure of some 500,000 Bosnian Serbs,
Croats and Muslims who have returned to their pre-war homes since
the end of the war in 1995.
	   Still, more than one million people remain displaced within
Bosnia and across Europe, and international officials and aid
agencies are trying to speed up their return.

First-stage champion Iwata loses opener in second stage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ First-stage champion Jubilo Iwata blew a 2-0
first-half lead as Yokohama Marinos came from behind to win in
extra-time in an opening game of the second stage of Japan's
professional soccer J-League Saturday.
	   Yokohama scored two goals after the interval and substitute
Sotaro Yasunaga kicked a sudden-death goal 22 minutes into extra
time for the 3-2 away victory.
	   Visiting Shimizu S-Pulse, which placed second in the first stage
on goal differences, beat Yokohama Flugels 4-2. Junji Nishizawa
headed home to break a 2-2 tie in the 60th minute, followed by
Kenta Hasegawa's goal 13 minutes later.
	   Kashima Antlers, last season's first-stage winner, got off to a
good start with a 3-1 victory over JEF United Ichihara. Kashima
finished fifth in the first stage.
	   The second stage extends through Nov. 14. If two teams emerge as
stage winners, they will have to play off for the league
championship in a two-leg series Nov. 21 and 28.

Sudanese rally against U.S. strikes

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sudanese stoning British Embassy, tearing apart
Union Jack, quotes from Sudanese president &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Chanting ``God is greater than America,''
thousands of Sudanese gathered outside the presidential palace
Saturday to protest the U.S. attack against a factory in Khartoum.
	   In the midst of the crowd hung a yellow banner reading ``Forward
ever, backward never. Yesterday Nairobi, tomorrow the White House''
_ a reference to the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi,
Kenya.
	   President Bill Clinton ordered a missile attack Thursday against
a factory in Sudan in retaliation for the bombing in Nairobi and
one the same day in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. U.S. missiles also
struck suspected camps of Muslim militant Osama bin Laden in
Afghanistan.
	   Protesters hurled stones at the British Embassy _ Britain has
expressed strong support for the strikes _ and one young man
climbed up the embassy flagpole and cut down the Union Jack.
	   After the flag fell to the ground, angry demonstrators tore it
apart.
	   Sudan's beleaguered government has sought to use the strikes,
which left one dead and nine wounded, to rally a people weary of
war and economic hardship.
	   Saturday's crowd denounced America and Sudanese opposition
figures that the government considers traitors.
	   One soldier in green camouflage and a red head band that read
``No, no to America'' collected donations for the government's war
against southern rebels.
	   A 15-year-old boy in camouflage, who would only identify himself
as Holy Warrior Mustafa, said ``God willing, we will carry weapons
and defend our country.''
	   One banner hit on a theme sounded time and again by Sudanese:
Clinton launched the attack to draw attention from his affair with
Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. It said: ``No war for
Monica.''
	   ``This is a wicked president,'' said President Omar el-Bashir,
jabbing a black staff into the air. ``This president lied to the
whole world and to his people, and he is still lying.''
	   El-Bashir struck a militant chord, calling Sudan's defiance of
the United States a war for the sake of Islam. His adviser sounded
a similar theme.
	   ``We reserve for ourselves the right to respond against American
interests anywhere in the world,'' said Brig. Bakri Hassan Saleh,
minister for presidential affairs.
	   Schools let students out early to attend the rally outside of
el-Bashir's office. Government ministries asked employees to attend
the protest, which lasted about three hours.

At least 15 said to die from tainted water
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MODADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least 15 people were reported dead
and another three dozen seriously sickened after drinking water
that had been hauled in a barrel apparently tainted with toxic
material.
	   Sketchy reports on Saturday said the poisonings occurred after
nomads in a dry area asked travelers to fill the barrel from wells
that were several days walk away. Those who drank the water later
suffered convulsions, and some died, according to the reports.
	   A militia commander in the area contacted by radio, Col.
Abdirizak Hassan Awl, said a few of those who were sickened managed
to reach the town of Abudwaq to seek help, and told officials there
what had happened.
	   Awl said the barrel had apparently previously contained toxic
material, possibly ingredients for fertilizer.
	   The incident occurred in the central region of Galgudud, about
200 miles (320 km) northeast of the capital, Mogadishu.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ President Robert Mugabe's spokesman on
Saturday rejected Congolese rebel claims that they shot down two
Zimbabwean jet fighters.
	   Spokesman George Charamba said Zimbabwe had not deployed its
Chinese-made MiG-21 interceptors along with ground troops to
support embattled Congolese leader Laurent Kabila, the official
Zimbabwe news agency reported.
	   ``We have no MiG fighters in DRC (the Democratic Republic of
Congo) ... our deployment in the DRC did not have that dimension,''
Charamba was quoted as saying.
	   In his statement to the state-run media, Charamba did not
mention the British Hawk ground attack jets or the Spanish Casa
transport planes _ suitable for dropping paratroopers _ which
Zimbabwe also possesses. He did not return repeated phone calls
seeking clarification.
	   A duty officer at the Zimbabwe Air Force operations center said
of the rebels' claim: ``I don't think it can be right. We don't
have any fighters up there.''
	   The officer refused to give his name, saying he wasn't
authorized to give information.
	   Although Zimbabwe has sent soldiers to Congo, there have been no
reports it has sent warplanes.
	   The Herald newspaper, meanwhile, quoted unidentified witnesses
as saying a Russian built cargo plane was loaded with ``a variety
of war equipment'' at an air force base outside Harare and was
headed for the Congolese capital.
	   It said Zimbabwe's intervention aimed to make the war
``unwinnable for the rebels'' and force negotiations to end the
conflict.
	   Charamba refused to say how many Zimbabwean troops were being
sent to Congo.

Sudan dissidents say terror will end only when government toppled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The only way to end the Sudanese
government's support for terrorism is to overthrow it, Sudanese
opposition groups said here Saturday.
	   A statement issued at the end of a meeting of the National
Democratic Alliance, the umbrella group of Sudanese dissidents,
said the Khartoum government ``depends on terrorism as a means of
extending its authority and combating the popular movement which
opposes its policies,'' Egypt's official Middle East News Agency
reported.
	   The alliance meeting in the Egyptian capital came two days after
U.S. missiles destroyed a factory in north Khartoum which the
Americans said made the ingredients of chemical weapons. Sudan said
it manufactured only pharmaceutical products.
	   ``The ruling regime in Khartoum opened Sudan's doors to the
militants groups and international terrorism ... and gave them
weapons and money, and helped them to penetrate other countries to
carry out criminal acts,'' said the statement.
	   The United States and Egypt have long accused Sudan of harboring
Muslim extremists. The United States has withdrawn its diplomats
from Khartoum and imposed limited sanctions on Sudan because of
this concern. Egypt accuses Khartoum of providing sanctuary for
three men implicated in the 1995 assassination attempt on President
Hosni Mubarak.
	   Sudan denies the U.S. and Egyptian allegations.
	   The alliance called on the international community to send an
committee to investigate ``the terrorist sites in Sudan which
produce chemical weapons,'' MENA reported.
	   Sudan's role in terrorism will not end ``until the dictatorial
regime in Sudan, which instilled the culture of violence and
terrorism in the region, is removed,'' the alliance said.
	   The alliance includes the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which
has been waging an insurrection in southern Sudan since 1983, and
the Umma Party of former Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi, who was
overthrown when the military-backed government seized power in
1989.
	   The head of the alliance, Mohammed Othman al-Merghani, met
Saturday with Egyptian Foreign Minister for talks on recent events
in Sudan, reported MENA. No other details were immediately
available.
	   More than 1.5 million people have died in the Sudanese
insurrection and related famines.

	   MIANSHAH, Pakistan (AP) _ A militant Islamic group in Pakistan
denied on Saturday that the Afghan bases bombed by the United
States were used to train terrorists, and vowed to avenge the
deaths of those killed in the attack.
	   Meanwhile, a Pakistani who was in Afghanistan on the night of
the U.S. strike said he saw fire in the sky, then felt the missiles
hit what Washington says was a training camp for Islamic militants.
	   ``There was panic and screaming, and people running everywhere.
I remember nothing after that because I passed out,'' Muhammed
Furqan told The Associated Press on Saturday from his hospital bed
in Mianshah, a Pakistani town near the camp.
	   He had wounds on his legs, chest and head that he said were
received in Thursday's attack.
	   A total of 27 people were killed in the strike. Taliban
officials initially put the toll at 21, but six people injured in
the attack died in hospitals in Pakistan on Friday, doctors said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said the U.S. strikes on Afghanistan
and Sudan on Thursday were aimed at rooting out extremist violence
in general and at Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, whom the United
States accuses of directing worldwide attacks from hide-outs in
Afghanistan. Washington named him as the No. 1 suspect in the Aug.
7 bomb attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Furqan said he had arrived just a week ago at the camp near
Khost, 90 miles (145 kilometers) southeast of the Afghan capital of
Kabul and just across the border from Pakistan.
	   He said he was engaged in ``religious studies'' there, reluctant
to admit to training in a militant camp.
	   Badshah Gul, the base commander, said that when he heard
explosions, he thought the men were engaged in their usual Friday
night drill of hurling explosives at targets.
	   ``But the explosions were so big that they lit the sky for a
while, and I began to realize what actually happened,'' Gul told
the national Pakistani newspaper The News.
	   The newspaper quoted several witnesses as saying that they heard
fighter planes before the missiles.
	   U.S. officials said the missiles were fired from ships in the
Arabian Sea. Pakistani officials have said that no U.S. planes
crossed their airspace for the attack.
	   There have been public protests in Pakistan since the attack,
which has been condemned by Islamabad. On Saturday, about 300 women
descended on a park in the northeastern city of Lahore, carrying
placards denouncing the United States.
	   The Pakistani government fired its intelligence chief, Manzoor
Ahmed, on Saturday for his handling of information about the U.S.
attacks.
	   The Pakistanis said Friday that one U.S. missile landed in
Pakistan, killing at least five people. Hours later, the ministry
said that information was inaccurate, and that all missile hits and
casualties were inside Afghanistan.

Bereaved parents of Spanish victims of bombings at London service
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Northern Ireland &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The parents of two Spanish victims on Saturday led
mourners at a memorial service for people killed in the Northern
Ireland bombing a week ago.
	   The service was held at St. Martin's-in-the-Field, a historic
church on Traflagar Square, while in Omagh, where 28 people were
slain, and across Ireland, north and south, hundreds of thousands
of people fell silent in memory of the victims.
	   At the Service of Solidarity in London, the parents of
12-year-old Fernando Blasco Baselga and teacher Rocio Abad Ramos,
23, listened to poems, prayers and readings by Roman Catholics and
Protestants.
	   The pair were among a party of Spanish children and supervisors
on a day-trip to Omagh during an exchange visit to Ireland to
improve their English.
	   Twelve Spaniards were among the 330 were injured in the bombing,
the worst atrocity in three decades of sectarian conflict in
British-run Northern Ireland.
	   Mourners sang ``Make Me A Channel of Your Peace,'' and listened
to a reading from Luke 13 _ Jesus Weeps Over Jerusalem _ requested
by the Spanish families.
	   ``So many lives have been shattered, now is not the time to
interpret what it all means. It is time for us to live with the
pain,'' the Rev. David Monteith told the congregation.
	   ``We must remember the young people from Spain who came to
Ireland to enjoy the beauty and richness of the country,'' he
added.
	   People at the service welcomed the news Saturday that another
dissident group opposed to a peace settlement in Northern Ireland,
the Irish National Liberation Army, had declared a cease-fire.
	   The Omagh bombing was admitted was a group dubbed the Real IRA
because it, too, opposes the Irish Republican Army's acceptance of
the peace deal.
	   ``I'm extremely glad _ but I don't know how it will help the
parents,'' Spain's deputy ambassador to Britain, Agustin Jervas,
said.
	   Jervas said the parents of the slain boy and teacher were
overwhelmed by the warm welcome and support they had received.
	   ``We have spent the last three days in (Northern Ireland
capital) Belfast and we have been superhumanly well-treated, from
every day people, diplomats and agencies,'' he said.
	   He said the parents, Manuel Blasco and his wife Lucreva Baselga,
whose son was killed, and Jose Abad and his wife Ana Maria Ramos,
were coping remarkably well.
	   Carol Cavey, on holiday from Limerick in the Irish Republic,
said of the INLA cease-fire, ``This is great news and gives hope to
the families and all those who share in their grief.''
	   ``Perhaps some of our prayers have been answered already,'' she
added. ``I felt I had to come today, and I'm so glad I did.''
	   The organizer of the service, Dublin-born Eoin O'Neachtain,
said, ``I think the people of these islands have given the signal
they won't tolerate violence of any kind.''

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Tropical storm Bonnie strengthened to a hurricane overnight as
it continued its west-northwest movement away from the local
islands. Some lingering rain bands and stiff southerly winds on the
back edge of Bonnie continued to affect Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands. Scattered showers and thunderstorms moved north to
northeast on shore over the south coasts of the islands. The
heaviest rain was detected over the southeast and eastern interior
of Puerto Rico where Doppler estimated around 4 inches in places
across the municipalities of Guayama, Arroyo, Patillas, Caguas and
Salinas. This prompted an urban and small stream flood advisory and
a flash flood watch for the rivers across the eastern interior to
southeast.
	   Clouds and rain bands will continue to affect Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands today. Most of the showers and
thunderstorms will move across the islands this morning producing
intermittent showers and thunderstorms, some with heavy rain and
gusty winds. The winds will remain southerly up to 20 to 25 mph and
gusty through the day. Skies will brighten this afternoon as Bonnie
moves farther away from the local islands and drier air begins to
move in through Sunday.
	   Seas across the Atlantic coastal waters will remain rough as
northwest to west swells persist from Bonnie. Also fresh to strong
southerly winds will keep seas high in the Caribbean as well.
Therefore a small craft advisory will remain in effect across both
the Atlantic and the Caribbean waters for today.
	   The next tropical wave over the Atlantic located 700 miles east
of the Windward Islands will approach our local area by late Monday
into Tuesday.
 &UR; San Juan and north sections of Puerto Rico
	   Today ... Variably cloudy and breezy. A 40 percent chance of
showers and thunderstorms, mainly morning. High 85 to 95. Wind
south 15 to 20 mph and gusty.
	   Tonight ... Partly cloudy with a 20 percent chance of showers.
Low 75 to 80. Wind southeast around 10 mph.
	   Sunday ... Mostly sunny morning. Partly cloudy and hot
afternoon. A 20 percent chance of showers. Slight chance of a
thunderstorm. High 90 to 95. Wind southeast 10 to 15 mph.
 &UR; East sections of Puerto Rico
	   Today ... Variably cloudy and breezy. A 50 percent chance of
showers and thunderstorms ... Mainly morning. High from 70 to 75
mountains to 85 to 90 low elevations. Wind south 15 to 20 mph and
gusty.
	   Tonight ... Partly cloudy with a 20 percent chance of showers.
Low 75 to 80. Wind southeast 10 to 15 mph.
	   Sunday ... Partly cloudy morning with a 20 percent chance of
showers. Mostly sunny afternoon. High around 85. Wind southeast
around 15 mph.
 &UR; Ponce and south sections of Puerto Rico
	   Today ... Variably cloudy and breezy. A 50 percent chance of

Israeli shelling wounds Lebanese civilian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli forces shelled suspected guerrilla
hideouts and villages in southern Lebanon on Saturday, wounding a
Lebanese civilian, Lebanese security officials said.
	   A villager, Samir Hammoud, was lightly injured by shrapnel from
a shell that exploded near his house in Arab Salim, a village just
outside the Israeli-occupied zone, the officials said.
	   Hammoud, who was admitted to a hospital in the port of Sidon,
was the second civilian to be wounded by Israeli shells in two
days.
	   A seventy-year-old Lebanese man was wounded Friday when Israeli
artillery retaliated for a guerrilla ambush that killed two Israeli
soldiers.
	   Saturday's shelling appeared to be in retaliation for guerrilla
attacks hours earlier on Israeli positions in the occupation zone.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, said its fighters
attacked positions of the Israeli army and its allied South Lebanon
Army at Sojod and Bir Kallab in the zone.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties.
	   Hezbollah is the main guerrilla group fighting to dislodge
Israeli troops and their SLA allies from southern Lebanon. Israel
set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern territory from
cross-border attacks.

Yeltsin-Kohl hold phone conversation

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ German Chancellor Helmut Kohl supported the
Russian government's efforts to resolve a financial crisis during a
telephone conversation with President Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
leader's press service said Saturday.
	   Kohl expressed satisfaction with Russia's statement that it will
pay its foreign debts following a 90-day moratorium, the press
service said.
	   The debt moratorium and an effective devaluation of the ruble
were announced Monday in response to Russia's deepening financial
crisis.

Russian Muslims condemn U.S. air strikes

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Muslim leaders on Saturday condemned the
U.S. attacks on alleged terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   ``We believe that an unlawful act was committed, an act which
should not have been allowed to happen,'' Sheik Ravil Gainutdin,
mufti of Moscow and Central Europe, told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``As a result of the U.S. strikes on the so-called terrorist
bases, peaceful people suffered,'' he said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus said
Saturday he was too busy to attend the 53rd session of the United
Nations General Assembly and a meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement.
	   Lukashenko made his comments in an interview broadcast on
national television, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The Non-Aligned Movement is scheduled to meet in Durban, South
Africa, from Aug. 29-Sept. 3. The 53rd session of the U.N. General

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with higher waters on the
Yangtze, cracks in dikes downstream, soldiers trying to plug dike
near oil field; no pickup; CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Weeks of high waters cracked soggy dikes
protecting cities along the Yangtze River on Saturday, and soldiers
in the northeast fought to stop a breached levee hard by China's
largest oil field.
	   The state disaster relief agency warned that high waters surged
anew on the upper Yangtze, threatening another round of flooding
downstream. Governor Wang Maolin said dikes in central Hunan
province were already soggy and seriously damaged.
	   While the latest Yangtze flood crest receded Saturday around
Hunan's Dongting Lake, its retreat exposed fractures in protective
embankments. Some 830,000 soldiers and civilians worked to shore up
dikes and patch cracks, one of them 70 meters (230 feet) long,
around Yueyang city, state media reported.
	   The Yangtze River basin has taken the brunt of China's worst
flood season in 44 years. At least 2,000 people have died
nationwide and millions more have been left homeless, but the
government, often reluctant to divulge bad news, has not revised
those tallies in two weeks.
	   Since then floodwaters have smothered villages and threatened
some of the most important industrial centers of the northeast. The
Xinhua News Agency reported that 1.5 million people have been
flooded out in Heilongjiang, China's northeasternmost province.
	   With clinics and hospitals in many parts of the country under
water, health officials face a shortage of medicine and equipment
to check the outbreaks of disease.
	   Health Minister Zhang Wenkang warned on Friday that colds,
stomach illnesses, dysentery, hepatitis and diseases carried by
waterborne parasites are on the rise and the trend is likely to
worsen over the next three months, state media reported.
	   Soldiers rushed to close a breach that opened in the third and
last line of levees keeping the Nen River out of the Daqing oil
field and city, state radio reported.
	   Since overwhelming the dike Thursday night, the Nen has washed
away a highway and inundated nearly half the area's farmland, the
Liberation Daily reported. More threatening to the oil field was a
brimming reservoir on its eastern edge.
	   ``If the weather gods don't smile and we get another torrential
soaking, it might unleash flooding,'' the newspaper said.
	   Xinhua said that oil production was being maintained despite the
inundation of 1,443 oil wells and the complete shutdown of 282.
	   In Harbin, Heilongjiang's capital 150 kilometers (100 miles) to
the southeast, the Songhua River continued to swell to ever higher
record levels and began undermining the 26-kilometer (15-mile)
levee by the city's industrial heart.
	   Foundations under a riverside pumping station and apartment
complex gave way overnight and residents were evacuated, state
television reported. Video footage showed a crack running down the
two-story pumping station building, part of which sank 30
centimeters (a foot) into the saturated ground.
	   Trucks brought more soldiers into Harbin on Saturday morning to
reinforce the levee.
	   ``As long as the dikes are all right, we are all right and our
homes are safe,'' read one banner in the city.
	   Relief officials are worried that many flood victims in the
northeast, known in the West as Manchuria, may not be able to move
back into their homes before the onset of winter in mid-October,
the China Youth Daily said.

Dragons defeats BayStars 4-3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Leo Gomez and Kazuki Inoue hit a pair of doubles in
the third inning to score a winning run as Chunichi Dragons beat
the Central League's front-running Yokohama BayStars 4-3 at
Yokohama Saturday.
	   Gomez, formerly with Chicago Cubs, went 3 for 4 before a crowd
of 30,000 people. The BayStars are now three games ahead of the
Dragons.
	   At Hiroshima, Tomoaki Kanemoto smashed a pair of home runs,
including the day's second homer in the bottom of 11th inning,
giving the Hiroshima Toyo Carp a 6-4 win over the Yomiuri Giants.
	   Hideki Matsui blasted a home home run for the Giants. Matsui has
28 home runs and lead the league.
	   The Yakult Swallows edged the Hanshin Tigers 3-2 at Osaka Dome.
	   In the Pacific League, hurler Rob Mattson scattered three hits
in 8 1/3 innings, helping the Kintetsu Buffaloes to top the
front-running Nippon Ham Fighters 5-3 at Tokyo Dome. Mattson
previously played in the Mexican League.
	   In Chiba, Brian Williams gave up only five hits and went the
distance, helping the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks beat the China Lotte
Marines 5-1. The Hawks extended their winning streak to three.
	   At Seibu Stadium, the Seibu Lions beat the Orix BlueWave on
Fumiya Nichiguchi's five-hit, 2-0 shutout.

Serbia decries U.S. bombings, but draws parallel with Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia has decried the U.S. bombings
of suspected terrorist targets in Sudan and Afghanistan as an act
of aggression against two sovereign states.
	   But at the same time, a late Friday commentary on state-run
Serbian television appeared to derive from the air raids a
justification to crack down on separatist rebels in Kosovo whom
Serbia calls ``terrorists.''
	   Serbia, the dominant republic of rump Yugoslavia, has been
confronted with a possible military intervention by NATO for its
offensives against armed ethnic Albanians militants, including many
civilians, in its southern province.
	   Speaking of ``an aggression against two sovereign states,'' the
commentary asked rhetorically whether the U.S. move was ``in
accordance with international rules of conduct,'' making clear it
was not.
	   State-run television is the chief mouthpiece of the authorities
dominated by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The commentary spoke of ``a precedent ... to fight against
terrorism in territories of other states, in violation of their
integrity and sovereignty.''
	   However, the U.S. action ``can be seen as a broad authorization
for every country to respond to terrorism,'' said the commentary,
also published Sunday in pro-government papers in Belgrade.
	   ``Our country, too, is faced with terrorism and separatism,'' it
said, referring to the Kosovo rebels fighting for independence.
``Muslim fundamentalism, its aggressiveness and intolerance ...
generates many conflicts and terrorist acts in the world.''
	   A majority of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, who account for 90
percent of the two million population, are Muslims.

Peace singers protest at U.S. Embassy in London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Some 100 demonstrators chanted and sang peace
songs outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday morning in protest at
American strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   In another move, a small group of governing Labor Party
lawmakers and antinuclear campaigners denounced Prime Minister Tony
Blair's backing of the strikes against what the U.S. said were
terror bases and nerve gas plant.
	   ``State terrorism by the United States is no better than the
dreadful happenings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam,'' said Tam
Dalyell, a lawmaker who signed the protest.
	   ``It reinforces the negative image of the United States and
Britain in the Arab, African and Asian world and pushes moderate
people into support for extremism,'' Dalyell.
	   The U.S. strikes followed bombings of the American embassies in
the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, and the Tanzanian capital, Dar es
Salaam.

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels pushing within 30 kilometers (18
miles) of Congo's capital said on Saturday they downed two
warplanes allied with embattled President Laurent Kabila's loyalist
forces.
	   ``Just this morning, we have shot down two of their jet
fighters,'' said Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister
who defected to the rebels.
	   Karaha said the planes were shot down over rebel territory in
Congo's southwest. The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Amid mounting threats and acts of war, South Africa scrambled to
salvage a crumbling regional peace summit it was hosting in
Pretoria in a bid to forestall an escalation in Congo's rebellion
around sub-Saharan Africa.
	   The talks were being snubbed by two key players _ Zimbabwe's
President Robert Mugabe and Kabila, who deployed reinforcements to
defend the Congolese capital.
	   Mugabe is backing Kabila with troops and military equipment.
There were conflicting reports he had also sent fighter jets.
	   In Kinshasa, the government moved to expel two French diplomats
accused of inappropriate conduct.
	   State-controlled National Radio-Television said the embassy's
First Secretary Philippe Parise and his assistant Daniel Guilbert
had 24 hours to leave the country.
	   The move follows reports that Congolese armed forces fired on
French helicopters that overflew the capital Friday night as part
of an evacuation of French civilians in Kinshasa.
	   The government in recent days has accused France and the West of
complicity in the rebellion launched three weeks ago.
	   The rebels say they have marched to within 30 kilometers (18
miles) south of Kinshasa, but did not specify where they had shot
down the two jet fighters.
	   There was no immediate comment on the downed aircraft from
Kinshasa, but a former military intelligence officer with close
government ties said Kabila's army had recently acquired fighters
being flown by either Cuban or Angolan pilots.
	   ``We know that the government does have air support
capabilities,'' the officer said on condition of anonymity.
	   Speaking from the rebel stronghold of Goma, Karaha said the
planes were from Zimbabwe.
	   But a duty officer at the Zimbabwe Air Force operations center
said the downed planes were unlikely Zimbabwean: ``I don't think we
have any fighters up there,'' the officer said, refusing to give
his name.
	   Although the rebels earlier this week offered to negotiate a
cease-fire, Kahara said the attacks Saturday demonstrated the
rebels' resolve to continue fighting as long as outside forces were
involved.
	   ``It should be understood that the people of Congo are ready to
resist any foreign aggression,'' he said of the reported arrival of
more than 600 troop reinforcements from Zimbabwe and a contingent
from Angola in support of Kabila.
	   Angola has declined to comment, but eyewitnesses in Angola's
enclave of Cabinda bordering southwestern Congo said Angolan troops
and military equipment were moving toward the border. Cabinda
governor Amaru Tati reportedly said that defensive border measures
were being taken, but did not elaborate.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi denied that Angolan troops
had arrived, and said when they do it will be publicly announced.
	   ``When Angola sends its troops that will be a big day, as was
the case with Zimbabwe,'' Mumengi said on state-controlled
television.
	   The rebels themselves are said to have the backing of
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The peace negotiations in South Africa appeared doomed as
Zimbabwe said its president was boycotting the talks because it did
not include other countries favoring military support to Kabila.
	   Congo's president asked for a delay in the talks, but the
government instead sent Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo and
Transport Minister Henri Mova Sakani on his behalf.
	   Although the leaders of Rwanda and Uganda were believed
attending, Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni threatened to join
the rebel side if other foreign forces do not withdraw.
	   ``Uganda may be forced after due consultations, to take its own
independent action in the protection of its own security,''
Museveni said in the statement released in his capital.
	   In Kinshasa, hundreds of angry protesters marched down the
city's main June 30th Boulevard. Denouncing Rwanda and the West,
the demonstrators vowed to back Kabila.
	   The rebels accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, tribalism and
mismanagement of his vast African nation.
	   Karaha accused Kabila of ordering the execution of 20,000 ethnic
Tutsis in Moba in southeastern Congo, a move which he said prompted
the rebels to advance to the Lake Tanganyika port of Kalemie.

Bonnie becomes hurricane; Bahamians in southeast batten down

GMT) Bonnie was centered near 22.7 north latitude, 70.6 west

	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Bonnie strengthened into the Atlantic
season's first hurricane Saturday and headed toward sparsely
populated Bahamian islands, on a route that could threaten the
southeastern United States.
	   Another storm was gaining strength in the Pacific Ocean.
	   ``It's definitely going to happen. The southeastern portion (of
the Bahamas) is going to be hit today,'' meteorologist Dave Chorney
said from the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   On Crooked Island, fuel distributor Daisy Scavella said the sun
was shining as residents battened down windows.
	   ``I guess we're going to have a good blow,'' she said. People on
the low-lying islands were most concerned about flooding.
	   Bahamian radio warned the islands' fishing fleet and yachters to
make for safe port. The islands' meteorological department said
Bonnie would hit landfall in the southeast later Saturday and pass
by Long Island, Eleuthera and the Abacos over the next 48 to 72
hours.
	   ``People along the southeastern U.S. should pay attention to its
progress,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of National Hurricane
Center.
	   He said winds could reach 100 mph (160 kph) by Monday. Chorney
said the worst thunderstorms were on the northern side of Bonnie,
in the open Atlantic.
	   Bonnie was about 95 miles (150 kilometers) north-northwest of
Turk Island at 11 a.m. (15:00 GMT) with sustained winds of 85 mph
(140 kph) and higher gusts. It was moving west-northwest near 15
mph (24 kph) with a motion expected to continue through most of
Sunday.
	   The National Hurricane Center said Bonnie could eventually
become a Category 3 storm with winds of more than 111 mph (178 kph)
capable of causing extensive damage.
	   The Bahamian government Saturday posted a hurricane watch for
the northwest islands and hurricane warnings covered the British
Turks and Caicos islands and the southeastern and central Bahamas.
	   ``Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to
completion,'' the hurricane center urged.
	   North Florida is more likely than any other region to be hit if
the storm reaches the mainland. Still, the storm could veer out to
sea and miss the U.S. coast entirely, Jarrell said.
	   Meanwhile, another weather system that threatened parts of Texas
lost power Saturday.
	   All warnings were discontinued when Tropical Storm Charley
weakened to a depression, though the hurricane center warned small
vessels to remain in port along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico
until winds and waves that reached 10 feet (3 meters) subside.
	   The threat of heavy rains and a storm surge hustled the
evacuation of thousands of people from oil rigs in the Gulf of
Mexico.
	   Shrimp boats hustled back to shore Friday night, crews sighting
waves up to 15 feet (4.5 meters).
	   As it moved into Texas, Matagorda Island to the south was hit
the hardest with 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain and 70 mph (110
kmh) wind gusts around 2:30 a.m. (0730 GMT). The depression was
centered near latitude 28.4 north, longitude 97.5 west at 11 a.m.
(15:00 GMT).
	   Also Friday, a storm in the Pacific Ocean reached hurricane
strength but remained far off the Mexican coast. Hurricane Howard
intensified Saturday, packing winds of 110 mph (176 kph) with
higher gusts. The hurricane center said it was expected to get even
stronger but anticipated that it would dissipate out in the Pacific
later Sunday.
	   Authorities closed the Acapulco port and warned ships to be
cautious of high waves along the southwestern Mexican coast.
	   Howard was centered about 400 miles (645 kilometers) southwest
of Acapulco at 11 a.m. (15:00 GMT), at latitude 13.8 north,
longitude 106.2 west moving slowly northwest at about 12 mph (19
kph).
	   The Atlantic Basin typically has nine tropical storms each year
with six of them becoming hurricanes, two of them intense. In 1997,
there were seven named storms, three hurricanes and one intense
hurricane.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia has decried the U.S. bombings
of suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan as an act of
aggression against two sovereign states.
	   But at the same time, a commentary late Friday on state-run
Serbian television appeared to derive from the air raids a
justification to crack down on separatist rebels in Kosovo whom
Serbia calls ``terrorists.''
	   Serbia, the dominant republic of rump Yugoslavia, has been
confronted with the possibility of military intervention by NATO
for its offensives against armed ethnic Albanians militants,
including many civilians, in its southern province.
	   Speaking of ``an aggression against two sovereign states,'' the
commentary asked rhetorically whether the U.S. move was ``in
accordance with international rules of conduct,'' making it clear
that it considered that it was not.
	   State-run television is the chief mouthpiece of the authorities,
dominated by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The commentary spoke of ``a precedent ... to fight against
terrorism in territories of other states, in violation of their
integrity and sovereignty.''
	   However, the U.S. action ``can be seen as a broad authorization
for every country to respond to terrorism,'' said the commentary,
also published Saturday in pro-government papers in Belgrade.
	   ``Our country, too, is faced with terrorism and separatism,'' it
said. ``Muslim fundamentalism, its aggressiveness and intolerance
... generates many conflicts and terrorist acts in the world.''
	   A majority of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, who account for 90
percent of the 2 million population, are Muslims.

Police arrests ten Arabs in an anti-terrorist operation

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Police and secret service agents arrested
Friday night ten foreigners, including some Arab citizens, after
raiding several houses believed to have served as bases for
terrorist suspects, informed sources reported Saturday.
	   ``All of them were sleeping in one room when police broke in and
searched the apartment where they found bulletproof vests, fake
passports, maps, radio transmitters, electronic devices'' and other
material, said a police source who took part in the operation,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The same source said the ten were Arab citizens, but another
source told The Associated Press later that those arrested also
included citizens from non-Arab countries.
	   The state news agency ATA also reported that ten foreign
citizens had been detained, but it did not give their nationalities
or other details.

Labour party shows continuing strength in by-election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ The ruling St. Lucia Labour Party won
a special election held Friday, showing it remains strong more than
a year after it swept to power in an unprecedented landslide.
	   In a by-election to replace Kenneth John, a member of Parliament
who died in July while trying to save a swimmer, the Labour party
won by a better than 2-1 margin, in results announced Saturday.
	   Labour candidate Michael Gaspard retained the seat for the party
with 2,858 votes, compared to 1,402 votes for Allan Bosquet Jr. of
the United Workers Party.
	   Prime Minister Kenny Anthony hailed the results as evidence that
his party retains public confidence. In the young nation's largest
election landslide, Labour defeated the Workers party in the May,
1997 general election. The Workers party had ruled for all but
three years since St. Lucia gained independence in 1979.
	   With the win in Friday's special election, Labour continues to
hold 16 of the 17 seats in the assembly.

German, Polish soldiers join in historic swearing-in

<TEXT>
	   GUBIN, Poland (AP) _ German and Polish recruits held joint
swearing-in ceremonies for the first time Saturday, a new sign that
the two nations are overcoming enmity and divisions sowed by World
War II.
	   Both defense ministers walked across a pontoon bridge built by
the troops to witness the oath-taking on opposite sides of the Oder
River, which divides Poland and Germany.
	   ``All this symbolizes a new age in the relationship between our
two peoples,'' German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said in a
speech.
	   ``Today's ceremony will contribute to the tightening of ties
between the two armies that will soon be allies,'' said his Polish
counterpart, Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
	   About 5,000 people filled the market square of Gubin as 103
young Poles took the oath. The town was bedecked in Polish and
German flags.
	   Then, 263 German recruits were sworn in at Guben just across the
river in Germany. Recruits from each country also took part in the
other side's ceremony.
	   The symbolism was especially strong because Nazi Germany's
brutal six-year occupation still resonates with many Poles.
	   Now, Germany is Poland's key partner in building bridges to the
West after decades of Cold War isolation.
	   Saturday's ceremony was ``testimony of our return to the family
of countries that we always believed we belong to,'' Onyszkiewicz
said.
	   Since signing a landmark friendship treaty in 1991, both
countries have boosted trade and defense ties and joined together
in fighting last summer's Oder floods.
	   Championed by Germany, Poland was among the first former Warsaw
Pact countries invited to join NATO and is on the short list for
early European Union entry as well.
	   Ruehe said Poland has made impressive progress toward
integrating its army into NATO. More than 1,000 Polish officers
have already been trained, mainly in Germany and the United States,
he said.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian police and secret service agents
arrested 10 foreigners after raiding several houses believed to
have served as bases for terrorist suspects, sources said Saturday.
	   ``All of them were sleeping in one room when police broke in and
searched the apartment where they found bulletproof vests, fake
passports, maps, radio transmitters, electronic devices'' and other
material, said a police source who took part in Friday night's
operation, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The same source said the 10 were Arab citizens, but another
source told The Associated Press later that those arrested also
included citizens of non-Arab countries.

Hall of Fame trainer dies at 84
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Woody Stephens, one of U.S. thoroughbred racing's
all-time great trainers, died Saturday after a long illness. He
would have been 85 on Sept. 1.
	   Stephens, who went into racing's U.S. thoroughbred Hall of Fame
in 1976, saddled a record five straight Belmont Stakes winners
after his induction.
	   He trained 11 Eclipse Award-winning horses, including 1984
Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes winner Swale, 1983 juvenile
champion Devil's Bag and 1982 U.S. Horse of the Year Conquistador
Cielo.
	   He was voted the Eclipse Award as the United States' No. 1
trainer in 1983.
	   His decades of success made Stephens a wealthy man. His breeding
interests in Devil's Bag and Conquistador Cielo alone were worth
about dlrs 1 million each, and the trainer traditionally gets a
10-percent cut of a horse's winnings. Stephens, whose stable won
dlrs 5.2 million in 1984 and more than dlrs 4 million in 1987 and
'88, drove a silver Mercedes two-seater and had homes in New York
and Florida.
	   After five years as an assistant, he struck out on his own in
1940. He didn't saddle his first winner, Bronze Bugle, for three
more years. His first stakes triumph was with Saguaro in the 1945
Excelsior Handicap.
	   Stephens won his first Triple Crown race, the Preakness Stakes,
with Blue Man in 1952. The next, the Kentucky Derby, took 22 more
years.
	   He won the 1974 Derby with Cannonade, then took American
racing's most coveted prize again 10 years later with the ill-fated
Swale. That colt, a son of 1977 Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew,
went on the become the third of Stephens' four Belmont winners,
then died suddenly eight days later.
	   In the 1980s, Stephens seemed to own the third leg of the
American Triple Crown. He saddled nine entries for the Belmont in
10 years. Five went on to win: Conquistador Cielo in 1982; Caveat
in 1983; Swale; Creme Fraiche, the first gelding to win the 1
1-2-mile (2.4-kilometer) classic, in 1985, and Danzig Connection in
1986.

Discovery of rare plant at Snowbasin complicates Olympics
</HEADLINE>
preparation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Preparations for the Olympics at Snowbasin
resort in northern Utah may be complicated by the discovery of a
rare type of mustard plant on the craggy terrain where the men's
downhill race course will begin.
	   Through genetic testing, scientists determined that the
lime-green plants with yellow flowers are a unique species, likely
to be called Burke mustard (Draba burkei). Previously the plants
were thought to be part of the Maguire mustard (Draba maguirei)
species.
	   The discovery isn't expected to significantly disrupt
Snowbasin's preparations for the 2002 Winter Games. But it could
cause some delays in a number of construction projects, including
grading work on the upper slope of the men's downhill course,
construction of the start house where racers push off, excavation
of a water line for snowmaking and installation of a ridgetop
communications tower.
	   ``It does change things,'' Ruth Monahan, the Forest Service's
Ogden District ranger, said Thursday. ``Our hope is that through
the mitigation measures we develop, we can complete the projects.''
	   The Maguire mustard is found only in northern Utah, in limited
numbers, and is listed as a sensitive species by the Forest
Service. Because Snowbasin's plants are not related to the Maguire
mustards, both species' numbers are smaller than previously
estimated.
	   There are believed to be 5,000 to 6,000 of the plants at
Snowbasin, making it the largest population of the newly described
species.
	   The Forest Service has known for some time that small
populations of mustard plants existed in northern Utah and that
botanists were uncertain whether they represented one species or
two.
	   The uncertainty was eliminated when scientists affiliated with
the Utah Museum of Natural History's Garrett Herbarium confirmed
through chromosome, enzyme and DNA studies that two species exist.
	   ``The (Burke mustard) seems to be a pretty viable species,''
herbarium curator Michael Windham said. ``But the Forest Service
has estimated there are only 10,000 (plants) total. As your
population drops and becomes more fragmented, it really represents
a threat to the species. We don't want to lose many plants or we
may exceed minimum viability levels.''
	   The Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have
agreed that the loss of up to 500 plants as a result of the
Olympics projects would be acceptable.
	   The Forest Service plans to remove selective plants and collect
seeds from sites where the plants will be disturbed.

Labour party shows continuing strength in by-election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ The ruling St. Lucia Labour Party won
a special election, showing it remains strong more than a year
after it swept to power in an unprecedented landslide.
	   In Friday's by-election to replace Kenneth John, a member of
Parliament who died in July while trying to save a swimmer, the
Labour party won by a better than a 2-1 margin in results announced
Saturday.
	   Labour candidate Michael Gaspard retained the seat for the party
with 2,858 votes, compared to 1,402 votes for Allan Bosquet Jr. of
the United Workers Party.
	   Prime Minister Kenny Anthony hailed the results as evidence that
his party retains public confidence.
	   In the young Caribbean nation's largest election landslide,
Labour defeated the Workers party in the May 1997 general election.
	   The Workers party had ruled for all but three years since St.
Lucia gained independence in 1979.
	   With the win in Friday's special election, Labour continues to
hold 16 of the 17 seats in the assembly.

Italians sweep men's marathon, Arron wins relay for France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with women's 4x100 relay, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Christine Arron powered home in the
anchor leg to lead France to victory in the women's 4x100-meter
relay and clinch her second gold medal of the European Championship
on Saturday.
	   The 100-meter champion with orange-dyed hair pulled her team
from third to first with an astonishing last leg. The French won in
42.59 seconds.
	   With stunning acceleration in the last 50 meters, Arron flew
past Russia's anchor Irina Privalova, who stared in disbelief as
Arron sprinted past her.
	   Privalova, 100-meter silver medalist and 200 champion, lost her
second place as well when Andrea Philipp of Germany nipped her on
the line. Germany finished in 42.68, while Russia clocked 42.73 for
the bronze.
	   In the morning, Stefano Baldini overcame rainy and windy
conditions to lead an Italian medal sweep in the men's marathon.
	   ``For the last month my coach and I have believed that this gold
would be mine,'' Baldini said. ``He said that he could see victory
in my eyes before the start and my heart also told me this medal
would be mine.''
	   Baldini, who was running stride for stride with fellow Italian
Danilo Goffi at the 40-kilometer mark, pulled away before entering
the Nep stadium and won in 2 hours 12 minutes 01 second.
	   Goffi was second in 2:12.11, and another Italian, Vincenzo
Modica, took the bronze in 2:12.53. Three Spanish runners took the
next three places.
	   ``After 37 kilometers I knew that I would beat my compatriots to
the finish,'' Baldini said.
	   After a week of mostly sunshine and warm weather in the
Hungarian capital, the conditions cooled considerably after a night
of storms.
	   Baldini and Goffi ran easily, however, and both were fresh
enough to celebrate by hugging each other after the
42.195-kilometer race.
	   Winner of the world half-marathon title in 1996, Baldini, 27,
was second in the 1997 London Marathon and third in the New York
race that same year.
	   Baldini is the eighth of 10 brothers, and his older brother
Marco is also a marathon runner.
	   In the men's 110-meter hurdles semifinal, world record-holder
Colin Jackson of Britain set a championship record of 13.02
seconds, the third fastest in the world this year. His old mark was
13.04, from 1994.
	   While the Italians ruled the longest distance, in Europe at
least, no one can measure up to British men sprinters.
	   Since the retirement of Linford Christie, no Briton _ and no
European for that matter _ has come close to challenging the North
American, African and Caribbean runners.
	   In Europe, Britons continue to rule.
	   Iwan Thomas completed a British sweep of the men's sprints when
he won the 400 meters on Friday in 44.52 seconds, a championship
record.
	   Minutes earlier, Doug Walker led a 1-2-3 British triumph in the
200. Britain also had had a gold-silver sweep in the 100 on
Wednesday.
	   Thomas led coming out of the turn and held on, as Robert
Mackowiak of Poland passed Mark Richardson to prevent another 1-2
British finish. Mackowiak clocked 45.04 and Richardson 45.14.
	   Walker, No. 1 in Europe this season, clocked 20.53 seconds to
win ahead of Doug Turner, second in 20.64. Julius Golding snatched
the bronze in 20.72.
	   Led by Christie, the British team had also swept the sprints in
1990 and took two four years ago, losing only the 200.

Hungary postpones bidding for fighter aircraft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary is postponing the announcement
of a tender for the purchase of new military aircraft, Hungarian
Premier Viktor Orban said Saturday.
	   ``The performance of the Hungarian economy does not, at this
time, allow for the purchase of new fighter aircraft,'' Orban said
at a military air show in Kecskemet, 80 kilometers (50 miles)
southeast of Budapest.
	   Hungary hopes to be formally admitted to NATO next year, and it
was hoping to be able to acquire at least a few state-of-the-art
jet fighters.
	   It came as something of a surprise when Gen. Ferenc Vegh, the
Hungarian Chief of Staff, told television news Friday evening that
``Hungary is postponing announcement of the tender until 2003.''
	   Vegh said that after 2003 dlrs one billion will be earmarked for
the purchase of 30 jet fighters.
	   Hungary's defense establishment was looking at the American
McDonnell-Douglas-made F-18s, Lockheed Martin's F-16s, and Sweden's
Saab Grippen.
	   France's Mirage and Russia's MiG 29s may also be competing.
	   The technical condition of the Hungarian Air Force is rated bad,
and Hungarian pilots spend significantly fewer hours flying than
their NATO counterparts.
	   While it is common for a NATO pilot to fly an annual 150-200
hours, it is only 30 hours for military pilots in Hungary.
	   The country's air space theoretically is defended by 28 MiG 29s,
many of which are immobile due to a lack of spare parts.

Charlton wins 5-0 to go top as giants tie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Promoted Charlton charged to the top of the
Premier League after a 5-0 crushing of Southampton Saturday with
Clive Mendonca scoring three times in the last 25 minutes.
	   Alan Curbishley's team, returning for the first time since 1990
after gaining a Premier League place through last season's division
one playoffs, overwhelmed the Saints at The Valley, a refurbished
stadium which last saw top flight soccer in 1957.
	   John Robinson fired the Addicks ahead after only three minutes,
new signing Neil Redfearn added a second before Mendonca took over
in the second half.
	   The much-traveled 29-year-old striker was brought down by Saints
goalkeeper Paul Jones who was ordered off for the foul. Mendonca
struck home the 65th minute penalty, added the fourth nine minutes
from the end and then scored the fifth in the final minute to send
Southampton sliding down to last of the 20 clubs.
	   Charlton stormed to the top on a day when the big teams were
held in tied games. Defending titlist Arsenal went to Anfield and
drew 0-0, Manchester United managed only a goal-less tie at West
Ham despite the debut of 12.6 million pound (dlrs 20 million)
Dwight Yorke, while Chelsea and Newcastle tied 1-1.
	   Liverpool striker Michael Owen signed a new contract Saturday to
keep him at Anfield for five years but had few chances against a
well-organized Arsenal defense missing its captain and central
strongman, Tony Adams, who was injured.
	   Ray Parlour missed an easy close-range chance for the Gunners
while Liverpool's United States international 'keeper Brad Friedel
made two brilliant saves to thwart Nicolas Anelka.
	   Yorke had few openings against the Hammers at Upton Park in
partnership with Andy Cole as the Reds looked far short of the form
that brought four league titles in five seasons.
	   At Stamford Bridge, Nigerian international Celestine Babayaro
fired Chelsea ahead but Swedish striker Andreas Andersson leveled
for Newcastle so that both teams are still looking for their first
win the campaign.
	   Wimbledon, surprise leader after the opening day, was held 0-0
by Derby at Pride Park and slipped to third while Leicester, which
gained a 2-2 tie at Manchester United last weekend, moved into
second place after downing Everton 2-0 at Filbert Street with goals
by veteran striker Tony Cottee and Muzzy Izzet.
	   Tottenham tumbled 3-0 at home to Sheffield Wednesday and the
pressure is already on Swiss coach Christian Gross after two losses
and six goals conceded. Peter Atherton, Paolo Di Canio and Andy
Hinchcliffe netted Wednesday's goals at White Hart Lane where the
home fans were leaving in droves long before the end.
	   Steve Stone netted Nottingham Forest's winner in a 1-0 victory
over neighbor Coventry at the City Ground.
	   Saturday's results mean that no team will have maximum points
even after only two games.
	   The two teams in action Sunday, Aston Villa and Middlesbrough,
and Monday's rivals Leeds and Blackburn, were all involved in
goal-less ties last weekend.
	   After two games, Arsenal places fourth, Liverpool fifth, while
Manchester United is 10th and Chelsea is third from last after a
loss and a tie.
	   Norwich powered to the top of division two after a 4-2 beating
of Queens Park Rangers. Birmingham, promoted Watford and Birmingham
also have 100 percent records from three games.
	   Birmingham won 2-0 at Sheffield United, Graham Taylor's Watford
triumphed 4-1 at Bristol City and Wolves scored a 1-0 victory over
Swindon.
	   In Scotland, Hearts replaced Aberdeen atop the Premier League by
beating the north-east team 2-0 at Tynecastle. Champion Celtic hit
back from a goal down to beat Dundee United 2-1 and Rangers gained
a 3-1 win at Kilmarnock.

Dean once lost in rain forest resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HURON, Ohio (AP) _ A college dean who spent 12 days last summer
lost in a rain forest will resign at the end of the school year.
	   Darby Williams has been dean of Bowling Green's Firelands campus
for five years. He may remain at Bowling Green as an administrator
or a professor, said Lesley Ruszkowski, a spokeswoman at Firelands.
	   She said he has been considering a career change for several
months.
	   She said Williams, 56, decided to announce his resignation now
to give the college a full year to search for a replacement.
	   Williams was reported missing in July 1997 in the 28,000-acre
Caribbean National Forest. He had gone there to take video
recordings for a book he planned on Puerto Rico.
	   When a heavy rain started, he got lost. He said he ate snails
and ferns and drank mountain water for 12 days while searching for
a way out.
	   More than 60 police officials, civil defense officials and
forest rangers, assisted by police dogs, searched the area for
Williams. He eventually found the trail he was on when he entered
the forest and was found by tourists.

Moscow mayor: No more money this year for Christ the Savior church
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said Saturday there was
no more money this year to finish construction of the landmark
Christ the Savior Cathedral because of Russia's financial crisis.
	   The grandiose cathedral, which dominates central Moscow's
skyline, has been rebuilt over the past three years to replicate
one destroyed by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1931.
	   The original cathedral, designed to celebrate Russia's victory
over Napoleon in 1812, was consecrated in 1883 after four decades
of construction.
	   ``The situation is very difficult, but not disastrous,'' Luzhkov
said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``There are
possibilities for continuing the construction program.''

Italians sweep men's marathon, Arron wins relay for France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's pole vault, men's relay &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Christine Arron powered home in the
anchor leg to lead France to victory in the women's 4x100-meter
relay and clinch her second gold medal of the European Championship
on Saturday.
	   The 100-meter champion with orange-dyed hair pulled her team
from third to first with an astonishing last leg. The French won in
42.59 seconds.
	   Darren Campbell and Doug Walker also picked up their second
golds when they ran in the winning British team in the men's 4x100
relay. Campbell was the 100-meter champion, Walker the 200 gold
medalist.
	   Julian Golding, bronze medalist in the 200, ran the anchor leg
for Britain, which clocked 38.52 for the gold. France took the
silver in 38.87, while Poland was third in 38.98.
	   With stunning acceleration in the last 50 meters, Arron flew
past Russia's anchor Irina Privalova, who stared in disbelief as
Arron sprinted past her.
	   Privalova, 100-meter silver medalist and 200 champion, lost her
second place as well when Andrea Philipp of Germany nipped her on
the line. Germany finished in 42.68, while Russia clocked 42.73 for
the bronze.
	   Maksim Tarasov of Russia cleared 5.81 meters to win the men's
pole vault. Tim Lobinger of Germany was second with the same height
but with more attempts overall, while Jean Galfione of France, the
Olympic champion, had to settle for bronze at 5.76.
	   In the morning, Stefano Baldini overcame rainy and windy
conditions to lead an Italian medal sweep in the men's marathon.
	   ``For the last month my coach and I have believed that this gold
would be mine,'' Baldini said. ``He said that he could see victory
in my eyes before the start and my heart also told me this medal
would be mine.''
	   Baldini, who was running stride for stride with fellow Italian
Danilo Goffi at the 40-kilometer mark, pulled away before entering
the Nep stadium and won in 2 hours 12 minutes 01 second.
	   Goffi was second in 2:12.11, and another Italian, Vincenzo
Modica, took the bronze in 2:12.53. Three Spanish runners took the
next three places.
	   ``After 37 kilometers I knew that I would beat my compatriots to
the finish,'' Baldini said.
	   After a week of mostly sunshine and warm weather in the
Hungarian capital, the conditions cooled considerably after a night
of storms.
	   Baldini and Goffi ran easily, however, and both were fresh
enough to celebrate by hugging each other after the
42.195-kilometer race.
	   Winner of the world half-marathon title in 1996, Baldini, 27,
was second in the 1997 London Marathon and third in the New York
race that same year.
	   Baldini is the eighth of 10 brothers, and his older brother
Marco is also a marathon runner.
	   In the men's 110-meter hurdles semifinal, world record-holder
Colin Jackson of Britain set a championship record of 13.02
seconds, the third fastest in the world this year. His old mark was
13.04, from 1994.
	   Wilson Kipketer, world champion and record-holder, did just
enough to qualify for the final in the men's 800 by finishing third
in his semifinal heat.
	   While the Italians ruled the longest distance, in Europe at
least, no one can measure up to British men sprinters.
	   Since the retirement of Linford Christie, no Briton _ and no
European for that matter _ has come close to challenging the North
American, African and Caribbean runners.
	   In Europe, Britons continue to rule.
	   Iwan Thomas completed a British sweep of the men's sprints when
he won the 400 meters on Friday in 44.52 seconds, a championship
record.
	   Minutes earlier, Walker led a 1-2-3 British triumph in the 200.
Britain also had had a gold-silver sweep in the 100 on Wednesday.
	   Thomas led coming out of the turn and held on, as Robert
Mackowiak of Poland passed Mark Richardson to prevent another 1-2
British finish. Mackowiak clocked 45.04 and Richardson 45.14.
	   Walker, No. 1 in Europe this season, clocked 20.53 seconds to
win ahead of Doug Turner, second in 20.64. Golding snatched the
bronze in 20.72.
	   Led by Christie, the British team had also swept the sprints in
1990 and took two four years ago, losing only the 200.

	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ The defense and foreign ministers
from the former Soviet republics in Central Asia held talks behind
closed doors on Saturday about the fighting in Afghanistan.
	   No details were released about the meeting of ministers from
Uzbekistan, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
	   The countries are concerned that if the Taliban Islamic army
gains full control of Afghanistan there could be a influx of
refugees and weapons across their borders.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia officially condemned
Saturday U.S. bombings of suspected terrorist targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan, suggesting it was inadmissible to support at the same
time ``terrorists'' in Kosovo.
	   Yugoslav media and officials have always referred to the Kosovo
Liberation Army fighting for independence of the Serbian province
as ``terrorists.''
	   Yugoslavia ``condemns all forms of terrorism ... but
internatioal terrorism can be successfully uprooted only by
respecting basic principles of international law,'' said the
statement carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
	   It denounced unilateral actions ``to protect terrorists and
include them in talks in one case,'' a reference to Kosovo, while
``using most destructive weapons against terrorist targets in
foreign, sovereign countries.''
	   The statement cited ``a conflict of principles in international
relations, (which) are counterproductive and unacceptable.''
	   ``Attempts to divide terrorists into `good' and `bad' ones are
not based on principles, but on ...unilateral asessments of one's
own interests,'' the statement said, referring to the U.S. action.
	   A commentary late Friday on state-run Serbian television, which
was also published Saturday, appeared to derive from the U.S. air
raids a justification to crack down on separatist rebels in Kosovo.
	   Serbia, the dominant republic of rump Yugoslavia, has been
confronted with a possible military intervention by NATO for its
offensives against armed ethnic Albanians militants, including many
civilians, in its southern province.
	   Speaking of ``an aggression against two sovereign states,'' the
commentary asked rhetorically whether the U.S. move was ``in
accordance with international rules of conduct,'' making clear it
was not.
	   However, it said, the U.S. action ``can be seen as a broad
authorization for every country to respond to terrorism,'' said the
commentary, also published Saturday in pro-government papers in
Belgrade.
	   ``Our country, too, is faced with terrorism and separatism,'' it
said, referring to the Kosovo rebels fighting for independence.

	   1-0 John Robinson fired the Addicks ahead in the 3rd minute,
turning home a cross vie the inside of the post. Neil Redfearn,
signed from Barnsley during the summer, hit the second in the first
minute of second half before Mendonca hit three goals in the 65th,
81st and 90th. 16,488.
 &UR; Chelsea 1, Newcastle 1 (1-1) &QC; 
	   Celestine Babayaro scored his first goal for the club in the
23rd minute after Gustavo Poyet's shot had been blocked on the line
by Stuart Pearce. Andreas Andersson hit the equalizer two minutes
before half time from a tight angle from Alan Shearer's headed
pass. 34,795.
 &UR; Derby 0, Wimbledon 0 &QC; 
	   Referee Jeff Winter infuriated the hosts by disallowing a late
Paulo Wanchope ``goal.'' Two minutes into injury time, the lanky
Costa Rican back-headed Lee Carsley's deep cross past the Dons
Scottish international goalkeeper, Neil Sullivan, and ran to
celebrate only for Winter to rule out the goal presumably for a
foul. 25,747.
 &UR; Leicester 2, Everton 0 (2-0) &QC; 
	   The Foxes went ahead after 11 minutes when Theo Zagorakis'
through ball found Tony Cottee in space on the edge of the area and
he placed the ball expertly beyond 'keeper Thomas Myhre. Muzzy
Izzet added the second in the 38th by turning in Steve Guppy's
cross. 21,037.
 &UR; Liverpool 0, Arsenal 0 &QC; 
	   Brad Friedel made a great blocking save to keep out shot from
Nicolas Anelka and Ray Parlour failed to turn in the rebound from
in front of goal for an amazing miss. Friedel also saved from
Anelka early in second half and Marc Overmars looked certain to
score a late winner for Arsenal when he rounded Friedel but Jamie
Carragher got back to rescue his team with a tackle. 44,429.
 &UR; Nottingham Forest 1, Coventry 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Steve Stone, who missed most of last season through injury, shot
home from edge of area in 51st minute for the only goal of the
game. 22,546,
 &UR; Tottenham 0, Sheffield Wednesday 3 (0-2) &QC; 
	   Peter Atherton's header from Wim Jonk's free kick put Wednesday
ahead in the 26th minute. Ten minutes before half time, Paolo Di
Canio made it 2-0 at second attempt after Ian Walker's initial
save. Andy Hinchcliffe scored the third in the 78th minute from a
20-meter (yard) free kick. 32,129.
 &UR; West Ham 0, Manchester United 0 &QC; 
	   United claimed a penalty after only three minutes when Ryan
Giggs was held back by Neil Ruddock but it was waved away. The Reds
created few chances after that and neither did the Hammers, who
badly missed injured Ian Wright. 26,039.

<TEXT>
	   VAIL, Colorado (AP) _ Laura DeNuccio wrote on her photo:
``Thanks for saving my senior season.''
	   ``Thanks for keeping my dream alive,'' wrote Jeff Kramer of
Weatherford, Texas.
	   Never heard of them? She was a goaltender for her high school
hockey team in North Oaks, Minnesota. Kramer played American
football for Texas Tech.
	   Their photos are on the walls, desks and shelves of the
Steadman-Hawkins Clinic, a world-renowned sports medicine facility
high in the Rocky Mountains.
	   Dr. Richard Steadman displays pictures of DeNuccio, Kramer and
other regular folks among the many tributes from Australian golfing
great Greg Norman, former World Cup downhill champion Picabo Street
of the United States, American football heroes John Elway and Joe
Montana and dozens of other professional athletes and celebrities
whom his clinic has treated.
	   ``The vast majority of people we see are ordinary folks,''
Steadman said.
	   The clinic treated 1,666 people last year for everything from
injured feet to shoulders. Patients go there for surgery and stay
for rehabilitation under the watchful eye of Steadman and his
partners and staff.
	   Steadman, a Texas native, got his first look at sports injuries
on the playing field, first as a youngster and then playing
gridiron football at Texas A-and-M.
	   And when he became an orthopedic surgeon after graduating from
the University of Texas he had an idea about how to get injured
players going again: keep them moving.
	   He began testing his theory in his own living room when he
started working for the U.S. ski team in Lake Tahoe, California, in
the early 1970s.
	   The entire ski team ``slept on our floor or our couch. We had
seven people staying in the house at one time,'' he said. ``It was
a madhouse.''
	   Every morning and every evening, Steadman made sure the skiers
did their exercises. He didn't want their injured muscles to
atrophy. He felt movement was the key.
	   In the 1970s, Cindy Nelson, a three-time Olympic downhill skier
for the United States, became his first famous patient when he
treated her for a broken leg, the third in her career.
	   ``In the past, the doctor said put it in the cast and don't walk
on it. He (Steadman) opens up the cast (after a few days) and says,
`Point your toes at the ceiling.' I about fainted,'' she said.
	   But she recovered faster than ever before.
	   In December 1983, she injured her knee eight weeks before the
Olympics and thought, ``I'm out.'' Steadman had her up on skis in
time to compete in the Olympics.
	   ``It was really miraculous. I didn't win a medal but I felt I
had just because I had been able to compete. He's a pioneer in his
field,'' she said.
	   Former three-time overall World Cup ski champion Marc Girardelli
of Luxembourg had one of the worst knee injuries Steadman ever
patched up.
	   ``It's extremely difficult to come back from an injury like
that. Girardelli not only came back, he won the world championship
five times,'' Steadman said.
	   Steadman moved from California to Vail in 1988 and founded the
Steadman Sports Medicine Foundation, in association with the
clinic.
	   Steadman believes his devotion to movement is the reason ``every
(injured) athlete performed at a better level'' after treatment.
	   Nelson believes it is more than that. She says he is such a good
listener and good athlete himself _ skier, golfer, tennis player
and former football player _ that he has a natural affinity with
athletes.
	   Steadman's partner, Dr. Richard Hawkins, is a former university
quarterback who specializes in shoulder and elbow injuries. A
graduate of the University of Western Ontario, he is the team
doctor for the U.S. National Football League's Denver Broncos.
	   After he operated on Elway last year, the quarterback led the
Denver Broncos to their first Super Bowl victory.
	   Hawkins operated on him again in February and considers Elway's
decision to play one more season another vote of confidence.
	   Both doctors say their clinic's No. 1 goal is to take the
medical advances developed for the stars and make them available to
the general public.
	   DeNuccio tore knee cartilage so badly in the summer before her
senior year that Steadman had to remove it.
	   ``Four weeks later I was on the ice again,'' said DeNuccio, who
will play goalie this fall when she enters her second year at
Rensselaer Polytech Institute in Troy, New York. ``I am indebted to
him.''
	   Kramer, then a highly recruited high school linebacker, came to
Steadman after seriously injuring his knee skiing above the clinic
on Vail Mountain in 1993. Later, while playing at Texas Tech, he
injured his shoulder and Hawkins repaired it.
	   The Steadman-Hawkins Foundation spends about dlrs 2 million a
year on research, including trying to develop a method to
regenerate damaged cartilage tissue in the knees.
	   The foundation also is studying ways to treat osteoarthritis,
which afflicts nearly 21 million Americans.

Drechsler wins fourth gold, Jackson third straight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with women's long jump going to Drechsler &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Heike Drechsler became only the third
athlete in history to win four straight European Championship
titles in the same event when she clinched the gold medal in the
women's long jump Saturday.
	   Colin Jackson of Britain won his third straight in the men's
110-meter hurdles in a championship record of 13.02 seconds. His
old mark of 13.04 came in 1994.
	   Jackson first set the record in the semifinals earlier in the
day and matched it in the final. It's the third fastest in the
world this year.
	   Drechsler soared 7.16 meters, the fourth longest jump in the
world this year, behind three by American Marion Jones, whose best
is 7.31.
	   Christine Arron powered home in the anchor leg to lead France to
victory in the women's 4x100-meter relay and clinch her second gold
medal of competition.
	   The 100-meter champion with orange-dyed hair pulled her team
from third to first with an astonishing last leg. The French won in
42.59 seconds.
	   Darren Campbell and Doug Walker also picked up their second
golds when they ran in the winning British team in the men's 4x100
relay. Campbell was the 100-meter champion, Walker the 200 gold
medalist.
	   Julian Golding, bronze medalist in the 200, ran the anchor leg
for Britain, which clocked 38.52 for the gold. France took the
silver in 38.87, while Poland was third in 38.98.
	   With stunning acceleration in the last 50 meters, Arron flew
past Russia's anchor Irina Privalova, who stared in disbelief as
Arron sprinted past her.
	   Privalova, 100-meter silver medalist and 200 champion, lost her
second place as well when Andrea Philipp of Germany nipped her on
the line. Germany finished in 42.68, while Russia clocked 42.73 for
the bronze.
	   Drechsler, a former Olympic and world champion and former world
record holder, was jumping healthy for the first time in three
years, after having surgery on both Achilles tendons.
	   Only two former Soviet athletes had previously won four straight
European titles: Janis Lusis in the men's javelin, 1962-1971, and
Nadezhda Chizhova in the women's shot put, 1966-74.
	   Fiona May of Italy, Olympic silver medalist and bronze medalist
in last year's worlds, took the silver with a jump of 7.11. World
champion Lydmila Galkina of Russia was third at 7.06.
	   In the men's hurdles, Jackson cruised home without being pushed,
but failed in his declared goal of going under 13 seconds.
	   Falk Balzer of Germany won the silver in 13.12, while Robin
Korving of the Netherlands took the bronze in 13.20.
	   Maksim Tarasov of Russia cleared 5.81 meters to win the men's
pole vault. Tim Lobinger of Germany was second with the same height
but with more attempts overall, while Jean Galfione of France, the
Olympic champion, had to settle for bronze at 5.76.
	   In the morning, Stefano Baldini overcame rainy and windy
conditions to lead an Italian medal sweep in the men's marathon.
	   ``For the last month my coach and I have believed that this gold
would be mine,'' Baldini said. ``He said that he could see victory
in my eyes before the start and my heart also told me this medal
would be mine.''
	   Baldini, who was running stride for stride with fellow Italian
Danilo Goffi at the 40-kilometer mark, pulled away before entering
the Nep stadium and won in 2 hours 12 minutes 01 second.
	   Goffi was second in 2:12.11, and another Italian, Vincenzo
Modica, took the bronze in 2:12.53. Three Spanish runners took the
next three places.
	   ``After 37 kilometers I knew that I would beat my compatriots to
the finish,'' Baldini said.
	   After a week of mostly sunshine and warm weather in the
Hungarian capital, the conditions cooled considerably after a night
of storms.
	   Baldini and Goffi ran easily, however, and both were fresh
enough to celebrate by hugging each other after the
42.195-kilometer race.
	   Winner of the world half-marathon title in 1996, Baldini, 27,
was second in the 1997 London Marathon and third in the New York
race that same year.
	   Baldini is the eighth of 10 brothers, and his older brother
Marco is also a marathon runner.
	   Wilson Kipketer, world champion and record-holder, did just
enough to qualify for the final in the men's 800 by finishing third
in his semifinal heat.

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Silence fell upon this
bomb-shattered town and across Ireland on Saturday in memory of 28
people slain by IRA dissidents, as another ruthless band of
anti-British outlaws responded to the atrocity by announcing their
own cease-fire.
	   More than 20,000 Protestants and Catholics packed the center of
Omagh to remember, through their sobs and tears, the dead and the
more than 330 wounded by the Aug. 15 car bomb.
	   Hundreds of thousands more marked the slaughter _ the worst in
three decades of violence in Northern Ireland _ with one minute's
silence in town squares, churches, sports stadiums and shopping
centers across Ireland.
	   The Irish Republican Army dissidents responsible for the bomb
have already formally ``suspended'' their campaign to fall in line
with the IRA cease-fire of July 1997.
	   On Saturday morning, the Irish National Liberation Army conceded
that its cause was futile and announced a truce, too.
	   The INLA, founded in 1975 and an opponent of April's peace
accord, insisted the accord was ``not worth the sacrifices of the
past 30 years'' but should be respected because most Irish people
ratified it.
	   ``We recognize that armed struggle can never be the only option
for revolutionaries,'' said the statement, read speedily at a
Belfast news conference by the group's reputed commander, Willie
Gallagher. ``In the new conditions prevailing it is only right to
respond to the new conditions. Those conditions demand a
cease-fire.''
	   The statement offered what it called ``a sincere, heartfelt and
genuine apology'' for the many civilians it killed by accident or
design _ but pointedly said the INLA had ``nothing to apologize
for'' when it killed British soldiers, police, prison officers and
Protestant extremists.
	   The INLA killed about 130 people in its failed campaign to
supersede the IRA as the dominant anti-British paramilitary group
operating within Northern Ireland's most hard-line Catholic
neighborhoods.
	   Like the IRA, its goal is to abolish Northern Ireland as a
Protestant-majority state linked with Britain. But most of those it
killed were Protestant civilians or its own members, as the INLA
feuded over splitting proceeds from drug-dealing and other criminal
rackets.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who attended Saturday's
ceremony in Omagh, welcomed the INLA truce as ``good news at the
end of a bleak and tragic week.''
	   Ahern said the so-called Real IRA dissidents who bombed Omagh
``must now convert its suspension of operations into a definitive
and unqualified cessation of violence.''
	   And he emphasized that a third anti-British organization that
still maintains its right to bomb Northern Ireland towns, the
Continuity IRA, ``must now acknowledge that it is insanity to defy
the Irish people and must also definitively end their anachronistic
campaign.''
	   Joining Ahern outside Omagh's courthouse was the Irish
president, Belfast-born Mary McAleese, and a remarkable gathering
of church and political leaders brought together by disaster.
	   The leaders of the Catholic, Anglican, Methodist and
Presbyterian churches in Ireland stood shoulder to shoulder. To one
side, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, reputed former IRA
commanders and today leaders of the Sinn Fein party; to the other,
the Protestant and Catholic heads of Northern Ireland's newborn
cross-community government, David Trimble and Seamus Mallon.
	   Beyond them a sea of ordinary residents, some wearing bandages
and casts from the blast, wiped back tears as the names of the 28
dead were slowly read out.
	   ``At this hour last Saturday, 28 good and deeply loved people,
one carrying twins awaiting birth, were alive in these streets,''
said a Catholic priest, the Rev. Kevin Mullan, recalling the
moments when police evacuated people away from the courthouse _ and
unwittingly towards the bomb.
	   ``Death and life were blasted together. Death carried life and
peace away,'' Mullan said.
	   A Presbyterian minister said a prayer in Gaelic, the old Irish
tongue normally loathed by the north's Protestants. A local
Catholic chaplain at Omagh's British army base said one in Spanish,
in recognition that among the dead were a Spanish teacher and
student.

Sudan's president whips up crowd against U.S. as anti-Islam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES for AMs, new el-Bashir quotes, no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By Jamal Halaby &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Whipping up popular anger over a U.S.
missile strike, President Omar el-Bashir said Saturday that
Sudanese were prepared to die in a holy war.
	   ``America is attacking us because we are guardians of Islam,''
el-Bashir told a central Khartoum rally of at least 5,000 people,
who replied with chants of ``Death to America.''
	   ``We have tasted the sweet flavor of Jihad (holy war) and
matyrdom and what we seek now is to die for the sake of God,''
el-Bashir said.
	   ``Go! Go! We are behind you,'' responded the crowd, which
included Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, trade unionists
and students who were given the day off to attend the rally outside
the presidential offices.
	   After his speech, some 500 hundred protesters went to the
British Embassy where they hurled stones at the building. One
demonstrator climbed to the top of the embassy flagpole and cut
down the Union Jack.
	   After the flag fell to the ground, angry demonstrators tore it
to pieces.
	   Khartoum newspapers have published that British Prime Minister
Tony Blair has expressed support for the U.S. attack on a factory
in north Khartoum on Thursday. Washington says the factory produced
the ingredients of chemical weapons, while Khartoum says it
manufactured only pharmaceutical products.
	   One person was killed in the attack and nine others wounded.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the cruise missile strike in
retaliation for the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7. U.S. missiles also
struck the Afghanistan camps of Muslim militant Osama bin Laden,
the man whom Washington accuses of instigating the embassy
bombings.
	   Sudan's government, beleaguered by economic failure and 15 years
of war against southern insurgents, has sought to use the strikes
to rally support.
	   Another speaker at the rally launched a scathing attack on
America's allies in the Middle East, such as Israel and Egypt.
	   ``America's Arab friends and the head of the snake, Israel, are
deceiving Clinton and the Americans into becoming enemies of
Muslims,'' said the head of the Sudanese Students' Federation,
Hamdi Hassan.
	   ``The Israelis want to maintain the upper hand in a region that
is predominantly Arab and Muslim,'' Hassan said.
	   One banner at the rally hit on a theme sounded time and again by
Sudanese: President Clinton launched the attack to draw attention
from his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern.
	   It said: ``No war for Monica.''
	   Sudan has asked the U.N. Security Council to convene an urgent
meeting to consider a U.N. investigation into the factory's
production and the attack. Sudanese diplomats are to address an
emergency meeting of the Arab League in Cairo on Monday.

Denmark qualifies for third straight World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SELYATINO, Russia (AP) _ Gitte Krogh and Lene Jensen sent
Denmark to its third straight Women's World Cup finals on Saturday,
scoring in the 52nd and 81st minutes to give it a 2-1 victory over
Russia on Saturday.
	   The victory before a crowd of 300 clinched the European Group
Four title for Denmark and made it the eighth team to qualify for
the 16-nation field.
	   Denmark joined Sweden, Italy and defending champion Norway from
Europe as qualifiers. Russia already had clinched a place in one of
two, two-leg playoffs to determine Europe's other two berths.
	   Finland and European champion Germany also have clinched playoff
berths. Ukraine and Iceland are still in contention for the final
playoff spot.
	   North Korea, China, Japan and Brazil have qualified from Asia
and South America for the June 19-July 10, 1999, event. The host
United States, which is the only nation to get an automatic berth,
gives the tournament more than half of its participants.
	   The Danes played more confidently through but took seven minutes
into the second half before Krogh ended the stalemate.
	   Jensen secured the victory with nine minutes remaining. Galina
Komarov scored Russia's consolation goal in the 90th.

With missile attack, Sudan seeks to bolster sagging support

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ America's missile barrage on a
pharmaceutical plant in the outskirts of Sudan's capital was called
a strike against outlaw states that support terrorism.
	   For Sudan's government, it has provided an opportunity, one that
has become woefully rare, to rally its weary people around the
flag.
	   Since Thursday's strike on a factory the United States said was
producing precursors to chemical weapons, protesters encouraged by
the government have poured into Khartoum's muddy, desolate streets.
Sudanese leaders have saturated the airwaves _ in Arabic for
consumption at home and English for an audience abroad _ and
officials have vilified the opposition as collaborators of America.
	   Opposition and government figures said that in the end, Sudan's
isolated Islamic leaders may be the ones to gain.
	   ``It would have been better if they had not done it,'' said
Ghazi Suleiman, a Sudanese dissident imprisoned earlier this year.
``The danger of such attacks is that it keeps people looking toward
the sky and not toward the actual problems.''
	   The problems in Sudan are plenty.
	   Already one of Africa's poorest countries, where as many nine
out of 10 people struggle with miserable poverty, Sudan was hit in
July and August with the worst floods of the Nile River in 10
years.
	   Electricity that on good days lasted half the day now is cut
after six hours, often fewer, a result in part of the floods'
effect on hydroelectric power. Dire economic conditions, coupled
with the blackouts, have sent people into the streets of several
cities.
	   A civil war with southern rebels grinds on after 15 years, and
angry women whose sons are drafted to fight the battles _ what one
general called ``advanced training'' _ have clashed with police in
Khartoum and Omdurman, the capital's sister city across the Nile.
	   But for Sudan's Islamic leaders, who took power in a military
coup in 1989 that overthrew the democratically elected government,
these are days of patriotism and fervor _ and plenty of it.
	   And Washington, which has declared Sudan a sponsor of terrorism,
faces a government using the attack to bolster its standing.
	   Oddly, the first time electricity had not been cut for more than
six hours was the night of the attack, allowing Sudanese to watch
live footage of the burning factory and a protest at the U.S.
Embassy.
	   The government, long renowned for its ability to turn out
well-organized and dedicated cadres, went into action.
	   Thousands flocked to a square behind the presidential palace
Saturday. Boys let out from high school wore loose-fitting brown
camouflage, girls in veils donned a light blue version. Bureaucrats
at the presidential palace turned out, as did employees of the Bank
of Sudan _ all on a break mandated by the government.
	   Throughout the rally, crowds chanted, ``God is greater than
America'' and denounced U.S. President Clinton as immoral,
degenerate and a liar. But special scorn was held out for the
Sudanese opposition, particularly its leaders in exile.
	   One sign read, ``No to the lackeys.'' Nearby were pictures of
former Prime Minister Sadiq el-Mahdi and Mohammed el-Mirghani,
another leader of the opposition National Democratic Alliance.
Across the pictures were blue Stars of David, the symbol of Israel.
	   ``There are those who are much worse than Clinton,'' President
Omar el-Bashir told the crowd. ``And they are Sudanese.''
	   On the day of the attack, Bashir promised that there would be no
room for what he called fifth columnists.
	   The standing of Sudan's opposition had, in fact, improved in
recent months. Long with a substantial following inside Sudan, it
received a boost abroad from Egypt, Sudan's northern neighbor, when
it invited the main Sudanese opposition leaders to Cairo this
month.
	   It was a show of prominence for a movement that has the
difficult task of uniting Muslim parties in the Arabized north with
the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which seeks autonomy and
religious freedom for the south's Christians and animists.
	   Already the movement has taken a lower profile.
	   In Omdurman, at Wad Nubawi Mosque, long a stronghold of
el-Mahdi's followers, the sermon at Friday prayers was noticeably
mild. Rather than stinging attacks on government repression, the
sermon scolded the United States for carrying out the strike.
	   Such reluctance was even evident at Saturday's rally.
	   ``It's foreign aggression,'' said Idris Mohammed Idris, a
63-year-old who was distinctly unenthusiastic. ``Even if a citizen
has problems with the government, no electricity and no water, when
it comes to foreign aggression, you have to forget about it.''
	   ``The government,'' he added, ``is stronger than before.''

Munich, Kaiserslautern, Leverkusen 1-2-3 again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Bayern Munich and FC Kaiserslautern both coasted
to victory Saturday and found themselves right where they ended
last season _ atop the Bundesliga.
	   Munich, second last year, dismantled MSV Duisburg 3-1 with an
impressive performance to take over the top slot after two rounds,
while defending champion Kaiserslautern breezed past
Moenchengladbach 2-1 to move to the second slot.
	   Leverkusen, third last season, also took that position despite a
1-1 draw against SC Freiburg. Two other traditional league
powerhouses bounced back from opening day losses.
	   Borussia Dortmund, its rebuilt lineup showing signs of
coalescing, blasted Hertha Berlin 3-0 and defensive-minded Schalke
stopped Stuttgart 1-0.
	   Munich, which chased Kaiserslautern all last season, dominated
Duisburg and seized a 2-1 lead in the 63rd minute on Thomas
Strunz's powerful shot from 16 meters.
	   Munich, heavy title favorites, displayed more imagination on
offense than in recent years with new acquisition Stefan Effenberg
directing the offense.
	   ``The days when they had to make excuses about how they played
seem to be past,'' said former German national team player Paul
Breitner. ``They seem to finally have a leader.''
	   Effenberg, picked up from Moenchengladbach this season,
converted an 86th minute penalty and striker Carsten Jancker also
scored in the 20th.
	   Munich could have run up the score, but midfielder Mario Basler
was denied one goal on a questionable foul and a second attempt
cracked against the post. Marcus Wedau scored Duisburg's goal in
the 23rd minute.
	   Kaiserslautern, a surprise champion last season, relied again on
the scoring prowress of German international Olaf Marschall in its
home opener.
	   Marschall, the league's second leading marksman last season,
struck in the 62nd following teammate Martin Wagner's score off a
free kick 20 minutes earlier. Seven minutes before the whistle,
Sladjan Asanin put Moenchengladbach on the scoreboard.
	   Eintracht Frankfurt also fell 3-2 to 1860 Munich at home, while
in Friday's matches Nuremberg edged Bremen 3-2 and Rostock and
Wolfsburg played to 3-3.
	   Schalke, after a stunning 3-0 loss to Moenchengladbach last
week, this time showed its usual stifling defense against
Stuttgart.
	   Martin Max's 50th career goal _ a roller as he slid between two
defenders _ provided the game-winner in the 55th minute.
	   Bosnia's Sergei Barbarez and Bachirou Salou, Dortmund's new
strikers, provided the firepower as the team handed 32-year-old
Michael Skibbe his first triumph as the side's coach.
	   ``After our 1-0 loss to Stuttgart last week we were under a lot
of pressure,'' admitted Skibbe, expected to guide the former
Champions Cup winner back to its former glory. ``Luckily we found
our rythmn.''
	   Barbarez's 39th minute shot was deflected into the net by a
Berlin player and Dortmund's confidence soared afterwards in front
of 67,500 spectators at expanded Westfalenstadium.
	   Barbarez, assisted by Juergen Kohler's pass, struck again in the
52nd minute while Salou scored 12 minutes later on a keeper
mistake.
	   Leverkusen salvaged a draw when Stefan Beinlich scored in the
75th, four minutes after Alexander Iaschwili put Freiburg ahead
1-0.
	   Bernhard Winkler converted a 75th minute penalty, breaking a 2-2
tie as 1860 Munich beat Frankfurt. Teammates Daniel Borimirow and
Abderrahim Ouakili also scored.
	   Frankfurt's goals came from Alexander Schur and Ralf Weber.

Drechsler wins fourth gold, Jackson third straight

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Heike Drechsler became only the third
athlete in history to win four straight European Championship
titles in the same event when she clinched the gold medal in the
women's long jump Saturday.
	   Colin Jackson of Britain won his third straight in the men's
110-meter hurdles in a championship record of 13.02 seconds. His
old mark of 13.04 came in 1994.
	   Jackson, 31, first set the record in the semifinals earlier in
the day and matched it in the final. It's the third fastest in the
world this year.
	   Drechsler, 33, had only two valid jumps and both were 7.16
meters, fourth best in the world this year, behind three by
American Marion Jones, whose best is 7.31.
	   ``I was somewhat disappointed about a few jumps, but a gold is
still a gold,'' Drechsler said.
	   Christine Arron powered home in the anchor leg to lead France to
victory in the women's 4x100-meter relay and clinch her second gold
medal of competition.
	   The 100-meter champion with orange-dyed hair pulled her team
from third to first with an astonishing last leg. The French won in
42.59 seconds.
	   Darren Campbell and Doug Walker also picked up their second
golds when they ran in the winning British team in the men's 4x100
relay. Campbell was the 100-meter champion, Walker the 200 gold
medalist.
	   Julian Golding, bronze medalist in the 200, ran the anchor leg
for Britain, which clocked 38.52 for the gold. France took the
silver in 38.87, while Poland was third in 38.98.
	   With stunning acceleration in the last 50 meters, Arron flew
past Russia's anchor Irina Privalova, who stared in disbelief as
Arron sprinted past her.
	   Privalova, 100-meter silver medalist and 200 champion, lost her
second place as well when Andrea Philipp of Germany nipped her on
the line. Germany finished in 42.68, while Russia clocked 42.73 for
the bronze.
	   Drechsler, a former Olympic and world champion and former world
record holder, was jumping healthy for the first time in three
years, after having surgery on both Achilles tendons.
	   ``It was difficult to come back after a long time away, but
apparently I can still jump OK,'' Drechsler said.
	   Only two former Soviet athletes had previously won four straight
European titles: Janis Lusis in the men's javelin, 1962-1971, and
Nadezhda Chizhova in the women's shot put, 1966-74.
	   Fiona May of Italy, Olympic silver medalist and bronze medalist
in last year's worlds, took the silver with a jump of 7.11. World
champion Lyudmila Galkina of Russia was third at 7.06.
	   In the men's hurdles, Jackson cruised home without being pushed,
but failed in his declared goal of cracking 13 seconds. His world
record is 12.91.
	   Falk Balzer of Germany won the silver in 13.12, while Robin
Korving of the Netherlands took the bronze in 13.20.
	   Maksim Tarasov of Russia cleared 5.81 meters to win the men's
pole vault. Tim Lobinger of Germany was second with the same height
but with more attempts overall, while Jean Galfione of France, the
Olympic champion, had to settle for bronze at 5.76.
	   In the morning, Stefano Baldini overcame rainy and windy
conditions to lead an Italian medal sweep in the men's marathon.
	   ``For the last month my coach and I have believed that this gold
would be mine,'' Baldini said. ``He said that he could see victory
in my eyes before the start and my heart also told me this medal
would be mine.''
	   Baldini, who was running stride for stride with fellow Italian
Danilo Goffi at the 40-kilometer mark, pulled away before entering
the Nep stadium and won in 2 hours 12 minutes 01 second.
	   Goffi was second in 2:12.11, and another Italian, Vincenzo
Modica, took the bronze in 2:12.53. Three Spanish runners took the
next three places.
	   ``After 37 kilometers I knew that I would beat my compatriots to
the finish,'' Baldini said.
	   After a week of mostly sunshine and warm weather in the
Hungarian capital, the conditions cooled considerably after a night
of storms.
	   Baldini and Goffi ran easily, however, and both were fresh
enough to celebrate by hugging each other after the
42.195-kilometer race.
	   Winner of the world half-marathon title in 1996, Baldini, 27,
was second in the 1997 London Marathon and third in the New York
race that same year.
	   Baldini is the eighth of 10 brothers, and his older brother
Marco is also a marathon runner.
	   Wilson Kipketer, world champion and record-holder, did just
enough to qualify for the final in the men's 800 by finishing third
in his semifinal heat.

South Africa takes Tri-Nations rugby championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Fullback Percy Montgomery scored on
five penalties and two conversions Saturday to lead South Africa to
a 29-15 victory over Australia in the Tri-Nations championship
game.
	   The Southern Hemisphere championship was narrow throughout, with
the Springboks leading only 16-12 at haftime.
	   The victory was the Boks' first trophy under coach Nick Mallett
and underlined a remarkable rennaissance since he took charge of
the team.
	   The result put Australia second place in the Tri-Nations
tournament, with New Zeland coming in third.
	   South Africa took the lead in the second minute when Montgomery
landed a penalty.
	   Two minutes later, Wallaby fullback Matt Burke replied in kind.
	   Tighthead prop Adrian Garvey then scored in the seventh minute
after skipper Gary Teichmann had taken a line-out ball and the Boks
mauled their way through.
	   Garvey finished off a move which he was set up by coming up in
support after a great break from left wing Pieter Rossouw.
	   Montgomery's conversion took the Springboks to 10-3, but Burke's
kick drew the Aussies back to 6-10.
	   Thereafter South Africa wasted a few opportunities to increase
their lead. They ran two goalable penalties while on the attack,
and at their third opportunity finally decided to give it to
Montgomery, who made it 13-6.
	   The Wallabies answered with two penalties by Burke which brought
them within a point of the Springboks.
	   After the Wallabies had strayed off-side on the half-way line,
Montgomery landed a sensational 50-meter (yard) strike to make it
16-12 at the half.
	   Australia raised their game after the interval, and Burke again
brought Australia to within a single point in the 51st minute with
his fifth penalty.
	   Montgomery restored the Boks' 4-point cushion with a superbly
struck penalty from 45 meters (yards) out in the 57th minute.
	   The Bok fullback took the Springboks to 22-15 with his fifth
penalty after Australia had come in from the wrong side.
	   Springboks replacement flanker Bobby Skinstad scored under the
posts in the 70th minute and Montgomery converted to take South
Africa to the 29-15 final score.
	   The win marks a comeback for the world-champion Springboks.
	   After suffering their worst test defeat in their history last
year, a 55-35 embarrassment at the hands of New Zealand, the
Springboks are on the way back to supremacy of the sport.
	   The Tri-Nations championship comes on the heels of a record
96-13 win over Wales and comprehensive victories over England and
Ireland earlier in the season.

	   Key players in Congo's growing conflict:
	   _Congo: Led by President Laurent Kabila; under attack by a rebel
movement seeking to topple his regime and install democratic
reform.
	   _Congolese Democratic Coalition: Political wing of the rebel
movement; includes former Kabila government officials, opposition
leaders. Rebels are a coalition force of ethnic Tutsi fighters,
disaffected members of Kabila's army and soldiers from former
Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko's military.
	   _Rwanda: Neighbor east of Congo; increasingly disenchanted with
Kabila for failure to secure the turbulent border region. Said to
be backing the rebels with arms and troops and threatens
intervention in Congo to protect its ``vital interests.''
	   _Uganda: Borders Congo to the northeast. Said to be backing the
rebels with tanks and troops; has threatened unilateral
intervention in Congo if other foreign forces backing Kabila don't
withdraw.
	   _Zimbabwe: African country that does not share a border with
Congo; has sent up to 600 troops in support of Kabila.
	   _Angola: Borders Congo to the south; has expressed support for
Kabila. Angola is believed to have deployed troops and possibly
pilots to help Kabila hold off rebel advance.
	   _Republic of Congo: Congo's sister country to the west with its
capital strategically located just across the Congo River from
Kinshasa; says it will remain neutral in conflict despite past
troubled relations with Kabila.
	   _South Africa: Working to broker peace talks between Congo, the
rebels and their respective allies.

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's plans to hold a
summit to end
	   the Congo crisis hit a snag Saturday when two key figures failed
to appear.
	   Only two heads of state of the four invited showed up: the
presidents of Rwanda and Uganda. Congo accuses Rwanda and Uganda of
supporting rebels in the country.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila declined to come and instead sent
his justice minister, Mwenze Kongolo, who arrived late Saturday,
well beyond the time when the peace talks were to have begun.
	   Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe _ who is backing Kabila with
troops _ boycotted the meeting because it didn't include other
countries which support military intervention in Congo.
	   While awaiting Kongolo's arrival, South African President Nelson
Mandela was having ``an exhange of views'' with Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, according
to Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana.
	   No immediate progress was reported after Kongolo arrived.
Reporters were kept away from the meeting site, a residence for
visiting VIPs in Pretoria, the capital.
	   On Sunday, the Southern African Development Community planned to
hold a meeting in Pretoria to resolve a split within the 14-nation
group on how best to deal with the Congo crisis.
	   While Zimbabwe and reportedly Angola and sending troops to back
Kabila, South Africa has ruled out military intervention and wants
other countries to take the same stance.

Drechsler wins fourth gold, Jackson third straight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with heptathlon, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Heike Drechsler became only the third
athlete in history to win four straight European Championship
titles in the same event when she clinched the gold medal in the
women's long jump Saturday.
	   Colin Jackson of Britain won his third straight in the men's
110-meter hurdles in a championship record of 13.02 seconds. His
old mark of 13.04 came in 1994.
	   Jackson, 31, first set the record in the semifinals earlier in
the day and matched it in the final. It's the third fastest in the
world this year.
	   Drechsler, 33, had only two valid jumps and both were 7.16
meters, fourth best in the world this year, behind three by
American Marion Jones, whose best is 7.31.
	   ``I was somewhat disappointed about a few jumps, but a gold is
still a gold,'' said Drechsler, who broke into tears at the medal
ceremony.
	   Christine Arron powered home in the anchor leg to lead France to
victory in the women's 4x100-meter relay and clinch her second gold
medal of competition.
	   The 100-meter champion with orange-dyed hair pulled her team
from third to first with an astonishing last leg. The French won in
42.59 seconds.
	   With stunning acceleration in the last 50 meters, Arron flew
past Russia's anchor Irina Privalova, who stared in disbelief as
Arron sprinted past her.
	   Privalova, 100-meter silver medalist and 200 champion, lost her
second place as well when Andrea Philipp of Germany nipped her on
the line. Germany finished in 42.68, while Russia clocked 42.73 for
the bronze.
	   Darren Campbell and Doug Walker also picked up their second
golds when they ran in the winning British team in the men's 4x100
relay. Campbell was the 100-meter champion, Walker the 200 gold
medalist.
	   Julian Golding, bronze medalist in the 200, ran the anchor leg
for Britain, which clocked 38.52 for the gold. France took the
silver in 38.87, while Poland was third in 38.98.
	   There was another gold for Britain when Denise Lewis came from
behind to win the heptathlon with 6,559 points. Urszula Wlodarczyk
of Poland gained the silver at 6,460 and Natalya Sazanovich of
Belarus took the bronze at 6,410.
	   Drechsler, a former Olympic and world champion and former world
record holder, was jumping healthy for the first time in three
years, after having surgery on both Achilles tendons.
	   ``It was difficult to come back after a long time away, but
apparently I can still jump OK,'' Drechsler said. ``This was
perhaps my hardest win.''
	   Only two former Soviet athletes had previously won four straight
European titles: Janis Lusis in the men's javelin, 1962-1971, and
Nadezhda Chizhova in the women's shot put, 1966-74.
	   Fiona May of Italy, Olympic silver medalist and bronze medalist
in last year's worlds, took the silver with a jump of 7.11. World
champion Lyudmila Galkina of Russia was third at 7.06.
	   In the men's hurdles, Jackson cruised home without being pushed,
but failed in his declared goal of cracking 13 seconds. His world
record is 12.91.
	   Falk Balzer of Germany won the silver in 13.12, while Robin
Korving of the Netherlands took the bronze in 13.20.
	   Maksim Tarasov of Russia cleared 5.81 meters to win the men's
pole vault. Tim Lobinger of Germany was second with the same height
but with more attempts overall, while Jean Galfione of France, the
Olympic champion, had to settle for bronze at 5.76.
	   In the morning, Stefano Baldini overcame rainy and windy
conditions to lead an Italian medal sweep in the men's marathon.
	   Baldini, who was running stride for stride with fellow Italian
Danilo Goffi at the 40-kilometer mark, pulled away before entering
the Nep stadium and won in 2 hours 12 minutes 01 second.
	   Goffi was second in 2:12.11, and another Italian, Vincenzo
Modica, took the bronze in 2:12.53. Three Spanish runners took the
next three places.
	   ``After 37 kilometers I knew that I would beat my compatriots to
the finish,'' Baldini said.
	   Baldini and Goffi ran easily, however, and both were fresh
enough to celebrate by hugging each other after the
42.195-kilometer race.
	   Winner of the world half-marathon title in 1996, Baldini, 27,
was second in the 1997 London Marathon and third in the New York
race that same year.
	   Baldini is the eighth of 10 brothers, and his older brother
Marco is also a marathon runner.

Mexican gang leader lists his profession as `Kidnapping'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GLORIA PEREZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALMOLOYA DE JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) _ Asked by the judge to state
his profession, Daniel Arizmendi Lopez curtly responded:
``Kidnapping.''
	   Judge Armando Baez Espinoza of the 2nd Federal Criminal Court
stared in disbelief at the man dubbed the ``ear-lopper'' for
allegedly sending ransom notes attached to his victims' ears.
	   Judge Baez asked Arizmendi to repeat himself. He replied: ``I do
kidnappings ... I am a kidnapper.''
	   After the eight-hour pretrial hearing at the maximum security
prison in Almoloya de Juarez, near Mexico City, Arizmendi and his
mistress, Dulce Maria Paz Venegas, refused to plead innocent or
guilty to the charges.
	   Arizmendi said he was very tired after three days of questioning
by police at the Attorney General's Office.
	   Their court-appointed lawyer, Maria Eugenia Lopez Fuentes, asked
the hearing to be recessed until next Thursday so she could have
time to prepare her case. The judge agreed and ordered them held
without bail.
	   Arizmendi is accused of kidnapping, racketeering, laundering
money from ransom payments and illegal possession of firearms.
Lopez is accused of racketeering and money laundering.
	   Arizmendi said he was born in Miacatlan, in western Morelos
state. He gave his age as 40, and said he had a high school
education. He said he did not smoke or use drugs and stopped
drinking alcohol two years ago.
	   He also admitted serving time for car theft in 1985, before he
went into kidnapping.
	   Arizmendi, a former police officer in neighboring Morelos state,
and Lopez were arrested Monday night in Naucalpan, a northwestern
suburb of Mexico City, after a 10-month manhunt. Police found dlrs
1 million in cash in the car they were driving.
	   According to prosecutors, Arizmendi headed a kidnapping gang
numbering at least 38, with activities stretching into at least
four states. The members allegedly included both former and active
police officers.
	   Some authorities say Arizmendi's was involved in as many as 200
abductions over a period of five years, all of wealthy businessmen
or their family members.
	   The latest victim, a wealthy business executive, was shot dead
after he was kidnapped Aug. 6 in Queretaro state.
	   Police had been searching for Arizmendi since October. On May
21, Arizmendi narrowly escaped a raid on a safe house in
Cuernavaca, 35 miles (55 kilometers) south of Mexico City.
	   His son and daughter-in-law were arrested in that raid, as well
as his wife, a former nurse allegedly assigned the task of slicing
off the ears forwarded to the victims' families.
	   The three gave authorities information that, along with
intelligence gathered from phone taps, helped track down Arizmendi.

Sweden's Gronberg moves three ahead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Mathias Gronberg rolled in a 30-foot
eagle putt at the last for a 5-under 67 Saturday to take a 3-stroke
lead going into the final round of the 1.25 million (dlrs 2
million) European Open.
	   Chasing a first price of 208,300 pounds (dlrs 344,000) _
Europe's second richest prize _ the 28-year-old Swede is out to
eclipse some of the continent's big Ryder Cup names with players
like Colin Montgomerie and Seve Ballesteros already missing the
cut, Jose Maria Olazabal 17 strokes back and Lee Westwood likely to
pull out after three rounds with a hip injury.
	   Gronberg, whose only European tour victory came three years ago,
leads American Craig Hainline by three strokes and is six ahead of
third place Darren Clarke, Bernhard Langer and Jose Rivero.
	   Hainline stayed in contention with a 69, Clarke had a 70 and
joint halfway leaders Langer and Rivero slipped back with 3-over
75s.
	   Gale-force winds and heavy rain are forecast for Sunday's final
ran and Gronberg hopes his lead is big enough for him to hold on.
	   ``There are 18 holes left, and I'll try to take it shot-by-shot
and stay calm,'' the Swede said. ``This K Club can be very
punishing, and I've heard the weather is going to be pretty
horrendous.
	   At exactly 3:10 in the afternoon, the players halted for a
minute's silence in memory of the 28 people, many of them children,
killed in a bomb blast at Omagh, Northern Ireland, a week ago.
	   Led by Clarke, European players have planned a Pro-Am to raise
money for the dependants of those who died in last Saturday's
explosion.

 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ America's missile barrage on a
pharmaceutical plant in the outskirts of Sudan's capital was called
a strike against outlaw states that support terrorism.
	   For Sudan's government, it has provided an opportunity, one that
has become woefully rare, to rally its weary people around the
flag.
	   Since Thursday's strike on a factory the United States said was
producing precursors to chemical weapons, protesters encouraged by
the government have poured into Khartoum's muddy, desolate streets.
Sudanese leaders have saturated the airwaves _ in Arabic for
consumption at home and English for an audience abroad _ and
officials have vilified the opposition as collaborators of America.
	   Opposition and government figures said that in the end, Sudan's
isolated Islamic leaders may be the ones to gain.
	   ``It would have been better if they had not done it,'' said
Ghazi Suleiman, a leading lawyer and dissident who served a short
term in prison earlier this year. ``The danger of such attacks is
that it keeps people looking toward the sky and not toward the
actual problems.''
	   The problems in Sudan are plenty.
	   Already one of Africa's poorest countries, where as many nine
out of 10 people struggle with miserable poverty, Sudan was hit in
July and August with the worst floods of the Nile River in 10
years.
	   Electricity that on good days lasted half the day now is cut
after six hours, often fewer, a result in part of the floods'
effect on hydroelectric power. Dire economic conditions, coupled
with the blackouts, have sent people into the streets of several
cities.
	   A civil war with southern rebels grinds on after 15 years, and
angry women whose sons are drafted to fight the battles _ what one
general called ``advanced training'' _ have clashed with police in
Khartoum and Omdurman, the capital's sister city across the Nile.
	   But for Sudan's Islamic leaders, who took power in a military
coup in 1989 that overthrew the democratically elected government,
these are days of patriotism and fervor _ and plenty of it.
	   And Washington, which has declared Sudan a sponsor of terrorism,
faces a government using the attack to bolster its standing.
	   Oddly, the first time electricity had lasted more than six hours
was the night of the attack, allowing Sudanese to watch live
footage of the burning factory and a protest at the U.S. Embassy.
	   The government, long renowned for its ability to turn out
well-organized and dedicated cadres, went into action.
	   Thousands flocked to a square behind the presidential palace
Saturday. Boys let out from high school wore loose-fitting brown
camouflage, girls in veils donned a light blue version. Bureaucrats
at the presidential palace turned out, as did employees of the Bank
of Sudan _ all on a break mandated by the government.
	   Throughout the rally, crowds chanted, ``God is greater than
America'' and denounced U.S. President Clinton as immoral,
degenerate and a liar. But special scorn was held out for the
Sudanese opposition, particularly its leaders in exile.
	   One sign read, ``No to the lackeys.'' Nearby were pictures of
former Prime Minister Sadiq el-Mahdi and Mohammed el-Mirghani,
another leader of the opposition National Democratic Alliance.
Scrawled across the pictures were blue Stars of David, the symbol
of Israel.
	   ``There are those who are much worse than Clinton,'' President
Omar el-Bashir told the crowd. ``And they are Sudanese.''
	   On the day of the attack, Bashir promised that there would be no
room for what he called fifth columnists.
	   The standing of Sudan's opposition had, in fact, improved in
recent months. Long with a substantial following inside Sudan, it
received a boost abroad from Egypt, Sudan's northern neighbor, when
it invited the main Sudanese opposition leaders to Cairo this
month.
	   It was a show of prominence for a movement that has the
difficult task of uniting Muslim parties in the Arabized north with
the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which seeks autonomy and
religious freedom for the south's Christians and animists.
	   Already the movement has taken a lower profile.
	   In Omdurman, at Wad Nubawi Mosque, long a stronghold of
el-Mahdi's followers, the sermon at Friday prayers was noticeably
mild. Rather than stinging attacks on government repression, the
sermon scolded the United States for carrying out the strike.
	   Such reticence was even evident at Saturday's rally.
	   ``It's foreign aggression,'' said Idris Mohammed Idris, a
63-year-old who was distinctly unenthusiastic. ``Even if a citizen
has problems with the government, no electricity and no water, when
it comes to foreign aggression, you have to forget about it.''
	   ``The government,'' he added, ``is stronger than before.''

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ With impassioned speeches in three cities,
opposition candidate Gerhard Schroeder kicked off the final stretch
of his election campaign Saturday pledging to restore programs to
help the most vulnerable members of society.
	   Schroeder, the front-runner for the Sept. 27 national vote,
confidently predicted he will unseat Chancellor Helmut Kohl. If he
does, it will be partly with campaign promises to repeal unpopular
cuts to the welfare state passed by the conservative leader.
	   The Social Democrat fired off forceful, fist-shaking speeches in
Berlin, Munich and Bonn, hitting powerfully at his theme that
strengthening the economy shouldn't come at the expense of the
Germans struggling to get by, including workers who fall ill and
pensioners.
	   ``We must finally move ahead in Germany,'' he said as wind
whipped through his hair and rain pelted his suit at an outdoor
rally in Bonn, the last stop on the one-day sweep through Germany.
	   Schroeder was at his most forceful when he promised to repeal
cuts in sick pay pushed through by Kohl as part of reforms aimed at
making German companies more competitive.
	   ``We can win, and we will,'' he proclaimed earlier in Berlin.
	   Schroeder's intensive tour gave him a head start into the
decisive five-week spurt of heavy campaigning by both candidates:
He demonstrated vigor, while Kohl was kicking off with a single
rally Sunday.
	   Speaking at Munich's Olympic Stadium complex, Schroeder tied his
political credibility to bringing down unemployment _ the core
issue in this year's campaign.
	   If elected, he told some 5,000 spectators, the Social Democrats
wouldn't deserve another term unless they ``noticeably'' lower
joblessness.
	   Social Democratic party chairman Oskar Lafontaine, who also
spoke at the rallies, accused Kohl of breaking promises to lower
joblessness, taxes and government debt and letting them rise
instead.
	   Kohl displayed an unbroken will to hang on after 16 years in
power, despite a limp campaign that has him trailing in opinion
polls.
	   ``I'm pretty sure we will win the election,'' Kohl said in an
interview for broadcast Sunday on ZDF national television. ``The
election is not decided at all yet. We are fighting for every
vote.''
	   He said he would count on swaying the large number of undecided
voters _ nearly half according to a Forsa institute poll released
Saturday.
	   On Thursday, Schroeder presented his plan for the first 100 days
of a Social Democratic government, pledging to cut taxes but also
to scrap welfare-state reforms pushed through by Kohl's government.
	   A pragmatic pro-business moderate, Schroeder symbolizes his
traditionally left-leaning party's drive to capture a ``new
center'' in the electorate.
	   Another poll published Saturday by Focus magazine gave the
Social Democrats 42 percent compared to 38 percent for Kohl's
Christian Democrats. Neither poll gave a margin of error.

Sudan's president whips up crowd against U.S. as anti-Islam

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Whipping up popular anger over a U.S.
missile strike, President Omar el-Bashir said Saturday that the
Sudanese were prepared to die in a holy war.
	   ``America is attacking us because we are guardians of Islam,''
el-Bashir told a central Khartoum rally of at least 5,000 people,
who replied with chants of ``Death to America.''
	   ``We have tasted the sweet flavor of jihad (holy war) and
martyrdom and what we seek now is to die for the sake of God,''
el-Bashir said.
	   ``Go! Go! We are behind you,'' responded the crowd, which
included Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, trade unionists
and students who were given the day off to attend the rally outside
the presidential offices.
	   After his speech, some 500 hundred protesters went to the
British Embassy, where they hurled stones at the building. One
demonstrator climbed to the top of the embassy flagpole and cut
down the Union Jack. After the flag fell to the ground, angry
demonstrators tore it to pieces.
	   Khartoum newspapers have reported that British Prime Minister
Tony Blair expressed support for the U.S. missile attack on a
factory in north Khartoum on Thursday. Washington says the factory
produced ingredients for chemical weapons, while Khartoum says it
manufactured only pharmaceutical products. One person was killed in
the attack and nine others wounded.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the cruise missile strike in
retaliation for the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7. U.S. missiles also
struck the Afghanistan camps of millionaire Islamic extremist Osama
bin Laden, the man whom Washington accuses of instigating the
embassy bombings.
	   Sudan's government, beleaguered by economic failure and 15 years
of war against southern insurgents, has sought to use the strikes
to rally support.
	   Another speaker at the rally launched a scathing attack on
America's allies in the Middle East.
	   ``America's Arab friends and the head of the snake, Israel, are
deceiving Clinton and the Americans into becoming enemies of
Muslims,'' said the head of the Sudanese Students' Federation,
Hamdi Hassan. ``The Israelis want to maintain the upper hand in a
region that is predominantly Arab and Muslim.''
	   One banner at the rally hit on a theme sounded time and again by
Sudanese: Clinton launched the attack to draw attention away from
his relationship with former White House volunteer Monica Lewinsky.
	   It said: ``No war for Monica.''
	   Sudan has asked the U.N. Security Council to investigate the
factory's production and the attack. Sudanese diplomats were to
address an emergency meeting of the Arab League in Cairo on Monday.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Heike Drechsler became only the third
athlete in history to win four straight European Championship
titles in the same event when she clinched the gold medal in the
women's long jump Saturday.
	   Colin Jackson of Britain won his third straight in the men's
110-meter hurdles in a championship record of 13.02 seconds. His
old mark of 13.04 came in 1994.
	   Jackson, 31, first set the record in the semifinals earlier in
the day and matched it in the final. It's the third fastest in the
world this year.
	   ``Winning a gold medal is always hard, not matter how big a
favorite you are,'' Jackson said. ``This time was no different.''
	   Drechsler, 33, had only two valid jumps and both were 7.16
meters, fourth best in the world this year, behind three by
American Marion Jones, whose best is 7.31.
	   ``I was somewhat disappointed about a few jumps, but a gold is
still a gold,'' said Drechsler, who broke into tears at the medal
ceremony.
	   Christine Arron powered home in the anchor leg to lead France to
victory in the women's 4x100-meter relay and clinch her second gold
medal of competition.
	   The 100-meter champion with orange-dyed hair pulled her team
from third to first with an astonishing last leg. The French won in
42.59 seconds.
	   With stunning acceleration in the last 50 meters, Arron flew
past Russia's anchor Irina Privalova, who stared in disbelief as
Arron sprinted past her.
	   Privalova, 100-meter silver medalist and 200 champion, lost her
second place as well when Andrea Philipp of Germany nipped her on
the line. Germany finished in 42.68, while Russia clocked 42.73 for
the bronze.
	   Darren Campbell and Doug Walker also picked up their second
golds when they ran in the winning British team in the men's 4x100
relay. Campbell was the 100-meter champion, Walker the 200 gold
medalist.
	   Julian Golding, bronze medalist in the 200, ran the anchor leg
for Britain, which clocked 38.52 for the gold. France took the
silver in 38.87, while Poland was third in 38.98.
	   There was another gold for Britain when Denise Lewis came from
behind to win the heptathlon with 6,559 points. Urszula Wlodarczyk
of Poland gained the silver at 6,460 and Natalya Sazanovich of
Belarus took the bronze at 6,410.
	   Isaac Viciosa led a 1-2 Spanish finish in the men's 5,000,
winning in 13:37.46 ahead of Manuel Pancorbo, who clocked 13:38.03.
Mark Carroll of Ireland was third in 13:38.15.
	   Drechsler, a former Olympic and world champion and former world
record holder, was jumping healthy for the first time in three
years, after having surgery on both Achilles tendons.
	   ``It was difficult to come back after a long time away, but
apparently I can still jump OK,'' Drechsler said. ``This was
perhaps my hardest win.''
	   Only two former Soviet athletes had previously won four straight
European titles: Janis Lusis in the men's javelin, 1962-1971, and
Nadezhda Chizhova in the women's shot put, 1966-74.
	   Fiona May of Italy, Olympic silver medalist and bronze medalist
in last year's worlds, took the silver with a jump of 7.11. World
champion Lyudmila Galkina of Russia was third at 7.06.
	   In the men's hurdles, Jackson cruised home without being pushed,
but failed in his declared goal of cracking 13 seconds. His world
record is 12.91.
	   ``I am relieved as I had the pressure on my shoulders. I have
won my third European title in a row, equaling the championship
record, so I have to be content,'' Jackson.
	   Falk Balzer of Germany won the silver in 13.12, while Robin
Korving of the Netherlands took the bronze in 13.20.
	   Maksim Tarasov of Russia cleared 5.81 meters to win the men's
pole vault. Tim Lobinger of Germany was second with the same height
but with more attempts overall, while Jean Galfione of France, the
Olympic champion, had to settle for bronze at 5.76.
	   In the morning, Stefano Baldini overcame rainy and windy
conditions to lead an Italian medal sweep in the men's marathon.
	   Baldini, who was running stride for stride with fellow Italian
Danilo Goffi at the 40-kilometer mark, pulled away before entering
the Nep stadium and won in 2 hours 12 minutes 01 second.
	   Goffi was second in 2:12.11, and another Italian, Vincenzo
Modica, took the bronze in 2:12.53. Spanish runners took the next
three places.
	   ``After 37 kilometers I knew that I would beat my compatriots to
the finish,'' Baldini said.
	   Baldini and Goffi ran easily, however, and both were fresh
enough to celebrate by hugging each other after the
42.195-kilometer race.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Whipping up popular anger over a U.S.
missile strike, President Omar el-Bashir said Saturday that the
Sudanese were prepared to die in a holy war.
	   ``America is attacking us because we are guardians of Islam,''
el-Bashir told a central Khartoum rally of at least 5,000 people,
who replied with chants of ``Death to America.''
	   ``We have tasted the sweet flavor of jihad (holy war) and
martyrdom and what we seek now is to die for the sake of God,''
el-Bashir said.
	   ``Go! Go! We are behind you,'' responded the crowd, which
included Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, trade unionists
and students who were given the day off to attend the rally outside
the presidential offices.
	   After his speech, some 500 protesters went to the British
Embassy, where they hurled stones at the building. One demonstrator
climbed to the top of the embassy flagpole and cut down the Union
Jack. After the flag fell to the ground, angry demonstrators tore
it to pieces.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed support for the
U.S. missile attack on a factory in north Khartoum on Thursday.
Washington says the factory produced ingredients for chemical
weapons, while Khartoum says it manufactured only pharmaceutical
products. One person was killed in the attack and nine others
wounded.

South Africa takes Tri-Nations rugby championship

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Fullback Percy Montgomery
scored on five penalties and two conversions Saturday to lead South
Africa to a 29-15 victory over Australia in the Tri-Nations
championship game.
	   The Southern Hemisphere championship was narrow throughout, with
the Springboks leading only 16-12 at haftime.
	   The victory was the Boks' first trophy under coach Nick Mallett
and underlined a remarkable rennaissance since he took charge of
the team.
	   The result put Australia second place in the Tri-Nations
tournament, with New Zeland coming in third.
	   South Africa took the lead in the second minute when Montgomery
landed a penalty.
	   Two minutes later, Wallaby fullback Matt Burke replied in kind.
	   Tighthead prop Adrian Garvey then scored in the seventh minute
after skipper Gary Teichmann had taken a line-out ball and the Boks
mauled their way through.
	   Garvey finished off a move which he was set up by coming up in
support after a great break from left wing Pieter Rossouw.
	   Montgomery's conversion took the Springboks to 10-3, but Burke's
kick drew the Aussies back to 6-10.
	   Thereafter South Africa wasted a few opportunities to increase
their lead. They ran two goalable penalties while on the attack,
and at their third opportunity finally decided to give it to
Montgomery, who made it 13-6.
	   The Wallabies answered with two penalties by Burke which brought
them within a point of the Springboks.
	   After the Wallabies had strayed off-side on the half-way line,
Montgomery landed a sensational 50-meter (yard) strike to make it
16-12 at the half.
	   Australia raised their game after the interval, and Burke again
brought Australia to within a single point in the 51st minute with
his fifth penalty.
	   Montgomery restored the Boks' 4-point cushion with a superbly
struck penalty from 45 meters (yards) out in the 57th minute.
	   The Bok fullback took the Springboks to 22-15 with his fifth
penalty after Australia had come in from the wrong side.
	   Springboks replacement flanker Bobby Skinstad scored under the
posts in the 70th minute and Montgomery converted to take South
Africa to the 29-15 final score.
	   The win marks a comeback for the world-champion Springboks.
	   After suffering their worst test defeat in their history last
year, a 55-35 embarrassment at the hands of New Zealand, the
Springboks are on the way back to supremacy of the sport.
	   The Tri-Nations championship comes on the heels of a record
96-13 win over Wales and comprehensive victories over England and
Ireland earlier in the season.

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ America's missile barrage on a
pharmaceutical plant in the outskirts of Sudan's capital was called
a strike against terrorists operating from outlaw states.
	   For Sudan's government, it has provided an opportunity, one that
has become woefully rare, to rally its weary people around the
flag.
	   Since Thursday's strike on a factory the United States said was
producing precursors to chemical weapons, protesters encouraged by
the government have poured into Khartoum's muddy, desolate streets.
Sudanese leaders have saturated the airwaves _ in Arabic for
consumption at home and English for an audience abroad _ and
officials have vilified the opposition as collaborators with
America.
	   Opposition and government figures said that in the end, Sudan's
isolated Islamic leaders may be the ones to gain.
	   ``It would have been better if they had not done it,'' said
Ghazi Suleiman, a Sudanese dissident imprisoned and freed earlier
this year. ``The danger of such attacks is that it keeps people
looking toward the sky and not toward the actual problems.''
	   The problems in Sudan are plenty.
	   Already one of Africa's poorest countries, where as many nine
out of 10 people struggle with miserable poverty, Sudan was hit in
July and August with the worst Nile River flooding in 10 years.
	   Electricity that on good days lasted half the day now is cut
after six hours, often fewer, a result in part of the floods'
effect on hydroelectric power. Dire economic conditions, coupled
with the blackouts, have sent people into the streets of several
cities.
	   A civil war with southern rebels grinds on after 15 years, and
angry women whose sons are drafted to fight the battles _ what one
general called ``advanced training'' _ have clashed with police in
Khartoum and Omdurman, the capital's sister city across the Nile.
	   But for Sudan's Islamic leaders, who took power in a 1989
military coup against the democratically elected government, these
are days of patriotism and fervor _ and plenty of it.
	   And Washington, which has declared Sudan a sponsor of terrorism,
faces a government using the attack to bolster its standing.
	   Oddly, the first time electricity lasted more than six hours was
the night of the attack, allowing Sudanese to watch live footage of
the burning factory and a protest at the U.S. Embassy.
	   The government, long renowned for its ability to turn out
well-organized and dedicated cadres, went into action.
	   Thousands flocked to a square behind the presidential palace
Saturday. Boys let out from high school wore loose-fitting brown
camouflage, girls in veils donned a light blue version. Bureaucrats
at the presidential palace turned out, as did employees of the Bank
of Sudan _ all on a break mandated by the government.
	   Throughout the rally, crowds chanted, ``God is greater than
America'' and denounced U.S. President Bill Clinton as immoral,
degenerate and a liar. But special scorn was held out for the
Sudanese opposition, particularly its leaders in exile.
	   One sign read, ``No to the lackeys.'' Nearby were pictures of
former Prime Minister Sadiq el-Mahdi and Mohammed el-Mirghani,
another leader of the opposition National Democratic Alliance.
Scrawled across the pictures were blue Stars of David.
	   ``There are those who are much worse than Clinton,'' President
Omar el-Bashir told the crowd. ``And they are Sudanese.''
	   On the day of the attack, Bashir promised that there would be no
room for what he called fifth columnists.
	   The standing of Sudan's opposition had, in fact, improved in
recent months. Long with a substantial following inside Sudan, it
received a boost abroad from Egypt, Sudan's northern neighbor, when
it invited the main Sudanese opposition leaders to Cairo this
month.
	   It was a show of prominence for a movement that has the
difficult task of uniting Muslim parties in the Arabized north with
the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which seeks autonomy and
religious freedom for the south's Christians and animists.
	   Already the movement has taken a lower profile.
	   In Omdurman, at Wad Nubawi Mosque, long a stronghold of
el-Mahdi's followers, the sermon at Friday prayers was noticeably
mild. Rather than stinging attacks on government repression, the
sermon scolded the United States for carrying out the strike.
	   Such reticence was even evident at Saturday's rally.
	   ``It's foreign aggression,'' said Idris Mohammed Idris, 63, who
was distinctly unenthusiastic. ``Even if a citizen has problems
with the government, no electricity and no water, when it comes to
foreign aggression, you have to forget about it.''
	   ``The government,'' he added, ``is stronger than before.''

World No. 1 Sorenstam leads Alfredsson by two strokes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MALMO, Sweden (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam shot her second straight
71 Saturday and took a 2-stroke lead over fellow Swedish (U.S.)
LPGA star Helen Alfredsson after the penultimate round of the
Compaq Open.
	   Sorenstam, who won the European Tour event on another Swedish
course near her hometown of Stockholm last year, had a 4-under-par
total of 212 going into Sunday's fourth round on the tough
Barseback course.
	   ``But a two-stroke lead is nothing in this wind,'' said
Sorenstam, a two-time former U.S. Open champion ranked No. 1 in the
world. ''Anything can happen, already on the first hole. Helen is a
tough competitor. If she gets a good start, she's difficult to
beat.''
	   Alfredsson, who won the 1993 Dinah Shore for her only major
triumph, had a 70 Saturday and was one shot ahead of Johanna Head
of Britain.
	   Head, who has not made a cut all season, played alongside
Sorenstam in the final group and took the lead with birdies on the
short second _ where she nearly holed in one _ and the third. But
she dropped back with six bogeys to only one more birdie and
finished with a 74 for a 215 total.
	   Laura Davies, the big-hitting British star who's looking for a
Swedish double after winning the Chrysler Open in Goteborg a month
ago, also had a second successive 71 and was alone in fourth place
at 216.
	   Kelly Robbins, the top American in the tournament, slipped to a
77 and shared seventh at 219. She broke the course record with a 67
Saturday.
	   Karrie Webb of Australia shot a 73 for a 220 total. Two former
U.S. Open champions, Alison Nicholas of Britain and Liselotte
Neumann of Sweden, also struggled. Nicholas had a 75-223, Neumann
74-224.
	   Pia Nilsson, Swedish captain of Europe's Solheim Cup team, will
announce her five wild card-entries for the match against the U.S.
defending champions after the tournament ends Sunday. The Solheim
Cup is scheduled Sept. 18-20 at Muirfield Village, Ohio.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Heike Drechsler became only the third
athlete in history to win four straight European Championship
titles in the same event when she clinched the gold medal in the
women's long jump Saturday.
	   Colin Jackson of Britain won his third straight in the men's
110-meter hurdles in a championship record of 13.02 seconds. His
old mark of 13.04 came in 1994.
	   Jackson, 31, first set the record in the semifinals earlier in
the day and matched it in the final. It's the third fastest in the
world this year.
	   ``Winning a gold medal is always hard, not matter how big a
favorite you are,'' Jackson said. ``This time was no different.''
	   Drechsler, 33, had only two valid jumps and both were 7.16
meters, fourth best in the world this year, behind three by
American Marion Jones, whose best is 7.31.
	   ``I was somewhat disappointed about a few jumps, but a gold is
still a gold,'' said Drechsler, who broke into tears at the medal
ceremony.
	   Christine Arron powered home in the anchor leg to lead France to
victory in the women's 4x100-meter relay and clinch her second gold
medal of competition.
	   The 100-meter champion with orange-dyed hair pulled her team
from third to first with an astonishing last leg. The French won in
42.59 seconds.
	   With stunning acceleration in the last 50 meters, Arron flew
past Russia's anchor Irina Privalova, who stared in disbelief as
Arron sprinted past her.
	   Privalova, 100-meter silver medalist and 200 champion, lost her
second place as well when Andrea Philipp of Germany nipped her on
the line. Germany finished in 42.68, while Russia clocked 42.73 for
the bronze.
	   Darren Campbell and Doug Walker also picked up their second
golds when they ran in the winning British team in the men's 4x100
relay. Campbell was the 100-meter champion, Walker the 200 gold
medalist.
	   Julian Golding, bronze medalist in the 200, ran the anchor leg
for Britain, which clocked 38.52 for the gold. France took the
silver in 38.87, while Poland was third in 38.98.
	   There was another gold for Britain when Denise Lewis came from
behind to win the heptathlon with 6,559 points. Urszula Wlodarczyk
of Poland gained the silver at 6,460 and Natalya Sazanovich of
Belarus took the bronze at 6,410.
	   Britain now leads with six golds and 11 overall, while Russia
has five and 17 overall.
	   Isaac Viciosa led a 1-2 Spanish finish in the men's 5,000,
winning in 13:37.46 ahead of Manuel Pancorbo, who clocked 13:38.03.
Mark Carroll of Ireland was third in 13:38.15.
	   Drechsler, a former Olympic and world champion and former world
record holder, was jumping healthy for the first time in three
years, after having surgery on both Achilles tendons.
	   ``It was difficult to come back after a long time away, but
apparently I can still jump OK,'' Drechsler said. ``This was
perhaps my hardest win.''
	   Only two former Soviet athletes had previously won four straight
European titles: Janis Lusis in the men's javelin, 1962-1971, and
Nadezhda Chizhova in the women's shot put, 1966-74.
	   Fiona May of Italy, Olympic silver medalist and bronze medalist
in last year's worlds, took the silver with a jump of 7.11. World
champion Lyudmila Galkina of Russia was third at 7.06.
	   In the men's hurdles, Jackson cruised home without being pushed,
but failed in his declared goal of cracking 13 seconds. His world
record is 12.91.
	   ``I am relieved as I had the pressure on my shoulders. I have
won my third European title in a row, equaling the championship
record, so I have to be content,'' Jackson.
	   Falk Balzer of Germany won the silver in 13.12, while Robin
Korving of the Netherlands took the bronze in 13.20.
	   Maksim Tarasov of Russia cleared 5.81 meters to win the men's
pole vault. Tim Lobinger of Germany was second with the same height
but with more attempts overall, while Jean Galfione of France, the
Olympic champion, had to settle for bronze at 5.76.
	   In the last final of the day, Mihaela Melinte of Romania won the
first European title in the women's hammer, a new event, with a
heave of 71.17 meters. Olga Kuzenkova of Russia was second at
69.28, while Kirsten Munchow of Germany finished third at 65.61.
	   In the morning, Stefano Baldini overcame rainy and windy
conditions to lead an Italian medal sweep in the men's marathon.
	   Baldini, who was running stride for stride with fellow Italian
Danilo Goffi at the 40-kilometer mark, pulled away before entering
the Nep stadium and won in 2 hours 12 minutes 01 second.
	   Goffi was second in 2:12.11, and another Italian, Vincenzo
Modica, took the bronze in 2:12.53. Spanish runners took the next
three places.

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Angolan troops entered the war against
Congolese rebels on Saturday, landing troops in the west of the
country, a rebel leader said.
	   ``Angolan troops have invaded Congo,'' Bizima Karaha said from
the eastern stronghold of Goma.
	   Karaha said he had no details, but warned that the Angolan
involvement will complicate the crisis and the rebel will hit back
at the attackers.
	   Zimbabwe has already deployed troops to help Congo President
Laurent Kabila ward off rebel advances on the capital, Kinshasa.
	   ``We are calling upon the people of Congo to hold the
aggression,'' Karaha said. ``Angolans must come to their senses and
remove forces from Congo immediately.''
	   ``This involvement has put chances for negotiated settlement at
very narrow or almost impossible,'' he said.

Castro casts huge shadow over historic Caribbean summit

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Caribbean nations
signed a trade pact doubling their market Saturday at a summit
marked by growing anger at perceived U.S. neglect _ and the
overnight conversion of Fidel Castro from regional bogeyman to
elder statesman.
	   The summit also signaled the formerly insular Dominican
Republic's effort to become a lynchpin of the Americas through its
Hispanic culture, Caribbean location and ties to the United States,
where over a million Dominicans live.
	   The free trade accord will over six years remove most tariffs
between the Caribbean Community, whose 15 nations have a population
of 6 million people, and the Dominican Republic with 8 million
people.
	   It was timed to coincide with negotiations for a free trade zone
encompassing the entire Western Hemisphere by 2005.
	   The ambitious Dominican president, Leonel Fernandez, has seized
a leading role in the unprecedented Caribbean embrace of Castro _
once an avowed enemy of Fernandez's more conservative predecessors.
	   ``We believe that the development of our region must include
Cuba,'' said St. Lucia Prime Minister Kenny Anthony, who signed the
trade pact with Fernandez on behalf of the Caribbean Community.
	   Castro, largely isolated from his neighbors since seizing power
in Havana in 1959, is ending a triumphant tour three weeks ago that
took him to Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada.
	   His newfound acceptance results in part from Caribbean
frustration with a U.S. policy perceived as lacking leadership,
vision and generosity _ reflected in a 25 percent drop in U.S. aid
over five years, to dlrs 137 million last year.
	   Cuba, meanwhile, has increased its donations to an estimated
dlrs 20 million and handed out hundreds of scholarships at Cuban
universities.
	   A declaration from the leaders Saturday expressed ``deep
disappointment'' that the United States failed to make good on
President Bill Clinton's promises to extend the same preferences
for Caribbean textiles as those enjoyed by Mexico under the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
	   The statement _ a clear challenge to the U.S. embargo of Cuba _
extended a warm hand of friendship to Cuba and underscored ``the
significance of (Castro's) participation at the summit.''
	   It was read out as Castro smiled from the head table.
	   Castro argued that the small island nations of the Caribbean
must oppose the unbridled capitalism he attributes to the United
States.
	   ``The Caribbean confronts the serious danger of a growing
marginalization,'' he said Friday, calling on regional leaders to
promote tourism to boost their economies. ``Unity is the sole and
true strength of the Caribbean.''
	   That struck a deep chord in a region where people fear the
vagaries of a global free market in which their small economies
cannot compete. In particular, Caribbean leaders are outraged at a
successful U.S. legal challenge to trade advantages enjoyed by
their bananas in the European Union.
	   Caribbean leaders also want Washington to drop its embargo of
Cuba, arguing that ``constructive engagement'' with Castro is the
best way to promote human rights.

Russian interior minister to investigate killing of Muslim leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interior minister said Saturday that he
would personally supervise the investigation into the killing of
the Muslim leader in the southern region of Dagestan.
	   Mufti Said-Mohammad Abubakarov died Friday along with his
brother and their driver when their car was blown up by a
radio-controlled bomb after a service at the main mosque in
Makhachkala, the regional capital.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said he would send his deputy
to Makhachkala on Sunday to supervise the investigation there, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The speaker of the Russian parliament, the patriarch of the
Russian Orthodox Church, Russia's chief rabbi and other religious
and political leaders sent telegrams of condolences to the Council
of Russia's Muftis, of which Abubakarov was co-chairman.
	   They called on Russian authorities to ``immediately take
practical measures to solve the crime and punish those who stand
behind this terrorist act.''
	   The council called for a prompt investigation.
	   ``This terrorist act may cause destabilization not only in the
North Caucasus, but in the whole of Russia,'' said sheik Ravil
Gainutdin, mufti of Moscow and Central Europe, who is also
co-chairman of the council.
	   ``Therefore we demand that the leadership of the country and
investigative bodies ensure a prompt, but thorough and serious
investigation,'' he said.
	   The Interfax news agency said Friday that authorities believe
that the Wahhabis, a fundamentalist Islamic sect, could be involved
in the attack.
	   Abubakarov has been a long-time enemy of the Wahhabis. He once
said in an interview that every Muslim who killed a Wahhabi would
go to heaven.
	   Dagestan, which borders secessionist Chechnya, has been restive,
plagued by frequent bombings, kidnappings and other violence as
numerous ethnic and religious groups have fought for power.

Teen-age star signs new 5-year contract with Liverpool
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ One of the most promising stars to
emerge from the World Cup, 18-year-old England striker Michael Owen
pledged himself to Liverpool Saturday by signing a new 5-year
contract.
	   In a move to prevent Europe's richest clubs trying to lure the
talented teen-ager from Anfield, Liverpool arranged for the new
contract to be drawn up even though Owen had signed a 5-year deal
last season.
	   That was before he made such an impact. Owen became the youngest
player this century to be called up for England and then the
youngest to score for his country. He followed that up by scoring
his first World Cup goal and then produced an amazing solo goal
against Argentina.
	   His performances on such a big stage prompted rave reviews all
over the world and Liverpool reportedly said it was prepared to
insure Owen for 60 million pounds (dlrs 100 million) in case the
18-year-old striker's career was halted by injury.
	   ``I had a clause in my last contract which said that I could
re-negotiate when I had played for England in a competitive
international,'' Owen said before Saturday's 0-0 tie with Arsenal.
	   ``I have spoken to the board recently and am pleased to have
extended my contract until 2003.
	   ``As I have said all along, all I want to do is focus on my
football and hopefully help bring more silverware back to
Anfield.''

South Africa takes Tri-Nations rugby championship with 29-15

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Fullback Percy Montgomery
kicked five penalties and two conversions Saturday to give South
Africa a 29-15 victory over Australia and the Tri-Nations rugby
championship.
	   After Wallaby fullback Matt Burke pulled Australia within a
point for the second time 16-15 with a 45-meter penalty in the 51st
minute, Montgomery put South Africa back in control 22-15 with his
final penalty.
	   Replacement flanker Bobby Skinstad then clinched the victory in
the 70th with a try beneath the posts to the delight of the crowd
of 62,308 at Ellis Park.
	   The title was the Boks' first trophy under coach Nick Mallett
and underlined a remarkable rennaissance since he took charge
following last year's 55-35 loss to New Zealand, the country's
worst test defeat.
	   Australia finished second with a 2-0-2 record in the Southern
Hemisphere championship. New Zealand lost all four games and
finished third.
	   Montgomery and Burke traded penalties in the second and fourth
minutes before South Africa took the lead for good in the seventh
on a try by	   Tighthead prop Adrian Garvey.
	   Skipper Gary Teichmann had taken a line-out and the Boks mauled
their way through. Garvey finished off a move which he was set up
by coming up in support after a great break from left wing Pieter
Rossouw.
	   Montgomery's conversion put the Springboks ahead by seven, but
another of Burke's penalties kept it close.
	   South Africa wasted a pair of opportunities to increase its
lead, running two penalties while on the attack before Montgomery
took advantage of a third to make it 13-6.
	   Burke landed two more penalties to pull the Wallabies within a
point, but after Australia strayed offside on the half-way line,
Montgomery landed a 50-meter strike to give the Boks a 16-12
halftime lead.
	   The Tri-Nations championship comes on the heels of a record
96-13 win over Wales and comprehensive victories over England and
Ireland earlier in the season.

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Angolan troops entered the war against
Congolese rebels on Saturday, landing troops in the west of the
country, a rebel leader said.
	   ``Angolan troops have invaded Congo,'' Bizima Karaha said from
the eastern stronghold of Goma.
	   Karaha said he had no details, but warned that the Angolan
involvement will complicate the crisis and that the rebels will
strike back.
	   Zimbabwe has already deployed troops to help Congo President
Laurent Kabila ward off rebel advances on the capital, Kinshasa.
	   ``Angolans must come to their senses and remove forces from
Congo immediately,'' he said. ``This involvement has put chances
for negotiated settlement at very narrow or almost impossible.''
	   Karaha, Kabila's foreign minister until his recent defection,
said earlier Saturday from the rebel stronghold of Goma that the
rebels had downed two Zimbabwean planes over rebel territory in
Congo's southwest. The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   The rebels accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, tribalism and
mismanagement of his vast African nation since he toppled Mobutu
Sese Seko 15 months ago.
	   The rebels said they were within 30 kilometers (18 miles) of
Kinshasa, but did not specify where they had shot down the jets.
	   South Africa, meanwhile, scrambled to salvage a crumbling
regional peace summit it was hosting in Pretoria.
	   Two key players snubbed the talks _ Zimbabwe's President Robert
Mugabe and Kabila, who sent out reinforcements to defend the
Congolese capital. The leaders of Uganda and Rwanda were in
Pretoria.
	   The rebels themselves are said to have the backing of
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has threatened to join the rebel side if other foreign forces do
not withdraw.
	   Earlier Saturday, witnesses in Angola's enclave of Cabinda,
which borders southwestern Congo, said Angolan troops and military
equipment were moving toward the border. Cabinda governor Amaru
Tati reportedly said that defensive border measures were being
taken, but did not elaborate.
	   Congolese Information Minister Didier Mumengi denied that
Angolan troops had arrived, and said when they do it would be
announced.
	   ``When Angola sends its troops that will be a big day, as was
the case with Zimbabwe,'' Mumengi said on state-controlled
television.

Vatican says some of de Mello's books incompatible with faith
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ With the approval of Pope John Paul II, a
Vatican commission on Saturday denounced some writings by Anthony
de Mello, a widely-selling Jesuit author, as incompatible with
Roman Catholic faith.
	   In the latest move by Vatican's watchdogs to crack down on
doctrinal unorthodoxy, the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith
concluded that while some early books by the Indian-born priest,
who died in 1987, contained ``valid elements of oriental wisdom,''
there were many ``dangers'' in his body of work.
	   ``Already in certain passages in these early works and to a
greater degree in his later publications, one notices a progressive
distancing from the essential contents of the Christian faith,''
the congregation said.
	   For the author, the congregation said, ``religions, including
Christianity, are one of the major obstacles to the discovery of
truth'' and ``there are no objective rules of morality.''
	   Besides warning Catholics about the ``dangers'' in the texts,
the congregation's conclusions also put Catholic bookstores are
guard.
	   Since many works are ``collections of short tales which are
often quite clever, the underlying ideas can easily pass
unnoticed,'' the congregation said, concluding that ``the
above-mentioned positions are incompatibile with the Catholic faith
and can cause grave harm.''
	   De Mello's books have been best-sellers in many parts of the
world, including in Italy, where the first Italian translation
appeared in 1986. Characterized by some as ``New Age,'' his writing
enjoyed even greater popularity after his death at age 55.
	   Among the works cited by the congregation containing ideas which
could be incompatible with faith were ``The Prayer of the Frog,''
``Call To Love,'' ``One Minute Wisdom,'' ``One Minute Nonsense,''
``Awareness,'' ``Wellsprings: A Book of Spiritual Exercises,''
``The Song of the Bird,'' ``Walking on Water.''
	   If de Mello were alive, he would have had a chance to defend his
works before the congregation under recently-revised Vatican rules.
	   No spokesman was available Saturday evening at Jesuit
headquarters in Rome for comment on the warnings.
	   In de Mello's defense, the congregation noted that not all the
translations and texts of his works were authorized by him for
publication, and some were published after his death.
	   And it praised the ``positive features'' in his writings,
including, ``elements of eastern wisdom which can be helpful in
achieving self-control, in breaking the attachments and affetions
that keeps us from being truly free, in avoiding selfishness....''
	   Earlier this year, the Vatican reinstated a controversial Sri
Lankan Catholic priest-author who was excommunicated for heresy a
year ago after a ruling by the congregation.
	   The Rev. Tissa Balasuriya had been excommunicated for allegedly
challenging papal authority and the church teaching on baptism,
original sin and the virginity of Mary.

Basque separatist youths attack police in Bilbao, 17 injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ A gang of hooded youths who support Basque
separatism pelted police with Molotov cocktails and other
projectiles at a street fair in Bilbao, leaving 17 people injured,
authorities said Saturday.
	   Two of the injured were in serious condition.
	   The 30-minute melee occurred outside the town hall as an
estimated 100 youths set upon members of the Basque regional
government's police force.
	   Police reported two arrests _ a 19-year-old boy and a
16-year-old girl. The latter was one of the two people seriously
injured, suffering burns when an incendiary device went off in her
hands. The girl was placed under arrest after she was hospitalized.
	   The other serious injury was a middle-aged man who was attacked
for yelling at the youths who assaulted police.
	   Overall, 17 people were injured, including five policemen,
Europa Press reported.
	   Similar violence rocked another Basque town, Getxo, last
Saturday as youths with Molotov cocktails burned down a three-story
apartment building. Its residents were evacuated in time and no
injuries were reported.
	   After that incident, Herri Batasuna, the political party linked
to the armed separatist group ETA, said for the first time that the
party opposed street violence as a way to further the Basque
separatist cause.

Moeller and Haessler latest to quit German national team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DORTMUND, Germany (AP) _ Andreas Moeller and Thomas Haessler
Saturday became the latest players to join the exodus from
Germany's national team following its early exit at the World Cup.
	   The two Borussia Dortmund midfielders, longtime mainstays of the
national team, announced their retirement but both left the door
open for a return.
	   Eight players have now quit since three-time World Cup champion
Germany was upset in the quarterfinals at France by Croatia,
sparking fierce criticism by the media and public against the team.
	   Two of them, Dortmund's Stefan Reuter and Schalke libero Olaf
Thon said they refused to play as long as Berti Vogts remained
coach.
	   Both Haessler and Moeller had spoken to Vogts before making
their decision public.
	   ``Right now I need some distance,'' said Moeller, who has 82
caps and was stung by being banished to the bench by Vogts in
France after a poor performance against Yugoslavia in an early
match.
	   ``If I acted emotionally, I would just throw it away. But I love
playing for Germany too much and love wearing the national
uniform,'' added Moeller, 30, one of Germany's biggest talents but
a consistent underachiever at major tournaments.
	   Vogts, under fire for guiding Germany to its second straight
early World Cup exit, has promised to rebuild the oldest team in
France with an infusion of young players.
	   ``My name is never on any of these lists, so I can't be that
important,'' said Haessler, 33, with 97 caps, who said he could
only be coaxed back onto the team in an emergency.
	   Team captain Juergen Klinsmann, Andreas Koepke, Juergen Kohler
and Lothar Matthaeus have quit because they are at or near the end
of their careers.
	   The eight were among a generation of German players that
captured the 1990 World Cup and the 1996 European championship.
	   Vogts will name his roster for a Sept. 2 friendly against Malta
Monday, a list expected to include several foreign-born players
with a German passport like Brazilian Paulo Rink, who plays with
Bayer Leverkusen.
	   The hope is these players will provide a remedy for the dearth
of ball-handling skills the Germans displayed at the World Cup.

	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Bonnie strengthened into the Atlantic
season's first hurricane Saturday and headed toward sparsely
populated Bahamian islands, on a route that could threaten the
southeastern United States.
	   Another storm was gaining strength in the Pacific Ocean.
	   ``It's definitely going to happen. The southeastern portion (of
the Bahamas) is going to be hit today,'' meteorologist Dave Chorney
said from the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   On Crooked Island, fuel distributor Daisy Scavella said the sun
was shining as residents battened down windows.
	   ``I guess we're going to have a good blow,'' she said. People on
the low-lying islands were most concerned about flooding.
	   Bahamian radio warned the islands' fishing fleet and yachters to
make for safe port. The islands' meteorological department said
Bonnie would hit landfall in the southeast later Saturday and pass
by Long Island, Eleuthera and the Abacos over the next 48 to 72
hours.
	   The small islands would have little effect on Hurricane Bonnie,
which is expected to gather strength Saturday. A storm surge of 3
to 7 feet (a meter to two meters) could occur in the warned area,
forecasters said.
	   ``People along the southeastern U.S. should pay attention to its
progress,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of National Hurricane
Center.
	   He said winds could reach 100 mph (160 kph) by Monday. Chorney
said the worst thunderstorms were on the northern side of Bonnie,
in the open Atlantic.
	   Bonnie was about 115 miles (185 kilometers) north-northeast of
Turk Island at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) with sustained winds of 85 mph
(137 kmh) and higher gusts. Once a fast moving storm, Bonnie
stalled Saturday. It was expected to move west-northwest near 15
mph (25 kmh) with a motion expected to continue through most of
Sunday.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Police and secret service agents arrested
Friday night ten foreigners, including some Arab citizens, after
raiding several houses believed to have served as bases for
terrorist suspects, informed sources reported Saturday.
	   ``All of them were sleeping in one room when police broke in and
searched the apartment where they found bulletproof vests, fake
passports, maps, radio transmitters, electronic devices'' and other
material, said a police source who took part in the operation,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The same source said the ten were Arab citizens, but another
source told The Associated Press later that those arrested also
included citizens from non-Arab countries.
	   The state news agency ATA also reported that ten foreign
citizens had been detained, but it did not give their nationalities
or other details.
	   By Saturday evening, police seemed everywhere in Tirana, the
Albanian capital. Police cars and vans, many of them driving at low
speed, were moving in the pot-holed streets in unusually large
numbers. There was no official explanation for the large turnout.

	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Bonnie strengthened into the Atlantic
season's first hurricane Saturday, a 300-mile-long
(480-kilometer-long) storm dwarfing sparsely populated Bahamian
islands on its route, that could threaten the southeastern United
States.
	   Another hurricane gained strength in the Pacific Ocean but was
expected to peter out over open seas.
	   ``It's definitely going to happen. The southeastern portion (of
the Bahamas) is going to be hit today,'' meteorologist Dave Chorney
said from the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   Bonnie nearly stalled Saturday about 115 miles (185 kilometers)
north-northeast of the British Turk island, drenching it and the
nearby Bahamian island of Mayaguana with heavy rains carried by
gusty winds, residents said.
	   On Crooked Island, fuel distributor Daisy Scavella said the sun
was shining Saturday morning as residents battened down windows.
	   ``I guess we're going to have a good blow,'' she said. People on
the low-lying islands were most concerned about flooding. Bahamian
forecaster Basil Dean said the islands already were experiencing
higher-than-usual tides that Bonnie's storm surges could rise
another 3 to 7 feet (a meter to two meters).
	   Bahamian radio warned the islands' fishing fleet and yachters to
make for safe port. The Bahamas Air-Sea Rescue Association said
some U.S. yachters had turned back to Florida.
	   The islands' meteorological department said Bonnie would hit
landfall in the southeast later Saturday and pass by Long Island,
Eleuthera and the Abacos on Sunday and Monday.
	   ``People along the southeastern U.S. should pay attention to its
progress,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of National Hurricane
Center.
	   He said Bonnie was packing sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph)
that could reach 100 mph (160 kph) by Monday and eventually upgrade
to a Category 3 storm with winds more than 111 mph (178 kph)
capable of causing extensive damage. Chorney noted that the worst
thunderstorms were on the northern side of the system, in the open
Atlantic.
	   Bonnie was expected to resume its north-northwest tack and move
at 10-15 mph (16-24 kph) on Sunday, the hurricane center said.
	   The Bahamian government Saturday posted a hurricane watch for
the northwest islands and hurricane warnings covered the British
Turks and Caicos islands and the southeastern and central Bahamas.
	   ``Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to
completion,'' the hurricane center urged.
	   North Florida is the most likely target to be hit if the storm
reaches the mainland. Still, the storm could veer out to sea and
miss the U.S. coast entirely, Jarrell said.
	   Meanwhile, another weather system that threatened parts of Texas
lost power Saturday.
	   All warnings were discontinued when Tropical Storm Charley
weakened to a depression, though the hurricane center warned small
vessels to remain in port along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico
until winds and waves that reached 10 feet (3 meters) subside.
	   The threat of heavy rains and a storm forced the evacuation of
thousands of people from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   As it moved into Texas, Matagorda Island was hit the hardest
with 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain and 70 mph (110 kph) wind
gusts early Saturday.
	   Also Friday, a storm in the Pacific Ocean reached hurricane
strength but remained far off the Mexican coast.
	   Hurricane Howard intensified Saturday, with winds of 110 mph
(176 kph). The hurricane center said it was expected to become
stronger before dissipating in the Pacific later Sunday.
	   Authorities closed the Acapulco port and warned ships to be
cautious of high waves along the southwestern Mexican coast.
	   The Atlantic Basin typically has nine tropical storms each year
with six of them becoming hurricanes, two of them intense. In 1997,
there were seven named storms, three hurricanes and one intense
hurricane.

Seles downs Hingis in du Maurier semifinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Monica Seles of the United States upset
top-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2
semifinal victory Saturday at the dlrs 1.3 million du Maurier Open
women's tennis championship.
	   Hingis, 17, did not lose a service game until Seles, 24, broke
for a 5-3 lead in the second set in the one hour 32 minute match on
the hard court at Montreal's Jarry Stadium.
	   Seles' service games were laborious, hitting on few first serves
early in the match, but she turned that around, breaking for a 2-1
lead and again for 4-1 in the third set.
	   ``I really started to play well as the match went on,'' Seles
said. ``I actually think she was lucky to win the first set ...
Everything just went well for me today.''
	   Seles, the fifth seed, has won the last three du Maurier
tournaments.
	   The second semifinal later Saturday had second-seeded Jana
Novotna of the Czech Republic facing third-seeded Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario of Spain.

Arab League to convene emergency meeting on US strike in Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League will convene an emergency
meeting Monday to discuss the U.S. missile attack against Sudan,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency said Saturday.
	   The meeting is to ``support Sudan in this crisis,'' and has been
called at the request of the Khartoum government, the assistant
secretary-general of the League, Ahmed Ben Hulei, told the official
news agency.
	   U.S. missiles devastated a factory in north Khartoum on
Thursday, killing one person and wounding nine others. Washington
said the factory produced the ingredients of chemical weapons, but
Khartoum said it manufactured only pharmaceutical products.
	   The 22-member League's permanent representatives will meet at
the organization's headquarters in Cairo.
	   Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir cast doubt on the significance
of the meeting Saturday.
	   In an interview with Qatar's Al-Jazeera television, el-Bashir
said ``we don't expect much from the Arab League, which in the past
took stances that cannot be described as positive towards many Arab
causes.''
	   The Arab League condemned the U.S action on Friday, calling it a
``Rambo'' strike in reference to the macho-man film of that name.
	   ``American Rambo tactics will not solve the problem of
international terrorism, and will not put an end to the reasons
behind the violence,'' the deputy secretary-general of the League,
Mohammed Zakariya Ismail, told reporters in Cairo.
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Saturday that action
against terrorism should be ``within the framework of international
legitimacy ... and under the auspices of the United Nations.''
	   The minister spoke to reporters after meeting Sudan's ambassador
to Egypt.

Sorenstam leads Alfredsson by two strokes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MALMO, Sweden (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam shot her second straight
71 Saturday and took a two-stroke lead over Helen Alfredsson,
another Swedish star on the LPGA Tour, after three rounds of the
Compaq Open.
	   Sorenstam had a 4-under-par 212 going into Sunday's final round.
	   ``But a two-stroke lead is nothing in this wind,'' said
Sorenstam, a two-time former U.S. Open champion ranked No. 1 in the
world. ``Anything can happen, already on the first hole. Helen is a
tough competitor. If she gets a good start, she's difficult to
beat.''
	   Alfredsson, who won the 1993 Dinah Shore for her only major
victory, had a 70 Saturday and was one shot ahead of Johanna Head
of Britain.
	   Laura Davies, the big-hitting British star who is looking for a
Swedish double after winning the Chrysler Open in Goteborg a month
ago, also had a second straight 71 and was alone at 216.
	   Kelly Robbins, the top American in the tournament, slipped to a
77 and shared seventh at 219. She broke the course record with a 67
Saturday.
	   Karrie Webb of Australia shot a 73 for a 220 total. Two former
U.S. Open champions, Alison Nicholas of Britain and Liselotte
Neumann of Sweden, also struggled. Nicholas had a 75-223, Neumann
74-224.

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Silence fell upon this
bomb-shattered town and across Ireland on Saturday in memory of 28
people slain by IRA dissidents, as another band of anti-British
outlaws responded to the atrocity by announcing their own
cease-fire.
	   More than 20,000 Protestants and Catholics packed the center of
Omagh to remember, through their sobs and tears, the dead and the
more than 330 wounded by the Aug. 15 car bomb.
	   Hundreds of thousands more marked the slaughter _ the worst in
three decades of violence in Northern Ireland _ with one minute's
silence in town squares, churches, sports stadiums and shopping
centers across Ireland.
	   The Irish Republican Army dissidents responsible for the bomb
have already formally ``suspended'' their violent campaign.
	   Late Saturday, police said they had released without charge two
men arrested Monday on suspicion of involvement in committing the
Omagh attack. Three others arrested Monday had already been freed.

Factory owner's lawyer says no links to bin Laden, no weapons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sudan-War at Home
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A pharmaceutical plant destroyed by U.S.
missiles produced only drugs and its owner never met Osama bin
Laden, the Muslim militant America blames for the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in Africa, the owner's lawyer said Saturday.
	   Washington attacked the north Khartoum plant Thursday, saying it
was making precursors for chemical weapons that might be used by
bin Laden.
	   ``I think the Americans are under bad information and they are
not well briefed,'' said Ghazi Suleiman, a lawyer for Salah Idris,
the factory's Sudanese owner.
	   ``I think it would have been prudent before destroying the plant
to come and investigate the site.''
	   Idris purchased El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. in March
1998 from another Sudanese businessman, Bashir Hassan Bashir, and
Baboud Marine and Trade Corp., a business based in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, Suleiman said. He did not know the price.
	   The plant, which employed 300 people, mainly manufactured
antibiotics, Suleiman said. It produced 60 percent of Sudan's
pharmaceutical drugs and exported as well.
	   Suleiman is a leading Sudanese opposition figure who spent 25
days in prison earlier this year. Idris, he said, has no political
affiliation and never met bin Laden or spoke of him.
	   ``They are different characters. Mr. Idris has no interest in
politics. He is a businessman,'' Suleiman said.
	   Idris was in London when the attack occurred, he said.
	   The government has denied the plant was producing material for
chemical weapons. It has said its products were antibiotics and
drugs to treat malaria and tuberculosis.
	   The missile attack demolished the site, leaving mounds of red
brick and twisted sheet metal. One person was killed and nine were
wounded in the attack.
	   The government has allowed people to visit the site and has
taken foreign diplomats around it.
	   Suleiman said Idris may seek dlrs 50 million in compensation
from the United States, but has yet to take any steps.

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels battling to topple President Laurent
Kabila on Saturday accused Angola of entering the fray in Congo's
escalating war, which already includes forces from Zimbabwe and
threatens to engulf other African states.
	   Angolan troops landed in the west of this vast central African
country in support of Kabila's loyalist forces, a rebel leader said
without giving details.
	   ``Angolan troops have invaded Congo,'' Bizima Karaha said from
the rebel's stronghold of Goma in eastern Congo.
	   Karaha warned that the Angolan involvement will complicate the
spiralling crisis and the rebels will strike back. Zimbabwe had
earlier deployed troops to help Kabila ward off rebel advances on
the capital of Kinshasa.
	   ``Angolans must come to their senses and remove forces from
Congo immediately,'' he said. ``This involvement has put chances
for negotiated settlement at very narrow or almost impossible.''
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi denied that Angola had
deployed troops to Congo, but hinted that they would be sent before
long.
	   ``Certain African countries have offered their solidarity. They
have done this in a clear manner in full view of everyone,''
Mumengi told The Associated Press. ``As soon as Angola sends their
troops it will be done openly.''
	   Namibia and Zambia earlier in the week announced their support
for Congo's embattled president, but did not specify how, or if,
they would contribute to the war. There were unconfirmed reports of
two plane loads of weapons arriving in Kinshasa from Namibia last
week.
	   Two neighbors on Congo's eastern border, Rwanda and Uganda, are
said to have forces in Congo and Kabila has accused them of
masterminding the rebellion. Both countries deny the charge, but
warn of future intervention to protect their own territories.
	   Rwanda and Uganda played key roles in Kabila's rise to power in
a rebellion over longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko 15 months ago
but have since fallen out with the Congolese president, who they
accuse of allowing ethnic Hutu attacks on their countries from
covert bases in eastern Congo.
	   Karaha, who was Congo's foreign minister until his recent
defection, said earlier Saturday that the rebels had shot down two
Zimbabwean planes over rebel territory in Congo's southwest. The
report could not be independently confirmed.
	   There was no immediate comment on the downed aircraft from
Kinshasa, but a former military intelligence officer with close
government ties said Kabila's army had recently acquired fighters
being flown by either Cuban or Angolan pilots.
	   ``We know that the government does have air support
capabilities,'' the officer said on condition of anonymity.
	   A Zimbabwean spokesman denied Zimbabwe's Chinese-built MiG-21
fighters had been deployed to Congo, but did not specify whether
the country's other warplanes were there.
	   The rebels accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, tribalism and
mismanagement of his vast African nation since he toppled Mobutu.
	   The rebels said they were within 30 kilometers (18 miles) of
Kinshasa, but did not specify where they had shot down the jets.
	   South Africa, meanwhile, scrambled to salvage a crumbling
regional peace summit it was hosting in Pretoria.
	   Two key players snubbed the talks _ Zimbabwe's President Robert
Mugabe and Kabila, who sent out reinforcements to defend the
Congolese capital. The leaders of Uganda and Rwanda were in
Pretoria.
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has threatened to join the
rebel side if other foreign forces do not withdraw.
	   Earlier Saturday, witnesses in Angola's enclave of Cabinda,
which borders southwestern Congo, said Angolan troops and military
equipment were moving toward the border. Cabinda governor Amaru
Tati reportedly said that defensive border measures were being
taken, but did not elaborate.
	   Mumengi said when Angolan troops had arrived, it would be
announced.
	   ``When Angola sends its troops that will be a big day, as was
the case with Zimbabwe,'' Mumengi said on state-controlled
television.
	   EDITOR'S NOTE: Associated Press reporter Ian Stewart contributed
to this story from Congo's capital of Kinshasa.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Fullback Percy Montgomery
kicked two of his five penalties to break open a one-point match
and led South Africa to the Tri-Nations rugby championship with a
29-15 victory over Australia on Saturday.
	   The victory capped a remarkable rennaissance for the Springboks,
the reigning World Cup champion which last year and earlier this
year had slid to its worst test defeat and gotten mired in a
organizational political mess.
	   ``I can honestly say on this day, 22 August 1998, South Africa
is the best team in the word,'' coach Nick Mallett's said. ``I'm
very proud to be a part of it.''
	   After Wallaby fullback Matt Burke pulled Australia within a
point for the second time 16-15 with a 45-meter penalty in the 51st
minute, Montgomery put South Africa back in control 22-15 with his
two final penalties.
	   Replacement flanker Bobby Skinstad then clinched the victory in
the 70th with a try beneath the posts to the delight of the crowd
of 62,308 at Ellis Park.
	   The title was the Boks' first trophy under Mallett and
dramatized the resurgence of the team since he took charge
following last year's 55-35 loss to New Zealand, the country's
worst test defeat.
	   ``I think this side is better than the World Cup side,''
Springbok scrumhalf Joost Van der Westhuizen said. ``This is the
best ever South African team in which I've played, in terms of
spirit and confidence. We're one big family.
	   ``For myself, other than the World Cup victory, this was my best
win.''
	   Australia finished second with a 2-0-2 record in the Southern
Hemisphere championship. New Zealand lost all four games and
finished third.
	   ``They were physically stronger at the breakdown and that didn't
allow us to get continuity,'' Australian coach Rod Macqueen said.
	   Montgomery and Burke traded penalties in the second and fourth
minutes before South Africa took the lead for good in the seventh
on a try by Tighthead prop Adrian Garvey.
	   Skipper Gary Teichmann had taken a line-out and the Boks mauled
their way through. Garvey finished off a move which he was set up
by coming up in support after a great break from left wing Pieter
Rossouw.
	   Montgomery's conversion put the Springboks ahead by seven, but
another of Burke's penalties kept it close.
	   South Africa wasted a pair of opportunities to increase its
lead, running two penalties while on the attack before Montgomery
took advantage of a third to make it 13-6.
	   Burke landed two more penalties to pull the Wallabies within a
point, but after Australia strayed offside on the half-way line,
Montgomery landed a 50-meter strike to give the Boks a 16-12
halftime lead.
	   The Tri-Nations championship comes on the heels of a record
96-13 win over Wales and comprehensive victories over England and
Ireland earlier in the season.

Saturday's first semifinal. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Monica Seles of the United States upset
top-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2
semifinal victory Saturday at the dlrs 1.3 million du Maurier Open
women's tennis championship.
	   Hingis, 17, did not lose a service game until Seles, 24, broke
for a 5-3 lead in the second set in the one hour 32 minute match on
the hard court at Montreal's Jarry Stadium.
	   Seles' service games were laborious, hitting on few first serves
early in the match, but she turned that around, breaking for a 2-1
lead and again for 4-1 in the third set.
	   ``I really started to play well as the match went on,'' Seles
said. ``I actually think she was lucky to win the first set ...
Everything just went well for me today.''
	   Seles, the fifth seed, has won the last three du Maurier
tournaments.
	   The second semifinal later Saturday had second-seeded Jana
Novotna of the Czech Republic facing third-seeded Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario of Spain.

 &UR; Eds: ADDS troops killing alleged Israeli collaborator final grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli forces shelled suspected guerrilla
hideouts and villages in southern Lebanon on Saturday, wounding a
Lebanese civilian, Lebanese security officials said.
	   A villager, Samir Hammoud, was lightly injured by shrapnel from
a shell that exploded near his house in Arab Salim, a village just
outside the Israeli-occupied zone, the officials said.
	   Hammoud, who was admitted to a hospital in the port city of
Sidon, was the second civilian to be wounded by Israeli shells in
two days.
	   A seventy-year-old Lebanese man was wounded Friday when Israeli
artillery retaliated for a guerrilla ambush that killed two Israeli
soldiers.
	   Saturday's shelling appeared to be in retaliation for guerrilla
attacks hours earlier on Israeli positions in the occupation zone.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, said its fighters
attacked positions of the Israeli army and its allied South Lebanon
Army at Sojod and Bir Kallab in the zone.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties.
	   Hezbollah is the main guerrilla group fighting to dislodge
Israeli troops and their SLA allies from southern Lebanon. Israel
set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern territory from
cross-border attacks.
	   Separately, Lebanese troops shot dead Saturday a man wanted for
collaboration with Israel, a security official said.
	   Ayyoub Malak, who was also wanted for smuggling goods from the
occupied zone to the rest of Lebanon, was killed in a shootout in
central Lebanon as troops tried to arrest him, the official said.
Two soldiers were lightly wounded.

Olympiakos beats Apollon at the season's start
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Serbian striker Ilja Ivic scored twice
Saturday as defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus trounced Apollon
Athens 5-2 in a game which signaled the kickoff of the Greek first
division soccer league season.
	   A total of four games involving teams participating in European
tournaments on next week, were played Saturday. The other five
matches of the first round will be played Sunday.
	   Olympiakos and Panathinaikos Athens play in the Champions League
Wednesday, and PAOK Salonica and AEK Athens in the UEFA cup
Tuesday.
	   Olympiakos dominated the first half of the game scoring four
goals and losing at least five other scoring chances. The hosts, on
the other hand, had only one shot against the visitors' goalmouth
during this period.
	   The second period saw Apollon becoming more aggressive scoring
both goals in three minutes
	   The defending champions led with Serbian midfielder Predrag
Djordjevic off a free kick from Grigoris Georgatos in the 16th
minute and Ghanaian Peter Oforiquaye made it 2-0 in the 30th.
	   Two consecutive goals by Ivic in the last four minutes of the
half, increased the score to 4-0. Vassilis Karapialis scored
Olympiakos's fifth goal in the 75th.
	   Camerounian striker Nicolas Dikoume in the 56th and Antonis
Damigos in the 59th minutes were the scorers for the hosts.
	   Serbian defender Vladan Milojevic converted a penalty kick
seconds before the end of a game, to give Panathinaikos a 2-1
victory over Paniliakos Pyrgos.
	   Playing at the Athens Olympic stadium, Panathinaikos was jeered
by its fans, when Paniliakos in its second attack against
Panathinaikos' goalmouth, took the lead with Giannis Tatsis in the
27th minute.
	   Norwegian midfielder Frank Strandli levelled off a cross from
Polish striker Krzysztof Warzycha in the 75th.
	   Panathinaikos launched one attack after the other for a second
goal, but the Paniliakos defense resisted everything until the 45th
when Milojevic scored the winner.

Charles Brewer stops Byrd to defend IBF title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Charles Brewer of the United States
stopped another American, Antoine Byrd, in the third round Saturday
with a flurry of punches to defend his IBF supermiddleweight title.
	   The hard-punching Brewer, who knocked out South Africa's Gary
Ballard a year ago to gain the belt, battered Byrd with a series of
hooks midway through the round.
	   The referee stopped the fight with 1:11 remaining as Brewer
defended his crown for the third time. His record improved to 32-5
with 22 knockouts.
	   Brewer's next title defense will be against Germany's Sven
Ottke, who outpointed Dutchman William Krijnen over 10 rounds on
the same card.
	   Brewer will fight Ottke, a former two-time European amatuer
champion, on Oct. 24 in Duesseldorf Germany. Ottke ran his record
to 12-0 with an unspectacular win over the Dutchman, who took a
standing count in the 10th round.
	   Byrd lifted the first two rounds of the fight against Brewer
before he started to get tagged. It was the Cleverland, Ohio
fighter's third try at winning the same IBF title.
	   Byrd, 31-8 with 17 knockouts, lost a decision to American
Lindell Holmes in 1991 and three years ago to Roy Jones Jr.

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Goran Ivanisevic shook off an
aching shoulder and continued his dominance over Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, eliminating the defending Pilot Pen champ 6-3, 6-4
Saturday with a dominating service game.
	   Ivanisevic leads the head-to-head series 9-2, and has beaten the
Russian in their last seven matches. His powerful serve, clocked as
high as 131 mph (211 kph) in the tournament, kept him in control
through most of the 1 hour, 5 minute match.
	   The left-hander had a dozen aces to Kafelnikov's four and won 87
percent of his first service points.
	   In the hunt for his first tournament win in the United States,
Ivanisevic will play No. 7 seed Karol Kucera, of Slovakia, in
Sunday's final. Kucera advanced by beating No. 4 seed Richard
Krajicek, 6-7 (8-6), 6-4.
	   The 26-year-old Croat entered the semifinal nursing a sore left
shoulder he said was damaged from a decade of countless serves.
Ivanisevic said fifth-seeded Kafelnikov broke him in the first game
of the match before the pain-killers kicked in.
	   Ivanisevic broke back in the second game.
	   ``It was good that I broke him straight away. I was doing a lot
of running today,'' said Ivanisevic. ``He made me run with his drop
shots. The crowd liked it, but I was tired.''
	   The sore shoulder also dictated that he take a little off his
serves and rely more on his volleys, the part of his game he says
has steadily improved.
	   ``Especially on hard court. I can come in, I can finish with a
volley ... I can stay back,'' Ivanisevic said.
	   Kucera, a three-time singles winner, holds a 2-1 lead over
Ivanisevic in head-to-head meetings, and is ranked No. 13 on the
tour.
	   He broke Krajicek for the match when the hard-serving Dutchman's
return volley just missed the baseline.

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A pharmaceutical plant destroyed by U.S.
missiles produced only drugs and its owner never met Osama bin
Laden, the Muslim militant America blames for the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in Africa, the owner's lawyer said Saturday.
	   Washington attacked the north Khartoum plant Thursday, saying it
was making precursors for chemical weapons that might be used by
bin Laden.
	   ``I think the Americans are under bad information and they are
not well briefed,'' said Ghazi Suleiman, a lawyer for Salah Idris,
the factory's Sudanese owner.
	   ``I think it would have been prudent before destroying the plant
to come and investigate the site.''
	   Idris purchased El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. in March
1998 from another Sudanese businessman, Bashir Hassan Bashir, and
Baboud Marine and Trade Corp., a business based in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, Suleiman said. He did not know the price.
	   The plant, which employed 300 people, mainly manufactured
antibiotics, Suleiman said. It produced 60 percent of Sudan's
pharmaceutical drugs and exported as well.
	   Suleiman is a leading Sudanese opposition figure who spent 25
days in prison earlier this year. Idris, he said, has no political
affiliation and never met bin Laden or spoke of him.
	   ``They are different characters. Mr. Idris has no interest in
politics. He is a businessman,'' Suleiman said.
	   Idris was in London when the attack occurred, he said.
	   Suleiman said Idris may seek dlrs 50 million in compensation
from the United States, but has yet to take any steps.
	   The government has denied the plant was producing material for
chemical weapons. It has said its products were antibiotics and
drugs to treat malaria and tuberculosis.
	   In Amman on Saturday, three Jordanian civil engineers who worked
at the factory from its opening in 1996 to 1997 told reporters that
it could not produce the ingredients of chemical arms.
	   Eid Abou Dalbouh, who said he worked as a manager at the plant,
Ahmed Salem and Mohammed Abdul Wahed said the factory was designed
to produce only medical tablets, capsules and vaccines.
	   The three men addressed a press conference organized by the
Sudanese Embassy in an Amman hotel.
	   The missile attack demolished the factory and killed one person
and wounded nine others.

Americans qualify for World Cup with 21-16 victory over Uruguay

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Andre Plum and Mark Scharremberg
scored tries and some tactical kicks in the final 10 minutes sent
the United States to the Rugby World Cup with a 21-16 victory over
Uruguay on Saturday.
	   The United States became the third team to qualify for the
20-nation finals in September-October 1999 in Britain, Ireland and
France.
	   Argentina and Canada secured their places in the World Cup field
on Tuesday and played later Saturday to determine their final
placing in the Americas qualifying tournament.
	   The three teams from the Americas join host Wales, defending
champion South Africa, 1995 World Cup runner-up New Zealand and
1995 third-place finisher France in the finals.
	   The loss sends Uruguay into March's repechage qualifying
tournament, a seven-team event involving all five geographical
regions from which two teams will qualify.
	   Plum's try in the 13th and penalties by fly half Mark Williams
in the 32nd and first minute of first-half injury time got the U.S.
Eagles out to a 11-6 lead.
	   Scrum half Federico Sierra's penalties in the 21st and fourth
minute of first-half injury time were all Uruguay could muster
despite the advantage of the wind on the grounds of the Buenos
Aires Cricket and Rugby Club.
	   Sierra pulled Uruguay with two points with his his third penalty
goal nine minutes into the second half.
	   But Scharremberg scored a solo try in the 52nd minute and
Williams added the conversion to put the Americans in control.
	   Captain Diego Oramachea salvaged Uruguay's pride by pushing over
a try in the 70th minute, but some well-place kicks in the final 10
minutes kept Uruguay pinned in its half and preserved the U.S.
victory.

Factory owner's lawyer says no links to bin Laden, no weapons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sudan-War at Home
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A pharmaceutical plant destroyed by U.S.
missiles produced only drugs and its owner never met Osama bin
Laden, the Muslim militant America blames for the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in Africa, the owner's lawyer said Saturday.
	   Washington attacked the north Khartoum plant Thursday, saying it
was making precursors for chemical weapons that might be used by
bin Laden.
	   ``I think the Americans are under bad information and they are
not well briefed,'' said Ghazi Suleiman, a lawyer for Salah Idris,
the factory's Sudanese owner.
	   ``I think it would have been prudent before destroying the plant
to come and investigate the site.''
	   Idris purchased El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. in March
1998 from another Sudanese businessman, Bashir Hassan Bashir, and
Baboud Marine and Trade Corp., a business based in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, Suleiman said. He did not know the price.
	   The plant, which employed 300 people, mainly manufactured
antibiotics, Suleiman said. It produced 60 percent of Sudan's
pharmaceutical drugs and exported as well.
	   Suleiman is a leading Sudanese opposition figure who spent 25
days in prison earlier this year. Idris, he said, has no political
affiliation and never met bin Laden or spoke of him.
	   ``They are different characters. Mr. Idris has no interest in
politics. He is a businessman,'' Suleiman said.
	   Idris was in London when the attack occurred, he said.
	   Suleiman said Idris may seek dlrs 50 million in compensation
from the United States, but has yet to take any steps.
	   The government has denied the plant was producing material for
chemical weapons. It has said its products were antibiotics and
drugs to treat malaria and tuberculosis.
	   In Amman on Saturday, three Jordanian civil engineers who worked
at the factory from its opening in 1996 to 1997 told reporters that
it could not produce the ingredients of chemical arms.
	   Eid Abou Dalbouh, who said he worked as a manager at the plant,
Ahmed Salem and Mohammed Abdul Wahed said the factory was designed
to produce only medical tablets, capsules and vaccines.
	   The three men addressed a news conference organized by the
Sudanese Embassy in an Amman hotel.
	   The missile attack demolished the factory and killed one person
and wounded nine others.

Syrian President meets U.S. senator
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel held talks
Saturday with Syrian President Hafez Assad on the stalled Middle
East peace process, a presidential spokesman said.
	   Hagel, who is on the fourth leg of a fact-finding mission to the
Middle East, told reporters afterwards that Israel's recent
decision to build 2,300 homes and 2,500 vacation units in the
occupied Golan Heights, was hindering the process.
	   ``There is no question that is not helpful,'' Hagel said.
	   Israel captured the heights in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967.
Syria has refused to resume peace talks, which broke off in
February 1966, until Israel agrees to a complete return of the
plateau. The Israeli government says the heights are essential to
national security.
	   Earlier Saturday, Hagel met with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa.
	   Hagel, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is
due to travel to Saudi Arabia. He has already visited Israel and
the Palestinian territories, Egypt and Lebanon.

Runner felt Kenyan blast first hand
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos ADT101, ADT102 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHUCK SCHOFFNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMES, Iowa (AP) _ Five minutes can take a runner like David
Lichoro a long way. Heck, Lichoro can cover a mile (1.6 kilometers)
in five minutes without so much as breaking a sweat.
	   On this particular day, though, Lichoro was walking and had gone
only 300 yards (meters) or so in five minutes. It was far enough to
save his life.
	   Minutes after the Kenyan _ a cross country and track distance
runner at Iowa State _ left the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, a
bomb exploded with deadly, devastating force.
	   ``If I had been there a little longer,'' Lichoro said, ``I would
have died.''
	   Many did die and Lichoro knew some of them, including the wife
of a friend.
	   The blast killed 247 and injured thousands. Lichoro escaped with
a few glass cuts on his left hand and lower right leg. He was saved
from further injury by a metal door that was blown off a building
he was walking past and hit him in the back, knocking him to the
sidewalk.
	   He could hear shards of glass raining onto the door as he lay,
scared and confused, on the pavement.
	   ``A guy ahead of me was badly cut,'' Lichoro said Friday. ``When
the building shook, the door fell. It happened in a split second.''
	   Lichoro lives in Meru near Mount Kenya, 200 miles (320
kilometers) north of Nairobi. He and his brother, Emmanuel, had
gone to Nairobi with three friends to help one of the friends
straighten out a visa matter.
	   The friend had noticed his visa didn't look quite the same as
Lichoro's and wanted to clear that up. They checked in at the
embassy, learned there would be no problem and left.
	   Five minutes later by Lichoro's estimate, they heard a muffled
explosion and then a louder one. Then, Lichoro said, ``It was like
hell had broken loose.''
	   People were running everywhere in panic. A massive dust cloud
was blowing overhead, carrying paper and other debris from the
blast site. Lichoro's brother and friends were nowhere in sight.
	   Kenya has endured some political unrest from time to time and
Lichoro's first thought was that something was happening with the
government.
	   So Lichoro pulled himself up and did what he does best _ he ran,
dodging people who were coming at him from the opposite direction.
	   ``I saw blood everywhere,'' he said. ``I've never seen a blood
situation like that.''
	   Lichoro wanted to find his fiancee, who was having her hair done
in a beauty salon. He wasn't sure if he would find his brother or
friends.
	   ``I thought the guys were dead,'' he said.
	   His plan was to get out of the city as quickly as possible. If
something was coming down, he wanted to be far away from Nairobi.
	   ``We wanted to escape to the countryside,'' he said. ``It's more
safe and secure out there.''
	   He checked salons and called places he thought he might find his
fiancee _ all to no avail. Lichoro didn't know it at the time, but
she, along with his brother and friends, were frantically searching
the city for him.
	   Finally, more than six hours later, Lichoro called his fiancee's
home again and found her there. He also eventually met up with his
brother and friends. By that time, they had learned it was a
terrorist attack and not political trouble, but they left anyway
and headed home.
	   In the confusion, Lichoro lost a bag that contained some
clothes, money and running shoes. He wouldn't be doing any more
training in Kenya before he left, but he's not sure he could have
run anyway. Lichoro, who had been running 100 miles (160
kilometers) a week, was still scared and training was the last
thing on his mind.
	   ``I was counting days when I could leave and come over this way
and start my training back again,'' he said.
	   Lichoro was sitting in a quiet conference room at Iowa State's
Jacobson Athletic Building as he recounted his experience _ a far
cry from the Aug. 7 pandemonium that rocked Nairobi. He smiled
constantly, giving his face an almost angelic look, and wore a
T-shirt that proclaimed: ``God Has Been So Good To Me!''
	   He wore that shirt, a gift from his fiancee, the day of the
blast. On the long flight to the United States last weekend,
Lichoro had time to reflect on how close he had come to serious
injury _ or worse.
	   ``To me it's a miracle,'' he said. ``I think God has a plan for
my life. There were so many businesses I was to do at the embassy.
I had left a guy (in line) and was going to back to see him. I had
to reconfirm my flight in a building right next to the embassy.
	   ``Those who died were young men like me,'' he said. ``I was such
a lucky man.''
	   Yet Lichoro remains troubled. Why did the terrorists strike in
Kenya? Why did so many have to die? And for what cause?
	   ``I couldn't dream that such a thing could happen in our
country,'' he said. ``It was wrong for them to use Kenya. Because
so many innocent people died, and they didn't understand the reason
they died.
	   ``We are not familiar with terrorism. These people (in Kenya)
are really fighting to live. We have a lot of economic and social
problems. So things like politics and terrorism doesn't make any
sense to them.''

Marseille stages stunning five-goal comeback to win 5-4
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Marseille scored five goals in a remarkable second
half recovery to beat Montpellier 5-4 Saturday and maintain its
winning start to the season.
	   Bordeaux also won, 1-0 at home to Auxerre, to join Marseille on
nine points after three rounds of the French championship.
	   In one of the most amazing games ever witnessed at the Stade
Velodrome, Marseille came back from 4-0 behind at half time, to win
5-4.
	   Laurent Blanc won the match with a penalty in injury time.
	   Earlier, Montpellier scored four times in front of an angry home
crowd, with young striker Ibrahima Bakayoko netting twice.
	   Marseille, which won its first two games without conceding a
goal, started its recovery with goals by Florian Maurice, his first
since transferring from Paris Saint-Germain, and Fabrizio
Ravenelli.
	   Christophe Dugarry made it 4-3 with a powerful header, before
Ravenelli struck again to level the scores.
	   In the dramatic final seconds, Robert Pires was fouled inside
the penalty area and veteran defender Blanc kept his cool to give
Marseille a famous victory.
	   Bordeaux has also won its first three games, after a 1-0 home
victory against Auxerre.
	   It collected three points thanks to a fourth-minute close range
volley by Sylvain Wiltord, his fourth goal of the season.
	   Bordeaux dominated the match, and Johan Micaud came close to
doubling the lead with a late header that just cleared the
crossbar.
	   Late in the match Bernard Diomede had a chance to equalize, but
put a left-footed shot just wide.
	   Monaco, the other team that had won its first two games, drew
0-0 at Toulouse in a lifeless match.
	   PSG won 1-0 at struggling Strasbourg.
	   After Bernard Lama made a fine early save from a Frederic
Arpinon header, PSG began to dominate.
	   It scored the winner in the 64th minute.
	   Strasbourg midfielder Corentin Martins misplaced a pass, and PSG
worked the ball to Patrice Loko, who crossed for Marco Simone to
score.
	   The defeat means that Strasbourg has yet to score this season.
	   Rennes came from behind to win 2-1 at home to Le Havre, its
second victory of the season.
	   Miladin Becanovic opened the scoring with a 21st minute penalty.
	   But Rennes grabbed maximum points with second half strikes from
Shabani Nonda and a Ludovic Pollet own goal.
	   In other matches, Lyon, which beat Toulouse 6-1 last week, won
at minnow Lorient with a 58th minue goal by Marco Grassi.
	   Bastia thumped last season's runner-up Metz 3-0.

Clark, Bolton shine as Australia takes control
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WORCESTER, England (AP) _ Two century stands put Australia in
control of the third cricket Ashes test Saturday, the visitor
reaching 279 for one in reply to England's modest 243 all out with
two days to go.
	   Belinda Clark and Lisa Keightley put on 127 for the first
wicket, and Clark and Karen Rolton compiled 152 for the second.
	   Clark scored her second test century from 160 balls with 10
boundaries and at stumps she had moved through to her best at this
level _ 128 not out.
	   Rolton, who was dropped on five and 77, was not out 88 at the
close.
	   The first two tests were drawn and the Australians now are in a
strong position to take the series.

Charles Brewer stops Byrd to defend IBF title

 &UR; EDS: ADDS Axel Schulz outpointing Richard Mason &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Charles Brewer of the United States
stopped another American, Antoine Byrd, in the third round Saturday
with a flurry of punches to defend his IBF supermiddleweight title.
	   The hard-punching Brewer, who knocked out South Africa's Gary
Ballard a year ago to gain the belt, battered Byrd with a series of
hooks midway through the round.
	   The referee stopped the fight with 1:11 remaining as Brewer
defended his crown for the third time. His record improved to 32-5
with 22 knockouts.
	   Germany's Axel Schulz, on the comeback trail after losing three
world heavyweight title fights, also claimed a unanimious 10-round
decision over journeyman American Richard Mason on the same card.
	   Schulz, now 26-5, dominated but was knocked to the canvas in the
sixth round against Mason, a last-minute replacement for Britain's
Scott Welch.
	   The planned Schulz-Welch fight was for the vacant European
heavyweight title.
	   Byrd lifted the first two rounds of the fight against Brewer
before he started to get tagged. It was the Cleverland, Ohio
fighter's third try at winning the same IBF title.
	   Byrd, 31-7-1 with 17 knockouts, lost a decision to American
Lindell Holmes in 1991 and three years ago to Roy Jones Jr.
	   Brewer's next title defense will be against Germany's Sven
Ottke, who outpointed Dutchman William Krijnen over 10 rounds on
the card.
	   Brewer will fight Ottke, a former two-time European amatuer
champion, on Oct. 24 in Duesseldorf Germany. Ottke ran his record
to 12-0 with an unspectacular win over the Dutchman, who took a
standing count in the 10th round.

Bonnie becomes hurricane; Bahamians in southeast batten down

	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Bonnie strengthened into the Atlantic
season's first hurricane Saturday, a 300-mile (482-kilometer) -long
storm that dwarfed sparsely populated Bahamian islands on its
route, which could threaten the southeastern United States.
	   ``It's definitely going to happen. The southeastern portion (of
the Bahamas) is going to be hit,'' meteorologist Dave Chorney said
from the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   Bonnie nearly stalled Saturday about 115 miles (185 kilometers)
north-northeast of the British Turk island, drenching it and the
nearby Bahamian island of Mayaguana with heavy rains carried by
gusty winds, residents said.
	   Bonnie was expected to resume its north-northwest tack and move
at 15 mph (24 kph) mph on Sunday, the hurricane center said. At 5
p.m., (2100 GMT) the hurricane was located 23.3 north latitude and
71.0 west longitude, about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northwest of
San Salvador, Bahamas.
	   Bahamian radio warned the islands' fishing fleet and yachters to
make for safe port. The Bahamas Air-Sea Rescue Association said
some U.S. yachters had turned back to Florida.
	   The islands' meteorological department said Bonnie would hit
landfall in the southeast late Saturday and pass by Long Island,
Eleuthera and the Abacos on Sunday and Monday.
	   The Bahamian government Saturday posted a hurricane watch for
the northwest islands and hurricane warnings covered the British
Turks and Caicos islands and the southeastern and central Bahamas.

Ivanisevic, Kucera to meet in Pilot Pen finals

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ His golf game will have to wait.
	   Nursing an aching shoulder made tender from years of countless
serves, admitted golf fanatic Goran Ivanisevic planned to forego 18
holes on the eve of his fourth U.S. singles final.
	   ``I just take it easy. I put more ice and a little massage and
play some cards instead of golf,'' he said after beating Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, 6-3, 6-4 Saturday in the Pilot Pen International
semifinals.
	   A strong service game helped the No. 8 seed Ivanisevic continue
his dominance over the Russian. He leads their head-to-head series
9-2 and has beaten Kafelnikov in their last seven matches.
	   His serve, clocked as high as 211 kph (131 mph) in the
tournament, kept him in control through most of the 65-minute
match.
	   The left-hander had a dozen aces to Kafelnikov's four and won 87
percent of his first service points.
	   But the sore left shoulder also dictated that he take a little
off his serves and rely more on his volleys, the part of his game
he says has steadily improved.
	   ``Especially on hard court. I can come in, I can finish with a
volley ... I can stay back,'' Ivanisevic said.
	   If there was something missing off the serves, Kafelnikov, the
defending Pilot Pen champ and No. 5 seed, said he didn't notice.
	   ``It seemed like he was serving like in normal day, aces, one
after another,'' Kafelnikov said.
	   The 26-year-old Croat, ranked No. 16 on tour, is in the hunt for
his first tournament victory in the United States and will play No.
7 seed Karol Kucera, of Slovakia, in Sunday's final. Kucera
advanced by beating No. 4 seed Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands,
6-7 (8-6), 6-4 on the New Haven hard courts.
	   Sunday's final will be Kucera's first on U.S. soil. Ranked 13th,
Kucera opened the season with a singles title at Sydney, his first
hard court title.
	   Kucera said it took him nearly the first set to figure out the
hard-serving Dutchman, who topped the tournament with speeds of 212
kph (132 mph). Krajicek had eight aces to Kucera's six.
	   ``After the second set I think I got a little bit more returns
back and I could break him two times,'' he said.
	   He had a chance to serve for the match at 5-4, but admitted
feeling the pressure and Krajicek broke him.
	   ``I am not used to win all my service games and I knew I have to
today because if I would lose the serve like in the second set and
Krajicek is coming back,'' he said.
	   He broke the Krajicek for the match when Krajicek's return
volley just missed the baseline.

Olympiakos beats Apollon at the season's start
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Serbian striker Ilja Ivic scored twice
Saturday as defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus defeated Apollon
Athens 5-2 in the opening game of the Greek first division soccer
league season.
	   A total of four games were played Saturday involving teams
participating in European tournaments next week. The other five
matches of the first round will be played Sunday.
	   Panathinaikos Athens defeated Paniliakos Pyrgos 2-1 after
Serbian defender Vladan Milojevic converted a penalty kick seconds
before the end of a game.
	   Ionikos defeated PAOK Salonika 1-0 and AEK Athens beat Panionios
3-1.
	   Olympiakos and Panathinaikos play in the Champions League
Wednesday, and PAOK and AEK play in the UEFA cup Tuesday.
	   Olympiakos dominated the first half of the game, scoring four
goals and losing at least five other scoring chances while Apollon
had only one shot on goal.
	   The second period saw Apollon becoming more aggressive, scoring
two goals in three minutes, the first by Cameroonian striker
Nicolas Dikoume in the 56th minute and the second by Antonis
Damigos in the 59th.
	   Serbian midfielder Predrag Djordjevic opened the scoring off a
free kick from Grigoris Georgatos in the 16th minute and Ghanaian
Peter Oforiquaye made it 2-0 in the 30th minute.
	   Ivic scored two more goals in the last four minutes of the half.
Vassilis Karapialis scored Olympiakos' fifth goal in the 75th.
	   Playing at the Athens Olympic stadium, Panathinaikos was jeered
by its fans when Paniliakos took the lead with Giannis Tatsis in
the 27th minute.
	   Norwegian midfielder Frank Strandli leveled off a cross from
Polish striker Krzysztof Warzycha in the 75th to even the score.
	   The Paniliakos defense resisted Panathinaikos attacks until the
45th minute, when Milojevic scored the winner.

Inspired Cambuur holds PSV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Newly promoted Cambuur Leeuwarden,
widely predicted to drop directly back to the first division, held
last year's runner-up PSV Eindhoven 1-1 Saturday.
	   Cambuur owed its first point in the Dutch premiership to the
sheer sweat and effort it showed after new captain Andre Ooijer put
PSV ahead just before the break.
	   But it also needed a stroke of luck as Twan Scheepers' left-foot
shot took a wicked deflection to give the midfielder a crucial late
equalizing goal on his debut for Cambuur.
	   It took 70 minutes for Nikos Machlas, the Greek scoring machine
who dominated Dutch football last year with 34 goals, to open his
account for Vitesse Arnhem this season.
	   He finally shook off the close marking which had shut him out of
the game and rose to head home from almost point blank range,
handing Vitesse a 1-0 win over Roda JC.
	   In Saturday's other games MVV Maastricht went down 2-1 at De
Graafschap Doetinchem, AZ Alkmaar downed Sparta Rotterdam 2-0 and
NEC Nijmegen defeated RKC Waalwijk 1-0.
	   Champion Ajax Amsterdam completes the first round of games
Sunday when it plays host to Willem II Tilburg.

Eight teams survive big odds to get into championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REWRITES throughout to UPDATE with Canadian winner; add

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Amazing feats brought these
eight teams to the Little League World Series. One youngster threw
a no-hitter in the deciding game. Another hit a two-run homer in
the last at-bat. Another hit two home runs with a trip to
Williamsport on the line.
	   The best of the more than 7,000 teams from America, Europe and
Asia won regionals on three continents and make a run at the world
championship starting Sunday at the Howard J. Lamade Stadium. The
championship is Aug. 29.
	   ``When you think of the chances of getting this far, it is
pretty amazing. More than 7,000 teams started out, and we're among
the final eight,'' said Tom Meyer, the coach of the U.S. Central
team from Jenison, Michigan.
	   Meyer also coaches a high school American football team in town,
so he commuted the 600 miles (965 kilometers) from Jenison to
Indianapolis for each day of the U.S. Central Regional last week.
Godwin Heights High School administrators said he could skip the
all-night drives and two-a-day football practices this week.
	   ``They said I could go to the World Series,'' he said, smiling.
	   Jenison is joined in Williamsport by three other U.S. teams _
Greenville, North Carolina, Toms River, New Jersey, and Cypress,
California _ and four non-U.S. teams, including Langley Little
League of British Columbia, who defeated Glace Bay of Nova Scotia,
4-1, to win the Canada Region Championship.
	   Guadalupe, Mexico, has three players returning from last year's
championship team, which scored four runs in the final inning to
beat Mission Viejo, California.
	   Kashima, Japan bring along the first girl to play for a Far East
champion. Sayaka Tsushima, who plays center field, becomes the
fifth girl to play in the Little League World Series, all since
1984.
	   The Arabian American Little League of Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, won
the European Regional for the fourth consecutive year.

Seles downs Hingis to maintain Canadian win streak
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes; Will be UPDATED with second semifinal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Monica Seles upset top-seeded Martina Hingis of
Switzerland with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 semifinal victory Saturday at the
dlrs 1.3 million du Maurier Open women's tennis championship.
	   Seles advanced to Sunday's final against either second-seeded
Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic or third-seeded Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario of Spain, who played in the second semifinal later
Saturday.
	   Seles, 24, the fifth seed, has won the last three du Maurier
tournaments. Her only previous loss at the event was to Sanchez
Vicario in the 1992 final. Seles' du Maurier record is now 23-1.
	   ``This tournament just seems to bring out the best in me at key
times,'' said Seles. ``Like today, I woke up at a key time.''
	   Hingis, 17, did not lose a service game until Seles broke for a
5-3 lead in the second set in the one hour, 32 minute match. Seles
added two early breaks in the third set to put away the match.
	   ``I really started to play well as the match went on,'' Seles
said. ``I actually think she was lucky to win the first set.
Everything just went well for me today.''
	   Hingis, who won three grand slam tournaments last year, has four
tournament victories in 1998 but has not won since the Italian Open
in May and may soon be in danger of losing the No. 1 ranking she
has held since March 31, 1997.
	   ``I'm just having trouble right now winning a whole
tournament,'' said Hingis. ``I always play pretty solidly, but have
trouble to win the whole thing.
	   ``But we'll see what happens at the U.S. Open (in two weeks).''
	   Seles, the former world No. 1, missed most of the 1993 and 1994
seasons after she was stabbed in the back by a spectator in
Hamburg, Germany on April 30, 1993.
	   She made a dramatic return at the 1995 du Maurier in Toronto,
defeating Amanda Coetzer of South Africa in the final. She beat
Sanchez in the 1996 final in Montreal and downed Anke Huber of
Germany in last year's final in Toronto.
	   Seles has yet to win a tournament this year, but she reached the
final of the French Open in June and made the semifinals at two
events in California in recent weeks.
	   ``I feel I'm getting better, but sometimes I come in and just
play horrible matches, like at Wimbledon (a quarterfinal loss to
Natasha Zvereva) or in the past couple of weeks in California,''
Seles said.
	   ``I haven't been getting consistent training and that's why some
days my game is way up and other days it's way down. I have to
improve on that.''

Mallorca beats Barcelona 1-0 to take Spanish Supercup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Mallorca beat Spanish league and cup
champion FC Barcelona by a score of 1-0 Saturday night to take the
Spanish Supercup, the season's first trophy.
	   Mallorca had won the final's first leg 2-1 on Tuesday in Palma.
	   The Supercup is played between the winner of the first division
and the King's Cup. Since Barcelona won both, Mallorca qualified
having been finalist in the King's Cup.
	   Saturday's win marked the first time Mallorca has won a title in
Spanish football.
	   Barcelona dominated for the first 20 minutes or so at the Camp
Nou stadium, keeping Mallorca pinned down with spirited individual
play by Luis Felipe Madeira and Luis Enrique Martinez.
	   But as the game wore on, the Catalan titan found it harder and
harder to gel as a team despite its wealth of talent.
	   In the first half Barcelona led in shots on goal, and threatened
on several occasions, one time forcing Argentine goalkeeper Carlos
Angel Roa to come out and virtually tackle Luis Enrique as he tried
to slam home a shot from just outside the box.
	   Barcelona's best chance came in the 19th minute on a free kick
by Brazilian Rivaldo which sailed just high of the crossbar.
	   The visitors from the Balearic islands finally jumped ahead in
the 29th minute on a crisp header by Daniel Garcia following a pass
from behind him by Francisco Soler.
	   Garcia knocked it in from ten meters (yards) out, just to the
right of diving Barcelona goalkeeper Ruud Hesp.
	   In the 30th minute of the second period Garcia came close to
scoring a second goal, again on a nice header.
	   Spanish first division play begins Aug. 30.

Contiguglia wins U.S. federational presidential vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WAILEA, Hawaii (AP) _ Dr. Bob Contiguglia, the endorsed
candidate of outgoing American soccer head Alan Rothenberg, was
elected president of the U.S. Soccer Federation on Saturday.
	   The chairman of the U.S. Youth Soccer Association from
1990-1996, Contiguglia, 55, beat outgoing USSF executive vice
president Larry Monaco with 57.6 percent of the vote of USSF
members. Monaco received 42.4 percent of the vote.
	   Contiguglia was seen generally as the candidate that was more
supportive of continuing to build on the gains of the professional
division, meaning essentially Major League Soccer, and the national
teams.
	   Monaco was looked upon as more geared toward the federation's
membership, two-thirds of which is youth and amateur.
	   Rothenberg, the head of the 1994 World Cup organizing committee
and the founder of MLS, is stepping down after completing his
second four-year term as USSF president. USSF bylaws prevented him
from running for a third.
	   In Saturday's other contested election, John Motta, a business
entrepren eur from the New Hampshire Soccer Association, defeated
MLS Deputy Commissioner Sunil Gulati for executive vice president
by only 11 votes.

	   ALMOLOYA DE JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) _ Asked by the judge to state
his profession, Daniel Arizmendi Lopez curtly responded:
``Kidnapping.''
	   Judge Armando Baez Espinoza of the 2nd Federal Criminal Court
stared in disbelief at the man dubbed the ``ear-lopper'' for
allegedly sending ransom notes attached to his victims' ears.
	   Judge Baez asked Arizmendi to repeat himself. He replied: ``I do
kidnappings ... I am a kidnapper.''
	   After the eight-hour pretrial hearing at the maximum security
prison in Almoloya de Juarez, near Mexico City, Arizmendi and his
mistress, Dulce Maria Paz Venegas, refused to plead innocent or
guilty to the charges.
	   Arizmendi said he was very tired after three days of questioning
by police at the Attorney General's Office.
	   Their court-appointed lawyer, Maria Eugenia Lopez Fuentes, asked
the hearing to be recessed until next Thursday so she could have
time to prepare her case. The judge agreed and ordered them held
without bail.
	   Arizmendi is accused of kidnapping, racketeering, laundering
money from ransom payments and illegal possession of firearms. Paz
is accused of racketeering and money laundering.

Leading Mexican novelist Elena Garro dead at 77
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Elena Garro, a leading Mexican playwright and
novelist, died in a hospital Saturday after a long illness. She was
77.
	   The former wife of the late Mexican poet and Nobel laureate
Octavio Paz, Garro had been suffering for years from ephysemia.
	   Monday she checked in at a hospital in Cuernavaca, 35 miles
south of Mexico City, where she died of heart and lung failure,
according to her attending physician, Dr. Marco Aurelio Eslava.
	   Garro wrote more than two dozen best-selling novels in Spanish
and as many plays, and held a number of literary awards, among them
the Sor Inez de la Cruz, one of Mexico's top prizes.
	   Her foremost novel was ``Recuerdos del Porvenir'' (Remembrances
of the Future). Other literary works included ``Mariana,''
``Reencuentro con Personajes'' (Reencountering Personages), ``La
Casa Junto al Rio'' (The House Next to the River), and ``Memorias
de Espana'' (Memories of Spain).
	   With the exception of a couple of plays, few of her works were
translated into English. But she was well known in Europe,
especially in Spain.
	   Garro was born Dec. 12, 1920, in Puebla, the capital of the
state of the same name, 65 miles southeast of Mexico City. She
started writing when she was very young.
	   She later settled in the Mexican capital where she moved in
literary circles, and met and married Paz in 1937. The young couple
moved to Spain soon after to write about the 1936-39 Spanish Civil
War.
	   Her marriage to Paz ended in an angry divorce three decades
later. Octavio Paz died in Mexico City on April 19 _ they never
reconciled or spoke to each other.
	   She first went to the United States, then France and later
settled in Spain in 1972, where she lived for 21 years. She moved
to Cuernavaca, the capital of Morelos state, three years ago and
lived a solitary life in a small apartment with her daughter,
Helena (cq) Paz Garro and 10 cats.
	   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.
	   Garro is survived by her daughter Helena Paz.

Hall and Shaw share lead after two rounds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, New York (AP) _ Walter Hall shot a 3-under-par 69
Saturday to hold a share of the lead of the dlrs 1 million
Northville Long Island Classic for the second straight year, this
time with Tom Shaw, who had a 66.
	   Hall, in his second year on the Senior PGA Tour, held a
three-stroke lead after an opening 65 and his 10-under 134 total
matches what he had last year after two rounds at the 6,842-yard
(6,254-meter) Meadow Brook Club. He had a final-round 74 last year
and finished 11th.
	   ``I have a lot more experience than I did last year, that was
just my second senior tournament,'' said Hall, who played the first
three holes in last year's final round three over par. ``I'm not
saying I'm going to win by a long shot, but if I happen to get off
to a better start hopefully things will be better but I am happy
with where I am.''
	   That would be tied with Shaw and two strokes ahead of Spaniard
Jose Maria Canizares and South African Gary Player, who both
matched their opening-round 68s. John Schroeder, who had a 65, and
Lee Trevino, who had a 69, were at 7-under 137.
	   Hall bogeyed Nos. 7 and 8 to fall to six under and knew he
needed something to jump start his round.
	   ``At 8, I was over for the round and I'm watching everybody
going by on the leaderboard,'' Hall said. ``Then I made some
birdies on the way in.''
	   Hall's birdies on Nos. 11, 14 and 16 came on putts of 10, 8 and
20 feet (3, 2.4 and 6 meters).
	   Shaw jumped right into contention by starting his second round
with an eagle and a birdie.
	   ``My goal for tomorrow is to get off to a better start than I
did today,'' Shaw said breaking into a big laugh. ``If I do, just
come drag me off the golf course.''
	   Shaw had a chance at a spectacular round, but missed six birdie
putts of 10 feet (3 meters) or less.
	   Shaw, 59, hasn't won on the Senior PGA Tour since 1993, the last
year he also held a lead entering the final round of a tournament.
	   ``The last three years I've been in kind of a slump, but this
year I'm playing pretty well,'' he said. ``I've been waiting for
the chance to put three good rounds together.''
	   Canizares was one of the players who shared the 36-hole lead
with Hall last season and he missed the playoff by one stroke. He
could have held second alone, but missed a 3-foot (1-meter) putt
for par on the final hole.
	   Player won the 36-hole MasterCard Champions, his fourth straight
victory on the mini-tour for players over 60.
	   ``At the presentation I thought back to the 1961 Masters when I
won dlrs 20,000,'' said Player, whose 8-under total was six better
than Jim Ferree. ``Now at almost age 63 I win dlrs 18,000 for a
super seniors. That is food for thought.''
	   Defending champion Dana Quigley had a 68 and was at 141.
 &UR; DIVOTS: &LR;  Canizares' 15-year-old son Jose Alejandro was his caddy
for the first time in the United States. The younger Canizares, who
plays to a 3 handicap, will work just the one week as he has to
head back to school in Spain.

Agassi, Corretja reach finals of RCA Championships

 &UR; EDS: NEW with Saturday's semifinals. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ After posting two-set victories over their
respective foes in Saturday's semifinal round, Andre Agassi and
Alex Corretja predicted a tight battle in Sunday's finals of the
RCA Championships.
	   Agassi, the fifth seed, advanced with a 7-6 (8-6), 6-3 victory
over Paraguay's Ramon Delgado. Corretja, the sixth seed from Spain,
eliminated 15th-seeded Todd Martin 6-2, 7-6 (7-4).
	   Their respective victories set up what promises to be an
outstanding serve-and-volley match between players who are not
afraid to run. Agassi has won the four previous matches with
Corretja, including a 5-7, 6-3, 5-7, 6-0, 6-2 victory in the 1995
U.S. Open.
	   ``Alex hits the ball with heavy topspin and moves like a
gazelle,'' Agassi said. ``But if I play well, if I execute, I
should be all right.''
	   Corretja echoed those sentiments, but not necessarily in
Agassi's favor.
	   ``I think he's on fire; he's been playing really well during the
whole summer season,'' Corretja said of Agassi, who has won 19 of
his last 21 matches. ``But in the same boat, I think I will have a
good chance if I keep concentrating on my game.''
	   Agassi was able to keep Delgado away from the net in the second
set after Delgado rushed the net 25 times in the first set.
	   ``He was establishing to me that if he does get in control of
the point, he's going to be willing to finish it off,'' Agassi
said. ``It just looked like he ran a little bit out of gas at the
middle of the second set.
	   ``Once he started to shift down a gear, then I was managing to
control some points, and he wasn't in position to come in as
much.''
	   Agassi got the boost he needed in the first set. Trailing 3-2,
he double-faulted to fall behind love-40 in the sixth game. With
the crowd cheering him on, Agassi came back to win after going to
deuce three times. He held serve again in the 12th game after
falling behind 40-15.
	   ``A lot of these matches do boil down to a few crucial
moments,'' Agassi said. ``It's just about playing well at the right
time.''
	   Delgado agreed, saying, ``I had my chances, but he played
unbelievable points when he was down.''
	   Corretja used a strong baseline game to deny Martin's play at
the net.
	   ``In the first set, I just played perfect tennis,'' Corretja
said. ``Once I equalized again in the second set at 4-all, I just
saw myself in good shape to just finish the match in two sets.''
	   ``He made it real difficult for me to win points on my serve all
day,'' Martin said. ``Just not being real sharp came back to haunt
me.''

Americans qualify for World Cup with 21-16 victory over Uruguay
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Argentina-Canada result; CORRECTS spelling of
Blom, Sharrenberg, Ormaechea, Sciarra. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Andre Blom and Mark Scharrenberg
scored tries and some tactical kicks in the final 10 minutes sent
the United States to the Rugby World Cup with a 21-16 victory over
Uruguay on Saturday.
	   The United States became the third team to qualify for the
20-nation finals in September-October 1999 in Britain, Ireland and
France.
	   In Saturday's other game Argentina routed Canada 54-28 to finish
as the top team in the America's qualifying tournament. Both teams
qualified with victories on Tuesday.
	   The three teams from the Americas join host Wales, defending
champion South Africa, 1995 World Cup runner-up New Zealand and
1995 third-place finisher France in the finals.
	   The loss sends Uruguay into March's repechage qualifying
tournament, a seven-team event involving all five geographical
regions from which two teams will qualify.
	   Blom's try in the 13th and penalties by fly half Mark Williams
in the 32nd and first minute of first-half injury time got the U.S.
Eagles out to a 11-6 lead.
	   Scrum half Federico Sciarra's penalties in the 21st and fourth
minute of first-half injury time were all Uruguay could muster
despite the advantage of the wind on the grounds of the Buenos
Aires Cricket and Rugby Club.
	   Sciarra pulled Uruguay with two points with his his third
penalty goal nine minutes into the second half.
	   But Scharrenberg scored a solo try in the 52nd minute and
Williams added the conversion to put the Americans in control.
	   Captain Diego Ormaechea salvaged Uruguay's pride by pushing over
a try in the 70th minute, but some well-placed kicks in the final
10 minutes kept Uruguay pinned in its half and preserved the U.S.
victory.

Singh clings to lead in tightening International
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Saturday play &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTLE ROCK, Colorado (AP) _ Vijay Singh, withstanding two
eagles including a hole-in-one from onrushing Tiger Woods, clung to
a narrow lead Saturday after three rounds of the Sprint
International.
	   Singh, of Fiji, began the day with a 4-point lead under the
modified Stableford scoring system used in this event and saw his
margin trimmed to 1 point.
	   Singh, the recently crowned PGA champion, had four birdies and
two bogeys in a steady if unspectacular round at Castle Pines Golf
Club, which for the first time in three days was spared delays from
lightning and rain. He added 6 points to his total for 33, one
ahead of Willie Wood and 2 ahead of Woods.
	   Another point back on a tightly bunched leaderboard was Rocco
Mediate. Defending champion Phil Mickelson also surged, finishing
at 29. The top 12 players were separated by only 8 points.
	   The International's scoring format awards 5 points for an eagle,
2 for birdie, zero for par, minus-1 for bogey and minus-3 for
double-bogey or worse.
	   Points accumulate over all four rounds. The field will be cut to
the top 36 scorers and ties for Sunday's final round.
	   While Singh's point total hovered around the low 30s most of the
day, the diminutive Wood was a surprising presence among the
leaders on a course that favors long hitters.
	   Wood had eight birdies, including five of the last six holes. He
sank long-range birdie putts of 30, 20, 20, 18, 15 and 12 feet, (
9, 6, 6, 5.5 and 3.6 meters) and lipped out a 50-foot (15.2-meter)
eagle attempt at the par-5 17th.
	   It was a Tiger who made the most noise. Woods, whose
second-round struggles left him 10 points behind Singh, wasted no
time making a move in the third round. He eagled the par-5 first
hole, then knocked an 8-iron into the cup on the fly at the
185-yard (169 meters) seventh hole for the third hole-in-one of his
pro career.
	   Woods also had two eagles on Thursday, and his four eagles broke
the tournament record of three by Lee Janzen in 1995 and Mark
Brooks last year.
	   The ace moved Woods to 28 points, and he added a birdie at No. 8
to tie Singh for the lead at 30. He momentarily held the lead after
a birdie at 14, but missed greens at 15 and 16 cost him bogeys.
	   Mediate also had eight birdies, five on his back nine. Fully
recovered from back surgery and trimmed down, Mediate called his
round ``very exciting. It was an easy day, if there is such a
thing.''
	   Mickelson shot himself into contention with six birdies and an
eagle in a 16-point round that vaulted him to 29 points.
	   Mickelson _ the only multiple winner of this tournament, having
also prevailed in 1993 _ birdied three straight holes on the front
nine but made his biggest move at the par-5 17th. He hit his second
shot, a 6-iron from 202 yards (185 meters), 10 feet (3 meters) from
the pin and made the eagle putt worth 5 points.
	   Steve Flesch was at 28 points, Brandt Jobe at 27 and Mark Brooks
at 26.

Poll indicates growing doubts that princess' crash was accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ New opinion polls indicate there are growing
public doubts that Princess Diana's death was an accident, and
increasing approval for Queen Elizabeth II since the week of
Diana's funeral.
	   Nearly a year after the princess and Dodi Fayed died in a Paris
car crash, 59 percent of Britons asked in an NOP poll said they
believed the deaths were an accident, compared with 84 percent in a
similar poll in September, shortly after the crash.
	   In the poll published in The Sunday Times, 24 percent of the
1,003 people asked said they believed there was a conspiracy to
have the princess murdered. There was no comparative figure for
last year. Twelve percent said they didn't know, and 5 percent said
it was neither.
	   Twenty-nine percent believed the queen should abdicate now or at
age 75, compared with 52 percent a year ago. Sixty-two said she
should never step down, and 63 percent said the country would be
worse off without the monarchy.
	   Another poll, published in The Mail on Sunday, found 75 percent
believed Britain is better off with a monarchy.
	   That MORI poll of 804 adults also indicated substantial support
for Prince Charles.
	   Three-quarters of those polled believed he had done a good job
bringing up his sons. Only 9 percent said the prince and Camilla
Parker Bowles should split up, 42 percent said they should conduct
their relationship in public, and 35 percent said the relationship
should remain private.
	   Assuming they remained a couple, 38 percent said they believed
the two should marry, and 29 percent were opposed. The rest did not
have an opinion. If Charles and Camilla did marry, half of those
surveyed believe Charles should still be allowed to become King,
and 41 percent were against. The rest did not know.
	   At the time of Charles' divorce from Diana in August 1996, The
Mail on Sunday said, 66 percent believed Charles should not be king
with Camilla at his side.
	   Prince Charles has said he did not intend to remarry.
	   In the NOP poll of 1,003 adults, three-quarters said there
should be an end to the ``cult of Diana'' and that she should be
allowed to rest in peace _ although 17 percent said it was
understandable that public interest in her remains intense.
	   Both polls were taken last week and had a margin of error of 3
percent.

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Silence fell upon this
bomb-shattered town and across Ireland on Saturday in memory of 28
people slain by IRA dissidents, as another band of anti-British
outlaws responded to the atrocity by announcing their own
cease-fire.
	   More than 20,000 Protestants and Catholics packed the center of
Omagh to remember, through their sobs and tears, the dead and the
more than 330 wounded by the Aug. 15 car bomb.
	   Hundreds of thousands more marked the slaughter _ the worst in
three decades of violence in Northern Ireland _ with one minute's
silence in town squares, churches, sports stadiums and shopping
centers across Ireland.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said he will visit the
province on Tuesday to express his belief that the Omagh bomb had
brought the people of Northern Ireland closer together.

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ For Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the way to unwind
after two years as chairman of the a commission investigating
apartheid-era crimes in South Africa is to tackle major theological
issues at a U.S. university.
	   The Nobel peace laureate will join Emory University's theology
department for the coming academic year.
	   ``I'm much looking forward to unwinding after the work in which
we have been involved in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
back home in South Africa,'' Tutu said.
	   The commission's work is wrapping up. On Friday, former
President P.W. Botha was found guilty of ignoring a summons to
appear before the panel. He was given a suspended prison sentence
and fined.
	   Tutu said theology may be the key to stopping terrorist attacks
like the recent bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa.
	   Tutu will work on a book this fall and will not take on any
classroom duties. He will teach two courses in the spring, with the
topics to be determined later, Emory spokeswoman Elaine Justice
said.
	   ___
	   ATTICA, New York (AP) _ The deranged fan who killed John Lennon
doesn't want a cent for the Beatles album he got the former Beatle
to autograph shortly before the murder.
	   Lennon signed and dated the ``Double Fantasy'' album for Mark
David Chapman outside his New York apartment building the same day
he was killed, Dec. 8, 1980.
	   The record is being offered for an asking price of dlrs 1.8
million on the Internet by an anonymous man who found it at the
crime scene.
	   Chapman, who is serving a 20-years-to-life prison sentence, said
he was contacted last week by a New York City lawyer who told
Chapman he had the legal right to ``assert a claim'' to the album
as a personal possession.
	   Chapman, 43, said he stashed the album behind a watchman's booth
and fired five shots from a .38-caliber revolver into Lennon's back
as the rock star returned home from a recording session.
	   After being examined by police as evidence, the album was
returned to the man who found it.
	   ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ If the audience sees a little of Broadway's
style in Janet Jackson's new razzle-dazzle ``Velvet Rope'' tour,
it's not by accident.
	   ``To me, being on stage is about entertaining,'' said Jackson,
32, the youngest daughter of the celebrated Jackson family. ``I
know there are people who just walk on stage and give you a show by
just doing their music, but I always wanted something extra.''
	   The Broadway influence goes back to her childhood.
	   ``I'm crazy about Broadway. I saw my first Broadway show when I
was 10,'' she said Friday. ``I saw Stephanie Mills in `The Wiz' on
Broadway and I saw it over and over again. Then I saw 'Annie' and I
wanted to be in it so badly.''
	   ___
	   The tour, which has drawn capacity crowds, was in Southern
California last week.
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Some of Europe's top golfers will take
part in a fund-raising match for those killed and injured in the
recent bombing in Omagh, Northern Ireland.
	   ``We can't bring people back, but we would like to do something
to show our support,'' said Ryder Cup player Darren Clarke, who is
from County Tyrone where the tragedy took place.
	   ``Not that other atrocities haven't affected me, but this one
has hit deeper. Adults and children were just slaughtered _ it was
a senseless, murderous act.''
	   The Pro-Am event will be at Portmarnock Links in Northern
Ireland on Sept. 14.
	   The goal is to raise about dlrs 250,000 for the Omagh Fund.
Saturday's bomb killed 28 people, many of them children, and
injured more than 330.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels battling to topple President Laurent
Kabila on Saturday accused Angola of entering the fray in Congo's
escalating war, which already includes forces from Zimbabwe and
threatens to engulf other African states. An Angolan government
source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said troops would
defend Kinshasa, although he gave no official word on his
government's position on the fighting. Angolan troops landed in the
west of this vast central African country in support of Kabila's
loyalist forces, a rebel leader said without giving details.
(CONGO-REBELS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton moved to choke off
funds to Osama bin Laden and his terrorist group while opposition
Republicans presented an increasingly unified front in supporting
the president's missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan. U.S.
officials suggest more strikes might come in the future. ``We must
not allow sanctuary for terrorism _ not for terrorists or for their
money,'' Clinton said Saturday. He announced that on Thursday, the
day of the U.S. air strikes, he signed an executive order blocking
all financial transactions between bin Laden's organization and any
U.S. individual or company. Clinton urged other nations to file
suit. (US-BOMBINGS)
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Whipping up popular anger over a U.S.
missile strike, President Omar el-Bashir said Saturday that the
Sudanese were prepared to die in a holy war. ``America is attacking
us because we are guardians of Islam,'' el-Bashir told a central
Khartoum rally of at least 5,000 people, who replied with chants of
``Death to America.'' After his speech, some 500 protesters went to
the British Embassy, where they hurled stones at the building. One
demonstrator climbed to the top of the embassy flagpole and cut
down the Union Jack. After the flag fell to the ground, angry
demonstrators tore it to pieces. (SUDAN-US)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ With impassioned speeches in three cities,
opposition candidate Gerhard Schroeder kicked off the final stretch
of his election campaign Saturday pledging to restore programs to
help the most vulnerable members of society. Schroeder, the
front-runner for the Sept. 27 national vote, confidently predicted
he will unseat Chancellor Helmut Kohl. If he does, it will be
partly with campaign promises to repeal unpopular cuts to the
welfare state passed by the conservative leader. The Social
Democrat fired off forceful, fist-shaking speeches in Berlin,
Munich and Bonn, hitting powerfully at his theme that strengthening
the economy shouldn't come at the expense of the Germans struggling
to get by, including workers who fall ill and pensioners.
(GERMANY-SOCIAL DEMOCRATS)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Weeks of high waters cracked soggy dikes
protecting cities along the Yangtze River on Saturday, and soldiers
in the northeast fought to stop a breached levee hard by China's
largest oil field. The state disaster relief agency warned that
high waters surged anew on the upper Yangtze, threatening another
round of flooding downstream. Governor Wang Maolin said dikes in
central Hunan province were already soggy and seriously damaged.
While the latest Yangtze flood crest receded Saturday around
Hunan's Dongting Lake, its retreat exposed fractures in protective
embankments. Some 830,000 soldiers and civilians worked to shore up
dikes and patch cracks, one of them 70 meters (230 feet) long,
around Yueyang city, state media reported. (CHINA-FLOODS)

Americans qualify for World Cup with 21-16 victory over Uruguay
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECAPS with details of Argentina-Canada. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Andre Blom and Mark Scharrenberg
scored tries and some tactical kicks in the final 10 minutes sent
the United States to the Rugby World Cup with a 21-16 victory over
Uruguay on Saturday.
	   The United States became the third team to qualify for the
20-nation finals in September-October 1999 in Britain, Ireland and
France.
	   In Saturday's other game Argentina routed Canada 54-28 to finish
as the top team in the America's qualifying tournament. Both teams
qualified with victories on Tuesday.
	   The three teams from the Americas join host Wales, defending
champion South Africa, 1995 World Cup runner-up New Zealand and
1995 third-place finisher France in the finals.
	   The loss sends Uruguay into March's repechage qualifying
tournament, a seven-team event involving all five geographical
regions from which two teams will qualify.
	   Blom's try in the 13th and penalties by fly half Mark Williams
in the 32nd and first minute of first-half injury time got the U.S.
Eagles out to a 11-6 lead.
	   Scrum half Federico Sciarra's penalties in the 21st and fourth
minute of first-half injury time were all Uruguay could muster
despite the advantage of the wind on the grounds of the Buenos
Aires Cricket and Rugby Club.
	   Sciarra pulled Uruguay with two points with his his third
penalty goal nine minutes into the second half.
	   But Scharrenberg scored a solo try in the 52nd minute and
Williams added the conversion to put the Americans in control.
	   Captain Diego Ormaechea salvaged Uruguay's pride by pushing over
a try in the 70th minute, but some well-placed kicks in the final
10 minutes kept Uruguay pinned in its half and preserved the U.S.
victory.
	   In the other game, Argentina fly half Gonzalo Queseda kicked
five of his seven penalties in the second half to break open a
27-21 match and enable the Pumas to cruise.
	   With Queseda scoring 29 points, Pablo Camerlinckx and Martin
Scelzo scored tries as Argentina finished the qualifying tournament
by outscoring its opponents 161-52.
	   Canadian captain Gareth Rees also kicked seven penalties and
finished with 23 points.

Contiguglia wins U.S. federational presidential vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds quotes from Contiguglia. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WAILEA, Hawaii (AP) _ Dr. Bob Contiguglia, the endorsed
candidate of outgoing American soccer head Alan Rothenberg, was
elected president of the U.S. Soccer Federation on Saturday.
	   The chairman of the U.S. Youth Soccer Association from
1990-1996, Contiguglia, 55, beat outgoing USSF executive vice
president Larry Monaco with 57.6 percent of the vote of USSF
members. Monaco received 42.4 percent of the vote.
	   Contiguglia was seen generally as the candidate that was more
supportive of continuing to build on the gains of the professional
division, meaning essentially Major League Soccer, and the national
teams.
	   ``The final candidates are still the final four,'' Contiguglia
said. ``We will have a small working committee basically made up of
the folks who have working about this the last several months. The
committee will make a recommendation and the president will make
the final decision. ...
	   ``The criteria would be international experience, working with
professional athletes, obviously track record and preferably, if
possible, as American. One of my criteria would be someone who's
played in the World Cup, too.''
	   Monaco was looked upon as more geared toward the federation's
membership, two-thirds of which is youth and amateur.
	   Rothenberg, the head of the 1994 World Cup organizing committee
and the founder of MLS, is stepping down after completing his
second four-year term as USSF president. USSF bylaws prevented him
from running for a third.
	   In Saturday's other contested election, John Motta, a business
entrepren eur from the New Hampshire Soccer Association, defeated
MLS Deputy Commissioner Sunil Gulati for executive vice president
by only 11 votes.

 &UR; BAHAMAS: Bonnie begins blowing in southeastern Bahamas &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Bonnie strengthened into the Atlantic
season's first hurricane Saturday, a 300-mile-long
(480-kilometer-long) storm dwarfing sparsely populated Bahamian
islands on its route, that could threaten the southeastern United
States.
	   Another hurricane gained strength in the Pacific Ocean but was
expected to peter out over open seas.
	   At 8 p.m. (0000 GMT) Saturday, the National Hurricane Center
said Bonnie's center was located about 210 miles (335 kilometers)
east-southeast of San Salvador in the Bahamas, the island where
Columbus is believed to have first landed in the hemisphere.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Caribbean nations sign trade pact
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Caribbean nations
signed a trade pact more than doubling their market Saturday at a
16-nation summit overwhelmed by one-time bogeyman Fidel Castro, who
appears to have been promoted overnight to the role of regional
elder statesman.
	   The summit marks the high point of the formerly insular
Dominican Republic's effort to become a lynchpin of the Americas
through its Hispanic culture, Caribbean location and ties to the
United States where over a million Dominicans live.
	   The free trade accord will over six years remove most tariffs
between the Caribbean Community, whose fifteen nations have a
population of 6 million people, and the Dominican Republic with 8
million people. It was timed to coincide with negotiations for a
free trade zone encompassing the entire Western Hemisphere by 2005.
 &UR; ST. LUCIA: Election shows ruling party still popular
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ The ruling St. Lucia Labour Party won
a special election held Friday, showing it remains strong more than
a year after it swept to power in an unprecedented landslide.
	   In a by-election to replace Kenneth John, a member of Parliament
who died in July while trying to save a swimmer, the Labour party
won by a better than 2-1 margin, in results announced Saturday.
	   Labour candidate Michael Gaspard retained the seat for the party
with 2,858 votes, compared to 1,402 votes for Allan Bosquet Jr. of
the United Workers Party.
	   Prime Minister Kenny Anthony hailed the results as evidence that
his party retains public confidence. In the young Caribbean
nation's largest election landslide, Labour defeated the Workers
party in the May, 1997 general election. The Workers party had
ruled for all but three years since St. Lucia gained independence
in 1979.
	   With the win in Friday's special election, Labour continues to
hold 16 of the 17 seats in the assembly.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Dean once lost in Puerto Rico forest resigns post
	   HURON, Ohio (AP) _ A college dean who spent 12 days last summer
lost in a rain forest will resign at the end of the school year.
	   Darby Williams has been dean of Bowling Green's Firelands campus
for five years. He may remain at Bowling Green as an administrator
or a professor, said Lesley Ruszkowski, a spokeswoman at Firelands.
	   She said he has been considering a career change for several
months.
	   She said Williams, 56, decided to announce his resignation now
to give the college a full year to search for a replacement.
	   Williams was reported missing in July 1997 in the 28,000-acre
Caribbean National Forest. He had gone there to take video
recordings for a book he planned on Puerto Rico.
	   When a heavy rain started, he got lost. He said he ate snails
and ferns and drank mountain water for 12 days while searching for
a way out.
	   More than 60 police officials, civil defense officials and
forest rangers, assisted by police dogs, searched the area for
Williams. He eventually found the trail he was on when he entered
the forest and was found by tourists.

Horses and surf attract widowed Bo Derek to TV series
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo LA303 &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB THOMAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Bo Derek, who gave new meaning to the number
10, is joining the fall television sweepstakes. She plays the
mother of two teen-age boys in an NBC dramatic series, ``Wind on
Water.''
	   Judging from the pilot episode, which debuts Saturday, Oct. 17,
the show is a cross between ``The Big Valley'' and a Bruce Brown
surfing movie.
	   Like Barbara Stanwyck in the 1960s Western series, Miss Derek is
the matriarch of a sprawling cattle ranch. In the grand old
tradition of Westerns, she fights over water rights with a neighbor
who wants to take over her property.
	   And since the spread is located on the Big Island in Hawaii,
there is ample opportunity for water sports, and the two sons are
championship surfers.
	   Miss Derek has had a curious career since her sensational
appearance in 1979 as the object of Dudley Moore's obsession in
``10.'' Instead of accepting the big-money roles that were
available, she worked only with her mentor and husband, John Derek.
She produced the films and he directed and photographed them.
	   None achieved popularity.
	   John Derek died of heart failure on May 22 at 71. His widow put
their 31-acre (13-hectare) horse ranch in Santa Ynez on sale and is
returning to acting with ``Wind on Water.''
	   Miss Derek paused for a recent interview at the production
company's Encino offices before heading to the Hawaii location
where the whole series will be filmed.
	   She was accompanied by her German shepherd, who was trained as a
guard dog in Germany and Hungary.
	   There is a hint of maturity in the Derek face but it still could
stop freeway traffic. So could her figure.
	   Except for a couple of projects she doesn't want to remember,
Miss Derek hasn't acted for 10 years.
	   ``I don't think I meant it to be such a long delay; it just
worked out that way,'' she said. ``As you may remember, I'm not the
most motivated person in the world. I'm very good at finding
excuses why I shouldn't do something.
	   ``Recently I said, `You know what? This is becoming a habit.
It's time I jump back in the water and try to swim.' ''
	   When ``Wind on Water'' was proposed to her last March, it seemed
comfortable for her _ except for playing the mother of two
teen-agers.
	   ``I have no experience, and I guess they're different from dogs
and horses,'' she said with a smile. ``But I've seen my sisters and
my brother with their children, as well as my friends. So it's not
entirely foreign to me.''
	   She certainly feels comfortable in the role of Ciel Connolly,
whose life has been spent on horseback and in the water.
	   ``I was brought up on the beaches of Southern California,'' she
said. ``A lot of water sports. Because of my father's job, we went
to Hawaii a lot. My little-girl dream would have been to have the
horse ranch on the water in Hawaii. Life took me somewhere else,
but this would have been a dream for me.''
	   Ciel Connelly is widowed in the first episode. Her sons are
described as ``hotshot athletes,'' so the series affords a variety
of sports. The first episode features a leap from a helicopter to a
ski run (that's right: skiing in Hawaii) as well as a surfing
contest with huge waves. Also promised: windsurfing, polo, canoe
racing, dirt biking, snowboarding and skydiving.
	   The series arose before John Derek died.
	   ``He didn't like the show,'' his widow admitted. He couldn't see
her playing a matriarch _ ``That was not the little girl he fell in
love with. I'm 41, so it's definitely possible. But he just didn't
see that for me.
	   ``But I feel very good about it. ... Before John died, it would
have been trying. Now it's an absolute blessing.
	   ``The strangest part about being alone now is making decisions
for myself, which I've never really done. I was 16, still living at
home, when I met John. So I've never really been on my own, even to
decide what I want for dinner, or what I'm going to do tomorrow.
You always take into consideration the person you're with, or your
family.
	   ``I always relied on John's opinions and experience, coming from
a good place, from someone who really loved me.''
	   She expressed no regret about working almost exclusively with
her husband after ``10,'' although she acknowledged it ``might be
some kind of self-defense mechanism.
	   ``Not that the decisions not to work were always right. But they
were mine. I had to live with the consequences, good or bad.
Whatever those decisions were they had to be part of the reason my
relationship with John remained so good for 25 years.''

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ They pace, they debate, they dance. One scrubs
floors, another sneezes. One is a demon cat. One caused a queen to
faint.
	   Washington's ghosts are a lively bunch.
	   Many of the phantom spirits vanished with the age of scientific
skepticism, but some Washington wraiths persist. Some presidents
were true believers. And some former chief executives are said to
be ghosts themselves.
	   According to their nature, the capital's ghosts are hard to pin
down.
	   But their stories remain, recorded in a newly expanded book,
``Ghosts, Washington Revisited: The Ghostlore of the Nation's
Capital,'' by John Alexander, a former radio newsman, folklorist,
teller of tales and collector of ghost stories.
	   ``Washington is the greatest town for ghosts in the country,''
The Washington Star exclaimed in 1891. ``The city is dotted all
over with (unrented) haunted houses.''
	   ``Ghostlore is a fascinating way to remember people _ to weave
legends in which heroes and villains can be larger, and last
longer, than life itself,'' writes author Alexander.
	   His book has hundreds of them: male, female, gaunt, portly. John
Wilkes Booth as an icy spot on the stage at Ford's Theater. Dolley
Madison as an ever-vivacious presence.
	   Of the heroes, perhaps the most vivid presence is Abraham
Lincoln's.
	   ``I see him in different rooms and in the hall,'' President
Theodore Roosevelt once said, describing his predecessor's White
House haunts.
	   Harry Truman said he was awakened by two sharp knocks on the
door of his White House bedroom, opened it, found nothing, but
heard footsteps retreating down the hall. He was convinced it was
Lincoln.
	   Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands is said to have fainted when
she answered a knock at the door of the Rose Bedroom late at night
to find Lincoln on the other side.
	   First lady Mary Lincoln, who held seances in the White House,
said she had experienced the shade of the musical Thomas Jefferson,
hearing him rather than seeing him.
	   ``My, my, how that Mr. Jefferson does play the violin,'' she
told friends.
	   Truman may have been a bit of an exorcist. Ghost sightings have
been less frequent at the White House since he ordered its interior
gutted and rebuilt in the 1950s.
	   The ghostly trail continues up Pennsylvania Avenue to the
Capitol, a veritable cockpit of ghostly phenomena.
	   Here, it is said, can be heard the footsteps of an invisible and
long-departed guard, phantom debates, quarrels, gavel cracks at
midnight in a darkened and locked House chamber and the howls of a
giant black demon cat said to appear on the eve of national crises.
	   There is also a story _ surely, just a story _ that the marble
and bronze statues in Statuary Hall dismount from their pedestals
each New Year's Eve and dance the night away in celebration of
another year of the republic.
	   Vice President Charles Wilson died of pneumonia in November
1875, and his ghost can be heard sneezing still. There is the story
of the cleaning woman who died alongside her scrub pail. The sounds
of scrubbing continue yet.
	   And then there are the chickens.
	   Former House doorkeeper William ``Fishbait'' Miller said he
often heard ``clucking sounds.''
	   He said there were stories that Union soldiers quartered in the
Capitol as the Civil War began had brought live chickens with them
for food to be stewed and roasted in the Capitol's marble
fireplaces.
	   ``Wonder if those infernal clucking sounds I keep hearing are
chicken ghosts,'' Fishbait Miller said, perhaps with tongue firmly
in cheek.
	   ``There is fact, and there is fiction,'' author Alexander wrote.
``One of the eternal quests of humanity seems to be to separate one
from the other.''

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ With his sly wit and uncanny feel for the
American idiom and character, writer-director Preston Sturges hit
the heights from 1940 to '44 with a series of film comedies
considered classics today.
	   His descent was equally rapid. The glory years ended with ``Hail
the Conquering Hero,'' and he spent his last 15 years struggling to
recapture his brilliance.
	   Sturges was born 100 years ago Aug. 29, and the centennial is
being celebrated this month on both coasts: Manhattan's Film Forum
offered a festival of his films with newly minted prints, and the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences scheduled a tribute
featuring the filmmaker's widow, Sandy Sturges, and Eddie Bracken,
his star of ``Conquering Hero'' and ``The Miracle of Morgan's
Creek.''
	   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art was staging a major
retrospective, and Universal Studios Home Video issued four movies
Sturges wrote but did not direct. His directorial classics are
available on videocassette.
	   His films have long been revered by movie buffs, though,
astoundingly, none made the American Film Institute's recent list
of the 100 best films. They constituted one of the greatest bursts
of creativity in film history: ``The Great McGinty,'' ``Christmas
in July,'' ``The Lady Eve,'' ``Sullivan's Travels,'' ``The Palm
Beach Story,'' ``The Miracle of Morgan's Creek,'' ``Hail the
Conquering Hero.''
	   ``He was touched with genius,'' comments Billy Wilder, who first
knew Sturges when both were writers at Paramount Studio in the
1930s.
	   ``I thought he was a genius,'' agrees Betty Hutton, who played
the non-singing role of a mother of sextuplets in ``Morgan's
Creek.'' ``I loved the man.''
	   ``He was my best friend,'' adds Eddie Bracken. ``I wouldn't want
to change a word of his scripts, they were so perfect.''
	   Sturges' own life contains the stuff that movies are made of. He
was born into a wealthy Chicago family and educated in private
American schools and in France, Germany and Switzerland. His mother
owned a cosmetics company, and at 16 he was managing the office in
Deauville, France.
	   He flew for the Army in World War I, then returned to the
cosmetics company, where he invented a lipstick that wouldn't be
transferred by a kiss. In the late 1920s he drifted into the New
York theater, first as stage manager, then as playwright, scoring a
hit with ``Strictly Dishonorable.'' After a couple of flops, he
shifted to Hollywood.
	   Like most screenwriters, Sturges was disturbed by how directors
mangled his scripts. In 1940, he urged the Paramount bosses to let
him direct his political satire, ``The Great McGinty.'' Since the
low-budget film presented little risk of financial loss, they
agreed.
	   ``Sturges was the first writer to become a director,'' says
Billy Wilder. ``I was the second, and then came John Huston, Joe
Mankiewicz and others who convinced the studio bosses they could
film their scripts better than anyone else.''
	   ``The Great McGinty'' earned Sturges his only Oscar, for
original script. He continued writing hit after hit, aiming gentle
satire at such American institutions as politics, advertising and
hero worship.
	   Even though he was bringing acclaim and money to Paramount,
Sturges' oddball habits disturbed studio executives. Eddie Bracken
recalls when production boss Buddy DeSylva came to the ``Morgan's
Creek'' set in mid-afternoon to complain that no film had been shot
that day:
	   ``The studio had a rule that directors had to shoot (at least)
three pages of script per day. DeSylva kept complaining until
Preston said, `Get off my set.' By 6 o'clock he had shot 11 pages.
Of course for the next three days he did retakes on those 11
pages.''
	   Sturges' methods were indeed unique. He preferred to write his
scripts in the early hours of the morning. A stock company composed
of silent screen comics, ex-vaudevillians, Broadway has-beens and
former prizefighters peopled scripts awash with dialogue, to be
spoken at a breakneck pace.
	   ``Diana Lynn and I had a 5-minute scene of rapid dialogue in
`Morgan's Creek,' '' Hutton remembers. ``We did it perfectly in one
take! Preston was delighted, and he asked how I could do it. I said
I memorized it like a song, learning the lines rhythmically.''
	   A clash of egos at Paramount led to Sturges's departure.
	   ``He went crazy when he became partners with Howard Hughes,''
declares Wilder. ``They bought their own studio, and that was the
beginning of Sturges' decline. He never did anything important
after that.''
	   At two o'clock one morning in 1945, this reporter visited
Sturges at his new headquarters at California Studio, where he was
working on a script for a Harold Lloyd comeback he titled ``The Sin
of Harold Diddlebock.''
	   An actor read pages from the script, and the great man nodded
approvingly. With his trim mustache, handsome features and deep,
cultivated voice, he resembled an actor himself.
	   ``Diddlebock'' turned into a disaster. Hughes kept demanding
changes, finally cut the film himself and released it as ``Mad
Wednesday.'' It was a resounding failure.
	   Darryl Zanuck hired Sturges for two films at Fox: ``Unfaithfully
Yours,'' a romantic comedy with Rex Harrison and Linda Darnell, and
a Betty Grable Western, ``The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend.''
Both showed signs of the Sturges brilliance, but failed to find an
audience. Sturges' Hollywood career had ended.
	   He exiled himself to Paris, the scene of his youthful days. He
managed to make one last film, ``The French They Are a Funny
Race,'' released in the United States in 1955 to little notice.
	   ``He remained the boulevardier,'' Wilder recalls. ``He occupied
a table at the Alexander cafe on the Avenue George V, cadging
drinks from American tourists who passed by.''
	   On Christmas Day, 1958, he returned to New York with plans of
reviving his career. He died a few weeks later at the age of 60.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Three men have told police that with the
backing of Osama bin Laden they ran a fishmongering business to
cover their preparations to bomb the U.S. embassy in Nairobi.
	   Disguised as fish merchants delivering their Indian Ocean catch
to restaurants and hotels, the trio said they tried to blend into
the commercial crush around the embassy, according to Saturday's
Daily Nation newspaper in Kenya.
	   The newspaper _ which earlier had reported that three men were
spotted filming the embassy days before the devastating Aug. 7
car-bomb attack _ said the three suspects confessed to authorities
that they had carried out surveillance prior to the attack.
	   Neither Kenyan police nor FBI officials investigating the
bombing would comment on the report, which publicly named two of
the suspects in custody for the first time.
	   They were identified as Khalid Salim, who held a Yemeni
passport, and Abdallah Nacha, said to be Lebanese. U.S. and Kenyan
officials already had named another suspect in custody, Mohammed
Saddiq Odeh.
	   The embassy bombing, on one of the Kenyan capital's most
congested streets, killed 247 people and injured more than 5,000.
Another 10 people died in a nearly simultaneous blast at the U.S.
Embassy in Dar es Salaam, in neighboring Tanzania.
	   Odeh was arrested in Pakistan the day of the bombings and
returned a week later to Nairobi. Days later, FBI agents and Kenyan
detectives raided a hotel in Nairobi about a mile (kilometer) from
the embassy that may have been used as a staging ground for the
attack.
	   The other two men were arrested after Odeh reportedly told
police they were his accomplices.
	   Under questioning, the three confessed that with financial
backing from millionaire Saudi militant bin Laden, they plotted the
bombing while pretending to be fish merchants based in Mombasa, an
Indian Ocean port city, the newspaper account said.
	   Such a business would provide a ready explanation for
transporting cargo between the coastal region and Kenya's capital,
and for frequenting the downtown district where the embassy was
located.
	   The report, coupled with a raid by investigators in a coastal
town on Friday, suggested that Mombasa and surrounding areas were
becoming a focus of the probe. The city, a trade center for
centuries, is east Africa's major port.
	   Witnesses reported that FBI agents and Kenyan police raided a
home Friday in the coastal town of Malindi and detained the
homeowner.
	   The FBI and Kenyan police have declined to comment on that raid.
	   On the political front, both the Kenyan and Tanzanian
governments remained silent about Thursday's U.S. cruise missile
strikes on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan, sites that the Clinton
administration has linked to bin Laden.
	   Even before the U.S. strikes, many Kenyans feared their country
could become a venue for fresh attacks by those who carried out the
embassy bombings. Those worries intensified with the U.S. reprisal
raids.
	   ``America, like any other country, has the right to protect its
citizens,'' said an editorial on Saturday in the East Africa
Standard. ``But America must also ensure that the innocent are not
made to suffer because of its quarrel with its enemies.''
	   Meanwhile, the United Nations said the fatal shooting of an
Italian soldier working with the United Nations in the Afghan
capital, Kabul, was a deliberate attack.
	   The soldier, Lt. Col. Carmine Calo, died Saturday, the day after
he was shot as he drove through Kabul. A civilian U.N. worker from
France was injured. The Taliban, which rule Afghanistan, said 13
people have been detained in connection with the shooting.
	   James Ngobi, acting head of the U.N. Afghan mission, said the
two men were in a clearly marked U.N. vehicle when gunmen drove
head-on at the car, forcing Calo to stop, then fired into the front
seat with automatic weapons.

	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Bonnie strengthened into the Atlantic
season's first hurricane Saturday, a 300-mile-long
(480-kilometer-long) storm dwarfing sparsely populated Bahamian
islands on its route, that could threaten the southeastern United
States.
	   Another hurricane gained strength in the Pacific Ocean but was
expected to peter out over open seas.
	   At 8 p.m. (0000 GMT) Saturday, the National Hurricane Center
said Bonnie's center was located about 210 miles (335 kilometers)
east-southeast of San Salvador in the Bahamas, the island where
Columbus is believed to have first landed in the hemisphere.
	   Maximum sustained winds were estimated to have increased to near
95 mph (155 kph) and the hurricane was expected to grow stronger
during the next 24 hours, the meteorologists said.
	   ``People along the southeastern U.S. should pay attention to its
progress,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the hurricane center.
	   He said Bonnie could eventually strengthen to a Category 3 storm
with winds more than 111 mph (178 kph) capable of causing extensive
damage.
	   Though the hurricane nearly stalled for part of the day
Saturday, Bonnie was expected to resume its north-northwest tack
and move at 10-12 mph (16-19 kph) on Sunday, the hurricane center
said.
	   Bahamian forecaster Basil Dean said the islands closest to the
hurricane would experience waves 6 to 9 feet above normal, and
Bonnie's storm surge and rain could cause local flooding.
	   Bahamian radio warned the islands' fishing fleet and yachters to
make for safe port. The Bahamas Air-Sea Rescue Association said
some U.S. yachters had turned back to Florida.
	   The islands' meteorological department said Bonnie would have
the greatest effect on San Salvador island, which could see five to
10 inches of rain, while more populated areas, including the
capital of Nassau, were unlikely to suffer as much from the storm.
	   Three inches of rain was reported in the Turks and Caicos
Islands at the southeast end of the Bahamas chain.
	   Saturday evening, the hurricane warning was discontinued in the
Turks and Caicos and was downgraded to a tropical storm warning in
the southeastern Bahamas.
	   North Florida is the most likely target to be hit if the storm
reaches the mainland. Still, the storm could veer out to sea and
miss the U.S. coast entirely, Jarrell said.
	   Meanwhile, another weather system that threatened parts of Texas
lost power Saturday.
	   All warnings were discontinued when Tropical Storm Charley
weakened to a depression, though the hurricane center warned small
vessels to remain in port along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico
until winds and waves that reached 10 feet (3 meters) subside.
	   The threat of heavy rains and a storm forced the evacuation of
thousands of people from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   As it moved into Texas, Matagorda Island was hit the hardest
with 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain and 70 mph (110 kph) wind
gusts early Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ This small ambitious emirate
got the nickname, Hong Kong of the Middle East, for its role as a
commercial hub, shopping mecca and top tourist draw for the
surrounding region.
	   Now it wants to add another notch to its belt _ Hollywood of the
Gulf.
	   Multi-millionaire businessman Khalaf al-Habtoor, the man behind
the vision, has plans. Big plans.
	   He has invested dlrs 100 million in film development in Dubai,
brought in superstars Patrick Swayze and Jean-Claude Van Damme to
discuss future film roles, and envisions building a film school and
studio.
	   Some see oil-rich Dubai _ with its stifling heat and
conservative Muslim views _ more as a source of investment than as
a setting for making movies for worldwide audiences.
	   But the bespectacled Al-Habtoor, 46, trim from hours of tennis,
disagrees.
	   ``Dubai is a natural choice. We are at the crossroads between
East and West. We have the infrastructure, varied locations, and
plenty of cheap labor,'' he says.
	   A number of movie-stars, screen-writers, directors and producers
have started flocking to Dubai, lured by the fledgling industry and
the potential investors.
	   Aether Media, formed by Gulf contractor Jumaa al-Naboodah and
British expatriate John Robins, is working on four film projects.
Robins says he found possible backers in Saudi Arabia and Qatar and
would like to lure others across the Gulf.
	   Canadian director Izidore Musallam, whose last film starred Omar
Sharif, arrived recently with the Egyptian film star looking for
financing for a new movie.
	   Next year, Al-Habtoor Entertainment will start filming ``The Eye
of the Falcon,'' an adventure tale set in the Gulf before the
discovery of oil whose double heroes are an Arab tribesman and an
American photographer.
	   Al-Habtoor says along with inviting Swayze and Van Damme to
discuss the Western lead, he talked to Steven Seagal. The movie's
British co-producer Dominic Berger says he found interest from
distributors in the United States, Britain, Germany and France.
	   Another planned al-Habtoor film would examine conspiracy
theories behind the death of the Arab world's most popular leader,
suggesting Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser may not have died
of a heart attack.
	   Al-Habtoor says he has twin goals in all his movie projects:
promoting both Dubai and Arab culture, which he feels has gotten a
bad rap on film.
	   ``There are a lot of wonderful stories in this part of the world
that would make great movies. And I would like to see Arabs shed in
a more realistic light, not only as bad guys or terrorists,'' he
says.
	   British screen-writer Gerry Sherard, who helped script ``The Eye
of the Falcon,'' plans a film with East-West interest. He bought
movie rights to a book about British pop star Cat Stevens, who
stopped singing at the height of his career after converting to
Islam.
	   ``A movie about someone like Cat Stevens, which might not find
financing in the West, has more of a chance here,'' he says.
	   Sherard is staying in Dubai because of his optimism over the
future of movie-making here. ``We need just one success story for
the industry to take off,'' he said.
	   However, many hurdles remain to the emirate becoming a Hollywood
of the Gulf.
	   Unlike Egypt and Syria _ which have made movies for decades _
Dubai has few experienced film people. Flying in talent would be
expensive.
	   Then there are the summer temperatures averaging 40 degrees
Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and humidity of 90 percent, which make
filming practical only half the year.
	   Al-Habtoor says his planned film school and the production
called complex ``Dreamland'' could overcome some of Dubai's
shortcomings, teaching film skills and allowing interior shots in
summer.
	   As for the expense of bringing in talent, al-Habtoor has an
edge. Among his properties are hotels, a car dealership and a
construction company, meaning he can put up and drive around actors
and technicians _ and even build sets.
	   But al-Habtoor, one of the emirate's wealthiest businessmen,
makes clear he's not motivated by charity in pushing Dubai as a
movie capital.
	   ``We're willing to break even or even incur a small loss on the
first two films. Then we expect to make money,'' he said.
``Otherwise we cannot continue. It has to be profitable.''

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels battling to topple President Laurent
Kabila have accused Angola of entering Congo's escalating war,
which already includes forces from Zimbabwe and threatens to engulf
other African states.
	   An Angolan government source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said on Saturday that troops would defend Kinshasa,
Congo's capital, although he gave no official word on his
government's position on the fighting. Neither did state-controlled
media.
	   Angolan troops landed in the west of this vast central African
country in support of Kabila's loyalist forces, a rebel leader said
without giving details.
	   ``Angolan troops have invaded Congo,'' Bizima Karaha said from
the rebel's stronghold of Goma in eastern Congo.
	   Karaha warned that the Angolan involvement will complicate the
crisis and the rebels will retaliate. Zimbabwe had earlier deployed
troops to help Kabila ward off rebel advances on the capital,
Kinshasa.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi denied that Angola had
deployed troops to Congo, but hinted that they would be sent before
long.
	   ``Certain African countries have offered their solidarity. They
have done this in a clear manner in full view of everyone,''
Mumengi told The Associated Press. ``As soon as Angola sends their
troops it will be done openly.''
	   The insurgents, who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, tribalism
and mismanagement of his vast African nation, drew within 18 miles
(28 kilometers) of the capital on Saturday.
	   In announcing that Angolan troops had crossed into Congo, Karaha
urged the Luanda government to ``come to its senses'' and withdraw
its forces.
	   Angola's entry into Congo's civil war came as South Africa
scrambled to salvage a crumbling regional peace summit in Pretoria.
Two key leaders snubbed the talks _ Kabila and Zimbabwe's President
Robert Mugabe, who is supporting the Kinshasa government with
troops and military equipment.
	   With the intervention of Angolan forces, chances of a negotiated
settlement are ``almost impossible,'' Karaha said.
	   Earlier Saturday, Karaha said rebels had shot down two warplanes
allied with Kabila's forces.
	   Karaha said the Zimbabwean planes were shot down over rebel
territory in southwestern Congo. The report could not be
independently confirmed.
	   In the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, President Robert Mugabe's
spokesman rejected Congolese rebel claims that they shot down two
Zimbabwean jet fighters.
	   Spokesman George Charamba said Zimbabwe had not deployed its
Chinese-made MiG-21 interceptors and ground troops in support of
Kabila, the official Zimbabwe news agency reported.
	   ``We have no MiG fighters in DRC (the Democratic Republic of
Congo) ... our deployment in the DRC did not have that dimension,''
the agency quoted Charamba as saying.
	   In his statement to the state-run media, Charamba did not
mention the British Hawk ground attack jets or the Spanish Casa
transport planes _ suitable for dropping paratroopers _ which
Zimbabwe also possesses. He did not return repeated phone calls
seeking clarification.
	   There was no immediate comment from Kinshasa on the alleged
shootdown, but a former military intelligence officer with close
government ties said Kabila's army had recently acquired fighters
being flown by Cuban or Angolan pilots.
	   ``We know that the government does have air support
capabilities,'' the officer said on condition of anonymity.
	   Karaha said the attacks Saturday demonstrated the rebels'
resolve to continue fighting as long as outside forces were
involved.
	   ``It should be understood that the people of Congo are ready to
resist any foreign aggression,'' he said of the reported arrival of
more than 600 troop reinforcements from Zimbabwe and a contingent
from Angola in support of Kabila.
	   The rebels themselves are said to have the backing of
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.
	   In Pretoria, South African President Nelson Mandela had ``an
exchange of views'' with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and
Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, according to Mandela's
spokesman, Parks Mankahlana.
	   There was no immediate comment from participants in the talks on
either the movement of Angolan troops into Congo or the purported
shootdown of the Zimbabwean warplanes.
	   Kabila declined to come and instead sent his justice minister,
Mwenze Kongolo, who arrived late Saturday, well beyond the time
when the peace talks began.
	   Museveni threatened to join the rebel side if other foreign
forces do not withdraw from Congo.
	   ``Uganda may be forced after due consultations to take its own
independent action in the protection of its own security,''
Museveni said in the statement released in his capital.
	   Karaha accused Kabila of ordering the execution of 20,000 ethnic
Tutsis in Moba in southeastern Congo, a move which he said prompted
the rebels to advance to the Lake Tanganyika port of Kalemie.

For artists in Taos, it's more of a struggle than ever

<TEXT>
	   TAOS, New Mexico (AP) _ Two decades ago, Susan Ammann quit her
lucrative job as a Wall Street investment banker to spin a potter's
wheel in this eclectic artists' town.
	   The majestic mountains, piercing sunlight and rugged landscape
gave her confidence that she could survive as an artist. After all,
it had inspired painter Georgia O'Keeffe, photographer Ansel Adams
and writers D.H. Lawrence and Willa Cather.
	   Ammann had spent most of her Wall Street cash on traveling, but
that didn't matter in Taos, a town of hippies and artists
struggling to make ends meet.
	   Now it appears Taos has fallen victim to its own charms,
beguiling the rich and famous, such as actress Julia Roberts, at
the expense of longtime residents whose works may never captivate
the gallery crowd.
	   As the town celebrates a century as an art colony, Mayor
Frederick Peralta says the rising cost of land and housing could
threaten Taos' future as a home for struggling artists.
	   ``Now, people don't have to struggle. They just buy their way
in,'' Ammann said. ``It's still an art community, but it's
changing.''
	   In Taos County, per capita income barely reached dlrs 15,000 and
average household income was estimated at less than dlrs 25,000 in
1995, the most recent year for which figures are available. Today,
the median cost of a home is dlrs 162,000.
	   ``It's harder for young struggling artists to survive here,''
said Tom Decker, director of the Taos Institute of Arts.
	   While the county commission tries to ensure that affordable
housing is included in development plans, the city of Taos has set
aside dlrs 2.5 million in bond money to buy land where 124 homes
will be built and sold below market value.
	   The price will be around dlrs 89,000. Buyers will have to show
they earn less than dlrs 39,000 annually, the mayor said. As the
owners pay their mortgages, the town will reinvest the money in
more housing.
	   Artist Ed Sandoval, whose framed oil paintings fetch up to dlrs
10,000, says some of his artist pals take second jobs to make ends
meet. Others, in search of a cheaper place, have headed to small
southern Colorado towns that are geographically and culturally
reminiscent of the old Taos.
	   For Sandoval, the ``inspiring colors'' of the enormous white
clouds and glowing sunsets in Taos make the high cost worthwhile.
	   That inspiration is what captivated the artists who first
stumbled upon Taos a century ago. ``There's something intangible
about it,'' said Skip Miller co-director of the Kit Carson Historic
Museums. ``The artists saw and felt the same things.''
	   Snowcapped mountains stand in sharp contrast to the Rio Grande
gorge, 600 feet (180 meters) deep. Creeks trickle through the
rustic landscape where cattle roam. And there's an almost blinding
sunlight. With an elevation of 7,000 feet (2,133 meters), the thin
air forms a deep blue sky with little humidity to soften the sun's
rays.
	   As long as the area retains its beauty, many say, the artists
will remain.
	   ``I don't see Taos as ever not being an art colony (although) it
may be other things as well,'' said Betsy Carey, executive director
of the 650-member Taos Art Association.
	   In 1898, Taos was a poor trading town of a few thousand American
Indians and Hispanics, with dirt streets, mud houses and acres of
wheat and barley, when Ernest Blumenschein came in search of a
blacksmith.
	   He and fellow artist Bert Phillips were heading to Mexico on a
quest to sketch the Wild West before it disappeared. The two were
rolling across rugged trails through northern New Mexico when their
wagon lost a wheel. Blumenschein lost a coin toss and lugged the
broken part into Taos.
	   ``He absolutely fell in love,'' Miller said.
	   Blumenschein stayed for three months, then headed to New York.
He returned several times before persuading his wife to permanently
settle in 1919. Phillips immediately made it his permanent home.
	   Credit for making Taos an art colony also goes to American
artist Joseph Henry Sharp who visited in 1893 and spread word of
its beauty. More artists arrived, and in 1915 a group of six formed
the Taos Society of Artists. The Santa Fe railroad began buying
their paintings to promote tourism. Southwestern landscapes and
pictures of Indians in traditional dress began to appear in
stations across America.
	   The area grew in popularity, and artists would gather daily to
share ideas and inspirations. ``They created a whole new world. It
was almost a utopia,'' Miller said.
	   New York heiress Mabel Dodge Luhan settled in Taos in 1918 and
provided a catalyst for the burgeoning art community. As grande
dame of her own intellectual salon, she invited dozens of famous
painters, writers and activists to her home.
	   She lured Lawrence by sending Indian jewelry to his wife,
Frieda, and promised that Taos was the haven he was seeking.
	   O'Keeffe, a pioneer of Southwestern modernism, lived and worked
in the tiny northern New Mexico town of Abiquiu from 1949 until a
few years before her death in 1986.
	   Taos is now a town of about 6,200 in a county of about 25,600.
It has some 90 art galleries.
	   In the vein of the old salons, artists continue to gather
regularly to discuss, critique and inspire each other.
	   ``Walking down the street, any way you go,'' Carey said, ``the
creative energy is happening.''

At the movies: `Blade'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Film opened Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By NIKI KAPSAMBELIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In the mood for a little gore? How about a nice
decapitation to finish off the summer? Or maybe some impromptu
dentistry?
	   Be forewarned: while ``Blade'' is a stylish, original twist on
the comic-book action movie, it's also harrowingly graphic.
	   The film opens at an underground vampire nightclub beneath the
floor of a slaughterhouse. As dancers gyrate, blood sprays from the
ceiling.
	   Enter Blade, played by Wesley Snipes, a sword-wielding mutant
who hunts vampires in hopes of keeping them from taking over the
world.
	   The film deftly sidesteps cliches and delivers a complex plot
that's quickly moved along with more intelligent dialogue than is
typical for this genre. These vampires deal in things like politics
and offshore accounts; one of them is bored, unshaven pretty boy
Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) who's threatening the world with
apocalypse.
	   Blade, who looks like a cross between Robocop and Tim Burton's
version of Batman, fights vampires because he is angry that one of
them chomped on his mother when she was pregnant, causing her to
die as he was born. The bite also altered his genetic makeup,
turning him into a half-human, half-vampire who can withstand
traditional vampire weapons like garlic and daylight but still
thirsts for blood.
	   Joining him in his fight are the requisite codger sidekick (in
this case, Kris Kristofferson playing a vengeful, cancer-stricken
old man whose family was wiped out by vampires) and a young
hematologist (N'bushe Wright) who works to find a cure for vampire
blood after she is bitten by an undead corpse in a hospital.
	   There's plenty of action to go around, especially in fight
sequences where Snipes gets to show off his real-life martial arts
prowess. But this action is smartly paired with a storyline that
has oedipal and Christian overtones. When Blade is finally reunited
with his mother, who has become a vampire, she acts seductively
toward him. And when his hands and feet are impaled in a climactic
torture scene, his blood is drained into a chalice.
	   The film is based on a Marvel comic book character who debuted
in 1973 and is described by screenwriter David S. Goyer as ``Shaft
with a stake.''
	   The extreme violence _ including exploding corpses and many
lingering closeups of needles piercing skin _ is set to a grinding,
repetitive beat that somehow makes the scenes even more disturbing.
	   Detracting somewhat from the film's overall impression are the
special effects, which at times are too obviously generated by a
computer and almost look as though they were drawn onto the screen
with a set of felt-tip pens. Audiences are getting more
sophisticated about computer animation, and if filmmakers are going
to use it, they have to be more discreet.
	   The ending of ``Blade'' clearly leaves room for a sequel. With
any luck, Snipes and the filmmakers will avoid the diluted formula
that has plagued the ``Batman'' series.
	   ``Blade,'' a New Line Cinema release, was produced by Amen Ra
Films in association with Imaginary Forces. It was directed by
Stephen Norrington, produced by Peter Frankfurt, Wesley Snipes and
Robert Engelman and written by David S. Goyer. Running time: 2
hours.

Common thread in James Carter's new album is the Hammond organ
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With ARTS-US-James Carter &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The common thread running through James Carter's
new album ``In Carterian Fashion'' (Atlantic) is the Hammond organ.
The 10 tracks each feature one of three organists _ Cyrus Chestnut,
Henry Butler and Craig Taborn _ backing Carter and his band.
	   ``Our premise is to give an overview of the importance of the
organ in the black music experience,'' said Carter. ``Whatever the
situation, there's a certain soul that I've grown up hearing in the
organ.''
	   The selections go back to the spiritual roots (``Trouble in the
World'') through the tenor-organ combo sound of the 1950s
(``Lockjaw's Lament'') and up to 1970s disco funk (``In Carterian
Fashion'') and more modern free-form (``Odyssey'').
	   Carter has recently been in the studio working on pianist
Chestnut's new album and performing tunes from ``Porgy and Bess''
for Herbie Hancock's ``Gershwin's World,'' a tribute marking the
centennial of George Gershwin's birth.
	   Although his stylistic tastes might seem eclectic, Carter sees
the link between jazz past and present.
	   ``The way I was brought up musically is that the music doesn't
really separate. ... To me it all just relates. One wouldn't be
existing without the other. I've heard Lester (Bowie) do certain
things on trumpet that I've also heard `Sweets' (Edison) do,'' said
Carter. ``The music to me is all a part of one continuum.''

James Carter: he's got sax appeal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With ARTS-James Carter Album &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photo NY344 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHARLES J. GANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ James Carter swaggers onto the Bryant Park
bandstand in midtown Manhattan for his JVC Jazz Festival set with
the self-assuredness of a young Muhammad Ali. He is cocky,
handsome, charismatic and, at times, playful and humorous.
	   The 29-year-old saxophonist is a legitimate contender for the
tenor title long held by Sonny Rollins. Although tenor sax is his
main horn, because Carter says ``it comes closest to the human
voice,'' he also ranks among the top vote-getters in jazz magazine
polls for soprano and baritone sax and miscellaneous instrument
(bass clarinet).
	   On a balmy late summer evening in the park, Carter shows the
audience what sets him apart from many of his contemporaries who
are locked into a neotraditionalist approach. Leading his quintet,
he covers a full spectrum of jazz styles from swing to the
avant-garde _ sometimes in a single piece. His influences include
not only the legendary jazz saxophonists, but also Jimi Hendrix
(for his multinote playing and freedom of expression) and old
Warner Bros. cartoons with orchestra music by Carl Stalling (for
the use of sound effects to express emotions).
	   As Carter bobs and weaves _ using body language to punctuate his
powerful playing _ the audience begins to react. A female fan
shouts out ``talk to me'' and ``work it'' when Carter gets down and
dirty in a funk groove in the title piece to his new album, ``In
Carterian Fashion'' (Atlantic). Suddenly, it's as if he's playing
just for her _ and not a crowd of several thousand.
	   ``In essence, I feel that there should be a dialogue with the
audience, just in general bringing the music back to the people,''
said Carter. ``There's a point where the audience needs to be able
to identify with certain things.''
	   Carter wants to reach beyond the hard-core jazz audience. He was
among the young jazz lions featured in Robert Altman's 1996 film
``Kansas City'' _ ``a jazz memory'' of the director's hometown in
the 1930s. He was appropriately cast as the aggressive-playing and
flirtatious tenor saxophonist Ben Webster.
	   There's no question that Carter has both sex and sax appeal.
He's now represented by Wilhelmina Models. He was ``The Cat in the
Hat'' in a July 1997 GQ magazine spread in which he modeled clothes
by some of his favorite designers, including Giorgio Armani and
Joseph Abboud.
	   ``James is a natural,'' said Kevin Jones, creative director at
Wilhelmina. ``He is attractive, wears clothes very well, and is
making a fashion statement. ... It's a strong, positive black male
image.''
	   Beneath his brash, bold image, Carter holds deep-rooted core
values. He wants his music to be accessible, but doesn't water it
down into a pablum for the ears. He describes what he does as
``edutainment.''
	   Carter grew up in a musical family in Detroit, and describes
music ``as the glue that kept us together.'' He began studying
saxophone at 11. As a teen-ager, he was invited to play some dates
with Wynton Marsalis. He moved to New York in 1990. He made his
first recording as a leader in Japan (``JC on the Set'') in 1993.
His 1995 Atlantic debut, ``The Real Quietstorm,'' established him
as a saxophone contender.
	   Carter, who lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side with his wife
Tevis, a former model, is obsessed with the history of his
instrument. He is constantly tinkering with his collection of
dozens of saxophones and other woodwind instruments. While on tour,
he visits saxophone makers and can trace the history of instruments
back to the date they were shipped from the factory.
	   He holds a deep respect for the jazz tradition and its elder
statesmen. His 1996 album ``Conversin' With the Elders'' (Atlantic)
paired Carter with some of the musicians who were his mentors and
who inspired him _ from swing veterans, trumpeter Harry ``Sweets''
Edison and tenor saxophonist Buddy Tate of the Count Basie band, to
modernists, baritone saxophonist Hamiett Bluiett and trumpeter
Lester Bowie.
	   ``My initial concept was just being thankful for individuals who
helped my development,'' said Carter. ``As opposed to giving them a
posthumous tribute, this was an active one where these individuals
are still alive and able to play. ... How many people do you find
nowadays up in Harlem who are actually conversing with the elders
as opposed to backlashing at them?''

Singh clings to lead in tightening International
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RECAPS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTLE ROCK, Colorado (AP) _ Tiger Woods made the most noise,
but steady, reserved Vijay Singh stayed in control after three
rounds of the Sprint International.
	   Singh, withstanding two eagles including a hole-in-one from the
onrushing Woods, clung to a narrow lead on Saturday. Singh, who
began the day with a 4-point lead under the modified Stableford
scoring system used in this event, saw his margin trimmed to a
point.
	   The recently crowned PGA champion had four birdies and two
bogeys in a solid if unspectacular round at Castle Pines Golf Club,
which for the first time in three days was spared delays from
lightning and rain. He added 6 points to his total for 33, just 1
ahead of Willie Wood and 2 ahead of Woods.
	   Another point back on a tightly bunched leaderboard was Rocco
Mediate. Defending champion Phil Mickelson also surged, finishing
at 29. The top 12 players were separated by only 8 points.
	   ``The leaderboard is so bunched up right now,'' Singh said. ``I
think anybody within 6 points is in it.
	   ``I didn't play as well today as I did yesterday. I hit a lot of
pretty average shots. But I'm happy to finish in the lead. I didn't
let it go. I hung on to it, I grinded it out to the end. I'm still
leading, and I'm still very positive about my game.''
	   The International's scoring format awards 5 points for an eagle,
2 for birdie, zero for par, minus-1 for bogey and minus-3 for
double-bogey or worse.
	   Points accumulate over all four rounds. The field, cut after 36
holes, was cut again to the top 36 scorers and ties for Sunday's
final round. Among those missing the 54-hole cut were Ernie Els,
Jim Furyk and U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen.
	   While Singh's point total hovered around the low 30s most of the
day, the diminutive Wood was a surprising presence among the
leaders on a course that favors long hitters.
	   Wood had eight birdies, including five of the last six holes. He
sank long-range birdie putts of 30, 20, 20, 18, 15 and 12 feet, and
lipped out a 50-foot eagle attempt at the par-5 17th.
	   ``This course favors a big hitter who hits the ball high, and
that's not me,'' said Wood, 97th on the PGA Tour money list. ``A
lot of tournaments I go into thinking about winning. Not this one.
But if I keep putting the way I've been, I can win this.''
	   But it was a Tiger who roared the loudest. Woods, whose
second-round struggles left him 10 points behind Singh, wasted no
time making a move in the third round.
	   He eagled the 644-yard (588 meters) , par-5 first hole, lacing a
4-iron second shot 257 yards (234 meters) over trees and finishing
2 1/2 feet from the cup. Then, creating a thundering roar from the
gallery that Mediate called the loudest he had ever heard on a golf
course, Woods knocked an 8-iron shot into the cup on the fly at the
185-yard (169-meter) seventh hole for the third hole-in-one of his
pro career.
	   Woods also had two eagles Thursday, and his four eagles broke
the tournament record of three by Lee Janzen in 1995 and Mark
Brooks last year.
	   The ace moved Woods to 28 points, and he added a birdie at No. 8
to tie Singh for the lead at 30. Woods momentarily held the lead
after a birdie at 14, but missed greens at 15 and 16 cost him
bogeys.
	   ``I actually hit that 8-iron a little thin,'' Woods said. ``I
thought it was going to be about 10 feet short.
	   ``I'm right where I'd like to be. I'm very happy where I'm at.''
	   Woods had a 4-under-par round, but it was worth 14 points. Asked
if he wondered where this scoring system had been all his life, he
said, ``Boy, you ain't lying. Considering all the bad shots I've
hit this week, I'm thankful.''
	   Mediate also had eight birdies, five on his back nine. Fully
recovered from back surgery and trimmed down, Mediate called his
round ``very exciting. It was an easy day, if there is such a
thing.''
	   Mickelson shot himself into contention with six birdies and an
eagle in a 16-point round.
	   Mickelson _ the only multiple winner of this tournament, having
also won in 1993 _ birdied three straight holes on the front nine,
but made his biggest move at the par-5 17th. He hit his second
shot, a 6-iron from 202 yards (184 meters), 10 feet (3 meters) from
the pin and made the eagle putt worth 5 points.
	   ``After two rounds of putting very poorly, I thought I needed to
get to 30 points today, so this was a good day, obviously,''
Mickelson said. ``The big turnaround for me was 17. I badly needed
an eagle to get within striking distance of the lead.''
	   Steve Flesch was at 28 points, Brandt Jobe at 27 and Mark Brooks
at 26.
	   Grouped at 25 were Davis Love III, Steve Elkington, Peter
Jacobsen and Kirk Triplett.

Five Questions with James Marsden: from nerdy teen to the big
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   At 24, James Marsden bears more than a passing resemblance to
Tom Cruise, so it's hard to believe he was ever a misfit. But
Marsden insists that before he took his first drama class in Putnam
City North High School in his hometown of Oklahoma City, his social
ineptitude had his mother worried.
	   ``I was kind of this nerdy kid who didn't wear the cool clothes,
and I weighed 100 pounds (45 kilograms),'' he says. ``My mom saw
that I was not quick to get involved in the cliques in school. She
wanted me to try out for sports, get involved in the drama class.
She thought getting up and performing in front of people would let
down my guard.''
	   In ``Disturbing Behavior,'' his first big-screen film, Marsden
must keep his guard up.
	   The clever teen thriller is about how some creative
brain-tinkering by a guidance counselor turns slacker high-school
students into overachievers _ and violent killers.
	   It also stars 19-year-old Katie Holmes of U.S. television's
``Dawson's Creek.'' She plays Marsden's love interest in the film.
Marsden considers her a good friend. ``She's got a great sense of
humor and more talent than she needs to have at that age,'' he
says, laughing.
	   Marsden was her age when he packed up his car and headed for Los
Angeles in search of an acting career. ``My dad said he'd support
me financially for one year so I could concentrate on getting
parts.
	   ``I was very lucky that my dad grew up with a casting director
who's now in L.A. who knew a manager who was actually legitimate
and agreed to take me on,'' he says. ``You can easily fall into the
wrong hands in Hollywood.''
	   Success came with small roles in U.S. TV shows like ``The
Nanny'' and ``Saved by the Bell.'' In between acting stints, he
modeled Versace.
	   Marsden was the original Griffin on the Fox hit, ``Party of
Five,'' which he left to join the cast of ABC's ``Second Noah.''
That series was canceled after 1 1-2 seasons but it showcased
Marsden's singing talents when his character joined a rock band.
	   Later, Marsden appeared with Vanessa Redgrave in the CBS
miniseries, ``Bella Mafia.'' His movie-of-the-week credits include
``Ambush in Waco,'' ``Taken Away,'' ``Search and Rescue'' and ``On
the Edge of Innocence.''
	   1. ``Disturbing Behavior'' makes some interesting points about
the dangers of conformity. Do you think they apply in real life?
	   Marsden: I think people can fall into the trap of belonging to a
group just because they're socially accepted among their peers.
Especially when it's against their personality. Somebody who has no
interest in doing drugs or drinking will hang out with those people
just because they think they're cool. That's one of the main things
that kids lie to themselves about.
	   2. In addition to being an actor, you're also a trained singer,
right?
	   Marsden: I've kind of let my voice go a bit. In high school and
college I was always in vocal training classes and kept it in
really good shape. I love Frank Sinatra and Bobby Darin. I love
that kind of singing.
	   3. Would you like to sing on the big screen?
	   Marsden: Yes. I'm so upset that the movie musical has frittered
away. Ever since 'Grease' there hasn't been anything. I would love
to do a new kind of 'Grease' movie or an old movie like 'Singin' in
the Rain' shot in Technicolor.
	   4. When you were in the miniseries ``Bella Mafia'' did you pick
up any acting tips from Vanessa Redgrave?
	   Marsden: What I learned is that you always have to stick up for
yourself as an actor because ultimately you're the person up on the
screen. I would see her working on the set and the director would
say to do one thing and she would absolutely not do it. Some people
see that as difficult but I see it as sticking up for what you know
is right.
	   5. You once said you had no ambition whatsoever and that's why
you dropped out of Oklahoma State University. Is that true?
	   Marsden: I say it with a sense of humor. It seemed like there
wasn't anything in college that I wanted to go after. I didn't want
to settle for anything like being an insurance agent or a news
broadcaster. I wanted to give acting a shot.

	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Scott Erickson pitched a seven-hitter for his
AL-best ninth complete game and the Baltimore Orioles took
advantage of eight walks and a balk to beat the Cleveland Indians
6-3 Saturday.
	   Cal Ripken homered for the Orioles, who snapped a two-game
losing streak and improved to 31-10 since the All-Star break.
Baltimore has not lost three straight since July 3-5.
	   Manny Ramirez hit his 30th homer for Cleveland, which fell to
8-13 in August.
	   Erickson (14-9) struck out five and walked four. The
right-hander has won his last three starts and is 6-2 in his last
nine appearances.
	   Indians starter Bartolo Colon (13-7) allowed only five hits in 5
1-3 innings, but issued six walks in his second straight game.
Three of those walks turned into runs.
	   In Oakland, Gil Heredia pitched six strong innings in his first
major league start since 1995 in the first game of a doubleheader.
	   Heredia (1-0) allowed two runs and six hits for his first win
since 1996. The right-hander, who has spent parts of the last few
seasons bouncing between the minors and majors, was making his
first start since Aug. 30, 1995, when he pitched for Montreal at
San Diego.
	   Oakland scored in five out of seven innings against Brian
Moehler (12-10), who gave up seven runs _ six earned _ with a
season-high five walks.
	   T.J. Mathews pitched three innings for his first save.

	   In the spotlight: Elvis Costello
	    &UR; Personal stats: Elvis Costello was born Declan Patrick McManus
on Aug. 25, 1954, in Liverpool, Merseyside, England. He quit school
at 15. He moved to London, where he worked as a computer operator
at a perfume factory. He formed his own band, Flip City, and began
moonlighting on the local club scene, honing his songwriting
skills. By 1976, he was sending demo tapes to record companies.
	    &UR; A pseudonym is born: His great-grandmother's name was Costello.
He started using the name D.P. Costello after Flip City disbanded.
After signing with Stiff Records, he changed his first name, saying
``I thought Elvis was a better name than Jesus, and almost as
exclusive.'' In 1977, he made his live debut as Elvis Costello at
the Nashville in London. Shortly thereafter, he quit his day job at
the perfume factory.
	    &UR; Stardom comes: ``My Aim Is True,'' Costello's debut album, was
hailed by critics. More than a dozen albums later, he has clearly
demonstrated that he never plows the same musical furrow twice. His
songs have flirted with various aspects of pop music _ like
``Everyday I Write the Book,'' ``Watching the Detectives'' and
``Alison'' _ as well as country, folk, Irish traditional, baroque
pop, jazz and children's music.
	   ``I'm not trying to annoy them,'' he says of his listeners. ``I
have to be prepared to lose people who want everything to stay the
same, in order to gain the people who are prepared to listen with
all their heart. That's much more important, really.''
	    &UR; Recently: Costello worked with Brian Eno on the track ``My Dark
Life'' for the compilation CD, ``Songs in the Key of X,'' music
from and inspired by the popular U.S. television show ``The
X-Files.''
	    &UR; What the critics think: ``Perhaps the most versatile and adept
of rock's many literate non-singers, Costello employs a wide range
of peculiar inflections and punning emphases,'' says Rolling Stone
magazine. ``Underneath the churning, impatient veneer lurks a
fan-turned-musician with a startling command of roots.''

<TEXT>
	   ALMOLOYA DE JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) _ A pretrial hearing took a
bizarre twist Saturday when a defendant told the judge that his
profession was ``kidnapping.''
	   Daniel Arizmendi, 40, known as the ``ear-loper'' for allegedly
sending ransom notes attached to his victims' ears, refused to
enter a plea in the case, saying he was tired after three days of
police questioning.
	   His mistress, Dulce Maria Paz Venegas is also on trial and also
would not enter a plea.
	   When Judge Armando Baez Espinoza asked Arizmendi to repeat
himself, the Arizmendi replied: ``I do kidnappings ... I am a
kidnapper.''
	   Their court-appointed lawyer asked that the hearing be recessed
until Thursday, and the judge ordered the couple held without bail.
	   Arizmendi is accused of kidnapping, racketeering, laundering
money from ransom payments and illegal possession of firearms. Paz
is accused of racketeering and money laundering.
	   ___ &UR; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A famous theater and television comic was
wounded during a holdup in Mexico City on Saturday, but managed to
kill one of the gunmen before he was shot.
	   A police report said Eduardo Manzano suffered three bullet
wounds during the shoot-out in the midtown neighborhood of Roma and
was hospitalized in serious but stable condition.
	   Manzano was buying film at a photographic shop when three armed
men rushed in, the police report said. Manzano drew a gun and fired
at one of the men, killing him instantly.
	   The other two fired back, wounding Manzano, and fled in a
waiting automobile. The car was found by police abandoned a few
blocks away. Manzano was rushed to a hospital.
	   Mexico City has been hit by a crime wave in the past four years.
Police records show an average of 700 crimes involving a weapon
were committed every day in the Mexican capital last year,
resulting in six deaths daily.
	   ___
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Ecuadorean troops began to withdraw Saturday
from a disputed region where it fought a brief war with neighboring
Peru in 1995, easing a tense border standoff, Peru's Foreign
Ministry said.
	   ``The withdrawal should be concluded in seven days,'' a Foreign
Ministry news release said.
	   There's been no official comment from Ecuador on the withdrawal.
The ministry news release did not mention if the Peru's troops were
also withdrawing.
	   Peru charged two weeks ago that 300 Ecuadorean troops had
infiltrated its territory and were ``face-to-face'' with Peruvian
troops in a remote stretch of mountainous jungle 560 miles north of
Lima.
	   Ecuador denied the charge, saying the border was undefined in
the area, known as the Cordillera del Condor.
	   Fears of a war were defused on Aug. 13, when Peru and Ecuador
agreed to allow the deployment of international peacekeepers in the
area as a prelude to the removal of both countries' troops and the
creation of a temporary demilitarized zone.
	   The countries have fought wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over their
disputed border. In the last two, fighting was over 49 miles (78
kilometers) of unmarked border.

Movie winners and losers from the fat Summer of `98

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ This summer's movies weren't for the
faint-hearted, what with all the flying meteors, whizzing German
bullets, slashing swords, lethal black goo and that rampaging
lizard.
	   And yet people went to see them, and in droves. There was
something for every taste, no matter how bad, and at least two
serious Oscar contenders emerged, unusual for the popcorn season.
	   With so much on the menu, however, there was the constant
challenge to stand out, and more than a few films got buried,
leaving the summer with many winners and losers. Among them:
	   WINNER: The audience. The summer season is usually noted for its
sequels and mindless action movies _ not to mention mindless action
sequels _ and certainly the summer of 1998 had its share, from
``Lethal Weapon 4'' to ``Godzilla.'' But quality also could be
found in such Oscar-worthy fare as ``Saving Private Ryan'' and
``The Truman Show,'' raising the bar for the fall ``quality''
season.
	   The summer also offered one of the funniest comedies in some
time, ``There's Something About Mary,'' as well as one of the
better Disney animated features, ``Mulan,'' and not one but two
movies about menacing space debris in ``Armageddon'' and ``Deep
Impact.''
	   Movie-goers responded to the selection kindly. The summer is the
biggest on record in box office dollars, unadjusted for inflation,
at dlrs 2.16 billion from Memorial Day weekend through last
weekend, 10 percent ahead of last summer's dlrs 1.96 billion, the
previous record summer. And this year's figure doesn't include a
good chunk of the dlrs 139.6 million gross for ``Deep Impact,''
because the film opened two weeks before Memorial Day weekend.
	   LOSER: The blockbuster. Goodbye ``Men in Black,'' goodbye ``The
Lost World: Jurassic Park,'' goodbye ``Independence Day.'' The era
of the dlrs 200 million-plus super-hit died in the icy waters that
claimed ``Titanic'' _ at least for now.
	   The summer was marked by a series of triples, but no home runs,
with high production and marketing costs and profit-sharing deals
in which stars cut into profits even for the biggest films. The
good, but not stellar, performances of ``Godzilla'' and ``The
X-Files'' may also have snuffed out any potential sequels.
	   WINNER: Steven Spielberg. The most successful director in
Hollywood history reached an even higher level with ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' the epic that reinvented the war movie. Brutally
realistic, stunningly photographed and brilliantly acted, ``Ryan''
is marred only by a sappy plot device and some story lapses in the
middle, but otherwise stands out as one of the greatest combat
movies ever made. And it's raking in the money: dlrs 126 million
and growing. The only thing between Spielberg and another armload
of Oscars is the armload of Oscars he already won with
``Schindler's List.''
	   LOSER: George Clooney, who just can't seem to get his movie
career out of the ER, even when he's in a quality film. Clooney
shined in ``Out of Sight,'' a nifty Elmore Leonard adaptation, but
the movie fizzled at the box office and became another pit-stop in
Clooney's trail of tears: ``From Dusk Till Dawn,'' ``The
Peacemaker,'' ``Batman and Robin'' and ``One Fine Day.''
	   WINNER: Jerry Bruckheimer. All right, ``Armageddon'' may have
been a noisy, nonsensical testosterone case that made ``Deep
Impact'' look like ``Citizen Kane.'' But let's face it: The second
of the Earth-in-peril films was the top grossing movie of the
summer and the biggest in Disney's somewhat checkered live-action
history. It even topped ``Pretty Woman,'' and that has to count for
something.
	   Now settled in to working without Don Simpson, producer
Bruckheimer has proven that, like his late partner, he knows his
audiences, particularly those that are young and male.
	   LOSERS: MGM/UA and Universal Studios. The once-proud MGM, which
produced ``The Wizard of Oz'' and released ``Gone With the Wind,''
had a disappointment, ``Disturbing Behavior,'' and a turkey,
``Dirty Work,'' as its summer offerings. And while Universal's
parent company, Seagram, was off shopping for record labels in
Europe, the studio back home released the box office duds
``BASEketball'' and ``Out of Sight.''
	   WINNERS: Paramount and 20th Century Fox. As if these studios
didn't make enough from the joint production of ``Titanic,'' whose
revenues sloshed into the summer season, they had the
best-performing lineup of summer movies, with Paramount's ``Deep
Impact'' and ``The Truman Show'' and Fox's ``Dr. Dolittle,'' ``The
X-Files'' and ``There's Something About Mary.''
	   WINNER: The Farrelly Brothers, whose ``There's Something About
Mary'' proved that there's something about gross-out humor _ as
long as it's funny. The low-budget comedy from the makers of
``Kingpin'' and ``Dumb and Dumber'' had movie-goers howling in
spite of themselves. The sleeper hit of the summer found laughs in
all the wrong places, from gay sex to a very creative kind of hair
gel. Box office: nearly dlrs 100 million and holding strong.
	   LOSER: The other comedies. Even the creative forces behind
``Airplane!'' couldn't squeeze chuckles out of sports and organized
crime. ``BASEketball'' and ``Mafia'' fell far short of the
gut-splitting humor of ``Mary,'' which was released around the same
time. Box office: dlrs 6.7 million for ``BASEketball,'' dlrs 18.5
million for ``Mafia.''
	   WINNERS: Jim Carrey and Eddie Murphy. Carrey's restrained
performance (for him, anyway) as the unwitting star of his own
24-hour-TV program in ``The Truman Show'' generated the first Oscar
buzz of the year. It also propelled Carrey into the comedic acting
league of Robin Williams and Steve Martin. Murphy proved with ``Dr.
Dolittle'' that last year's transvestite incident didn't ruin his
box office appeal.
	   LOSERS: Art house films. Some of the best movies of the summer
played in the art houses, including ``The Opposite of Sex,''
``Smoke Signals,'' ``High Art'' and ``The Last Days of Disco,'' and
that was the problem: too much quality product. Still, look for
Oscar nominations from the actress ranks, particularly Ally Sheedy
in ``High Art'' and possibly Christina Ricci from ``The Opposite of
Sex.''
	   WINNER: Laurie Strode. Poor girl, it took 20 years to get
homicidal psychopath Michael Myers of the original ``Halloween''
off her back. But in ``Halloween: H20,'' Strode, played by Jamie
Lee Curtis, finally did just that, and made a bundle of dough along
the way. The modestly budgeted slasher film scored over dlrs 40
million at the box office, proving there's still money in blood.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Randy Johnson didn't get to face Kerry Wood, but
he did strike out Sammy Sosa.
	   Johnson allowed two hits in seven innings for his fourth victory
in five starts with Houston and Moises Alou went 4-for-5 with his
37th homer as the Astros beat the Chicago Cubs 8-3 Saturday.
	   Craig Biggio and Bill Spiers also homered for the Astros, who
won their 80th game and moved 8 1/2 games ahead of the Cubs in the
NL Central. Chicago entered the game tied with the Mets for the
lead in the NL wild-card race.
	   Johnson (4-1) didn't allow a hit after the second, walked three
and struck out nine, including Sosa in the third. The left-hander
gave up Glenallen Hill's fourth homer and a single to Scott
Servais.
	   Sosa went hitless in five at-bats _ 0-for-3 vs. Johnson _ with
one strikeout, leaving him with 49 homers. He trailed Mark McGwire,
who played Saturday night, by two homers.
	   The win pushed the Astros (80-50) 30 games over .500 for only
the second time in club history. Houston finished 96-66 in 1986 en
route to an NL West title.
	   Wood, Chicago's star rookie right-hander, pitched Friday despite
requests by Fox Sports to the Cubs to rest him another day to setup
a national-TV matchup with Johnson.
	   In New York, Mike Piazza hit his major league-leading fourth
grand slam, made a sliding catch into the Arizona dugout and threw
out a runner trying to steal.
	   The Mets, playing their fifth game in less than 48 hours,
rallied from an early 4-0 deficit. Bobby Jones (9-7), pitching on
three days' rest for the first time this season, helped New York
take a one-game lead in the NL wild-card race over Chicago.
	   Piazza hit the Mets' first slam of the year, keying a six-run
second inning against Andy Benes (11-12).
	   Piazza has drawn a mixed reaction from the home crowd ever since
the Mets got him from Florida in May, perhaps the result of high
expectations for the All-Star catcher.
	   There were scattered boos in the crowd of 42,654 when Piazza
struck out with runners on first and third in the opening inning,
but he quickly changed that in his next at-bat by turning a 4-2
deficit into a 6-4 lead.
	   In Atlanta, Walt Weiss and Gerald Williams each hit two-run
singles and Chipper Jones hit his 30th homer in a game that
included a second-inning brawl.
	   In the second inning, Atlanta's Andres Galarraga was hit by
Darren Dreifort's pitch and charged the mound. Galarraga swung at
Dreifort's head as he lunged toward the pitcher and the two players
fell to the ground as both dugouts emptied.
	   Braves starter Denny Neagle (12-11) picked up the win, allowing
three runs and six hits in five innings.
	   Kerry Ligtenberg pitched a perfect ninth for his 22nd save, and
now hasn't allowed an earned run in 20 games _ a span of 19 1-3
innings. He has recorded 16 straight saves since May 27.

	   During his heyday as a creator of movie satire, Preston Sturges
formulated a set of rules that should interest hopeful filmmakers:
	   _ A pretty girl is better than an ugly one.
	   _ A leg is better than an arm.
	   _ A bedroom is better than a living room.
	   _ An arrival is better than a departure.
	   _ A birth is better than a death.
	   _ A chase is better than a chat.
	   _ A dog is better than a landscape.
	   _ A kitten is better than a dog.
	   _ A baby is better than a kitten.
	   _ A kiss is better than a baby.
	   _ A pratfall is better than anything.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Victoria Gotti has this dream.
	   The author has just finished her latest best seller and
completed her round of interviews. She goes through the book
reviews and the newspaper clippings, and not one contains these
phrases:
	   _ Mafia princess.
	   _ Daughter of the don.
	   _ Capo di cutie capi.
	   ``In a perfect world,'' Ms. Gotti says with a sigh, ``in my
profession, you want to go before the camera or the critics as
Victoria Gotti the author, not Victoria Gotti, the daughter of ...
	   ``By the next book, maybe people will say, `The heck with the
background.'''
	   Or maybe not.
	   When your father is the jailed head of the Gambino crime family,
and your brother is allegedly his hand-picked successor, it's tough
to maintain that public perception of a career woman.
	   Things happen.
	   On this summer afternoon, shortly before an interview to promote
her second novel, ``I'll Be Watching You,'' Victoria put up her
dlrs 4 million Long Island mansion as collateral for brother John's
bail.
	   ``SIS TO THE RESCUE,'' read the front-page Daily News headline.
Sibling John ``Junior'' Gotti has been jailed since January on a
variety of criminal charges.
	   ``We deal with it,'' she explains patiently. ``We keep dealing
with it. It's not something you run away from.''
	   The blond, 34-year-old mother of three doesn't shy away from
addressing the Gotti family's reputed links to the Gambino family.
But she prefers to play down talk of organized crime when it comes
to her work as an author.
	   ``Victoria Gotti lives on Long Island with her husband and three
sons,'' says the understated book jacket bio. And ``I'll Be
Watching You'' steers clear of the mob; the book is a love triangle
tale intertwining a powerful Kennedyesque clan, an illegitimate son
and a best-selling author.
	   ``It's entertainment, escapism,'' she says. ``This is a little
more entertaining, a little lighter than my first book.''
	   That novel, ``The Senator's Daughter,'' garnered positive
reviews for the suburban housewife turned novelist.
	   ``Gotti weaves a fascinating tale of murder, betrayal, loss of
trust, and revenge,'' the San Francisco Examiner said of her debut.
	   ``I'll Be Watching You'' received a thumbs-up from a more
important critic: her father. John Gotti, serving a life sentence
for murder and racketeering, read the book in his Marion, Illinois,
jail cell.
	   ``I got a letter in the mail saying, `I liked it!''' she says.
``That was a great, great feeling. It seems we always seek out
parents' approval, no matter how old we are.''
	   The Dapper Don might have recognized a bit of himself in one of
the book's main characters, business magnate Dmitri Constantinos.
	   Constantinos offers odds on his acquittal in a criminal trial _
a stunt first pulled by Victoria's father. ``Three-to-one odds I
beat this,'' Gotti had boldly (and accurately) predicted of a 1990
assault case.
	   And during Gotti's first federal trial, defense attorney Bruce
Cutler told the jury: ``So he didn't go to Harvard. So he gambled a
little. That makes him a mob leader?''
	   Fictional defense attorney Evan Miller, representing
Constantinos, offers this defense of his client: ``(He) dresses in
dlrs 2,000 suits. He wears expensive shoes. He had influential
associates. But is that a crime?''
	   Not in Victoria Gotti's books.
	   Ms. Gotti, the second of five children, does her writing late at
night, sitting down at 11 p.m. and banging at a keyboard until she
grows weary. She's up most mornings at 6:30, taking care of her
brood.
	   ``I sit down for two or three hours, until I can't work any
more,'' she explains. ``I'm very nocturnal, although that's not by
choice. I'm sort of an insomniac.''
	   Actually, heart medication makes it difficult for Ms. Gotti to
fall asleep. She was diagnosed in college with mitral valve
prolapse, a condition which can cause dizziness or palpitations.
	   Her struggle with the illness led to Ms. Gotti's first book,
1995's ``Women and Mitral Valve Prolapse.'' Her move to fiction
soon followed _ but she kept a strong dose of reality in her
fictional tales.
	   ``I don't like that whole Cinderella stuff, with a fairy tale
ending,'' she says. ``I try to keep everything real. Everything
doesn't always end happy.''
	   One of Ms. Gotti's most enjoyable tasks is answering her own
mail, complying with requests for autographs and pictures.
	   Why?
	   She believes such contact dispels the ``Mafia princess'' image _
and she dreams of the day when it disappears.
	   ``I wake up, and there are children, beds to make,'' she
explains merrily. ``I work. It's a reward in itself. ... We don't
live in a Francis Ford Coppola world.''

Angela Bassett discovers a new groove
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: 'How Stella Got Her Groove Back' opened Aug. 14 &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo NY323 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK KENNEDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Think vulnerable.
	   Make it soft and tender. Then turn it into a movie role. OK, now
cast actresses.
	   Which of Hollywood's actresses immediately spring to mind?
	   Chances are Angela Bassett doesn't.
	   So the 40-year-old actress was fighting a case of nerves in the
back of the theater during the premiere of ``How Stella Got Her
Groove Back,'' a movie with a mush level that could rival a
Hallmark warehouse. Bassett fills the sexy title role in the
adaptation of Terry McMillan's go-girl best seller about a
40-year-old stockbroker who falls hard for a 20-year-old Jamaican
Adonis.
	   ``I was a little worried, to be honest,'' admits Bassett, who
has played her share of battered, abused and abandoned spouses.
``This was quite a new direction for me. How was it going down?''
	   From the next seat, the answer came with a friendly squeeze from
her husband, actor Courtney Vance. He leaned over during one
smoochie scene and whispered in delight: ``Oh, you look like a
little girl here!''
	   ``He's used to seeing me play just strong,'' Bassett says. ``And
courageous. And intense. This time, he said it was nice to see the
little girl.''
	   That's an unfamiliar side of Bassett, especially after she
ignited the screen like an acetylene torch in ``What's Love Got to
Do With It?'' ``Malcolm X'' and ``Waiting to Exhale.''
	   ``I love that she allowed her Stella to have fun,'' says Deborah
Schindler, who produced the film. ``We see her be playful. We
haven't seen that before that I really remember.''
	   It's 10 years since Bassett left the New York stage for Los
Angeles to break into film. The Ivy League-educated actress did a
few bit movie parts (``Kindergarten Cop,'' ``F/X''), some
television (``The Cosby Show,'' ``thirtysomething,'' ``The Guiding
Light''), and some straight-to-video clunkers (``Critters 4'').
	   It wasn't until she stepped into a pair of spiky high heels for
her strutting, hip-shimmying performance as Tina Turner in ``What's
Love Got to Do With It?'' that Bassett became a star, receiving an
Academy Award nomination.
	   Reared by an aunt in Harlem until she was 5, Bassett moved to
St. Petersburg, Florida, with her mother, who struggled alone to
raise two daughters.
	   ``My mother was on us 24 hours a day ... She never let us sit
back, she was always active because she never wanted me to make the
same mistakes she had as a young woman,'' Bassett says.
	   After ``Love,'' Bassett's next big role was Bernadine, a mother
of two whose husband leaves her for another woman in the 1995
surprise hit, ``Waiting to Exhale.''
	   In one blistering scene, Bernadine stuffs all her unfaithful
husband's designer duds into his BMW and torches it.
	   In the flesh, Bassett's fearsome image soon gives way. Those
biceps still knot gloriously. And her cheekbones are so chiseled it
seems at times as if she's nestling two golf balls up there. But
there's a delicateness, too: Her soft, almond-shaped eyes and
expressive eyebrows give her an elegant, leonine beauty. She curls
up in her chair like a kitten.
	   Bassett got interested in acting during a class trip to
Washington when she was in the 11th grade. One night, she saw James
Earl Jones rip up the stage in ``Of Mice and Men'' at the John F.
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Bassett says she left
weeping and trembling.
	   ``I knew what I had to do,'' she says, with an enormous smile.
	   What she did was go from a Florida housing project to Yale
University to Broadway and then on to Hollywood.
	   ``I look back and I can appreciate how far I've come. I sort of
stand outside myself and I still feel like the little 8-year-old
with her favorite song on the turntable. She's singing into a brush
like a microphone and she's acting out the parts for her sister and
her aunties,'' Bassett says.
	   ``There was a girl who came up to me last night. She said, 'I'm
an actress. Well, I want to be an actress. And you're my
inspiration,''' Bassett recalls. ``I'm somebody's inspiration? I
was the one looking for inspiration! I'm an inspiration to somebody
who's coming behind me? That's what amazes me.''

	   ``Adore'' _ Smashing Pumpkins (Virgin)
	   The Smashing Pumpkins have taken a lot of heat for failing to
give the public ``the next great rock album.''
	   Instead, the Pumpkins _ now minus drummer Jimmy Chamberlain _
offer up 16 oddly moody love tunes. It's a bold gamble, but one
which lead singer Billy Corgan says was in the works while the
Pumpkins were riding high on 1995's kaleidoscopic ``Mellon Collie
and the Infinite Sadness.''
	   Chamberlain, once one of rock's more formidable drummers, is
sorely missed. The Pumpkins might have made a strong statement by
firing Chamberlain following his heroin debacle, but they have not
filled the void left by his absence.
	   Electronic drums and other computer-generated sounds provide the
beat to many songs on ``Adore'' _ sometimes to distraction. And
doing a quiet turn is not that new for this group. ``Disarm'' off
1993's ``Siamese Dream'' stands as one of the Pumpkins' most
powerful songs.
	   Still, ``Adore'' does succeed on several levels. Corgan's vocals
show his emotional range throughout, and the arrangements of these
tunes, especially the string-fueled ``Tear,'' are superb.
	   This disc grows on you, but it is not the next great rock album.
Some of the songs _ ``Pug,'' for instance _ yearn to be given the
full sonic Pumpkins treatment.
	   ``Adore,'' for what it's worth, is a quirky interlude for a band
continuing to grow and experiment _ and it's definitely worth a
listen.
	   _ By John Pacenti, Associated Press Writer.
	   ``Airbag/How is My Driving?'' _ Radiohead (Capitol)
	   Radiohead's ``Ok, Computer'' could be a candidate for best rock
album of the decade.
	   The 1997 disc was a soundtrack for the 1990s, positing that what
a technology-based society considers safe and normal is actually
nothing but spiritual totalitarianism in disguise. It was a rarity
in which rock became true art.
	   This English band's new release, ``Airbag/How is My Driving?''
gives a glimpse of some of the creativity that went into the music
of that previous work, but little more.
	   Fans are treated to a laydown track that never got vocals. The
other cuts mostly show how rooted this band is in British
psychedelic.
	   Only ``Pearly'' and ``Polyethylene (Part II)'' seem fleshed out
enough that they contain the otherworldly feeling that is
Radiohead's essence.
	   _ By John Pacenti, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``The Elektra Years Anthology'' (Elektra) _ Paul Butterfield
Blues Band
	   This set of Paul Butterfield's earliest recordings shows the
fresh talent he had for playing Chicago blues faithfully, and for
advancing the music to broader audiences.
	   In the 1950s, Butterfield, who is white, remarkably won the
affection of the black blues giants of the time, and in tandem with
Elvin Bishop he formed the first of the great ``white blues
bands.''
	   Butterfield and Bishop were adored by the white American fans
who were drawn to folk festivals and ``roots'' music but were
alienated from classic black performers. The two also won great
standing in the blues heartland of black performers and fans.
	   ``Walkin' Blues'' in particular shows the young singer and
harmonica player with one foot in each world, pop and blues, while
the instrumental ``East West'' shows the band's rock sensibility.
	   Many record stores with weak blues sections display overpriced
box sets with photos and booklets promising to offer the gift of
history.
	   This modest package slips two discs into a single case that is
easily overlooked yet vastly more valuable.
	   _ By Ralph Siegel, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``The Sugarcubes_A Collection,'' (Elektra) _ The Sugarcubes
	   It used to be that a band had to have an extensive recording
history to warrant a greatest hits album.
	   But these days even a mediocre group like the Lemonheads can
become immortalized with a ``best of'' collection. The Sugarcubes _
best known for debuting the trip-hop waif Bjork in the late '80s _
fit somewhere in between those extremes.
	   Culled from the Icelandic band's three albums from 1988-91,
``The Sugarcubes_A Collection'' includes the minor hits
``Birthday'' and ``Hit,'' as well as the lesser known gems
``Regina'' and ``Walkabout.''
	   The Sugarcubes were a quirky breath of fresh air during a stale
period in modern rock, and it's a shame they didn't stick around
longer. But then we wouldn't have witnessed Bjork's phenomenal solo
career.

Tony Orlando after the Dawn: Life and show business still good
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRANSON, Missouri (AP) _ Hide the polyester. Tony Orlando is
back with a new documentary on VH1 and thoughts of releasing some
of his old recordings.
	   To those who disdain the 1970s as the Me Generation decade of
bad music and even worse clothes, the mention of Orlando's name can
bring smirks of sarcastic recognition.
	   He was, after all, the guy who strutted around on stage and TV
doing pop songs like ``Candida'' and ``Knock Three Times'' when he
wasn't being made the butt of jokes by his singing partners, Telma
Hopkins and Joyce Vincent-Wilson, known as Dawn. Their show, which
began as a summer replacement for ``The Sonny and Cher Comedy
Hour,'' quickly became one of the decade's bigger hits, airing on
CBS from 1974 to 1976.
	   But despite those reflexively dismissive feelings about him from
'70s haters, Tony Orlando has built a career as an all-round
entertainer in the tradition of his heroes, Frank Sinatra and Sammy
Davis Jr. He has starred in Las Vegas, even played P.T. Barnum in
the hit Broadway musical ``Barnum,'' as well as having had a string
of hit songs dating as far back as 1961.
	   Now, a quarter-century after ``Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round The Ole
Oak Tree,'' became the biggest-selling record of 1973, Michael
Anthony Orlando Cassavitis, the loud, boisterous,
heart-on-his-sleeve Greek-Puerto Rican guy from New York City, is
still at it.
	   Only now he's one of the biggest stars in this Midwestern mecca
of live entertainment where legions of his fans come to see him
perform.
	   Not bad, he says proudly, for a guy who never made it to high
school.
	   ``It's funny, most people relate childhood to playing in the
baseball game, going to high school,'' Orlando says. ``My childhood
was singing doo-wop on street corners.''
	   He and his group, The Five Gents, would strut down Broadway each
day to the section of Manhattan known as Tin Pan Alley, where the
offices of all the big music companies were. ``And then we'd walk
down every floor singing, hoping someone would hear us and open the
door,'' he recalls.
	   When no one ever did, the others gave up. But Orlando kept
coming back until record producer Don Kirshner finally hired him
for dlrs 50 a week to record demos _ songs that famous singers
would hear and, it was hoped, decide to record themselves.
	   He was good-looking enough but, at 250 pounds (113 kilograms),
too fat to be a famous singer himself in those days. Or so it
seemed until Kirshner put out his version of Carole King's melodic
``Halfway to Paradise'' in 1961 and it became one of the year's
biggest hits.
	   So he slimmed down and went on tour to promote it, becoming a
teen idol with screaming girls at every show and guards to escort
him to his car.
	   ``It was quite a thing for a guy who was all of 16,'' he recalls
now.
	   And it barely lasted until he was 20, when the Beatles arrived
and pushed every teen-age crooner off the charts.
	   So he found a day job in music publishing, and he might still be
doing that if a friend from his teen idol days hadn't approached
him in 1970.
	   The friend, Hank Medress of the Tokens, the group that recorded
``The Lion Sleeps Tonight,'' told Orlando he was sure everyone
would love a song titled ``Candida,'' if he could just find a
singer to record it.
	   Orlando was worried about his job. ``I said if my boss finds out
I recorded for another label, he'll fire me.''
	   No problem. They would put out the record under a fake name _
Dawn.
	   When it rose to No. 3 on the charts, Medress was back to cut a
follow-up, ``Knock Three Times.'' It went to No. 1 and Orlando was
a pop star again.
	   ``I backed into the whole kit and caboodle as a favor for a
friend,'' he says, smiling broadly. ``Some favor, huh?''
	   Not that all that resulted was good, though.
	   He has acknowledged becoming addicted to cocaine in the '70s and
fighting weight and depression over the years. He got divorced, met
his second wife, Francine, and turned everything back around, only
to see it start to go sour again when two backup singers in Branson
accused him of sexual harassment this year.
	   A jury found him innocent after a trial in March, but Orlando
still sounds hurt and angry about it.
	   ``I no longer sign autographs `Love, Tony Orlando' _ on the
advice of my attorneys,'' he says, shaking his head in disgust.
	   Still, life has been good since moving to Branson, where the
54-year-old entertainer quickly became one of the town's most
visible stars.
	   He was profiled in the hour-long documentary ``Tony Orlando:
Behind the Music'' that debuted on the music channel VH1 on June
28. And after a request from Rhino Records to include a song in one
of its collections, he is looking into bringing out unreleased
recordings he made over the years.
	   ``For a guy who never saw high school,'' says Orlando, ``I've
walked the streets of Pompeii, entertained for six presidents now.
Had my own TV show, my own theater in Branson. Starred on Broadway.
... Who could have any regrets?''

Remastering the sound of Broadway's Golden Age
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL KUCHWARA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Drama Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The old vinyl discs most likely molder in
cardboard boxes or stand upright on a bottom shelf in your rec
room, basement or attic.
	   Their battered square covers potently recall some of Broadway's
biggest hits.
	   _A caricature of George Bernard Shaw manipulating a marionette
of Henry Higgins who, in turn, manipulates a marionette of Liza
Doolittle: ``My Fair Lady.''
	   _A line of nervous, eager dancers spread across a gray-brown
background and silver letters: ``A Chorus Line.''
	   _Quaint medieval drawings suggesting the King Arthur legend,
Guinevere and the Knights of the Round Table: ``Camelot.''
	   Decca may have begun the Broadway cast recording revolution with
``Oklahoma!'' in 1943, but Columbia, under its label of Columbia
Masterworks, expanded it even further, particularly after the
introduction of the long-playing record in the late 1940s. These
albums were among the LPs that introduced a generation to Broadway.
	   When compact discs replaced records in the mid-1980s, some of
recordings were released on CD, but they were not digitally
remastered using the latest state-of-the-art audio techniques.
	   Now a few of these classics have been. And not only has the
sound been improved, the company cannily includes bonus tracks of
material not available on the original albums.
	   The first five recordings by Sony Classical and Columbia/Legacy
Recordings _ ``My Fair Lady,'' ``A Chorus Line,'' ``Camelot,''
``Cabaret'' and ``Kiss Me, Kate'' _ are in U.S. stores.
	   Except for ``Kate,'' the original recordings were the work of
the legendary producer Goddard Lieberson.
	   ``Goddard had two goals _ to capture the show and to make it
perfectly playable and dramatically readable when you remove the
sets, lights and costumes,'' says Thomas Z. Shepard, one of the
producers who supervised the redoing of the discs. ``His recordings
had a wonderful way of standing on their own because they just
resonated drama.''
	   For Broadway buffs, these reissues resonate even more
effectively. They are a treasure trove of the familiar and the
obscure.
	   The original jacket covers remain intact. Yet in the case of
``Kiss Me, Kate'' it is a yellow-and-red cover that has not been
seen since the recording was first released in 1949.
	   Then there is that tantalizing additional material.
	   ``The average show LP was probably between 45 and 50 minutes;
pop ones were even shorter,'' Shepard says. ``Compact discs can get
nearly 75 minutes.''
	   ``Cabaret'' offers the most unusual treats _ four songs cut from
the original production, played and sung here by its composer, John
Kander, and its lyricist, Fred Ebb.
	   One of these forgotten songs, ``I Don't Care Much,'' made it
into the current hit Broadway revival of the show, but who could
hum the other three _ ``Roommates,'' ``Good Time Charlie'' and
``It'll All Blow Over'' until now?
	   For ``My Fair Lady,'' the producers mined an album made by
orchestra leader Percy Faith to find ``The Embassy Waltz,'' a bit
of music from the show that never was on the original album.
	   ``A Chorus Line'' offers an expanded version of ``Hello Twelve,
Hello Thirteen, Hello Love,'' nearly two more minutes of a song
that further defines the dancers at an audition for a big musical.
	   The original recording of Cole Porter's ``Kiss Me, Kate'' never
started with its overture. It began with the entr'acte, the music
heard just before the beginning of the second act.
	   Now things have been righted _ a bit. The original overture,
recorded in 1958 by veteran conductor Lehman Engel, has been added
to the CD, but at the end of the recording. And the entr'acte is
where it has always _ wrongly _ been because, according to the
liner notes, ``not to do so ``would be a denial of the album as it
has stood for the past 50 years.'' Only Lerner and Loewe's
``Camelot'' doesn't contain any bonus material, although the album
always contained two numbers that eventually were cut from the show
to pare its running time. Now the producers have placed the songs
back in their original playing order.
	   ``The songs had been put out of order so they would play better
on the LP,'' Shepard says. ``But there is a certain wonderful
darkness to `Camelot'. You leave the original sequence and the show
gets kind of sadder and sadder toward the end.''
	   Upcoming toward the end of September are a second set of
classics: ``South Pacific,'' ``West Side Story,'' ``The Sound of
Music,'' ``On the Town'' and ``Annie.''
	   ``Annie'' could include several unused numbers done by composer
Charles Strouse and lyricist Martin Charnin, plus an early, rare
recording by them of the musical's ubiquitous anthem ``Tomorrow.''

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Randy Johnson didn't get to face Kerry Wood, but
he did strike out Sammy Sosa.
	   Johnson allowed two hits in seven innings for his fourth victory
in five starts with Houston and Moises Alou went 4-for-5 with his
37th homer as the Astros beat the Chicago Cubs 8-3 Saturday.
	   Craig Biggio and Bill Spiers also homered for the Astros, who
won their 80th game and moved 8 1/2 games ahead of the Cubs in the
NL Central. Chicago entered the game tied with the Mets for the
lead in the NL wild-card race.
	   Johnson (4-1) didn't allow a hit after the second, walked three
and struck out nine, including Sosa in the third. The left-hander
gave up Glenallen Hill's fourth homer and a single to Scott
Servais.
 &UR; Mets 9, Diamondbacks 4 &QC; 
	   Sosa went hitless in five at-bats _ 0-for-3 vs. Johnson _ with
one strikeout, leaving him with 49 homers. He trailed Mark McGwire,
who played Saturday night, by two homers.
	   The win pushed the Astros (80-50) 30 games over .500 for only
the second time in club history. Houston finished 96-66 in 1986 en
route to an NL West title.
	   Wood, Chicago's star rookie right-hander, pitched Friday despite
requests by Fox Sports to the Cubs to rest him another day to setup
a national-TV matchup with Johnson.
	   In New York, Mike Piazza hit his major league-leading fourth
grand slam, made a sliding catch into the Arizona dugout and threw
out a runner trying to steal.
	   The Mets, playing their fifth game in less than 48 hours,
rallied from an early 4-0 deficit. Bobby Jones (9-7), pitching on
three days' rest for the first time this season, helped New York
take a one-game lead in the NL wild-card race over Chicago.
	   Piazza hit the Mets' first slam of the year, keying a six-run
second inning against Andy Benes (11-12).
	   Piazza has drawn a mixed reaction from the home crowd ever since
the Mets got him from Florida in May, perhaps the result of high
expectations for the All-Star catcher.
	   There were scattered boos in the crowd of 42,654 when Piazza
struck out with runners on first and third in the opening inning,
but he quickly changed that in his next at-bat by turning a 4-2
deficit into a 6-4 lead.
 &UR; Braves 7, Dodgers 5 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Walt Weiss and Gerald Williams each hit two-run
singles and Chipper Jones hit his 30th homer in a game that
included a second-inning brawl.
	   In the second inning, Atlanta's Andres Galarraga was hit by
Darren Dreifort's pitch and charged the mound. Galarraga swung at
Dreifort's head as he lunged toward the pitcher and the two players
fell to the ground as both dugouts emptied.
	   Braves starter Denny Neagle (12-11) picked up the win, allowing
three runs and six hits in five innings.
	   Kerry Ligtenberg pitched a perfect ninth for his 22nd save, and
now hasn't allowed an earned run in 20 games _ a span of 19 1-3
innings. He has recorded 16 straight saves since May 27.

	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Scott Erickson pitched a seven-hitter for his
AL-best ninth complete game and the Baltimore Orioles took
advantage of eight walks and a balk to beat the Cleveland Indians
6-3 Saturday.
	   Cal Ripken homered for the Orioles, who snapped a two-game
losing streak and improved to 31-10 since the All-Star break.
Baltimore has not lost three straight since July 3-5.
	   Manny Ramirez hit his 30th homer for Cleveland, which fell to
8-13 in August.
	   Erickson (14-9) struck out five and walked four. The
right-hander has won his last three starts and is 6-2 in his last
nine appearances.
	   Indians starter Bartolo Colon (13-7) allowed only five hits in 5
1-3 innings, but issued six walks in his second straight game.
Three of those walks turned into runs.
 &UR; Athletics 7, Tigers 2, 1st game
	   In Oakland, Gil Heredia pitched six strong innings in his first
major league start since 1995 in the first game of a doubleheader.
	   Heredia (1-0) allowed two runs and six hits for his first win
since 1996. The right-hander, who has spent parts of the last few
seasons bouncing between the minors and majors, was making his
first start since Aug. 30, 1995, when he pitched for Montreal at
San Diego.
	   Oakland scored in five out of seven innings against Brian
Moehler (12-10), who gave up seven runs _ six earned _ with a
season-high five walks.
	   T.J. Mathews pitched three innings for his first save.
 &UR; Royals 3, Devil Rays 2
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Jose Rosado (7-9) overcame a
first-inning jam to allow just three hits in eight innings. Jeff
Montgomery pitched the ninth for his 28th save in 32 chances,
allowing Fred McGriff's 15th homer.
	   Kansas City is one shy of its season-high four-game winning
streak (May 24-29.) The Devil Rays (49-78) fell to a season-low 29
games under .500.
	   Wilson Alvarez (5-13) allowed two runs and five hits in seven
innings, struking out eight and walking two.

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Monica Seles upset top-seeded Martina Hingis of
Switzerland 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 Saturday in the dlrs 1.3 million du
Maurier Open women's tennis championship.
	   Seles advanced to Sunday's final against third-seeded Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario of Spain, who beat second-seeded Jana Novotna of
the Czech Republic 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 in the second semifinal
later Saturday.
	   Seles, 24, the fifth seed, has won the last three du Maurier
tournaments. Her only previous loss at the event was to Sanchez
Vicario in the 1992 final. Seles' du Maurier record is now 23-1.
	   ``This tournament just seems to bring out the best in me at key
times,'' Seles said. ``Like today, I woke up at a key time.''
	   Hingis, 17, did not lose a service game until Seles broke for a
5-3 lead in the second set in the one hour, 32 minute match. Seles
added two early breaks in the third set to put away the match.
	   ``I really started to play well as the match went on,'' Seles
said. ``I actually think she was lucky to win the first set.
Everything just went well for me today.''
	   Hingis, who won three grand slam tournaments last year, has four
tournament victories in 1998 but none since the Italian Open in May
and may soon be in danger of losing the No. 1 ranking she has held
since March 31, 1997.
	   ``I'm just having trouble right now winning a whole
tournament,'' Hingis said. ``I always play pretty solidly, but have
trouble to win the whole thing.
	   ``But we'll see what happens at the U.S. Open (in two weeks).''
	   Seles, the former world No. 1, missed most of the 1993 and 1994
seasons after she was stabbed in the back by a spectator in
Hamburg, Germany on April 30, 1993.
	   She made a dramatic return in the 1995 du Maurier in Toronto,
defeating Amanda Coetzer of South Africa in the final. She beat
Sanchez in the 1996 final in Montreal and downed Anke Huber of
Germany in last year's final in Toronto.
	   Seles has yet to win a tournament this year, but she reached the
final of the French Open in June and made the semifinals at two
events in California in recent weeks.
	   ``I feel I'm getting better, but sometimes I come in a just play
horrible matches, like at Wimbledon (a quarterfinal loss to Natasha
Zvereva) or in the past couple of weeks in California,'' Seles
said.
	   ``I haven't been getting consistent training and that's why some
days my game is way up and other days it's way down. I have to
improve on that.''

Rain forces postponement of second round

<TEXT>
	   MAPLE GROVE, Minnesota (AP) _ It took a late afternoon rainstorm
Saturday to keep Michelle Estill from building a commanding lead in
the LPGA Rainbow Classic.
	   Estill was at 9-under par through three holes of the second
round, and was lining up a birdie putt attempt on the fourth hole
of the Rush Creek Golf Course when the heavy rain chased nearly
half of the field to cover.
	   Sixty-six of the 138 golfers will return early Sunday morning to
finish the second round, then come back for the final 18 holes of
the dlrs 600,000 event.
	   Should further delays occur Sunday, the tournament would be
extended to Monday.
	   The weather forecast for Sunday was for partly cloudy skies with
a 20 percent chance of showers and thundershowers, mainly in the
morning hours. The predicted high temperature was in the mid-80's.
	   Estill, who is trying for her second career LPGA victory and
first in seven years, followed an opening-round 65 with birdies on
the first two holes of the second round to move to 9-under par. She
was standing on the fourth green when the rain came.
	   The only win on the LPGA tour for Estill came when she was a
rookie in 1991.
	   Wendy Ward, Nancy Harvey and Tracy Hanson were at 6-under par.
Ward finished seven holes and Harvey and Hanson four when play was
stopped.
	   Six others were on the course at 5-under par.
	   Mitzi Edge fired a 66 early Saturday to join Beth Daniel and
Gail Graham in the clubhouse at 3-under par. Graham shot 67 on
Saturday and Daniel a 69. Finishing the first two rounds at 2-under
par were Lori West, Cindy Figg-Currier, Jenny Lidback and Marilyn
Lovander.
	   The tournament is being held without many of the top players on
the LPGA tour. Only two of the top 10 money winners and eight of
the top 20 are entered. Among the absentees is South Korean rookie
Se Ri Pak, who has won two majors and four tour events this season.
She withdrew last week. The top European players, such as Annika
Sorenstam, are playing in the Compaq Open in Sweden.

<TEXT>
	   In Pittsburgh, Mark McGwire lowered his countdown to single
digits.
	   McGwire broke Babe Ruth's record for homers in three consecutive
seasons with his 52nd this year. He has 33 games to match Roger
Maris' record of 61 homers set in 1961.
	   McGwire powered an 0-2 pitch by Francisco Cordova (12-10) into
the right-center stands in the first inning, a 477-foot (145
meters) drive that was the longest in Three Rivers Stadium this
season. It was only his third opposite-field homer all year.
	   McGwire has 162 homers in three seasons, including 52 in 1996
and 58 in 1997. Ruth hit 161 from 1926-28.
	   McGwire became the first NL player to reach 52 homers since
George Foster for the Cincinnati Reds in 1977. He also set a
Cardinals' record for homers in consecutive seasons (76) and an NL
record for most homers by a first baseman in one season. Johnny
Mize hit 51 in 1947.
	   His fifth homer in four days electrified a sellout crowd of
45,082 _ only the Pirates' second of the season _ that gave him
standing ovations with every at-bat and booed when Cordova walked
him in the third inning.
	   McGwire nearly hit his 53rd in the seventh inning, bringing the
flashbulb-popping crowd out of their seats again as center fielder
Adrian Brown ran down his long drive a few feet (meter) short of
the wall.
	   Bobby Witt (2-4) took the loss.
 &UR; Giants 5, Marlins 4 &QC; 
	   In Miami, pinch-hitter Marvin Benard's RBI single capped a
three-run rally in the ninth inning, and Jeff Kent hit a sacrifice
fly in the 10th for San Francisco.
	   The Giants, trailing 4-1, scored three times with two out in the
ninth against Antonio Alfonseca.
	   In the 10th, pinch-hitter Stan Javier led off with a single
against Brian Edmonson (3-3). Rich Aurilia sacrificed and was safe
on Edmonson's throwing error. Barry Bonds walked to load the bases,
and Kent's sacrifice fly gave the Giants their first lead.
	   Rich Rodriguez (3-0) pitched a perfect ninth, and former Marlin
Robb Nen followed with a scoreless 10th for his 32nd save.

Six Taiwanese tourists, driver die in crash in northwest China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A van carrying tourists from Taiwan collided with
a truck Saturday in northern China, killing the van driver and six
Taiwanese, police said Sunday.
	   One person was seriously injured, and seven other people
suffered less serious injuries and were taken to a local hospital,
said a Yuman Traffic Police officer who gave only his surname, Ren.
	   The van crashed head-on with a Chinese-made Dongfeng truck on a
highway near the small town of Qingquan, west of the city of
Jiayuguan in Gansu province, he said.
	   The region is known for its ancient Buddhist cave temples and
relics of the oasis towns that flourished 2,000 years ago along the
Silk Road.

	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Hurricane Bonnie continued to strengthen
Sunday, becoming a 300-mile-long (480-kilometer-long) storm and
skirting sparsely populated Bahamian islands on a route that could
threaten the eastern United States.
	   Another hurricane gained power in the Pacific Ocean but was
expected to diminish over open seas Sunday.
	   At 11 p.m. Saturday (0300 GMT Sunday), the National Hurricane
Center said Bonnie's center was located about 195 miles (310
kilometers) east of San Salvador in the Bahamas.
	   Maximum sustained winds were estimated to have increased to near
95 mph (155 kph) and the hurricane was expected to grow stronger
Sunday, meteorologists said.
	   ``Bonnie could threaten the east coast of the United States
within the next few days,'' the National Hurricane Center said in a
statement. It said the likelihood of the hurricane hitting
southeast Florida has decreased. But it urged residents of the
coast and keys to be ready to ``take quick action'' if the
situation changed.
	   Jerry Jarrell, director of the center, said Bonnie could
eventually strengthen to a Category 3 storm with winds more than
111 mph (178 kph) capable of causing extensive damage.
	   Though the hurricane stalled for hours Saturday, it resumed its
west-northwest path after dark. Bonnie is expected to continue on
that course for about 24 hours before a gradual turn to the
northwest that could steer it from the U.S. mainland, the hurricane
center said. Bonnie was moving at about 9 mph (14 kph).
	   If it does hit the United State, north Florida is the most
likely target, Jarrell said.
	   Bahamian forecaster Basil Dean said the islands closest to the
hurricane would experience waves 6 to 9 feet (1.8-2.7 meters) above
normal, and Bonnie's storm surge and rain could cause flooding.
	   The islands' meteorological department said Bonnie would have
the greatest effect on San Salvador island, which could see five to
10 inches (13-25 centimeters) of rain, while more populated areas,
including the capital of Nassau, were unlikely to suffer as much.
	   Meanwhile, another weather system that threatened parts of Texas
lost power Saturday.
	   As it moved into Texas, Matagorda Island was hit the hardest
with 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain and 70 mph (110 kph) wind
gusts early Saturday.
	   Also Friday, a storm in the Pacific Ocean reached hurricane
strength but remained far off the Mexican coast.
	   Hurricane Howard intensified Saturday, with winds of 110 mph
(176 kph). The hurricane center said it was expected to become
stronger before dissipating in the Pacific later Sunday.

	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ His golf game will have to wait.
	   Nursing an aching shoulder made tender from years of countless
serves, admitted golf nut Goran Ivanisevic planned to forego 18
holes on the eve of his fourth U.S. singles final.
	   ``I just take it easy. I put more ice and a little massage and
play some cards instead of golf,'' he said after beating Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, 6-3, 6-4 Saturday in the Pilot Pen International
semifinal.
	   A strong service game helped the No. 8 seed Ivanisevic continue
his dominance over the Russian. He leads their head-to-head series
9-2 and has beaten Kafelnikov in their last seven matches.
	   His serve, clocked as high as 131 mph in the tournament, kept
him in control through most of the 1-hour, 5-minute match.
	   The left-hander had a dozen aces to Kafelnikov's four and won 87
percent of his first service points.
	   But the sore left shoulder also dictated that he take a little
off his serves and rely more on his volleys, the part of his game
he says has steadily improved.
	   ``Especially on hard court. I can come in, I can finish with a
volley ... I can stay back,'' Ivanisevic said.
	   If there was something missing off the serves, Kafelnikov, the
defending Pilot Pen champ and No. 5 seed, said he didn't notice.
	   ``It seemed like he was serving like in normal day, aces, one
after another,'' Kafelnikov said.
	   The 26-year-old Croat, ranked No. 16 on tour, is in the hunt for
his first tournament win in the United States and will play No. 7
seed Karol Kucera, of Slovakia, in Sunday's final. Kucera advanced
by beating No. 4 seed Richard Krajicek, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 on the New
Haven hard courts.
	   Sunday's final will be Kucera's first on U.S. soil. Ranked 13th
in the world, Kucera opened the season with a singles title at
Sydney, his first hard court title.
	   Kucera said it took him nearly the first set to figure out the
hard-serving Dutchman, who topped the tournament with speeds of 132
mph. Krajicek had eight aces to Kucera's six.
	   ``After the second set I think I got a little bit more returns
back and I could break him two times,'' he said.
	   He had a chance to serve for the match at 5-4, but admitted
feeling the pressure and Krajicek broke him.
	   ``I am not used to win all my service games and I knew I have to
today because if I would lose the serve like in the second set and
Krajicek is coming back,'' he said.
	   He broke the Krajicek for the match when Krajicek's return
volley just missed the baseline.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A van carrying tourists from Taiwan collided with
a truck Saturday in northern China, killing the van driver and six
Taiwanese, police said Sunday.
	   One person was seriously injured, and seven other people
suffered less serious injuries and were taken to a local hospital,
said a Yumen Traffic Police officer who gave only his surname, Ren.
	   The van crashed head-on with a Chinese-made Dongfeng truck on a
highway near the small town of Qingquan, west of the city of
Jiayuguan in Gansu province, he said.
	   The region is known for its ancient Buddhist cave temples and
relics of the oasis towns that flourished 2,000 years ago along the
Silk Road.
