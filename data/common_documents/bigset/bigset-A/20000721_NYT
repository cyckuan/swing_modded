HOUSE MOVES TO EASE EMBARGO ON CUBA

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives on Thursday night
approved measures to bar the Treasury Department from enforcing
restrictions on travel to Cuba as well as on the sale of food and
medicines to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the 38-year-old American trade embargo on Cuba hailed
the votes as a major first step in the House toward clearing the
way to commercial ties and even American tourism.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 232-186, lawmakers ordered that the Treasury
Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the chief bureau for
enforcing sanctions against Cuba, be prohibited from spending
federal funds to restrict Americans from traveling there or
engaging in the sale of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty Republicans voted in favor of the amendment on travel,
which was added to the bill to finance the Treasury Department and
Postal Service by Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford voiced elation at the vote, which he said was a sign
that lawmakers are increasingly prepared to engage the government
of Cuba, just as they have sought to end the isolation of
governments such as China and Vietnam.

DeLay criticizes reform of campaign financing By LETITIA STEIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only weeks after President Clinton signed into law
the first campaign finance legislation to clear Congress in over a
decade, Rep. Tom DeLay returned to the stump Thursday to challenge
the reform movement.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing the conservative side of the hotly-debated issue, DeLay,
R-Texas, called on policy makers to eliminate caps on campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, the House Republican Whip, also accused journalists of
aligning with liberals to support reform while the media industry
has profited from political advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The innocuously labeled `campaign finance reform' movement is
perhaps the most worrisome and disingenuous special interest of
them all,'' DeLay said during a campaign finance forum at the Cato
Institute, a Washington think tank that promotes free markets and
limited government.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we know today as campaign finance reform is simply an
effort to have the government regulate and ration political
discourse in America,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance reform movement received a boost this year
when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., made the issue a cornerstone of his
unsuccessful presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in its first action to tighten campaign finance laws
since the post-Watergate reforms, last month closed a tax code
loophole that allowed some groups _ so-called 527s _ to fund
political activities with unlimited and unregulated donations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which went into effect July 1, requires these
organizations to publicly disclose donor lists and political
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's attack on the movement Thursday underscores the uphill
battle reformers face in their effort to enact laws to dampen the
influence of money in government and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman also warned that the limited legislation
recently approved would not pass constitutional muster in an
inevitable court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issue advocacy is a freedom that we have to protect at all
costs because it is in the Constitution _ not only the right to
free speech, but the right to assemble and to petition your
government,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the debate, legal experts have long claimed
that DeLay's First Amendment concerns are unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution does not say, and has never said, that a
legislature can impose no regulations on the flow of money into
politics,'' said E. Joshua Rosenkranz, president of the Brennan
Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court has made clear over the course of 200 years
that all of the seemingly absolute terms of the Constitution are
always subject to balancing when the government has a very
important interest at stake,'' Rosenkranz said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at the Brennan Center have worked with lawmakers to
ensure the disclosure bill and other proposals do not cross the
line between the regulation of campaign activities and restrictions
on speech, Rosenkranz said. &QL;

NASA weighs expense, risk of Mars mission By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   As NASA races to revamp its failed Mars exploration program,
scientists are torn over how aggressively the agency should proceed
with a risky and expensive robotic mission that could hasten the
search for life on the Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, more than 200 experts wrapped up three days of
NASA-sponsored debate at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in
Houston over how the agency should reshape its Mars exploration
strategy in response to a pair of mission failures last year.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators blamed the losses of the Mars Climate Orbiter and
the Mars Polar Lander on NASA mismanagement and underfunding.
</P>
<P>
   With the advice of scientists and engineers, NASA expects to
unveil a new 20-year exploration strategy for Mars by December, one
that could be funded at about $400 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the discussion at the gathering focused on how much of a
priority NASA should assign a robotic mission that would attempt to
collect small samples of Martian rock and soil.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers would examine the soil and rock for signs of
biological activity. Scientists have yet to prove the existence of
even primitive life beyond the Earth, though neighboring Mars is a
leading candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't overestimate the value it will have,'' said Mike Duke,
a Lunar and Planetary Institute scientist who told colleagues the
Martian dirt would reveal clues about the origin of the planet, its
climate and mineralogy as well as the presence of life. ``It would
be a tremendous leap forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of the mission, estimated at from $1 billion to $2
billion, could prove even more devastating if it was attempted too
soon and failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been searching for a low-cost Mars sample return mission
for years,'' said Donna Shirley, a former Mars mission manager at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``I'd like to discourage any
magical thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA lacks the technology to land a probe at the precise site it
would like to collect a sample, Shirley cautioned. The cost of
launching all of the equipment required for the complicated mission
also will drive up the cost, she argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge is not to launch something before it's ready,''
said Scott Hubbard, who recently took over as NASA's
Washington-based Mars program manager.
</P>
<P>
   However, he noted that obtaining fragments of Mars with robots
is in NASA's plans.
</P>
<P>
   At the Houston conference, several scientists offered less
costly and risky alternatives for first collecting samples from
Mars' small moons, Deimos and Phobos.
</P>
<P>
   One scientists proposed launching spacecraft that could skim
close to the surface of the moons while firing projectiles. The
impacts of the projectiles would kick up dust that could be
collected during the fly-by and returned to Earth for study.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's record of Mars exploration has been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, NASA lost communication with its Mars Polar
Lander as the spacecraft began a high speed descent toward a
landing at the planet's south pole. Though they could not prove
conclusively how it was lost, investigators uncovered an overlooked
computer software error that would have caused braking rockets to
shut off while it was still airborne.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, NASA lost communication with its Mars Climate
Orbiter as the orbiting weather satellite was steering into orbit
around the Red Planet. &QL;

Mideast summit not dead yet By GREG McDONALD 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sought
Thursday to revive the Camp David summit in President Clinton's
absence, but there were still signs the Israelis and Palestinians
were balking at making peace despite a last-minute decision to
continue talks.
</P>
<P>
   Albright took control of the talks, which had all but collapsed
late Wednesday night, after Clinton left for Japan to keep his
commitment to attend the so-called Group of Eight economic summit.
He plans to rejoin the talks Sunday if the Israeli and Palestinian
delegations are still at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Albright spent the day shuttling back and forth between Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in
hopes of narrowing the differences between the two. Clinton was
unable to resolve the differences during nine intense days of
pressuring both leaders to end the bitter half-century dispute
between their peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Albright ``will continue to try to close the gaps and move
forward on the issues so that when the president returns he can
assess the status of our efforts,'' said State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's here to carry the ball forward. The determination is
there; the effort certainly is not slacking in any way,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were no plans for Barak and Arafat, who have not
met face-to-face since Saturday, to hold a trilateral session with
Albright. And Israeli and Palestinian sources said the two were
still far apart on the issues, especially over how to divide up
Jerusalem in order to make room for a Palestinian state capital.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fact that the two leaders were still at Camp David
_ after a day spent Wednesday preparing to leave the presidential
retreat and accusing each other of negotiating in bad faith _ was
no small accomplishment, said one Israeli official.
</P>
<P>
   ``That they are still here is an indication that neither one of
them is willing to give up just yet on this opportunity. They have
to reach a settlement of all the problems that have divided us,''
said the official.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a chance this will end in success.''
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart had declared the summit
over shortly before 11 p.m. CDT Wednesday, issuing a statement
saying the parties had failed to reach an agreement. Both the
Israeli and Palestinian delegations and press contingencies had
already been ordered to pack and check out of their hotels before
the statement was released, and motorcades were waiting at Camp
David to take the leaders back to Washington so they could fly
home.
</P>
<P>
   But as newspapers across the country were hitting the streets
with headlines screaming that the Middle East peace talks had
failed, Clinton emerged shortly before midnight Wednesday from
seclusion of the presidential retreat near Thurmont, Md. to
announce that Barak and Arafat had a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Failure, the weary-looking president said, had suddenly _ even
miraculously _ been replaced by hope once again that a deal might
be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short answer to why we're still here after everybody
thought we were through is that nobody wanted to give up. After all
these years, as hard as these issues are, they don't want to give
up. And I didn't think we should give up, and so we're still
plugging away,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left shortly after that to attend the economic summit,
saying he would return to Camp David on Sunday to ``assess'' where
the negotiations stand.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing for reporters Thursday, Boucher denied that the
failure announcement had been staged by the White House in order to
pressure the two leaders into staying for further discussions.
</P>
<P>
   He said a consensus to continue the talks emerged among the
leaders in discussions they were having to wrap things up after
Lockhart issued his statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that process the leaders got a sense with each other that
it was, in fact, not the best thing to do to conclude, but rather
it was better to stay and keep working on this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The way events unfolded Wednesday, it appeared that neither
Arafat nor Barak wanted to be the first to walk out of the summit,
even though they spent most of the day accusing each other of
negotiating in bad faith and threatening to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian sources said Thursday that the two sides
still have not been able to agree on the final boundaries of a
Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip or the fate of
more than three million Palestinian refugees who have been driven
from their homes since Israel was established in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   But the main stumbling block, they said, remains the competing
claims to Jerusalem, which both sides regard as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Wednesday offered a number of proposals aimed at
resolving that issue, including shared sovereignty of the old
walled city of East Jerusalem. But that offer has apparently been
rejected by the Palestinians who are insisting that Israel, which
captured and annexed East Jerusalem in the 1967 war, return it all
to their control. &QL;

Power conservation leaves inmates without air By JAMES KIMBERLY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ During the hottest hours of at least two days during
this heat wave, inmates and guards at a Houston-area prison
sweltered without the benefit of air conditioning or fans so that
the prison system could conserve electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Texas prison cell blocks are not air-conditioned. Consequently,
inmates and correctional officers rely on electric fans for relief
from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans were not available at the Darrington Unit
medium-security prison in Rosharon last Thursday and Friday
afternoons because the Texas Department of Criminal Justice was
trying to conserve power. More than 1,600 men are incarcerated at
Darrington, and they are overseen by nearly 400 correctional
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a contract signed this year with Reliant
Energy HL&AMP;P, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice can earn
credits for every kilowatt-hour it conserves when demand for
electricity is greatest.
</P>
<P>
   The prison system is one of 40 commercial customers that Reliant
Energy can call and ask to reduce the amount of electricity being
used. When the commercial customers conserve electricity, more
power is available for homes and other customers, said Reliant
spokeswoman Leticia Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for electricity usually peaks around 4 p.m., Lowe said.
Customers are asked to cut back on their power consumption for only
three hours at a time, Lowe said, and the contract limits to 15 the
number of times Reliant can ask a commercial customer to reduce
usage in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But those three hours can be tough to take, said a correctional
officer at the Darrington Unit. If the temperature outside is
higher than 100 degrees, the temperature inside the prison is
significantly higher, particularly on the third floor, said the
officer, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   High temperatures in the Houston area have been at or above 100
degrees for more than a week. When the effects of humidity are
factored in, it feels even hotter. So far, eight deaths in Houston
have been attributed to the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inmates are pretty upset about it,'' the prison guard
said. ``It's just as bad for the officers as it is for the
inmates.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Reliant asked its commercial customers to conserve electricity
July 13, July 14 and Monday. The temperature in Houston on those
days ranged from 99 to 102 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year that the prison system contracted with
Reliant Energy to conserve power. Last year, the prison system cut
similar agreements with power companies that serve prisons in
Abilene, Beeville and &UR;  &LR; Kenedy.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements earned the prison system $96,000 worth of credits
toward their electric bills last year, said department spokesman
Glen Castlebury. By adding 12 Houston area prisons to the program,
the prison system hopes to earn $200,000 worth of electric bill
credits. The money not spent on electricity will be used to improve
auxiliary power systems at the prisons, Castlebury said.
</P>
<P>
   Darrington was the only prison in the Houston area to have a
problem, Castlebury said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 11 successes last week and one failure,'' Castlebury
said.
</P>
<P>
   The other Houston area prisons saved power by using diesel
generators. An electrical problem prevented Darrington from doing
the same, Castlebury said. Security was not breached since locks on
gates and cell doors can be operated manually, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance crews thought they fixed the electrical problem, so
Darrington tried again on Friday to run on generator power. Once
again, the prison found itself in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Castlebury said Darrington will not participate in the energy
conservation program again until the electrical glitch is fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of fans might have been uncomfortable but probably did
not pose a significant health risk to inmates, said Dr. David
Persse, Houston's director of Emergency Medical Services.
</P>
<P>
   If the air the fans is circulating is hotter than the normal
body temperature of 98.6 degrees, then fans may actually do more
harm than good, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about fans is, ironically, if you are in a hot room,
they can actually make it worse. That's the way a convection oven
works,'' he said. ``It's not having air conditioning that is the
bad thing.''

Clinton hit by protests in Okinawa By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKINAWA, Japan _ As the leaders of the world's largest
industrialized nations gathered here for their annual summit,
President Clinton arrived today on an island gripped by mass
demonstrations against the presence of the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried hard to understand the concerns of the public
here,'' said Clinton, who was met on the island with calls to
consolidate the military presence here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do what we can to reduce our footprint on this
island.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came to this southern Japanese island, site of the last
major battle between the United States and Japan during World War
II and still home to 26,000 U.S. troops, to confer with Russian
President Vladimir Putin and leaders of six other industrialized
nations.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, an estimated 20,000 protesters formed a human
chain to block the entrance to the Kadena Air Base, one of 15 U.S.
facilities located on the small island. Police security remained
very tight on the island today in the wake of the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the local population and the U.S. troops
stationed here are often strained. But tensions have been running
high in recent weeks, following the arrest earlier this month of a
drunk, 19-year-old Marine who allegedly entered an Okinawan home
and fondled a 14-year-old girl in her bed. That incident rekindled
memories of the rape of a 12-year-old girl by three U.S. servicemen
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take seriously our responsibility to be good neighbors, and
it is unacceptable to the United States when we do not meet that
responsibility,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony summit organizers are hoping will help defuse the
tensions, President Clinton visited the Cornerstone of Peace, a
memorial dedicated to the more than 234,000 who died during the
bloody battle of Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the Okinawan population died in the 83-day battle 55
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia is largely at peace today because our alliance gives
people throughout this region confidence that the peace will be
defended and preserved, that no more such monuments need ever be
built,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks were not the only gesture designed to help
quell the uproar. U.S. military officials have banned drinking on
eight Marine bases during the summit, which continues through
Sunday, and restricted Marines and sailors to base between midnight
and 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Later today, Clinton will gather with the other leaders of the
Group of Eight _ the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany,
France, Italy, Canada and Russia _ in his last economic summit as
president. Clinton is the first president to visit Okinawa since
President Eisenhower in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders will discuss a host of social and economic issues,
ranging from the spread of AIDS to efforts to alleviate world
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   One major issue on the leaders' agenda is the so-called
``digital divide,'' the gulf between the industrialized nations and
the developed world in terms of their access to computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton will meet with Putin, who comes to Japan armed
with new warnings of a Russian-Sino response to any development of
a proposed U.S. missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The system would be designed to intercept missiles fired at the
United States or U.S. troops. Proponents argue the technology being
contemplated would not provide protection against the massive
arsenal of Russia but could guard against a launch by a state such
as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   A $100 million flight test of the system failed earlier this
month, and Clinton has not yet decided whether to move forward with
actual development.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, however, insist development of the proposed system
would represent a violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have been even more adamant in opposition. Before
traveling here to Okinawa, Putin met with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin to discuss the U.S. missile defense system. Putin and Zemin
then issued a joint statement condemning the proposal, warning it
could ``pose the most grave, adverse consequences'' and trigger a
new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also visited North Korea this week, the first-ever visit
by a Russian leader, and proposed the missile shield be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   G-8 members France and Germany already have criticized the
defense system as a potential threat to global disarmament. &QL;

 IN TEXAS-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
Gore rushes to Texas to rip Bush By PATTY REINERT 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Vice President Al Gore brought his criticism of
presidential rival George W. Bush's state budget to the governor's
back yard Thursday, as the two fought for the last word on Bush's
fiscal prowess and priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of Texas pride and Bush's popularity in the state even
as he bashed the governor's policies, Gore accused Bush of letting
Texans down by putting tax cuts for the wealthy ahead of health
insurance for poor children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful state, but I think it should be a state
where it's just as easy to raise a child as it is to set up an oil
rig,'' Gore told families and state lawmakers gathered at the Seven
Oaks Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Texas, as anybody who's been here knows, work
just as hard or harder than anybody else,'' he added. ``The
question is, is the Bush government here working just as hard for
them and helping to ensure that they succeed?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush shot back quickly from 80 miles up the interstate in
Austin, accusing the vice president of trying to mislead Texans
about their state budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Texas budget is balanced and in the black. We have a
surplus of $1.4 billion in the bank,'' Bush said at the Governor's
Mansion. ``For Vice President Gore to claim otherwise for his own
political purposes is a travesty _ he should be ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican state Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander also stepped
into the budget fray Thursday, officially confirming that state
government will have a surplus of $1.4 billion by Aug. 31, the
halfway point of the state's 2000-2001 budget period.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle reported earlier this month that
legislators likely will need to tap the surplus to cover unexpected
expenses totaling about $610 million in some state programs.
Rylander noted that the surplus would be more than enough to cover
the overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and some other Democrats have attempted to tie the budget
shortages to a tax cut the governor pushed, and the vice president
scuttled a planned campaign stop in Iowa Thursday to fly to Texas
in hopes of capitalizing on the uproar.
</P>
<P>
   In his San Antonio appearance, Gore was joined by state Sens.
Mario Gallegos, D-Galena Park, and Frank Madla, D-San Antonio, and
state Reps. Carlos Uresti, D-San Antonio, and Ruth Jones McClendon,
D-San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Also with him were several mothers who had tried to maneuver the
state's cumbersome process for signing children up for health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Texas began 1999 with a record surplus of $6.4 billion, which
legislators used that year to raise teacher pay and increase
spending on other education and health programs. They also used
$1.7 billion of the surplus for the tax cut that Bush proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bush squandered the 1999 surplus on $1.7 billion in
tax cuts for the wealthy, including $45 million for oil companies,
while neglecting health care and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that Governor Bush is a popular and well-liked
governor here, and I want to give him some credit on that score. I
think he has a warm and engaging personality,'' Gore said. ``But
you know, the presidency is more than just a popularity contest. It
involves whether or not you're willing to fight for what's right,
whether or not you're willing to spend some popularity to do
difficult, hard things.''
</P>
<P>
   While governors in other states have used the nation's economic
boom to address the needs of everyday people, Gore said, Bush's
priority was helping the wealthy. The same would be true, he said,
if Bush were elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that Texas ranks last in the United States in the
percentage of people with health insurance; that the state is
second-worst in the country, behind Arizona, in providing health
coverage for children; and that last year, about one-fourth of
Texas children lacked insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by state lawmakers who fought last year to expand
health coverage for children under the Children's Health Insurance
Program, or CHIP, Gore said Bush had fought the improvements and
his administration has delayed enrolling children who qualify. The
program provides health insurance for children who don't qualify
for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the state could lose $449 million in federal funding
for CHIP because it got a late start in enrolling children. In
addition, participants in Thursday's event criticized the state's
system as being nearly impossible to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters greeted Gore's San Antonio motorcade, waving
signs with such slogans as ``Viva Bush'' and ``Gore can't handle
the truth about Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Rob Junell, D-San Angelo, chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee and a Bush supporter, defended the state's
budget and the CHIP program that lawmakers established last year
for low-income children. The Legislature appropriated $179 million
for the program over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Junell told reporters in a conference call arranged by the Bush
campaign that Texas got a late start on CHIP because the
Legislature wasn't in session when the federal government issued
regulations for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Junell said the Legislature thoroughly debated budget priorities
during the 1999 session. And he noted that most legislators _
including some Democrats now criticizing Bush _ voted for the
budget and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer added that money from the state's
surplus had been used for $3,000 raises for teachers statewide and
to eliminate the sales tax on over-the-counter medicines, in
addition to the tax cuts Gore cites.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster his criticism of state finances and policies, Gore
appeared with Carrie De la Fuente, a single mother of four, who
said she tried repeatedly to sign her children up for CHIP, but
sometimes had to take hours off work, waiting for delayed
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd say, `No, you need more documents,' so then I'd have to
get another appointment to go back with more documents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said it wasn't unfair to speculate that the delays were
``intended to limit the number of people who participate'' in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now 16,000 children in Texas eligible for health
insurance who don't have it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to assign Governor Bush responsibility for all
the problems that exist,'' he said. ``I do think it's fair though
to ask what he has done to try to solve them. He fought against
those in the Legislature who tried to remove the obstacles, and I
think that's an important indicator of the priorities he wants to
establish.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed expanding CHIP to nearly 1 million uninsured
children, and allowing poor families who still don't qualify to buy
into the program at rates that are less expensive than private
insurance. His plan would cost $146 billion over 10 years. &QL;

TRACK GOING TO THE MAT TO IMPROVE ITS APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ No one is saying so directly, but if you
listen to the conversations around the U.S. Olympic Trials, there
is a distinct feeling that someday the hammer contestants will be
throwing at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Or that sprinters will be wired for the sound of their pre-race
woofings.
</P>
<P>
   Or pole vaulters must clear an electrified, sparking crossbar
(style points for scissoring the bar).
</P>
<P>
   It is the charge of Craig Masback, CEO of USA Track &AMP; Field, to
get his sport off its lips and into the American sports
consciousness. While he made none of the above suggestions, he all
but acknowledged that it is a pro rasslin' world, and the rest of
us are merely ring-card girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to structure the rules of the sport to make it as
entertaining as possible,'' Masback said Thursday after his ``state
of the sport'' speech. ``We need to look at the field events to max
out the entertainment value.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, ``our natural analogy (to rasslin') would be our
throwers.''
</P>
<P>
   So, C.J. ``The People'' Hunter, Lance ``Let's Break a'' Deal and
John ``No One Meana'' Godina, pack up your implements with your
face paint.
</P>
<P>
   By 2004, it won't be the Olympic Trials. It will be Five-Ring
Smackdown.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I exaggerate. But not much.
</P>
<P>
   The major buzz at the Trials, which wrap up Sunday with the main
event in the 200 meters between 400-meter champion Michael Johnson
and 100-meter champion Maurice Greene, has been the trash-talking
between the principals. Johnson, track's most prominent male figure
and a heretofore reticent orator, has been poor-mouthing Greene
with almost as much acid as Greene has tongue-lashed him. It's all
junior-league Vince McMahon, but hey, McMahon had to start
somewhere too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy it; I like it,'' said Masback, a former Olympic
distance runner. ``I know that the public reaction will be nothing
but good for the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true burlesque impresario.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the official track uniforms debuting in Sydney
were unveiled (by Nike, official owners of USA Track and Field) and
were just about one tattoo short of turnbuckle-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a mean-looking black with a Spiderman pattern, the unis
were festooned with some vaguely fascistic symbols _ an ominous
``USA'' upon a winged shield, coupled with a red star that would do
proud any remaining Soviet communists.
</P>
<P>
   However dubious the look, the stylings could probably get
somebody elected governor in Minnesota. That's the sort of
gratification track is after.
</P>
<P>
   Masback acknowledged that when he took over track's top business
position three years ago the critics said the sport was
``bankrupt'' in America and ``lacking confidence in its place in
the world of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of that was true, and has been so for years _ at least
since the cashiering of the old Soviet Union. The Evil Empire
provided the United States one of the great rivalries in all of
sports. America used to care a whole lot more about the Olympics
when beating the commies meant something, however symbolic and
artificial.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is no archenemy, only gentle-looking Kenyan runners
and Chinese divers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The rivalry) doesn't exist anymore, and that hurts,'' Masback
acknowledged. He attempted to talk up some meets with other
nations, but it isn't the same.
</P>
<P>
   Track, whose history of high drama and unforgettable moments is
arguably unsurpassed in all of sport, has yet to win over the
saturated American fan. Almost everyone involved has made numerous
suggestions, and for the last 30 years, almost none have been taken
up.
</P>
<P>
   Masback put on the predictable spin, saying his little industry
was ``good and getting better'' and asserting, accurately, that the
enthusiasm, crowds and organization Sacramento has provided
``exceeded all expectations'' and are ``the best trials ever.''
Unfortunately, a good fortnight does not a success make.
</P>
<P>
   Masback cited the NBC ratings for the opening weekend (4.0) as
the best for a TV sports event in the period, and he said the
seasonal ratings for its Golden Spike track circuit exceeded those
of the National Hockey League, Major League Soccer and the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, those sports are also in desperate search for
footing among fans and advertisers, and none have track's heritage
or its participation levels in junior high and high school.
</P>
<P>
   Masback is persuaded that the world's No. 1 track team will have
such a strong showing in Sydney that it will propel the sport
beyond the every-four-years fringe and into the American
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   But since the mainstream is filled with chairs broken over the
backs of the entertainers, Masback is making plans to take the
hammer throwers aside to ask them if they can sharpen their
short-range aim.

MARINERS TRIP ON STAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Call off the morticians. Cancel the burial.
The Athletics are very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   And the American League West race is still that _ a competition.
Seattle holds most of the cards, but Oakland still has an ace or
two up its sleeve _ not to mention a wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's Matt Stairs broke up Aaron Sele's bid for a no-hitter
in the seventh inning Thursday, then put the Mariners away with a
two-run homer in the eighth, highlighting Oakland's 5-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Stairs said it was as important a victory as the A's have had
all year, because the Mariners could have started to put the A's
away if they'd won. Seattle has a four-game lead over Oakland; if
the Mariners had won, the lead would have been six.
</P>
<P>
   ``At six games, the season's not going to be over, but they're
going to be extremely difficult to catch,'' Stairs said in
appreciation of the 55-39 record the Mariners have built up 94
games into the season. ``At six games, maybe we'd have to start
thinking about the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at four games, it's going to be tough to catch the
Mariners, because they're solid in so many ways. After losing (6-3
on Wednesday night), winning today was huge for us. Absolutely
huge.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to feel too sorry for Seattle. True, the
Mariners lost despite a terrific outing by Sele. But the Mariners
survived a harrowing, injury-plagued eight-game road trip to finish
with a 4-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   And their four-game lead in the West is one game better than
when they left town, despite shortstop Alex Rodriguez missing the
entire trip and designated hitter Edgar Martinez not starting five
of the eight games because the DH is not used in National League
ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to play all that time minus A-Rod, and then we didn't
have Edgar available,'' catcher Joe Oliver said. ``A 4-4 record is
a good trip for us, especially going into National League parks
(for six games). That was as good a road trip as we could have
hoped for.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed by more sizzling defensive work from the Seattle infield,
Sele almost made the trip better than the Mariners could have hoped
for. He battled control troubles to take a 1-0 lead into the
seventh inning. A one-out walk to Ben Grieve was followed by a
looping single to left by Stairs that broke up the no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying in the sixth inning that the best thing we had
going for us was the fact that Sele had a no-hitter going,'' A's
general manager Billy Beane said. ``In that situation, they're
going to go with him until he gives up a hit, and not go with the
matchups they might go with otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what happened. Sele hit Jeremy Giambi, then caught
too much of the plate, enabling A's shortstop Miguel Tejada to
crack a two-run double. The lead was 3-1 later in the inning on a
Terrence Long single off Jose Paniagua, and Jose Mesa allowed a
two-run bomb in the eighth to Stairs before the Mariners came up
one run short with a three-run rally in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   While Sele put up zeroes, A's starter Gil Heredia came up with a
few of his own. Mariners shortstop Carlos Guillen stunned Heredia
with a solo homer in the third, but he pitched out of two-men-on
jams later in that inning as well as in the second and sixth
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners racked up hits _ they finished with nine _ but they
weren't leading to any runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our hits,'' Oliver said. ``But we didn't get them in
spots where we could have driven in some runs. But give us credit.
Even after they took the big lead, we came back. We went down
fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   That fact wasn't lost on the A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't over when we got up 5-1,'' manager Art Howe said.
``You don't get to be four games in front this deep into the season
by giving up. They came back hard. We were just able to hold them
off. It was a big win for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to winning four of the trip's first seven games, it
was a not-so-big loss for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a long stretch for us,'' Sele said. ``It's not
just that we've been on the road for eight games. If you go back to
before the break, we've played 18 of the last 21 on the road going
back to the series in Texas (which started June 30).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough schedule. We've done well. And it's going to be
a lot of fun to go home. If you are able to go .500 on the road and
win at home, you'll find yourselves quite a few games over .500.''
</P>
<P>
   To be exact, 16 games over.
</P>
<P>
   So by the end of the afternoon, as they packed up in the bowels
of the Oakland Coliseum, the Mariners were thinking more of what's
to come and less of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it would have been nice to get this one,'' manager Lou
Piniella said. ``But 4-4 is acceptable. It really is. We went on
the road playing short and we went 4-4. That's good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners now look at a season-high 13-game homestand at
Safeco Field, where they are an AL-best 30-13 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder Stairs said catching the Mariners wasn't going to
be easy.

FOR BIGGER DIVISION GAP, M'S NEED MORE POP

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Aaron Sele could at least console himself with
a reassuring mantra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going home. We're happy about that,'' the right-hander
said Thursday after a 5-4 loss to the A's at the Coliseum ended a
long and winding stretch for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing 18 out of 21 on the road is worse than playing 21
straight,'' said Sele, who had the added bonus of a cross-country
trip to the All-Star Game in Atlanta, making the first half of July
a frequent flyer's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Mariners are heading home, where they have built the
bulk of their winning record at Safeco, their field of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   (begin italics) Pitching and defense. Pitching and defense. (end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   That is the other popular Mariner mantra. So far, it has served
the AL West leaders well.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the Mariners punctuated that point. In a 6-3
victory, they all but performed a clinic in the two categories that
make them frontrunners in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Moyer was outstanding, while Mark McLemore and David Bell
led a stellar defensive effort that magnified the defensive foibles
of the A's, the worst defensive team in baseball with 91 errors.
</P>
<P>
   But the follow-up was not exactly what the Mariners needed _ a
sleeping giant waking up on their watch.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stairs, his softball-player physique contributing to his
.215 batting average, looped a single into short right field in the
seventh inning, opening the door for the A's.
</P>
<P>
   With one swing of the bat, Sele's no-hitter was undone.
</P>
<P>
   So was Sele, who had walked Ben Grieve before facing Stairs. He
hit Jeremy Giambi to load the bases, then gave up a two-run double
to Miguel Tejada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't making good pitches,'' Sele said. ``I was behind in
the count from the start, and if you get behind, you're going to
get hurt. I was fortunate to keep the game close, but then I let a
situation get out of hand in the seventh.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, with Jose Mesa on the mound, Stairs clocked a
two-run homer. The A's may be rediscovering their ``Bash Brothers''
persona.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the best scenario for the Mariners, whose superior
pitching and defense should have produced a wider gap atop the
division.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, now 11-5, having lost his past two starts, has enjoyed
magnificent run support this season. He was among the league
leaders, averaging 7.32 runs per start.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, though, the A's asserted their strength _ and perhaps
their biggest advantage over the Mariners _ when Stairs resurrected
his home-run power.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone was wondering whether the current Mariners _ albeit
without the injured Alex Rodriguez _ need to make improvements to
their lineup, Thursday's game was a wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners managed nine hits, three in a three-run ninth. But
it wasn't about what the Mariners did or didn't do.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was how the A's, with two homers Wednesday night and
a big one Thursday, have the kind of lineup that can strike hard
and quick.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Mariners general manager Pat Gillick has held so many
meetings, he should consider renting Camp David. For weeks, the
Mariners have been talking like they're eager to find that extra
pop for their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   When Lou Piniella said Ken Caminiti would be a good fit, Gillick
had that deal in the works, derailed by the Astros placing the
power-hitting third baseman on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, as names like Johnny Damon and Jason Kendall have
been floated, and as B.J. Surhoff remains the coveted hitter who
doesn't want to come to Seattle, the Mariners have quietly and
professionally held their division lead.
</P>
<P>
   With Rodriguez saying he hopes to return Monday against the A's
after sitting out three games against the Rangers, the Mariners'
potent 3-4-5 punch will be back in order.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Mariners to extend their three- and four-game leads,
there must be more bang.
</P>
<P>
   The players aren't worried about upsetting chemistry or making
way for a new personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to be loaded. Too much is not a bad thing.
Better to be prepared. You never know,'' McLemore said.
</P>
<P>
   The second baseman said he wouldn't be surprised if the deal the
Mariners finally make is not just for a role player, but a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put anything past Pat. George Steinbrenner is one
who'll go out and do what needs to done. Pat's another one,''
McLemore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Gillick, Piniella, vice president of baseball
administration Lee Pelekoudas and player development director Roger
Jongewaard) are smart enough to know who's going to be the right
fit. They're the ones who put this thing together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard people talking about how Rickey (Henderson) wasn't
going to be a good fit, and look at him. He can still beat you.
When I heard he was going to be released in New York, I knew he was
going to come here. I wanted him to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners return home for a 13-game stretch against some of
the best teams in the American League with plenty to be happy
about, except that they aren't quite as deep and dangerous as they
could be.
</P>
<P>
   The A's are far from the perfect model to emulate when it comes
to building a contending ballclub. But a Matt Stairs homer every
once in a while shows what a little extra pop can accomplish.

SURE THING ABOUT THE CANDIDATES' VEEP CHOICES: THEY'RE WHITE 
 MALES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Take a look at who's on top of George W. Bush and
Al Gore's list of potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   They are Baby Boomers and war veterans. They are big state
governors and small state senators. And they are all white men.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush prepares to announce his running mate and Gore narrows
his list, the women and minorities once touted as promising
possibilities have all but faded from contention.
</P>
<P>
   California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, once seen as Gore's most
logical choice, has been eclipsed by a number of her male
colleagues. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson, a Latino, has seen
his negatives increase with the price of gasoline. Former Cabinet
Secretary Elizabeth Dole impressed no one with her aborted run for
president. And Gen. Colin Powell has flatly ruled out accepting an
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers blame the expected absence of such candidates on
the limited number of women and minorities in prominent positions
and the peculiarities of the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's prospects would skyrocket if California were seen as
a swing state, as would Dole's if Bush were far behind among female
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it serves as a reminder that 80 years after women gained the
right to vote, and 40 years after minorities were guaranteed access
to polls, both groups have a ways to go before becoming fixtures at
the uppermost echelon of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glass ceiling is chipped. It's not yet shattered,''
Feinstein said in a just-published book called ``Nine and
Counting,'' co-written by the nine female senators.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore have not publicly discussed their lists. It is
impossible to know with certainty who is being considered. But all
of the speculation _ based on face-to-face meetings, requests from
campaign officials for background information and chatter on the
campaign buses _ is focused on a dwindling list of about a dozen
white men.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the idle springtime talk of Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen
Townsend Kennedy, Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts, or New Jersey Sen.
Christine Todd Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   As decision time approaches, the hottest rumor on the Republican
side involves Bush's vanquished primary season rival, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, who once said of Bush that ``if he's a reformer,
I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of insisting he would not consider the vice
presidency, McCain reportedly told Republican officials this week
he might take the number two slot if it is offered.
</P>
<P>
   Other top GOP prospects include Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska,
Govs. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania George
Pataki of New York and former Defense Secretary Richard Cheney, the
man who is heading up Bush's search for a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will make up my mind soon,'' Bush told reporters earlier
this week. An announcement is expected as early as Monday, a week
before the start of the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, insider scuttlebutt is focused on House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who is seen as someone who
might immediately bridge the Democrat's split on labor and trade
issues. Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Evan Bayh of Indiana,
Bob Graham of Florida and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut are also
considered top prospects, as is former Sen. George Mitchell of
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Most say the lack of women and minorities is simply a numbers
game. The entire top tier of vice presidential candidates come from
the ranks of senators and governors. There are just nine female
senators out of 100 (and Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison is
constitutionally barred from joining fellow Texan Bush on the
ticket.) Just three of the nation's 50 governors are women.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are more stark for minorities. Outside of Hawaii,
the only minority senator is Native American Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, whose ponytail and love of Harleys makes his selection
highly unlikely. There are currently no African American senators
or governors.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Wilson was a city council member in Des Moines, Iowa, when
Geraldine Ferraro was named to the 1984 Democratic ticket, and she
remembers thinking that women would be seriously considered on
every ticket thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as president of the White House Project, Wilson works
toward changing public attitudes in order to return women to the
national ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time since Geraldine Ferraro was selected
that women are actually, seriously being discussed,'' Wilson said.
``It's taken us a long time to get to that place.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and other observers believe that were it not for a few
twists of the 2000 campaign, a woman might well have been named
vice president. But since white men still occupy well over 80
percent of the seats in Congress and in state houses, they say it
is no surprise that Bush and Gore appear to have turned to them
during a close election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't enough women yet who are credible, who have the
national national stature to be seen as a seen as something more
than filling a slot,'' said Eleanor Clift, a contributing editor
for Newsweek magazine who recently co-authored a book titled
``Madam President: Shattering the Last Glass Ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lead in the polls has led many advisers to counsel him to
pick a safe, conventional choice. And his strength among women in
the polls, a group that normally heavily favors Democrats has
further reduced the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the gender gap has vanished has taken away the
incentive,'' Clift said.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the ranks of nationally known women is thin, and they
do not come from the Midwest states where the election is likely to
be won.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein has long dismissed the likelihood of her selection,
insisting that she is focused on winning re-election to the Senate.
Most strategists believe California is safely Democratic without
Feinstein, and that her addition to the ticket could lead to an
uncomfortable focus on her husband's business dealings with China _
even though he pledged three years ago to donate any profits from
such investments to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Feinstein is simply too independent to play to role
of a loyal No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure she has the requisite number of subservient genes
required for vice president,'' Clift said.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the vice president's private Capitol Hill office a few
steps from the Senate chamber, California Sen. Barbara Boxer said
she has no doubt a woman will occupy a national office in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women didn't get the vote until 1920,'' said Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a function of their experience. Right now, you don't have
too many who fit the bill. It's not a matter of if. It's a matter
of when.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparent exclusion of women and minorities from the A list
was evident in recent feature story in the New York Times Sunday
Magazine, which detailed Gore's selection process and included tiny
mug shots of 10 top contenders stripped across the top.
</P>
<P>
   They were all white men.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this?'' Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, said in
response to the photos, blaming the media more than Gore's campaign
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Democratic Party in the 20th century, and a woman
couldn't make a list of 10?''

APPEALS COURT RULES INS CAN'T REVOKE CITIZENSHIP
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a decision protecting thousands of
naturalized citizens, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday that
the U.S. Justice Department cannot skirt the court system and
revoke citizenship on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco said the Immigration
and Naturalization Service did not have the authority in 1997 to
implement new procedures to strip individuals of citizenship in
closed-door administrative hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The decision directly affects 2,692 naturalized citizens across
the nation who received notices in 1997 or 1998 informing them of
the INS's intention to begin procedures to revoke their
citizenship. The INS claimed they had failed to disclose criminal
backgrounds. A federal judge in Seattle issued a preliminary
injunction in 1998 barring the agency from continuing the practice.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled
in a 2-1 decision that the INS had the power to revoke citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   But in a decision Thursday by an 11-judge panel, the same court
ruled that Congress had given only the judiciary that authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizenship in the United States of America is among our most
valuable rights,'' wrote Judge Andrew Kleinfeld of Alaska in the
court's opinion. ``For the Attorney General to gain the terrible
power to take citizenship away without going to court, she needs
Congress to say so.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has provided only one way to revoke the citizenship of
naturalized citizens, Kleinfeld said, and that is for a federal
prosecutor to file a petition in court. ``There is no statutory
warrant of a second way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The court rejected the Justice Department's argument that
because it had the right to grant citizenship it also had the power
to take it away. The court called the argument ``weak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no general principle that what one can do, one can
undo,'' Kleinfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan S. Franklin, the Washington, D.C., lawyer representing
the nationwide class of citizens challenging the INS, said the
decision gives all naturalized citizens the protection of a
neutral, independent judge.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that under administrative procedures, the INS official
who issues the notice alerting people to the fact they might be
ineligible for citizenship is the same person who makes the final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that the court has unanimously confirmed that
the INS cannot take away the precious right of United States
citizenship without first proving it in a court of law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Franklin, the citizens who received notices
included a woman in Los Angeles held by police for growing a
marijuana plant. It turned out to be a house plant, and the woman,
who was originally from Mexico and had lived in the United States
for most of her life, was released by police.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Franklin said, a man in New York faced loss of
citizenship after he was arrested. Though his arrest was nullified
by a judge, the INS notified him that the agency was initiating
procedures to revoke his citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman said that the
government lawyers had not had a chance to review the decision but
would take ``appropriate action following our review.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS adopted the rules in 1996 in the wake of criticism by
Republicans of Citizenship USA, a campaign launched by the Clinton
administration that allowed 180,000 immigrants to become citizens
before the November election without having to go through a
criminal background check.
</P>
<P>
   The INS responded by conducting an unprecedented review of more
than 1 million people granted citizenship between August 1995 and
September 1996. The study found 6,300 people lied or failed to
inform the INS about prior arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,600 people received notices that the INS was taking steps
to revoke their citizenship, but the agency acknowledged that only
369 of those people had committed crimes that would make them
ineligible for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The INS ultimately revoked the citizenship of 16 people before
the judge in Seattle issued the injunction blocking the process.

 CALIFORNIA GOP PICKS PRO-CHOICE ADVOCATE FOR PLATFORM PANEL  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The California delegation to the Republican National Convention
has chosen a pro-choice advocate as a representative on the GOP
platform committee _ and she will push for a ``more moderate''
party position on abortion, state leaders said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Parsky, who heads Texas Gov. George W. Bush's campaign in
California and chairs the 374-member state delegation, told
reporters Thursday that Toni Casey, the vice-mayor of Los Altos
Hills, has been appointed to the key subcommittee, which deals with
family issues within the GOP platform.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged she will be ``a good advocate'' for a viewpoint that
clearly differs from the official party position on the volatile
issue of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   With a little over a week to go before the Republican National
Convention opens in Philadelphia, the announcement was part of an
effort by state GOP leaders to underscore Bush's efforts to enlarge
the party's ``big tent.''
</P>
<P>
   The current GOP platform condemns abortion _ and makes no
exceptions for rape, incest or the life or health of the mother.
Bush has said he will not contest that language and believes the
GOP ``ought to maintain its pro-life tenor.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey, a strong Bush supporter, said Thursday that she will tell
GOP convention delegates that the issue has no place at all in the
GOP platform. ``The better solution is to recognize that this issue
has differing opinions on this side, and each side has respect for
the other,'' she said. ``This ... is a privacy and moral issue and
should be taken out of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The former biotech lobbyist said she is receiving 50 cards and
letters a day from pro-choice Republicans supporting her presence.
That's a far cry from the 1996 GOP national convention in San
Diego, where abortion proved a bitterly divisive issue _ and former
California Gov. Pete Wilson was lambasted by hard-liners for
unsuccessfully attempting to get his party to reconsider its tough
anti-abortion stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very incredible opportunity ... of having a full place
at the table,'' said Casey, who credited Bush's own campaign, as
well as the state GOP, for the change. But Casey added that
pro-choice Republicans are ``clearly unified in supporting George
W. Bush, and we will come out of the convention ... to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsky, in a conference call to reporters, also touted the
California GOP delegation as reflective of California's diversity,
saying it represented ``a different kind of convention for a
different type of Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parsky ran into trouble when he acknowledged that the GOP
has made no real measure of how diverse his delegation is, either
ethnically or in sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Parsky said Republicans ``don't operate (delegation selection)
with any quota system,'' and while there's no data to prove it, he
has ``high confidence'' that the party's representatives will
represent fresh voices at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic campaign adviser Bob Mulholland immediately
called the GOP's efforts to tout diversity ``a carnival shell
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush Jr.'s already caved in to Jerry Falwell and Bob Jones''
on the issue of abortion. Their platform says they believe that
abortion should not be a private matter _ it should be a crime,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he ridiculed the GOP's attempt to portray its ``handpicked''
delegation as diverse. ``Maybe to a billionaire, this crowd looks
diverse,'' said Mulholland.

 BE SURE TO BRAKE FOR GARTER SNAKE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER

NEW LIMIT PROPOSED FOR PROTESTERS
</HEADLINE>
 - LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To satisfy a federal judge, Los Angeles police
proposed Thursday allowing Democratic National Convention
protesters within 100 yards of the Staples Center, but vowed to
``not surrender our city.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, speaking before two City Council
committees, said the new plan would protect life and property --
but involve substantially more officers and boost the cost of
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not surrender our city,'' Parks said. ``Our duty lies
first with protecting the city, securing the convention and
allowing demonstrators to have their say -- not the other way
around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will require us to have more officers on duty at Staples
Center and there will be higher costs,'' Parks told members of the
Budget and Finance and Ad Hoc Committee on the Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal will be submitted to U.S. District Court Judge
Gary Feess, whose ruling released Thursday says the original plan
would violate protester rights to free speech by restricting them
to a yards from the Staples Center, across Olympic Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protecting the safety of all people present in the Staples
Center area during the convention is undoubtedly a significant
government interest,'' Feess wrote. He added, however, that the
``government cannot infringe on First Amendment rights on the mere
speculation that violence may occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Several council members voiced concern that the new plan would
leave police unable to protect other areas of the city, including
the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spoken to Valley commanders and others and they tell me
about how thin they are in the ranks,'' said Councilman Joel Wachs.
</P>
<P>
   Police plans would allow for coverage, Parks said, even if the
city goes to full mobilization, with officers assigned to 12-hour
shifts, which effectively doubles the size of the force.
</P>
<P>
   Although expensive -- such a plan costs $1.5 million a day --
Parks said it is a way to ensure police coverage across the city.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Tokaji, the American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney
who challenged the city's original plan, questioned whether the new
plan goes far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cases cited by the judge said that 75 yards away is too
far,'' Tokaji said. ``We will look at whatever they submit, but on
the surface that doesn't sound acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Without providing specific numbers or the cost, Cmdr. Tom
Lorenzen said the new plan might involve several hundred more
officers ``I can tell you from our experience in this city that
even with a fence, it is unstable and insecure. Without a fence, it
would be completely out of control. And if the demonstrators
attempt to breach the fence, it will mean we need even more
officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Alex Padilla said he was disturbed by the timing of
the discussions -- much of which had been heard before and was
assuming a worst-case scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making assumptions based on demonstrations that may or
may not happen, on violence that may or may not happen,'' Padilla
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the various official protest groups have adopted a
pledge of nonviolence, Parks said the same oath was made last year
in Seattle before the World Trade Organization meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to be like the Seattle police chief and stand
up before the cameras and say they lied to me,'' Parks said. ``We
have to prepare for any eventuality.''

ACHILLES' TENDON SIDELINES ANDERSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Center fielder Garret Anderson, after
suffering a couple of brain cramps in the past week, has come down
with what the Angels hope will be a less-lingering malady: a
strained Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was a late scratch from Thursday's lineup because of
the sore left heel. He suffered the injury while running during
Wednesday night's 3-2 loss to Texas but was penciled in the
designated hitter's spot on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It added injury to insult for Anderson, who twice in the past
week has failed to back up right fielders on balls that got away
from them.
</P>
<P>
   MERCKER UPDATE: Kent Mercker threw batting practice, the latest
step in his recovery from a cerebral hemorrhage on May 12. Mercker
reported no problems and is slated to throw a simulated game on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia said that a return by Mercker in 10
days is unrealistic, but if all goes well, the long man/spot
starter would likely be back before Sept. 1, when rosters are
expanded to 40 players. The plan is for Mercker to throw a couple
of simulated games before beginning rehab assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Mike Fyhrie has been outstanding in Mercker's role
(a 1.37 ERA over his last 26 innings), Scioscia said he won't have
a problem finding a spot for the left-hander. The Angels have only
one left-hander in the bullpen, Mike Holtz. &QL;

JOHNSON BACK ON THE BENCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Davey Johnson returned to the Dodgers bench in
good spirits, though admittedly a bit fatigued and also with a few
don'ts so he doesn't have a return of the irregular heartbeat that
hospitalized him for four days.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who went to the hospital Sunday and was released from
Centinela Hospital Medical Center on Wednesday evening, took over
his managerial duties for Thursday's game against Colorado. Bench
coach Jim Tracy went 3-1 as the acting manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we were playing, I thought about staying away for
another week,'' Johnson said. ``It's good to get back here. They
took real good care of me at Centinela Hospital. A lot of nice
people there. The only negative over there is they don't carry the
Dodger games on TV. I could catch them on radio, but it's good to
be back.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson, 57, is back under a few different rules set forth
by his doctors. Arguing calls is allowed, but tobacco, wine and
caffeine are out.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had a similar problem four years ago when he managed in
Baltimore, which he said helped him in this instance. Johnson
passed out when he was with the Orioles but he experienced similar
symptoms this time.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson continues to take medication. He said the reason he was
hospitalized for four days was to make sure his heart was back on
its regular rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was little bit scary,'' Johnson said. ``I think it's
something a lot of people have, but it's something you don't really
mess with. You get up and you get real faint. A couple of times I
almost fainted. That's happened during ballgames, too, but not at
six in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took about 24 hours, and after a lot of medication I came
back to normal and they kind of kept me in there. I feel a little
bit tired, but I'm glad to be out.''
</P>
<P>
   BATTLING BELTRE: Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre curbed his
early-season error problems and raised his average since the
All-Star break, but he isn't producing runs.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre said he must improve his performance with runners in
scoring position. Since returning from the disabled list June 17,
he is 4 for 27 (.148) with five RBI with runners in scoring
position. He has just eight RBI since coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``One week before the All-Star break, I was struggling, but I'm
starting to hit better,'' said Beltre, who's 10 for 25 since the
break and is hitting .264. ``I'm still struggling a little bit with
runners in scoring position, and that's bothering me right now. I
know it's going to change. It's not because I'm not patient. I
don't know exactly what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   SMELL WHAT SHEFF IS COOKIN': Left fielder Gary Sheffield hit his
major league-leading 33rd homer in the bottom of the first inning,
tying the third-most he's hit in a season in his career. Sheffield
hit 33 for San Diego in 1992, 34 for the Dodgers last season and 42
for Florida in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's hit with power this season, but he's also been
selective at the plate. Of the 21 players with 25 homers this
season, only six have more walks than strikeouts. And Sheffield
leads the group at +24. He's walked 66 times and struck out 42. By
contrast, Chicago's Sammy Sosa, who has 29 homers, has walked 52
times and struck out 104 times.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Right-hander Mike Fetters will serve his one-game
suspension today for his part in the May 16 fight at Wrigley Field.
... Long-lost outfielder Geronimo Berroa, on the disabled list
since June 3 with a broken left foot, isn't close to returning.
Berroa was re-examined by team doctors and X-rays revealed the
break still exists. &QL;

$226 MILLION EARMARKED TO COMPLETE SOUND WALLS
</HEADLINE>
 - LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DANA BARTHOLOMEW 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Breaking 30 years of delays, state officials
earmarked $226 &UR;  &LR; million Thursday to finish desperately needed
soundwalls on freeways across the San Fernando Valley and state.
</P>
<P>
   The state Transportation Commission, prompted by Gov. Gray
Davis, voted to spend the money on 63 unfinished soundwalls,
including 13 within the Greater San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   An official announcement is scheduled for today at a press
conference in Van Nuys along the San Diego Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soundwalls were promised as the freeway system was being
built,'' Davis said in a statement. ``Unfortunately, for a variety
of reasons, 63 projects fell through the cracks and were never
completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A promise made is a promise kept -- and the time is long
overdue to finish construction of the soundwalls,'' he added. ``The
residents living near the soundwalls have been more than patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Genette Winnik, 38, of Hollywood, whose home backs up to the 170
Freeway, said she and her neighbors had all but lost hope that the
soundwalls would be erected after so many years of waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating to hear they were going to be putting
soundwalls up all these years and they've never gone up,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other residents living along freeways said increased traffic
near their homes has made their back yards unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part is that you can't get out in your own back yard
and really enjoy it,'' said Don Pregler, who has lived in his
three-bedroom Williamsburg Colonial home that backs up against the
north side of the 134 Freeway since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for soundwalls along finished freeways has been
fought for 30 years. Funding for the walls was supposed to come
from a mammoth gas tax increase approved by voters in 1989.
Instead, it was diverted to bridge-repair work after the Loma
Prieta and Northridge earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, numerous efforts by legislators and residents
affected by the roar of cars and air brakes of countless trucks
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta tell you, it's about time,'' said Assemblyman Scott
Wildman, D-Glendale, whose two bills to fund soundwalls in his
Glendale and Toluca Lake district failed to garner support from
Northern California lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a massive community effort. When I was elected four
years ago, it became one of the priorities -- we had signatures
drives, petitions, letters. Finally, after two decades of abuse,
this community will finally get their soundwalls.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank L. Zugelter, president of the Toluca Lake Homeowners
Association, said his home does not back up against the freeway,
but that he can still hear the unrelenting sound of morning rush
hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice alarm clock, but who wants an alarm clock all the
time?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only freeways built after 1974 and those with newly built
car-pool lanes are required to have soundwalls, designed to keep
noise in neighborhoods below 65 decibels.
</P>
<P>
   While developers of new homes funded soundwalls adjacent to
their projects, older homes were ignored by the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, which was assigned with retrofitting
their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently 400 miles of soundwalls in Los Angeles and
Ventura counties, according to the California Department of
Transportation. Their cost: $1 million a mile.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect the new soundwalls to be completed within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big victory for the Valley, for quality of life,''
said Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that what was promised to voters in 1988 is finally
being delivered,'' added David Fleming, who as vice chairman of the
Transportation Commission fought for years to attain funding for
soundwalls in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   After years of hoping with no results, Winnik cautiously
reserved her elation. ``I'm still in shock and I won't believe it
until they start breaking ground,'' she said.

HMOS TO COVER ACUPUNCTURE VISITS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ First it was banning smoking in restaurants and
bars. Later it was Tae Bo and drinking shots of wheat grass. Now
health-conscious Californians want their health plans to offer
herbal supplements and acupuncture along with regular doctor
visits.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate their 2 &UR;  &LR; million California members, Woodland
Hills-based Health Net announced Thursday that it will begin
offering HMO-style coverage of acupuncture service and herbal
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   For a small fee -- no more than $15 -- a Health Net member will
be able to visit an acupuncturist to relieve, well, all the things
acupuncturists relieve. That same Health Net member will be able to
buy supplements for a similarly low co-payment.
</P>
<P>
   Other HMOs have offered limited coverage of acupuncture and
herbal supplements, but Health Net's is believed to be the most
comprehensive to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done our research, which shows there is a demand for
these services,'' said Lisa Kalustian, associate vice president of
communications and public relations at Health Net.
</P>
<P>
   There's also medical proof. Kalustian said the National
Institutes of Health has concluded that acupuncture has been proved
to be an effective therapy for a variety of conditions, including
lower back pain and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering discount programs for complementary
therapies, as some other health maintenance organizations do,
Health Net's acupuncture and herbal supplements coverage allows
members with HMO benefits to self-refer to an acupuncture provider
for up to a $15 co-payment, depending on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Diamond, senior media manager with the American
Association of Health Plans in Washington, said more and more
health plans nationwide are offering some acupuncture benefits but
not to the extent of Health Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It varies from plan to plan greatly still,'' Diamond said.
``Employees who want these benefits should ask their health plans
or their employer to see if they will purchase them.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond said if there are enough employees who are willing to
pay for an herbal supplements plan, the HMO will provide coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers need to remember that a lot of alternative
treatments are very costly, so it's hard to afford them out of
pocket,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of these plans to the employer vary, Kalustian said,
from about 80 cents per member per month up to about $2.50 per
person per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price depends on whether it's just chiropractic care or
combined with acupuncture and herbal,'' Kalustian said.
</P>
<P>
   At Blue Shield of California, members have access to
chiropractic and acupuncture benefits depending on their plan, said
company spokeswoman Michelle Naiditch.
</P>
<P>
   For 1.2 million Californians with PPO coverage, acupuncture and
chiropractic is automatically part of their benefits package, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For HMO plans, it's offered if the employer chooses to purchase
the optional acupuncture rider, while Medicare members are offered
the plan in a ``complementary benefit'' package for $25 per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have expressed a strong interest in mind, body and
health,'' Naiditch said. ``Our benefits and the discounts available
respond to those consumers with the assurance Blue Shield standards
for quality are being met.''
</P>
<P>
   Health Net's acupuncture and herbal supplement benefits will be
offered as an optional feature to employer groups beginning Aug. 1
with initial effective dates a month later.
</P>
<P>
   The new benefits are available to employers offering Health Net
commercial or Medicare HMO benefits, she said. The network of
acupuncture providers is maintained by American Specialty Health
Plan.
</P>
<P>
   Health Net is a subsidiary of Foundation Health Systems Inc.

Institutes of Health has concluded that acupuncture has been proved
to be an effective therapy for a variety of conditions, including
lower back pain and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering discount programs for complementary
therapies, as some other health maintenance organizations do,
Health Net's acupuncture and herbal supplements coverage allows
members with HMO benefits to self-refer to an acupuncture provider
for up to a $15 co-payment, depending on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Diamond, senior media manager with the American
Association of Health Plans in Washington, said more and more
health plans nationwide are offering some acupuncture benefits but
not to the extent of Health Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It varies from plan to plan greatly still,'' Diamond said.
``Employees who want these benefits should ask their health plans
or their employer to see if they will purchase them.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond said if there are enough employees who are willing to
pay for an herbal supplements plan, the HMO will provide coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers need to remember that a lot of alternative
treatments are very costly, so it's hard to afford them out of
pocket,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of these plans to the employer vary, Kalustian said,
from about 80 cents per member per month up to about $2.50 per
person per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price depends on whether it's just chiropractic care or
combined with acupuncture and herbal,'' Kalustian said.
</P>
<P>
   At Blue Shield of California, members have access to
chiropractic and acupuncture benefits depending on their plan, said
company spokeswoman Michelle Naiditch.
</P>
<P>
   For 1.2 million Californians with PPO coverage, acupuncture and
chiropractic is automatically part of their benefits package, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For HMO plans, it's offered if the employer chooses to purchase
the optional acupuncture rider, while Medicare members are offered
the plan in a ``complementary benefit'' package for $25 per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have expressed a strong interest in mind, body and
health,'' Naiditch said. ``Our benefits and the discounts available
respond to those consumers with the assurance Blue Shield standards
for quality are being met.''
</P>
<P>
   Health Net's acupuncture and herbal supplement benefits will be
offered as an optional feature to employer groups beginning Aug. 1
with initial effective dates a month later.
</P>
<P>
   The new benefits are available to employers offering Health Net
commercial or Medicare HMO benefits, she said. The network of
acupuncture providers is maintained by American Specialty Health
Plan.
</P>
<P>
   Health Net is a subsidiary of Foundation Health Systems Inc.

 RED SOX SPLIT WITH ORIOLES; SCHOUREK DONE?
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Pete Schourek was as tough a lefty as there was in
the National League in the mid-1990s, even though Red Sox Nation
barely caught a glimpse of that incarnation. And he'll always own a
small but notable niche in Red Sox annals as the guy who was given
the ball instead of Pedro Martinez one October, with a playoff
series hanging in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   But Schourek, who would sooner stop breathing than pitching, may
have reached the stage in his career where he is more useful in a
pre-med class at Tufts, where students could examine his ravaged
left arm, than back on the mound for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The longest day of the season for the Red Sox _ a day-night
doubleheader split against the Baltimore Orioles that saw the Sox
take the first game, 11-7, and lose the second, 9-4, with a
suspended Carl Everett (he was hit with a 10-game ban for last
Saturday's confrontation with umpire Ronald Kulpa) still in uniform
pending his appeal _ may have more lasting ramifications for
Schourek.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5-inch Virginian is 30, but his left arm might as
well be as old as that of another gallant Sox lefty, Mel Parnell,
who is 78. Schourek lasted seven outs in Thursday night's loss and
was charged with five runs on five hits and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, as the Sox wearily prepared for a postmidnight
flight home, Schourek admitted his arm was hamburger. In addition
to having bone chips in his elbow, which he hoped he could grin and
bear until winter, he also has stiffness in his shoulder. He
suspects, after talking with team doctor Bill Morgan, that he has
some fraying in his rotator cuff and a bone spur in the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think anyone will sign me after five surgeries?''
Schourek said as he contemplated his baseball mortality. ``I can't
beat myself up about it.''
</P>
<P>
   With Schourek sporting a record of 2-9, an ERA of 5.05, and a
bum arm, and a country boy named Paxton Crawford, who already has
won in the big leagues and three days ago threw a no-hitter at
Pawtucket, waiting in the wings, Schourek's days in the rotation
appear to be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see me making my next start for sure,'' Schourek said.
``After that, I don't know. I'm scheduled for an MRI in the next
couple of days, and we'll see how that plays out.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion is that it will play out just as unhappily as
Thursday night's game, when John Wasdin, who warmed up in the first
inning of both ends of the twinbill, finally got the call in the
third inning with the Sox still ahead, 3-2, but two Orioles on base
and a 2-and-0 count on Charles Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin walked Johnson, a base on balls that was charged to
Schourek. That loaded the bases, which for Wasdin is about as safe
as setting his pants on fire. Four times this season, he has
pitched with the bases full, and 10 of the 12 runners have scored,
including three Thursday night all coming home courtesy of Mark
Lewis's double into the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the third time we'd gotten Wasdin up,'' Williams said.
``We didn't have a lot of bullets out there. It didn't work, but it
was the right time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, the Game 1 starter, survived a stormy
introduction Thursday afternoon, giving up a first-inning grand
slam to Will (the Infrequent Thrill) Clark, who would later homer
off Wasdin in Game 2. Mike Bordick added a final two-run shot off
Bryce Florie in the seventh to put to rest any thoughts of a Sox
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't an idle notion. The Sox had beaten the O's 10
straight in Camden Yards, smacking 17 hits in the opener to rescue
Martinez, who allowed just one more run in his five innings of
work. Hours after baseball disciplinarian Frank Robinson called
Everett to tell him about his upcoming 10-game vacation, the Sox
center fielder hit a two-run home run with his first swing since
getting the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a distraction to me,'' Everett had said before the
game. ``It's all behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though Everett would go on to whiff four times for only
the third time in his career, it was smooth sailing for the Sox in
Game 1 once they got past Clark's first slam in nine years. Troy
O'Leary was on base five times with a walk and four hits, driving
in three runs. Nomar Garciaparra singled, doubled, and tripled,
raising his average to .403. (He proved mortal in Game 2, going 0
for 5 to bring his average down to .396.) Jason Varitek, who came
into the game in a 1-for-18 spin, doubled, homered, and singled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got big hits all day,'' said Orioles manager Mike
Hargrove. ``They have a track record of getting big hits and
driving in big runs and that's what we saw.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what Hargrove and the Orioles saw in Game 2, when
the Sox had just four hits off a wild Scott Erickson (six walks in
5 1/3 innings) and three relievers.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, meanwhile, had 14 hits and seven walks against
Boston moundsmen Schourek, Waz, and Florie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to sit down,'' Williams said as he popped up from his
chair after Game 2, which lasted 3 hours 14 minutes, two minutes
longer than the matinee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got beat. We've been here a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long enough for the immortal Izzy Alcantara to see action,
though. He was the only Sox position player not to take the field
in the doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   For Schourek, the leaving may be the hardest part. He graduated
from George C. Marshall High School in 1987, the same year he
pitched his first game of pro ball. It was only a year later, in
1988, when he had his first operation on his left elbow, and missed
the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he was in the big leagues. The guy has made a
career out of making comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid has got a heart as big as this building,'' Williams
said. ``He wants to pitch.''

LEAGUE GIVES EVERETT 10 GAMES FOR OUTBURST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Minutes after being informed Thursday morning that
he had been suspended for 10 games and fined (an amount not made
public) by Major League Baseball for twice making contact with
plate umpire Ronald Kulpa last Saturday, Red Sox center fielder
Carl Everett filed an appeal through the Major League Players
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lenaghan, assistant general counsel for the players
union, said he filed the appeal after speaking with Everett in the
visitors' clubhouse, about an hour before the penalty was announced
by Frank Robinson, vice president of on-field operations for Major
League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal allows Everett to continue playing until a hearing is
held. The hearing will be conducted by Paul Beeston, baseball's
chief operating officer. No date has been set for the hearing, and
while Beeston has attempted to hear appeals more quickly than
league presidents did in the past, it took him nearly six weeks to
make a ruling on the multiple appeals filed after the Dodgers'
brawl with spectators May 16 at Chicago's Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   It also was three weeks before Beeston conducted his hearing on
the Tigers-White Sox brawls April 22, for which Dean Palmer of the
Tigers was suspended eight games for charging the mound, then
coming out of the clubhouse for a second brawl after already having
been ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to need time to prepare,'' Lenaghan said. ``This
is not your garden-variety case.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-game suspension assessed Everett is the stiffest penalty
given a player by Robinson, who is in his first year of
administering discipline. It also is the longest given a player for
an on-field incident since Bill Madlock, who was playing for
Pittsburgh, shoved his glove in the face of umpire Jerry Crawford
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The statement from the commissioner's office read, ``Boston Red
Sox outfielder Carl Everett has been suspended for 10 games and
fined an undisclosed amount for excessive arguing, using foul
language, and making contact with an umpire on two occasions during
the Mets-Red Sox game at Fenway Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett hit a home run in his first at-bat after being informed
of his suspension, then struck out a season-high four times in the
Red Sox' 11-7 win over the Orioles in Game 1 of a day-night
doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a reaction,'' Everett said before the first game,
breaking his silence on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Everett was asked about comments by Larry Reynolds, his agent,
that a closer viewing of videotapes of the incident showed he had
not head-butted Kulpa, who is in his first season in the big
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is that the majority of the media tried to
make a guy (into) a monster,'' Everett said. ``Everybody is quick
to judge. I fault the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he regretted any of his actions, Everett said, ``You're
asking a question I really don't have an answer for, because that
answer can be fabricated. There's no need to answer that.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from the executive board of the
World Umpires Association, the umpires' new union that is in a
critical stage of its negotiations with Major League Baseball on a
new collective bargaining agreement. Karen Brinkman, administrative
assistant for the WUA, said early Thursday night the union may have
a statement forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox spokesman Kevin Shea said general manager Dan Duquette,
who was not with the team, would not comment on the suspension. Red
Sox manager Jimy Williams was asked if he found the penalty
excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for me to decide,'' Williams said. ``Everybody has a
job, just like you have with that pen right now. Frank Robinson
certainly has a tough job, but somebody has to make a decision. He
accepted the responsibility of taking that job, so he's handled it
the best he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett acknowledged he had spoken with Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him, that's all I can do,'' Everett said. ``He
called me. I talked to him. I told him my side. That's all I can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the severity of the suspension, Everett mentioned
how he had spoken out against Pedro Martinez's five-game suspension
for hitting Cleveland's Roberto Alomar with a pitch April 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've defended Pedro before, and what I stated with Pedro I
pretty much still feel the same,'' he said. ``Certain situations
are going be treated differently, so really I don't have an opinion
on every situation that goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The media) tried to make me out to be a monster, that's the
whole thing. That's purely it. If you listen to everything someone
said, it's their own opinion instead of what you actually see.
That's what they want everyone else to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he saw, Everett said, ``I would say I didn't do the
things people said I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he found unfair about the suspension that led
him to appeal, Everett said, ``I'm not gonna . . . That's . . . I
can't really state that here because there's no merit here. Where I
state that is when I go for my appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reporter mentioned to Everett that several of his
teammates had explained Everett's actions as the result of a
competitor being ``juiced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There again, I mean I can say some things that could rattle
some feathers but I'd rather keep that to myself until I appeal my
case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if he blamed Kulpa, who twice drew a line in the
dirt near home plate after Mets catcher Mike Piazza complained that
Everett was standing too close to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to judge another person,'' he said. ``I would
not go out of my way to just make myself look better. Let
everything stand as it is right now. At a later date, I can
elaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he felt he owed an apology to his teammates, he
said: ``That's just something between me and my teammates.''

MEDIA COLUMN: WHAT'S FOX UP TO?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the surface, the latest strategic move by the folk at Fox
Sports doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   The network that hired Keith Olbermann away from MSNBC and
installed him as the fulcrum of its Fox Sports News show, since
refurbished as the National Sports Report (NSR), is leaving that
show to host a weekly show on Sunday entitled ``The Keith Olbermann
Evening News.''
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann still will host the baseball pregame show on Fox and
have an expanded role in the network's postseason coverage, but his
days as co-host on the NSR are numbered. The new show is set to
debut on Aug. 6, and it will replace the NSR on Sunday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Fox President David Hill, who has been the nursemaid for
virtually every sports product at Fox, said that Olbermann has met
the goal of establishing the NSR as a competitor to ESPN's
SportsCenter, and that the plan was always to create him some new
challenges. Olbermann will also be executive producer of his show,
meaning no one will be around telling him what he can and can't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``In TV, you've got to be a shark,'' said Hill. ``When Keith
first came here, the news show was a mess, and he's corrected that.
This is something brand new, an attempt to redefine what networks
give viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One phrase I want to keep clear of with this show is `the
thinking man's show,' because I thing that would be wrong. But we
are trying to create something that's new.''
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann describes the new show as a hybrid. It will look like
a normal highlights show for 15 to 30 minutes, then move to
analysis, a live interview with a newsmaker and commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have a smorgasbord quality,'' said Olbermann. ``It's
like a Sunday newspaper. The Sunday paper is always bigger and has
many more things in it than any other days. The threshold will be
finding enough compelling stories to make it a solid hour of
wall-to-wall information.''
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann's job history is dotted with disagreements with
management, most notably his acrimonious departure from ESPN. Most
often, he has complained at management attempts to dumb-down its
sports product (i.e., Fox's sappy Regional Sports Report).
</P>
<P>
   So the question had to be asked: Was there a conflict between
Olbermann and NSR execs, especially since the recent changes that
saw less time for Olbermann commentaries and more time for
analysts?
</P>
<P>
   No, says Hill and Olbermann. But Hill admits the NSR needed to
change directions to adapt to a new environment that includes the
Internet. The emphasis on analysts early and often was a response
to Fox surveys that show 42 percent of all NSR viewers know the
result of the games that interest them before tuning in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't terribly happy with the original NSR and its former
role as Fox Sports News,'' Hill said. ``Our ratings were such that
I once asked if it wouldn't be cheaper to fly all the viewers in
and put them in a studio?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using the same philosophy we took when we created the
NFL pregame show: Report the facts and wrap them in analysis. The
great joy of sports is anticipation what happened, what does it
mean, and what's going to happen next.''
</P>
<P>
   This policy is OK when the analysts are the fearless Kevin
Kennedy (baseball) and energetic Marques Johnson (basketball), but
bad when the analyst is the somnolent Phil Esposito (hockey). Those
shows work best, too, when the anchors are also strong
personalities, like Olbermann.
</P>
<P>
   Hill prefers to flip direction. Rather than focus on what the
NSR is losing, he's looking forward to Olbermann's new show and the
way it hopefully will fit with other aggressive, content-heavy Fox
shows, like ``The Last Word'' with Jim Rome and ``Goin' Deep'' with
Chris Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a greedy programmer,'' said Hill. ``The more strong
programs I have the better.''
</P>
<P>
   And the decision does come at a time when the networks are all
flexing their often ignored and undernourished journalist muscles.
ESPN recently added a weekly edition of ``Outside the Lines'' and
HBO will debut a show hosted by Bob Costas after the baseball
season as a companion to ``Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be wonderful if all of these shows thrived, but
hard-hitting sports shows are a pretty low priority for sports
fans. Howard Cosell's ``Sports Beat'' show on ABC back in the '70s
was a Nielsen failure. Ratings aren't nearly as important in cable,
but it isn't cheap to front shows with hosts like Olbermann, Costas
and Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   At least in Olbermann's case, he answers to himself. As he joked
Thursday, ``the key to this show is the opportunity to be executive
producer. which may allow me to submit my own resignation to
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   THIRD AND LONG: Fox Sports will double its number of Hall of
Fame broadcasters next weekend when ex-Raider Howie Long is
inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst on the Fox NFL pregame show says his broadcast
experience helped put his playing career in better perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt Millen said this when I went to work for Fox, and I now
know what he meant,'' said Long. ``I didn't have any perspective of
my own career until I had the opportunity to talk with coaches and
players, especially young players coming up now, who thought a
great deal of how I played the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had tremendous respect for the privilege to play in
the NFL, and when you're playing, you don't think of yourself in
those terms. That was a benefit of my TV work I didn't really
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   DOG DAYS OF SUMMER: Coming to the ESPN and ESPN2 airwaves
beginning July 27 will be 17 hours of ``The Great Outdoor Games,''
an X Games spin-off the cable owns and hopes to develop into solid
alternative programming each summer.
</P>
<P>
   There will be 21 events in four categories that fall way outside
of the usual sports panorama fishing, timber events, target sports,
and sporting dogs. Other than the old ``American Sportsman'' series
hosted by Curt Gowdy or ESPN coverage of the occasional Lumberjack
Games, these sports haven't been graced by many cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing events include bass fishing, fly-fishing and casting
competition, and there will be shotgun, rifle and archery events in
the target section. The timber events include the always popular
Hot Saw and Two-Board Jigger, and the dogs will compete in Big Air
and Fly Ball competition.
</P>
<P>
   Big Air is essentially the doggy long jump. Technology has also
gone to the dogs with the first use of the Dog Cam worn by some
competitors. ESPN is taking this event seriously. The host is NFL
reporter Mark Malone, and ABC's Jack Arute, ESPN NHL analyst Bill
Clement and ESPN college football voice Ron Franklin are also
members of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Says Arute about the assignment: ``Dogs almost always are
accommodating even after a bitter defeat, and you rarely need to
watch out for inappropriate language.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Baywatch'' actress Kelly Packard will also do photo essays
during the coverage. Of herself, one might hope.
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW THE NEWS: It didn't take deposed Monday Night Football
announcer Boomer Esiason to find work. Westwood One/CBS Radio named
him an analyst on their Monday night radio broadcasts, joining
Howard David and analyst Matt Millen. Esiason has been co-host of a
football show on CBS Radio for more than a year. ... Tennis
Nielsens got a bump thanks to the American success of Pete Sampras
and Venus Williams at Wimbledon. Turner (TNT) averaged a 1.1 for
its 66 hours of daytime coverage, which works out to 868,000 homes
per broadcast. That was double what HBO averaged and also higher
than TNT's usual daytime average. NBC's ratings were also up over
last year. ... The newly aggressive U.S. Tennis Assn. has expanded
its media presence with a new series on CBS, ``Topspin,'' that airs
the next four Saturdays (11 a.m. this week). ... Monday's edition
of ``Real Sports'' on HBO (10 p.m.) includes a piece on gay
athletes. ... Sunday's ``Page One'' on CNN/SI (9:30 a.m., 4:30
p.m., 7:30 p.m.) focuses on sports parent rage. ... ESPN Classic
covers baseball's Hall of Fame induction ceremonies Sunday at 1:30
p.m. ... ESPN will go live with about ten minutes of Tour de France
coverage Sunday morning if Lance Armstrong is in a position to win
the race. &QL;

HOUSE APPROVES EASING OF EMBARGO ON CUBAN TRADE AND TRAVEL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives on Thursday night
approved measures to bar the Treasury Department from enforcing
restrictions on travel to Cuba as well as on the sale of food and
medicines to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the 38-year-old American trade embargo on Cuba hailed
the votes as a major first step in the House toward clearing the
way to commercial ties and even American tourism.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 232-186, lawmakers ordered that the Treasury
Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the chief bureau for
enforcing sanctions against Cuba, be prohibited from spending
federal funds to restrict Americans from traveling there or
engaging in the sale of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty Republicans voted in favor of the amendment on travel,
which was added to the bill to finance the Treasury Department and
Postal Service by Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford expressed elation at the vote, which he said was a sign
that lawmakers are increasingly prepared to engage the government
of Cuba, just as they have sought to end the isolation of
governments such as China and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford said the vote would help correct ``an incredible
inconsistency'' in American foreign policy, and marked a victory
for Americans who claim a constitutional right to travel to nations
whose governments are at odds with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sanford said, American travel will advance the cause
of democratic reforms in Cuba more surely than efforts to isolate
the Cuban people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marks the beginning of the an end for an outdated policy
toward Cuba,'' he said. ``We've tried 40 years of isolation. It has
not worked. The will of the house is that we take this incremental
step.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of sanctions against Cuba noted that it still remains
illegal for Americans to travel there as tourists, even if the
Treasury Department becomes unable to enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
   There is no companion measure on travel currently before the
Senate, the critics noted, and the overall bill faces a
presidential veto on unrelated matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has little practical effect, because the law hasn't
changed,'' said Rep. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who is
one of three Cuban-American members of Congress. ``What you've done
in this act is to create lawlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vote on travel to Cuba has particular resonance.
Until the 1959 triumph of the revolution, Cuba was the leading
American tourism destination in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the government of Fidel Castro has built up
tourism, adding European-financed hotels in Havana and at the
popular beach resort of Varadero.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American Republican from
Florida, charged that the measure would provide revenues to ``the
worst violator of human rights in all of the Western Hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration since last year has greatly broadened
the categories of Americans allowed to travel to the island,
allowing more than 200 universities to license student travelers.
Such people-to-people contacts, American officials say, will
enhance the prospects for a peaceful political transition to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   About 135,000 Americans visited Cuba last year on
government-approved trips. Another 22,000 traveled illegally
through third countries such as the Bahamas or Mexico, according to
Treasury Department estimates.

RIECH TRIES TO LIVE UP TO MANY STANDARDS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The men's javelin final at the U.S. Olympic Track
and Field Trials Thursday employed two decidedly different
yardsticks: the measuring tape used to determine how far each throw
traveled and Tom Petranoff.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Petranoff set a world record in the javelin and became
the brawn behind the racket that saw the javelin start stealing
pitchers from baseball. Among the early converts was Tom Pukstys,
the reigning American-record holder in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Pukstys is 32, but he remembers like yesterday the first time he
met Petranoff, now 42 and the second-oldest competitor (behind a
racewalker) at these Trials. ``It was in 1987 at a javelin camp and
I followed him around like a dog with a notebook,'' Pukstys said.
``Tom set the standard I've been trying to pass for the last 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the javelin throwers in the final share Puksty's
reverence for Petranoff, who represented the U.S. at the 1984 and
1988 Olympics before he was banned from international competition
in the late 1980s for competing in South Africa, an action seen as
tacit acceptance of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Riech is different. No disrespect to Petranoff, but Riech's
inspiration growing up was the 1964 Olympic 10,000-meters champion
Billy Mills. It makes perfect sense, once you know the Burbank
resident's background.
</P>
<P>
   The life as an outcast that Petranoff would come to know in his
30s, Mills and Riech both experienced from birth. Riech, 29, was
reared on an Indian reservation in Polson, Mont. He is a member of
the Flathead Kooteani tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, a Sioux Indian from South Dakota, is among the band of
rooters Riech has here. After Riech let loose the second-longest
throw during the qualifying rounds, Mills was among the first to
wish him well in his quest to make a second Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Riech was the Olympic Trials champion in 1996, but one year
after finishing 17th in Atlanta, he blew out the elbow in his
throwing arm and underwent extensive reconstructive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   While working his way back into shape, Riech helped others get
fit as a personal trainer at a health club in Valencia, Calif. It
was the only way he could train and keep his head above water.
Riech's javelin career costs him $40,000 a year. That's a lot of
personalized training sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The proud people Riech left behind on the reservation have at
various times held auctions, with the proceeds helping to defray
his expenses. Still, there have times he has felt like he's running
in circles just so he can keep his membership in javelin's elite
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Along with abdominal muscles, Riech can crunch numbers with the
best of them. When it comes to paying the household bills, he
doesn't need an accountant, he needs a guardian angel.
</P>
<P>
   Riech and his wife were getting around the San Fernando Valley
on a wing and a prayer _ both their cars had over 200,000 miles on
them _ until General Motors recently came through with a late-model
loaner. That's pretty much the sum total of the riches Riech has
enjoyed because of his javelin success.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us throwers are just trying to scrape by,'' Riech
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the European circuit _ where fortunes are made _ the money
thrown at track's marquee names doesn't trickle down much to the
field grunts. Pukstys posted the 10 best marks in the U.S. last
year. Yet because the Americans lag behind the world's best javelin
throwers _ who mostly hail from the Czech Republic, Germany and
Finland _ he feels pressure from promoters wanting to know what has
he done lately?
</P>
<P>
   After recording the fourth-best qualifying throw on Monday,
Pukstys was walking toward the exit when the promoter of an
upcoming meet in London got his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom,'' the man yelled good-naturedly, ``you better throw it
farther than that if you want to compete in my meet.''
</P>
<P>
   As the man disappeared into the crowd, Pukstys sighed. ``He was
joking, but he wasn't,'' he said glumly. ``You realize there's some
truth to what he said and it kind of hits you. It hurts a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   As Riech paced between his throws Thursday, he remembered how
much he hurt after his elbow surgery. He realized that under the
circumstances, it was no insignificant thing to be here, competing
for an Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
   Riech shook that thought off. ``I'm going to make the Olympic
team,'' he told himself. ``That's why I came here.''
</P>
<P>
   Riech came up short in the end but not really. He finished third
overall on Thursday night, but none of the throwers met the Olympic
``A'' qualifying standard. Hwanted to make another Olympic team, he
said, so he'd be a role model to ``a lot of good athletes on the
reservations who don't go anywhere. They don't further their
talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Riech can consider that mission accomplished. &QL;

WOMEN'S LONG JUMP REACHING NEW HEIGHTS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Trash talk? Oodles. Upsets, breakthroughs, clutch
performances? Plenty of each.
</P>
<P>
   What the 2000 U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials lacks as it
enters its final three days is a world record, and it doesn't
appear the sport's superstars are going to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the women's pole vaulters.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone is going to make this the 14th U.S. trials out of the
past 17 with at least one world record, the practitioners of the
newest Olympic track-and-field event are most likely to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 16 feet could happen,'' said Stacy Dragila, holder of
the two-month-old world women's vault record of 15 feet, 1 inches.
``I mean, on a good day I could pull it out. It wouldn't be that
big a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Female vaulters are making such dramatic strides, a Beamonesque
trashing of the record is not out of the realm of the possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've started out with this sport being nothing and we've had
to bring it to something,'' said Kellie Suttle, who has a best
vault of 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila is the Michael Johnson of the sport; even before the
women's vault is contested in the Sydney Games, she already has a
widely seen television commercial. Dragila, 29, vaults to the show
tune ``I Enjoy Being a Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   She is additionally famous for roping goats as a young rodeo
performer in her rural Northern California home, and a bit infamous
for posing nude in a for-charity calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Vaulting remains something of a novelty for women, and its top
performers are pioneers as well as sort of sorority sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Said Suttle: ``I remember in the '95 nationals, people were
going, `What the hell is going on here? Girls with sticks!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, now look at us. Our event's in the limelight and we have
to do everything we can to keep it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Women vaulters are known for showmanship, playing both to crowds
and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not just wave a hand at the crowd, or shake our legs
around and look all mean and stuff,'' Suttle said. ``Let's get the
crowd involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Olympics berths might begin to break up That Old
Gang of Theirs, but for now the vaulters remain close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost too close,'' Dragila conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Vaulters are known to help each other with information about
wind and the runway. Said Suttle: ``We've got this awesome thing in
common.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragila is the favorite to win gold at Sydney, but she is well
aware that American-record holder Jeff Hartwig didn't survive
qualifying here last weekend; he no-heighted and went home.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying in the women's vault is today; the finals are Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Final qualifying in the men's javelin and steeplechase was
contested late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In prelims on Thursday, Day 5 of the trials:
</P>
<P>
   -- Through four events, pre-meet favorite Chris Huffins led the
decathlon with 3,685 points, 100 more than rising star Tom Pappas.
Defending Olympic gold medalist Dan O'Brien withdrew from the event
with a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   -- Johnny Gray's attempt to make a fifth Olympic team ended in
the 800-meter prelims, where he faded to last in his heat. Gray,
40, holds the 15-year-old American record of 1:42.60. Bryan
Woodward of Long Beach had the No.3 time.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Clark Family put three runners into the final of the
women's 800. Hazel Clark and sister Joetta Clark-Diggs had the top
times, and sister-in-law Jearl Miles-Clark posted the No.6 time.
``I'm really glad our team advanced,'' Hazel Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Connie Price-Smith, winner of 21 national championships, led
the women's shot put with a mark of 57-4, nearly 7 feet short of
her lifetime best.
</P>
<P>
   -- Eric Thomas, who just missed the 1996 Olympic team, had the
best time in the men's 400-meter hurdles preliminaries, at 49.25
seconds. Atlanta Olympics gold medalist Derrick Adkins had the
ninth-best time at 49.84.
</P>
<P>
   -- Lance Deal, silver medalist in 1996, led hammer prelims with
a throw of 245 feet, 11 inches. ``My daughter said to me, `Just
pretend it's the Olympics,''' he said. &QL;

SECOND-HALF SURGE LIFTS SPARKS

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Sparks couldn't play any better than
they have against teams from the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Though trailing the New York Liberty at the half, the Sparks
came back for an 82-66 victory at the Forum, their eighth win in
eight games against a team from the East.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks shot 61 percent from the field and snapped New York's
six-game winning streak in front of 7,269.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks quickly got back on track after a losing an 11-point
lead and trailing at halftime 40-39. Los Angeles took a 61-47 lead,
outscoring New York 22-5 to start the second half.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which shot 47 percent in the first half, was held to
26 percent in the second half for 35 percent overall. They made
only two field goals during the Sparks early run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great defense,'' said Sparks coach Michael Cooper. ``I thought
we were able to sustain it longer than they had in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper had to remind the Sparks about how champions are
expected to play at the half, guard Tamecka Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked a little bit about that killer instinct that
champions have,'' Dixon said. ``We picked it up on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks outrebounded the Liberty 39-23, which accounted for
several of the fastbreak points (22) the Sparks accumulated. Center
Lisa Leslie had a game-high 21 points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks shot 68 percent in the second half, finishing the
game making 34 of 56 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie was 8 of 11 from the field, and forward DeLisha Milton
had 17 points on 7 of 12 shooting. Guards Ukari Figgs was 5 of 5
from the field, finishing with 10 points, and Dixon was 6 of 7 for
12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've been struggling as a team on the year shooting
and tonight we just came out and shot,'' Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks scored the first six points and stretched their lead
to 10 points when Milton scored to make it 25-15.
</P>
<P>
   Center Clarisse Machanguana gave the Sparks good production off
the bench, coming in to score five points to keep the home team
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But after that it was all Liberty, which quickly turned around
the game with a 16-5 run. Tamicka Whitmore and Teresa Weatherspoon
scored 11 of the points. After Whitmore's free throw, Weatherspoon
scored a 3-pointer and cut the lead to five with a pair of free
throws. &QL;

<P>
   ``This is really, really hard,'' groaned President Bill Clinton
in the early hours of July 20, as he left Camp David, a day late,
for the weekend G8 summit in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and Palestinians were to stay on and keep talking.
Nobody could fault the negotiators for failing to give peace their
best try. Neither side wanted to be the first to give up.
</P>
<P>
   For nine days they had been talking around the clock, without
reaching a conclusion. They had not yet found a way past the main
obstacles that have for so long barred Israelis and Palestinians
from equably sharing their tiny, deeply symbolic, bit of the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most enduring obstacles has been Jerusalem, the
beautiful stone-built city resting in the hills, central to
believers in the three monotheistic faiths, which is claimed by
both Israelis and Palestinians as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   For Jews, it is where the Temple was built to hold the Ark of
the Covenant. For Muslims, it is where the Prophet left his
footprint on earth when he ascended. For Christians, it is where
Jesus redeemed mankind on the cross.
</P>
<P>
   The religious monuments of all three faiths are mostly within
the walled Old City. But the future of the Old City is probably the
easiest part of the Jerusalem story to resolve. Control over the
Holy Places can be shared out; freedom to worship is an
uncontroversial doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Far trickier problems _ to do with sovereignty, demography and
politics _ haunt the city that spreads out beyond the ancient
walls.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 20 years, between 1948 and 1967, Jerusalem was
divided. A mantra, often repeated by Palestinians as well as
Israelis, is that it should never again have a formal, impassable
line running through it.
</P>
<P>
   The splitting, after Israel's war of independence, was ugly.
Palestinians, who may have owned the greater part of West
Jerusalem, were driven from their homes; Jews were unable to
worship at their holy sites in East Jerusalem, which came under
Jordanian control.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1967 war, Israel reunited the city, annexing its
eastern part. In 1980, it declared Jerusalem to be its eternal,
undivided capital.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel did not only annex East Jerusalem. It also extended
it to about three times its original size, designing careful new
boundaries that maximized the land area while minimizing the number
of Palestinians who lived within the city's extended borders.
</P>
<P>
   It then built residential colonies for Jews which, together with
their linking roads, became fortresses between the West Bank and
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The policy of successive Israeli governments was to increase the
population of Jews in East Jerusalem until they outnumbered the
Arabs. They nearly succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and Palestinians in East Jerusalem are now roughly
equal at about 200,000 each. This has been achieved partly by a
factory-line of Israeli houses, partly by making it intensely
difficult for Palestinians to accommodate their growing families by
enlarging their houses, let alone building new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Netanyahu, when he was prime minister, tried to hurry
the process along by banning ``absentee'' Jerusalemites, but this
backfired as Palestinians hurried home to preserve their
residential status.
</P>
<P>
   The current Israeli government hoped that the Palestinians might
be satisfied with control over their (Muslim and Christian) holy
places, plus a capital in Abu Dis, an Arab suburb just beyond the
municipal border, where Yasser Arafat is in fact building himself a
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians insist on East Jerusalem, not Abu Dis, being
their capital, drawing the scattered parts of their putative state
together, giving it a solidity and resonance that it otherwise
lacks.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, many outsiders think, is a second redrawing of the
city's boundaries, no less creative than the first.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem, capital to both peoples, would be open to both; a
joint council would take care of joint affairs. A Palestinian-run
East Jerusalem, including some of the excluded Arab villages, such
as Abu Dis, would be devised.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-run Jerusalem would be expanded to include the vast
settlements just outside municipal limits _ and the Israelis would,
at long last, obtain international recognition that their cherished
city was indeed their capital.
</P>
<P>
   These are not impossible thoughts. But they have not, as yet,
been accepted by the tired negotiators at Camp David. &QL;

<P>
   Even the judge could hardly believe his eyes. ``A lot of
zeros,'' he chuckled. True enough: this was the largest
civil-damages verdict in history.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-year trial, a Miami jury decided on July 14 that
America's largest tobacco companies should pay $145 billion _ yes,
that's billion, not million _ in punitive damages to thousands of
Florida smokers for damaging their health.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors chose this staggering amount to send a message that
could not be ignored. They certainly succeeded in doing that,
capturing headlines that broadcast far and wide their anger with
the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   But by choosing such an absurd figure, they also _ quite
inadvertently _ sent a more important message: that it is high time
Americans abandoned their misguided attempt to ``punish'' the
industry through lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they should be formulating a rational scheme for
regulating a product which, however bad for health or noxious to
some, is never going to disappear. And the right way to do that is
through legislation, not litigation.
</P>
<P>
   There is little chance that the tobacco firms will ever have to
pay a penny of this award, which is why tobacco shares barely
responded to the news. The eccentric way the trial was conducted,
as well as the colossal damages, means that the verdict will almost
certainly be overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this case is significant. It underlines what a
wrong turn the United States has taken on the question of tobacco
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   With their irresponsible verdict, the Miami jurors were doing no
worse than following a path pioneered by politicians since 1998,
when state governments forced a $246 billion settlement on the
industry by threatening endless litigation aimed at recovering
costs to state health schemes of smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has filed a giant, and similarly
misconceived, federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind these lawsuits is indefensible. Yes, tobacco
is addictive and damages your health. Yet every smoker for the past
34 years has known this, because each packet of cigarettes sold in
the United States has carried a warning to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Long before that, most people knew that smoking was not the
healthiest of pursuits. Neither is drinking lots of alcohol,
driving fast or eating junk food.
</P>
<P>
   Many of life's pleasures, unfortunately, are both unhealthy and
habit-forming, but people do have a choice about whether to take
them up in the first place. This obvious fact is why, until
politicians began using the courts to bully the industry, tobacco
firms won nearly all of the lawsuits filed against them by
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the states' settlement with the industry is also
perverse. Tobacco firms are paying for the settlement by raising
prices, and will do the same to pay damages in any other lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Most smokers, remember, are addicted. So most will feel
compelled to pay these government or court-imposed price hikes. In
effect, this is taxation without representation.
</P>
<P>
   If the Miami verdict were ever implemented, smokers in 49 states
would end up paying billions to current and past smokers in
Florida, an outcome impossible to justify.
</P>
<P>
   It may make sense to tax tobacco more heavily, or to restrict
its marketing and distribution more strictly. But voters in a
democracy _ who include millions of smokers _ are supposed to have
some say in these decisions through their legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Courts can punish and deter wrongdoing, but they are
ill-equipped to weigh the complex trade-offs involved in regulating
a widely used product such as tobacco. The resort to litigation
carries another cost that is rarely recognized.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States could succeed, through democratic debate
and legislative action, in agreeing a way to regulate tobacco, it
would also take a giant step towards finding a way to decriminalize
scores of other addictive and widely-used, though illegal, drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco regime most likely to emerge from such a debate _
``tax, control and discourage'' _ promises to be an effective
antidote to America's general drug problem, unlike its present
``war on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   That misguided policy has put millions of people behind bars,
cost billions, encouraged crime and spread corruption while failing
completely to reduce drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   As with tobacco, it is high time to take the courts out of the
equation, and for America to put aside its obsession with
punishment. &QL;

<P>
   Russia has long thought of itself as a singular power. At the G8
summit of rich, democratic nations, which opens in Okinawa on July
21, it will indeed be the odd one out.
</P>
<P>
   While the other seven leaders from North America, Europe and
Japan fret about the digital divide, and the poor health and bad
debts of the world's hard-up nations, Russian President Vladimir
Putin, by his own admission, knows he is struggling to avoid his
country's relegation from the big-power table to the ranks of the
Third World.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing this week, on his way to Japan, Putin made a lot of
Russia's much-vaunted strategic partnership with China, their
shared determination to build a multi-polar world (read, to limit
America's influence) and their opposition to America's plans for
limited national missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   In North Korea, he staked his claim to a part in the diplomacy
after last month's historic summit between North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian officials warn westerners, with varying
degrees of bad temper, that they have plenty of other friends _
China, India, Iran, Iraq, former Yugoslavia _ if NATO and the
European Union again overlook Russia's interests in places like
Kosovo and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   So far, not so different from the later Yeltsin years, when
Russia went into a deep sulk over its loss of empire and influence.
It saw the world as a 19th-century power game: a gain for the West
meant a loss for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, any spanner Russia could toss into western works _
protecting Iraq despite its flagrant disregard of U.N. disarmament
resolutions, selling weapons to China for use in regional rows or
for browbeating Taiwan, or helping Iran with its longer-range
missiles _ disguised Russia's great decline.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was that it did nothing to reverse it. Putin
recognizes that. Despite the week's rhetoric, there have been some
welcome hints of a new realism about where Russia's real interests
lie.
</P>
<P>
   It is reflected in Putin's travels in Europe, and Asia, in
speeches at home and in a new foreign-policy doctrine published
last month.
</P>
<P>
   It comes in three bluntly expressed parts. First, Putin has no
illusions about reversing Russia's imperial decline; the burdens of
empire helped drag it down.
</P>
<P>
   He looks forward to rebuilding Russia's influence, but with
qualms. Economic weakness, he points out, has been Russia's
undoing, not dastardly western plots.
</P>
<P>
   Russia needs to pull itself up by its own bootstraps, reforming
its tax system, defending property rights, if it is to break its
harmful dependence on either fortuitously high oil prices or
western handouts.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the qualms: without reform, Russia will fare just as badly
in the new information-based economy as it did in the old
industrial-based one.
</P>
<P>
   Second, says Putin, in these straitened times Russia needs to
rethink its foreign ambitions. He claims he will keep talking, even
at difficult moments, and tackle problems collectively, for example
at the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is encouraging; the test will be whether he still
uses Russia's influence there to coddle dictators such as Iraq's
Saddam Hussein and Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he could explain the new realities to his generals,
who are fighting over whether Russia needs more soldiers or more
nuclear missiles, when in truth it needs fewer of both.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Russia's annoyance at the West and its need for
cash from arms sales have driven the search for friends in
unhelpful places.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the third element in Putin's rethinking needs to
get most bluntly realistic: Russia's past tactics have often harmed
its long-term interests.
</P>
<P>
   Though it makes sense for a country with as many neighbors as
Russia has to be on good terms with as many as possible, China
included, Putin knows that, if Russia is to grow strong again, it
needs to link its future with the world's rich democracies _ the
folk around the G8 table _ not the world's few surviving dictators.
</P>
<P>
   His generals know that the fancy weapons Russia sells to China
may some day be turned against them.
</P>
<P>
   Obliquely, Putin acknowledges that Russia's past missile and
nuclear help to countries like Iran and Iraq has helped to spur
what could be a destabilizing search for new missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   And Russia is slowly recognizing that, if it is to be friends
with the EU, the price may be to get on better with Balts,
Ukrainians and others around its rim.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has so far put these new thoughts only on paper. They will
be hard to put into practice. If he managed it, Russia would indeed
deserve the respect it earned. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Republicans and Democrats are not the only people
who are feverishly preparing for next month's conventions in
Philadelphia and Los Angeles. For the first time in American
political history, the two main party conventions will each have
their shadows.
</P>
<P>
   These are parallel conventions designed to highlight issues that
the establishment would rather sweep under the carpet _ above all,
inequality, money politics and the ``war on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The shadow gatherings are the brainchildren of an unlikely
parent, a former Republican activist, Arianna Huffington, and have
attracted an equally unlikely collection of supporters, including
Peter Hirshberg, an Internet entrepreneur, and financier George
Soros.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will these shadow conventions be the end of it. The motley
crew of protesters who exploded onto the political scene in Seattle
last November will be out in force. They include members of the
Direct Action Network, United for a Fair Economy, the Ruckus
Society and a host of other obscure organizations.
</P>
<P>
   This second bunch have the same agenda as the first _ they want
to fix America's broken political system _ but they are prepared to
go to much more extreme lengths to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   The police expect about 10,000 people to turn up in Philadelphia
and perhaps three times as many two weeks later in Los Angeles,
where there are no fewer than seven alternative conventions on the
cards, including a homeless convention and an anarchist gathering.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to guess who will win the battle for the media
spotlight. This year's conventions are likely to be about as
interesting as a software manual.
</P>
<P>
   The ``themes'' for the Republican effort, for example, range
from ``Opportunity with a Purpose'' through ``Prosperity with a
Purpose'' to ``President with'' _ wait for it _ ``a Purpose.'' No
wonder the President with a Purpose is not bothering to show up
until the thing is almost over.
</P>
<P>
   Party conventions have been declining as a political art form
for 40 years. Until 1960 they actually decided things, complete
with platform fights, back-room deals and occasional fisticuffs.
Now all the key decisions are taken during the primaries and every
banal utterance is carefully scripted.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it looks as if America is even going to be denied the
one thing that lends a little excitement to these dismal events:
the candidates unveiling their choice for vice president. Which
leaves about 15,000 journalists looking for a story. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Arianna Huffington is a story in her own right. A few years ago
she was a hard-line Gingrichite who goaded her (now ex-) husband
into spending $30 million to run for the Senate from California.
(He has since come out as both homosexual and a Democrat.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, in her left-liberal salon in Brentwood, Calif., she
communes with Warren Beatty on the evils of inequality. But she has
also worked hard to provide the press corps with red meat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   John McCain will open the shadow conventions on July 30 with a
speech on campaign-finance reform. (``It's more than a slap in the
face,'' says one Republican senator about McCain's decision to
speak at the forum, ``it's a thumb in the eye.'')
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson, the Republican governor of New Mexico, will
discuss the drawbacks of drug prohibition. Celebrities will put in
appearances. The radicals on the fringe plan to make their own
news, with plenty of topless dykes and giant puppets.
</P>
<P>
   But what is really arousing interest is the threat of disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The big fear is a repeat of the Democratic Convention in 1968,
when the Yippies went to Chicago with the intention of producing,
in Abbie Hoffman's words, ``a huge orgasm of destruction atop a
giant media altar'' _ and Mayor Richard Daley's policemen made sure
they got what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The police forces in both Philadelphia and Los Angeles are
taking the threat of disorder seriously (as is Vice President Al
Gore, who has already decided not to stay in the downtown Biltmore
Hotel).
</P>
<P>
   They are tapping the FBI to provide details on radical
organizations. They hope to be able to confine the protesters to
``protest pits'' some distance from the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials in Philadelphia are even planning to reopen the
disused and ``dungeon-like'' Holmesburg Prison to deal with a surge
in arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Should the anti-conventioneers be left in their protest pits and
forgotten? Or do they have something to say?
</P>
<P>
   The core of their argument is that American politics is
fundamentally broken: corrupted by big money and managed to death
by professional political handlers. Money politics not only gives
inordinate power to vested interests, they argue, it also
discourages ordinary people from exercising their democratic
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, fewer than half of the eligible voters turned out _ and
only a third of those aged between 18 and 24.
</P>
<P>
   This is overstated, of course. Low turnout is not necessarily
proof of alienation: a survey for the League of Women Voters found
that non-voters are no more mistrustful of government than voters
are.
</P>
<P>
   A new report published by the Pew Research Center points to a
paradox. Voters are more disengaged from politics than they have
ever been in the recent past. But they are also more satisfied with
their choice for president than in either 1996 or 1992, and less
critical of the way the campaigns are being conducted.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is hard to look at the process that is symbolized by
the forthcoming conventions without a feeling of unease.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain insurgency showed that there are widespread
misgivings about the ``iron triangle'' of money, politics and
influence. And the influence of money has been more pervasive this
year than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Common Cause study suggests that politicians will raise
a record-breaking $500 million in soft money (unregulated
contributions) in the current election cycle _ 80 percent more than
in the scandal-ridden 1996 cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-conventions include more than their fair share of silly
people, from revolting students to overexposed celebrities. (``The
reaction we've had at cocktail parties is that people are really
excited,'' says Anne Biondi Simonds, one of the organizers of the
shadow conventions. ``It's like, `Hey, you're concerned, so am
I!''')
</P>
<P>
   But America should pay at least a little attention to what is
being said outside the convention halls in Philadelphia and Los
Angeles. The oddest messengers can bear important news. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Big Apple's media are easily bored, and the
Senate race between Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton was in
danger of being written off as the mother of all snores.
</P>
<P>
   Recent claims in a book about Rudolph Giuliani _ vexed love
life, father in the Mafia, etc. _ only reminded journalists what
fun they would have had if the mayor had not dropped out of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with relish that they seized on reports that Hillary
had called somebody a ``(expletive) Jew bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that she said it in 1974, if she said it at all? A
new book about the Clintons, ``State of a Union,'' describes Mrs.
Clinton hurling this abuse at Paul Fray, then manager of President
Bill Clinton's unsuccessful campaign for a seat in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Fray is a Baptist who claims only a Jewish great-grandmother,
and has often provided reporters with embarrassing details about
the Clintons. The First Lady denied this particular accusation
emphatically at a tearful press conference. (Needless to say, she
is scheduled to appear at a synagogue this weekend.)
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely helpfully, just as Mrs. Clinton was saying that she
did not even remember the argument with Fray, her husband took time
out from trying to negotiate a Middle East peace deal to say that
she ``never said it,'' though ``she might have called him a
bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to accuse the Republicans of character assassination.
This allowed his wife's Republican opponent, Lazio, to remind
voters of the Clintons' tendency to shift blame swiftly to others.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Mrs. Clinton have been wholly pleased by some other
attempts to defend her. A former
presidential-adviser-turned-troublemaker, Dick Morris, who is
Jewish, said that Mrs. Clinton is not anti-Semitic, though she
would keep serving him pork whenever he turned up for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times suggested that racist obscenities were
unlikely to have been uttered by ``one of the most politically
correct people on the planet,'' even if she has a foul temper.
</P>
<P>
   At least Giuliani was unequivocally nice, saying ``I'm willing
to accept her at her word.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Paul's Road-to-Damascus moment had nothing on Rudy's. Mrs.
Clinton's desire to disown this ancient profanity is
understandable. In New York's 1998 Senate race, Alfonse D'Amato's
chances of re-election were dealt a mortal blow when he called his
Jewish opponent, Chuck Schumer, a ``putz-head.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Yiddish scholars said this was a serious penis-based
obscenity, and not, as D'Amato claimed, the innocent twin of
schmuck.
</P>
<P>
   Before he used the word, polls showed D'Amato winning more than
a third of New York's 1.2 million Jewish votes; in the end, he took
only a fifth, which may have caused his narrow loss.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Jews have long tended to support Democrats. However,
even before the recent controversy, polls showed Hillary winning
only 54 percent of the Jewish votes to Lazio's 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jews have long regarded Mrs. Clinton as weak on Israel, and
thoroughly dislike her public embrace of Palestinians and her calls
for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has worked for compensation for victims of the Holocaust,
and several prominent and wealthy New York Jews, who supported
Schumer in 1998, have publicly backed him.
</P>
<P>
   The current controversy is also playing to the perception of
many voters (Jewish or not) that Mrs. Clinton says one thing in
public _ usually a platitude _ while holding very different, even
vitriolic, views in private.
</P>
<P>
   The real Mrs. Clinton has been so well hidden from the voters
that it is easy for them to speculate that she may do all manner of
nasty things.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everything is going against Mrs. Clinton in a race
that is still too close to call. She has been cleared, albeit
halfheartedly, of having played an inappropriate part in the
Travelgate affair.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's failure to march alongside Hillary and Rudy in the
gay-pride parade may have cost him some homosexual votes, despite
his claim that only previous engagements kept him away.
</P>
<P>
   And there remains the awkward possibility that he will be
prosecuted for insider dealing by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, over his purchase in 1997 of options on shares in Quick
&AMP; Reilly, a brokerage, shortly before it was acquired by Fleet
Financial at a big premium.
</P>
<P>
   The voters might be prepared to forgive him; but, if the SEC
were to charge him, could he stay in the race? &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The good life isn't what it used to be. Silicon
Valley headhunters report that executives from New York think twice
about multimillion-dollar offers when they compare the tiny place
they might afford in the Bay Area with the pile they live in in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Although America remains, on average, a cheap place to live by
European standards, it has pockets where the dynamism of the
economy has fuelled not only tremendous growth in wealth, but also
steep inflation in the cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest price rises have come in the heartland of the new
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Palo
Alto, in the heart of Silicon Valley, is $1,900, and prices in some
complexes have jumped from $1,550 at the beginning of the year to
$2,200 in June.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Sunnyvale, rents have climbed 25 percent since
the beginning of the year, and the vacancy rate has dropped to a
negligible 0.03 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Buying is just as daunting: the median house price in San
Francisco's Bay Area is $370,000, compared with $135,000 for the
country at large.
</P>
<P>
   For the well-off, this provides a chance either to moan or
gloat, depending on when they bought their house. They are unlikely
to be shut out altogether; they simply pay more or live in a
smaller space. The less well-off end up being displaced.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus of working-class residents is creating both
commercial problems and political strife. Nurses at Stanford's
hospital were followed by those at ten other Bay Area hospitals
when they went on strike last month to demand wages that would
allow them to live closer to where they worked, rather than
enduring a commute of several hours.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of the positions in the Los Altos police force are
empty because officers, unable to live near the town, have
resigned, and the force expects to be down to half-strength by the
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure extends to the vacation resorts where the new
wealth goes to play. Median house prices around Lake Tahoe, a ski
area on the eastern border of California, have risen 60 percent in
the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The chambermaids and ski-lift attendants are being priced out.
In Truckee, the small main town of the resort, the Safeway
supermarket has resorted to advertising on television to attract
staff.
</P>
<P>
   One river-raft tour organizer has prepared for the summer season
by importing 12 assistants from eastern Europe and housing them in
tents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pressure is cyclical; the Bay Area has seen housing
bubbles before, and this one too will eventually burst. But the new
economy has permanently changed some patterns of life.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Kotkin of Pepperdine University in Los Angeles, author of a
forthcoming book on the geography of the information age, sees the
favorite cities of the Internet economy, such as San Francisco and
Seattle, as boutiques for the young, single and rich.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, for example, has the lowest density of children of any
city in America. Just 10.8 percent of its residents are aged
between five and 17.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural and ethnic mix that used to characterize inner
cities is increasingly found in suburbs. Yet even boutiques _ or
the mountain resorts that Kotkin calls ``Valhallas'' _ need a
mixture of people in order to function, including manual laborers,
police, nurses and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the cry in America's rental hot-zones for more
``affordable housing'': subsidized accommodation reserved for those
who work nearby and cannot afford the market rates.
</P>
<P>
   In California's budget, passed this month, $570 million has been
allocated just for this. In Aspen, a particularly chic resort town
in Colorado where the median price of a house is now over $2
million, ``affordable housing'' is needed even for people who
would, in most places, be the prosperous upper-middle class.
</P>
<P>
   To live in America's most sought-after enclaves, you need not
only to find your own house; you also need to help provide one for
your poor local lawyer. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A ghost at Camp David has been America's Congress.
This week, as musing turned to the monetary rewards for peace, the
speaker of the House of Representatives, Dennis Hastert, wrote to
President Bill Clinton, tartly reminding him that Congress is the
sole authority for spending money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to be kept fully apprised of all aspects of the
negotiations prior to entering into any commitments,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch McConnell, the head of the Senate subcommittee that would
have to propose any aid package that formed part of a peace deal,
says, ``The chances of the Congress approving (the money) this year
are pretty slim, probably even nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   His opposite number in the House, Sonny Callahan, worries that
``a lame-duck president looking for a legacy might be willing to
write a blank check to get an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   America bankrolled the first Camp David agreement, between
Israel and Egypt in 1978. If there should be a second deal, might
Congress scupper it? The possibility seems real.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has come under unprecedented attack in Congress lately,
meaning that bipartisan backing for a deal signed by the Israeli
government can no longer be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, congressmen of both parties have
criticized Israel for its proposed sale of an airborne radar system
to China, and have been only partly mollified by the deal's
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when the Israelis suggested that a peace deal
with Syria might cost America around $17 billion, largely for
splendid new military equipment to offset the loss of security once
Israel had withdrawn from the Golan Heights, congressmen were
openly unsympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   But that sum pales into insignificance compared with the alleged
costs of any likely Palestinian deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are said to have claimed that it will take
something like $40 billion to resettle or compensate the refugees
who were evicted in 1948 from what is now Israel, plus other forms
of compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is also claiming vast amounts of money, partly to rehouse
those of its settlers who will have to leave the West Bank, partly
to buy yet more splendid military equipment to offset the loss of
security from handing over control of the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The grand total may be $70 billion or even more, of which
America's share could be in the order of $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers at this stage are plucked from the sky. But given
that this is an election year in America, the potential for
grandstanding is endless. Campaigning politicians are bound to say
that this is money for a Clinton legacy, and that it would be far
better spent on health care.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, the chances are that if the negotiators were to
reach a deal that was accepted in Israel and Palestine, Congress
would approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen are being disingenuous in claiming to be out of the
loop. Although the negotiations are secret, both the National
Security Council and Israel's ambassador have been busy briefing
congressmen, to prepare the ground should there be a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton will be out of office by the time any bill is
presented to Congress _ which should mean a Congress less strongly
influenced by anti-Clintonian sentiments. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This year's summit of the rich world's leaders
suffers no shortage of symbolism. It marks the 25th anniversary of
the first such summit; the first of the new millennium; and
President Bill Clinton's eighth and last.
</P>
<P>
   It is taking place between July 21 and 23 on the Japanese island
of Okinawa, home to 26,000 American troops and site of a vicious
battle in the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Keen as it is to flex its muscles on the international economic
stage, Japan is determined to make the summit a big deal. The goal,
say the Japanese hosts modestly, is to set the stage for ``greater
prosperity,'' ``peace of mind'' and ``world stability'' in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is less imposing. Since all the world's big
economies, except Japan's, are in relatively good shape, there is
no impetus for the economic navel-gazing and criticism that has
long characterized these get-togethers _ especially since, as
hosts, the Japanese will be determined to deflect talk away from
their own, still shaky, economic performance.
</P>
<P>
   So there is little chance of big breakthroughs on big
international controversies. The chance of an announcement of a big
new trade round, for instance, is close to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the summiteers will try to divert attention away from
their differences by talking grandly about development. The hot new
topic will be the ``global digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be much speculation about the potential for
information technology to accelerate development, and much
hand-wringing that so many poor countries are not wired.
</P>
<P>
   Of an estimated 332 million Internet users, fewer than 1 percent
live in Africa. Only about 2.7 million of Africa's more than 600
million people use the Internet, and most of those are in South
Africa. That compares with an average in North America and Europe
of one user for every four people.
</P>
<P>
   Less obvious is how to bridge this divide. Mimicking its efforts
to increase computer- and Internet-access among poor Americans, the
Clinton administration is keen on partnerships with the private
sector. So several business stars, including John Chambers of Cisco
Systems and Nobuyuki Idei of Sony, were invited to the pre-summit
discussion in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, much of the burden of implementing fine-sounding
ideas will fall on multilateral institutions, so the heads of the
United Nations Development Program and the World Bank were also
invited.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's approach to the divide, as so often in development, is
to throw money at it. It has announced a $15 billion aid package
over five years, although it is unclear whether this is new money,
or what exactly it will be spent on.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless, the gathering will yield more headline-grabbing
initiatives. There is, for instance, to be an ``Okinawa Charter''
on information technology. But there are few signs that anybody
knows how best to address the divide, or even whether information
technology is the right place to concentrate development efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Those uncertainties do not plague the summiteers' two other
development priorities: education and health.
</P>
<P>
   The heads of government will reaffirm their determination to
reach the international goal of universal primary education by
2015. They will stress the importance of educating girls. Some
60-70 percent of the more than 100 million children who are not in
school are girls.
</P>
<P>
   On health, there will be more talk about tackling the spread of
infectious diseases, especially AIDS. Specific targets for reducing
the number of young AIDS victims over the next decade by, say, 25
percent, are likely.
</P>
<P>
   Here again, Japan has already pledged $3 billion to fight
infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   These deadlines and promises should all be taken with a pinch of
salt. After all, it was only a year ago that the summit in Cologne
announced, with great fanfare, a package of enhanced debt relief
for the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   So far only nine countries have received relief, worth about $15
billion in total.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC)
program argue that the process is too slow, and that conditions
attached to debt relief are still too burdensome. Neither argument
is entirely convincing. Many of the countries potentially eligible
for debt relief are deeply corrupt or at war.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing is the fact that some rich countries, notably
the United States, have not yet made good on their commitments to
finance debt relief. Assistance for Honduras and Bolivia has
already been held up for lack of American contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the exaggerated expectations, the summit's focus on debt
relief has expanded and accelerated the process. The same could be
true of this year's areas of concern.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is still a nagging suspicion that the global
digital divide is the wrong priority for the world's richest
countries.
</P>
<P>
   If they really wanted to help the poorest, the summiteers would
do far better to focus on opening up their markets. But sadly,
trade liberalization costs political capital. Grand words come
cheap. &QL;

<P>
   LA PORTE, TEXAS _ The Texas Independence Trail, a dreary stretch
of road on the outskirts of Houston, is inspiring in name only.
</P>
<P>
   Lined with some of the state's largest oil refineries and
petrochemical plants, the trail ends in the murky town of La Porte
at the monument to the Battle of San Jacinto, an obelisk which,
from afar, is virtually indistinguishable from the dozens of
smokestacks that dot the skyline.
</P>
<P>
   In the smog that often hangs over this hallowed ground, it is
hard to conjure up images of 1836, when Texan soldiers crying
``Remember the Alamo!'' defeated the advancing Mexican army.
</P>
<P>
   If Al Gore has his way, this place will generate a new rallying
cry in the closing months of the 2000 presidential campaign:
``Remember La Porte!''
</P>
<P>
   In its bid to undermine George W. Bush's record as governor of
Texas, the Gore campaign is painting a grim picture of the state's
environmental woes on Bush's watch.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the criticisms from several environmental groups,
you might think that Texas's rivers are awash in industrial waste
and its cities choked with pollution as bad as that of the old
Soviet block.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent letter printed in several national newspapers, a
Sierra Club official thundered: ``Voting for Bush is the kiss of
ecological and planetary death! To do so is to risk the lives of
our children and our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Bush become president, he is unlikely to be the earth's
destroyer. Still, he hardly bills himself as its savior, either. On
the campaign trail, offering himself as a ``Reformer with
Results,'' he perks up when he discusses education reform and tax
cuts in Texas, yet rarely mentions the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Even his aides admit it has never been exactly at the top of his
agenda. The Gore camp sees this as a chink in his armor, and will
no doubt run ominous advertisements _ or give a wink and nod to ads
run by others _ about billowing smokestacks and miles-long traffic
jams in the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   Are things in Texas really that bad? And is Governor Bush to
blame? To the first question, the answer is undoubtedly yes.
</P>
<P>
   As the heart of America's petrochemical and oil-refining
industries, Texas puts more chemicals into the air than any other
state, and by most rankings is the state with the worst toxin level
in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Were Texas a country in its own right, it would be the world's
seventh-biggest national emitter of carbon dioxide _ even though
the latest data from the NAFTA Environmental Commission show that
Texas's toxic release levels actually declined by 15 percent from
1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The largest problem is the dangerous amount of nitrogen oxide
(which mixes with vehicle-exhaust gas to create ozone, and then
smog) coughed out by the state's industrial plants.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Houston surpassed Los Angeles as the country's
smoggiest city, Texas had the nation's 25 highest ozone
measurements and 90 percent of the nationwide readings deemed
``very unhealthy'' by the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush took office, the number of days when Texan cities
have exceeded federal ozone standards has doubled, and Houston and
Dallas currently face federal deadlines to make sharp cuts in air
pollution or risk losing federal money for their roads.
</P>
<P>
   As pollution gets worse, environmentalists are constantly
knocking heads with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission (TNRCC), the state's environment-regulating agency. They
accuse the agency's officials of deliberately delaying plans to
clean up the air, in part because of heavy lobbying by oil-industry
executives.
</P>
<P>
   The officials reply that Rome was not built in a day, and they
cannot be expected to clean up Houston overnight: after all, it
took 30 years to get that way. The dramatic growth of Texas's
cities over the past decade, they add, has not exactly helped.
</P>
<P>
   This does not persuade the environmentalists. They point to
cities such as Charlotte, N.C. and Salt Lake City, Utah: places
that have grown as fast as Houston and Dallas and yet have managed
to improve their air.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Marston of the Texas chapter of the Environmental Defense
Fund is scathing: the agency people ``pretended like (air
pollution) wasn't happening, then shrugged their shoulders and said
it wasn't their fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas's woes are not Bush's creation. It needed a lot of years
(and several governors) to create an air pollution crisis, and Bush
inherited most of the trouble when he took office in 1995
</P>
<P>
   Given most Texans' dislike of regulations, there has never been
a strong grass-roots environmental movement in the state, so the
issue has never been high on the agenda of any governor. Yet, even
if he is not responsible for the problem, he has not been notably
energetic in looking for solutions to it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is fond of saying that you cannot regulate or sue your way
to clean air and water. It is a nonchalant way to approach the
issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Consider the centerpiece of his present environmental policy,
the plan to clean up the state's so-called ``grandfathered''
industrial plants.
</P>
<P>
   Grandfathered plants, built before the state's Clean Air Act in
1971, are bigger polluters than newer ones, accounting for 36
percent of the chemicals Texas releases into the atmosphere each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, rather than order the older plants to comply with new
environmental standards, Bush instead worked with industrial
leaders to arrange a system by which the plants' owners are
supposed to take part in the plan voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Texas's industrialists are not bursting with the spirit of
volunteerism. As of last month, two-and-a-half years after the
scheme was introduced, only 30 out of 461 plants not already facing
federal restrictions had volunteered to comply with environmental
guidelines; they will reduce grandfathered emissions by only 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This does not surprise environmentalists, who have long argued
that any policy of pollution-reduction that does not include a
threat of punishment for non-compliance is useless.
</P>
<P>
   However, according to Ralph Marquez of the TNRCC, it is too
early to pass judgment on the success of the policy, since the
deadline for plants to take part voluntarily does not fall until
September next year.
</P>
<P>
   He praises Bush for his ``new approach'' to environmental
regulation, and for endorsing during the 1999 legislative session a
bill that ordered emission cutbacks in Texas's electric power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in the view of Marquez, has consistently avoided adopting
the ``anti-industry philosophy'' of his Democratic predecessor, Ann
Richards.
</P>
<P>
   For many environmentalists, this is exactly the problem. They
argue that Bush has in effect let the oil industry dictate the
state's environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
   All of the TNRCC's three present commissioners have backgrounds
in industry; Marquez, for instance, formerly worked for the
Monsanto chemical company. And some of the industrialists who
helped to create the voluntary pollution-reduction plan are among
the most generous contributors to Bush's presidential campaign. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,300) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A cozy relationship between government and big business is
nothing new in Texas. Yet it does not go down well in
pro-environment states like Washington and Colorado, which Bush
hopes to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   And he faces, in Gore, an opponent who has every intention of
making the most of Texas's environmental troubles.
</P>
<P>
   If the Gore dagger strikes home, Bush may feel like the
disobedient son haunted by his father's words.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, George Bush senior went to Boston Harbor and attacked
the environmental record of his opponent in that year's
presidential race, Michael Dukakis: ``My opponent has said that he
will do for America what he has done for Massachusetts. That's what
I fear for my country.'' &QL;

PARK, GREEN LOOKING BETTER IN DODGERS' WIN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This was better for the Dodgers than Kevin Brown
allowing one hit in eight innings, more promising than another Gary
Sheffield homer in his run for the major-league home run crown.
</P>
<P>
   This was Chan Ho Park winning for the first time in a month,
Shawn Green making a team pay for not wanting to pitch to Sheffield
and the late-game matchups working right into the Dodgers' hands.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the things that are needed if the Dodgers are to make a
playoff run came in their 6-3 beating of the Colorado Rockies on
Thursday night at Dodger Stadium. And it made for a happy return
for Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, who returned from a four-game
absence after being hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels a lot better than being in the hospital, I'll tell
you that,'' Johnson said. ``(Bench coach Jim) Tracy put the
pressure on me winning three out of four.''
</P>
<P>
   Park (10-7) again battled control problems, but through the five
walks in six innings he gave the Dodgers a chance to win by
allowing three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Park left trailing 3-1, but Green quickly gave the Dodgers the
lead in the bottom of the sixth to make a winner out of Park. Mark
Grudzielanek led off with a single to center and Sheffield, who hit
his major league-leading 33rd homer in the first, walked in a
10-pitch at-bat. Green then hit Masato Yoshii's 2-0 pitch 439 feet
over the center-field wall to put the Dodgers ahead 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stuff Green's been going through the last month, it's just
awesome,'' Grudzielanek said. ``Even if it's just a solo shot and
we're losing 10-1, to see him do that for himself and get
untracked, like he has the last few days, is a great thing for us.
He's starting to get it back and look like the old Green, and that
spells trouble for opposing pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Green's first homer since July 6, and just his second
since June 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see some results,'' said Green, who added a
double in the Dodgers' two-run eighth inning. ``You feel good in
the cage, but until it starts translating onto the field you don't
get that extra lift. I just got in some bad habits at the plate and
I was trying too hard to get out of it and it just gets worse and
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson then won the matchup battle in the eighth inning. The
Dodgers loaded the bases with one out. Adrian Beltre popped out,
but Johnson sent lefty Dave Hansen in to pinch-hit against
right-hander Mike DeJean. Colorado manager Buddy Bell countered
with lefty Gabe White, so Johnson went with right-handed hitting
Jim Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
   And Leyritz, for the fourth time in six pinch-hitting chances
with the Dodgers, came through, hitting a groundball, two-run
single just out of the reach of shortstop Neifi Perez to push the
Dodgers' lead to 6-3. Mike Fetters pitched the ninth for his fourth
save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good luck, especially (Thursday),'' Leyritz said.
``That ball wasn't hit too well. It's a nice present for Davey.''
</P>
<P>
   So as cheesy as it seems, the Dodgers also swept a series for
the first time in two months. Of course, this was a two-game series
with the Rockies, who've lost 13 of 15, and the Dodgers still
haven't swept a three-game series since May 19-21 at Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers jumped ahead of Colorado in the NL West and into
third place. They trail Arizona by five games and second-place San
Francisco, which opens a three-game series at Dodger Stadium
tonight, by 3 games. &QL;

ETHERTON GROWS UP IN ANGELS' WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Keep the ball down, change speeds and throw
strikes, and it doesn't matter if you're pitching in Little League
or the major leagues, you'll get hitters out.
</P>
<P>
   It's a formula that Seth Etherton is using well in his brief
big-league career.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie right-hander from USC isn't blessed with an
overpowering fastball or a knee-buckling curve, but he displayed
once again the qualities of a polished pitcher Thursday night in a
6-1 win over Texas before 23,150 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Spiezio, filling in at the designated hitter spot for late
scratch Garret Anderson, hit a home run and Darin Erstad had two
hits _ padding his major league-leading total to 157, scored a run
and drove in another as the Angels won for the ninth time in 12
games.
</P>
<P>
   But the star of the night was Etherton (5-1), who won his fifth
consecutive start and lowered his ERA to 3.97 with the best and
longest performance of his nearly two-month long major-league
career.
</P>
<P>
   He scattered six hits (all but one were singles), struck out two
and his only two walks came in the eighth inning when he was
clearly tiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ready for the challenge of the big leagues,'' said
manager Mike Scioscia, who briefly sent Etherton back to Triple-A
Edmonton last month when the Angels had a glut of starting
pitchers. ``He makes a bigger footprint each time out there. I
don't think he's going anywhere. ... This guy's for real.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was equally appreciative, rewarding Etherton with a
standing ovation when he was lifted with one out in the eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who just over two years ago was pitching USC
to the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton, who has walked only 17 in his eight starts, made
pitching look simple. He threw strikes (72 of his 109 pitches were
strikes), kept the Rangers off balance with his change of speeds
and relied on his defense, which turned two double plays behind him
and three for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a power pitcher,'' said Etherton, who attended
Dana Hills High in Dana Point and was the Angels' first-round draft
pick in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at USC, I struck out a lot of guys but it was with
off-speed pitches and locating my fastball. Nothing changes here.
Moving the ball around is the key to the game. I know I'm not going
to blow people away. I understand my limits.''
</P>
<P>
   A sign of how well Etherton pitched was when he twice had Rafael
Palmeiro, one of the game's premier hitters, well out in front of
pitches that he hit for fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   The key, said catcher Bengie Molina, was Etherton's ability to
locate his 88 mph fastball early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was his day,'' Molina said. ``By the start of the second
inning I could tell he was on. He needed to throw his fastball
early in the count and work ahead and that's what he did.'' &QL;

<P>
   Some surprising words from my wedding day that I'll never forget
</P>
<P>
   By Phil Latham
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ It has been 20 years ago now, but I remember
it with the clarity that you remember important moments in your
life: Your wedding, the birth of your children, the death of a
loved one.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was almost my wedding moment, just about an hour
before the service, in fact. I was well past nervous and into numb
when my father walked into the small room where the groomsmen were
properly making every joke they could about me.
</P>
<P>
   When he asked them to leave, nervous came back. Quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Because I knew that my father had not come into the room for
some teary-eyed, mushy moment. My father couldn't conjure up much
emotion for the movie ``Ol' Yeller'', which can make most
red-blooded American males bawl in their boots. No, this was not
going to be that kind of special moment.
</P>
<P>
   The horrible thought crossed my mind that maybe he was going to
try to give me some advice, the possible range and breadth of which
gave me the shivers.
</P>
<P>
   But I was wrong about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Though we were alone in the room _ the other guys fled like rats
when he told them to leave _ he came up close to me. His eyes got
narrow and his voice got low and gruff. The last time I had seen
him act like this was the last time I got a whipping _ at 12 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you something, boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever he used the word ``boy'' it generally meant he was
angry at me. What could have made him so upset on my wedding day?
After all, he was in a position to never have to support me in any
way again.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few minutes you're going to be married. I'm warning you
about something.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused for effect, though he really didn't have to do so. We
could have been standing in the middle ring of a three-ring circus
and my attention would have been focused on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever, ever hit your wife, if you ever lay the first
hand on her, get ready. You don't have to worry about her family
coming after you. No. Because I'll be here first. I'm going to whip
you like a man, whip you so that you'll beg me to stop, but I'm not
going to stop. Do you understand?''
</P>
<P>
   I understood.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know that some of you will think that threats of violence
aren't proper. I agree with you But, since my father had never
committed violence on me before, it was clear to me even then that
this was no threat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, my father was telling me, in his own gruff way, that
violence against women was completely unacceptable and that it was
one thing that could make him turn against me.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, my father being the wild man that he was, I could
never be completely sure, could I? And I never was, either.
</P>
<P>
   I can't help but wonder what a different kind of world we might
live in if all fathers pulled their sons aside on their wedding day
and told them a similar straight-forward message.
</P>
<P>
   I have never once contemplated violence of any sort against my
wife, but had that ever happened in my marriage, I know that my
father's words would be ringing in my ears before I could have
landed the blow.
</P>
<P>
   Words alone aren't enough to stop family violence, no matter who
they come from. But don't think that the right words from the right
people don't have an impact.
</P>
<P>
   It was 20 years ago that I heard those words and I won't ever
forget them. In fact, it is quite likely that someday, I'll be
repeating them myself.

 &HT;    Another swing at ba$eball
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. _ We took our granddaughter and her friend
Caroline to the ballpark the night before the All-Star game. More
accurately, they took us. It was our first trip to Turner Field.
Naturally, they had been before.
</P>
<P>
   I spent the evening thinking about my first boss in The Atlanta
Journal sports department, the redoubtable Col. Ed Danforth. Col.
Danforth leaned heavily to horse racing and football. Although his
readers would never have suspected, he didn't much care for
baseball. But there wasn't much else going on in an Atlanta summer
at mid-century, and being the newspaper's sports editor, he had to
put in regular appearences at the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1954 he was recovering from a heart attack. As
the junior member of the firm, my job was to accompany him to Ponce
de Leon Park when the Atlanta Crackers (if you don't know, don't
ask) were in town. There were no elevators. I carried his heavy
Royal typewriter to the press box and made the trip down on the
field to solicit starting lineups from the managers.
</P>
<P>
   One hot July evening, with the score tied in the bottom of the
ninth and every prospect of extra innings, the colonel turned to me
and confided in a gravelly whisper. ``Young man,'' he said, ``you
won't have to do this when you are my age. Professional baseball is
a game for seventh-graders played by grown men. It'll be gone
before the century is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Sammy Sosa slam batting practice lobs into the outer
reaches of a cheering mob, I wondered what Mr. Danforth would
think. Was he right or wrong in 1954? Baseball surely survives, but
it isn't a game he would recognize.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, there's the price of a ticket. On Monday night it
cost $75 to sit in deep left field and watch what amounted to
batting practice. Fortunately, the company my working wife is
associated with sponsored the Home Run Derby and gave away tickets.
Otherwise, the tab for the four of us would have been $300.
</P>
<P>
   We also were invited to the company picnic in one of the
pavilions. Based on figures posted at concession stands, I'd
estimate the fried chicken, pasta, salad, hot dogs, hamburgers,
cookies, cake and refreshments we consumed at the picnic would have
totaled around $1,000 if we had been paying. Parking was only $10.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball survives in 2000, but a night at the park is for Bill
Gates. My guess is several million dollars changed hands on enough
beer to float the Queen Mary and tacos sufficient to fill a freight
train stretching from here to Birmingham, not to mention peanuts
and Cracker Jacks at $3.75 a pop. Despite a blessed pregame
downpour, I personally required three bottles of water at $3 each
to survive the heat.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I had attended a baseball game I was one of a
throng of 6,000 in the late Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. Baseball
was looking very much like the moribund sport it was accused of
being before it went head over heels into show business.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the entrance to Turner Field, I decided to impress
the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you realize?'' I asked, ``that I stood on this very spot
watching Mayor Ivan Allen drive a bulldozer to break ground for
Atlanta Stadium?''
</P>
<P>
   They must have been impressed, so much so that they were at loss
for words. They didn't answer. They just rolled their eyes. For
them Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium is as deep in the past as Ponce
de Leon Park. Or Spiller. (If you don't know, don't ask.)
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't expect was all the stuff outside the stadium, and
in the concourses. The only way I can describe Turner Field and
environs is to suggest a cross between the midway of the old
Southeastern Fair in Atlanta, Disney World, and vendors' row at the
Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima.
</P>
<P>
   Since we were only going to see batting practice, I assumed the
stands would be half-empty. They were full. That was a surprise,
although it should not have been. If no All-Stars had showed up,
fans would come just for the hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   Well aware of the game's commercialization, I was still shocked
to see the extent. Turner Field has more advertisements than the
Sunday paper. A billboard the size of a boxcar exhorted fans to
play the Big Game for $34 million. When the Crackers played in
Ponce de Leon, gambling, now encouraged by lawmakers, was against
the law. Cops made periodic sweeps through the left-field bleachers
to nab two-bit hustlers enticing fans to wager 25 and 50 cents on
fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what I'd tell Mr. Danforth if I could get a message
through. So much has changed. I kept asking myself how Country
Brown (if you don't know, don't ask) would look laying down a drag
bunt in a ballet suit. I'm not a pervert, but I wish I could have
visited the All-Star locker rooms, just to see how they squeeze
into those tight pants.

 &HT;    Shrinking interest in national election reflects rise in apathy
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Politics is important because it determines who gets what.
</P>
<P>
   Dwindling voter interest in the upcoming presidential election
indicates that a lot of people are not going to get what they want.
</P>
<P>
   Americans who drop out of the political process can't complain
when they see politicians doling out their tax dollars to the
people who took an active part in politics.
</P>
<P>
   At this point back in the 1992 presidential campaign, 63 percent
of American voters said they had thought about the upcoming
election. Four years later, only 55 percent of voters said they had
thought about the 1996 presidential election. This year, only 46
percent of voters have thought about the coming presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   This drop-off in interest about the presidential election
corresponds to a similar nosedive in interest in politics.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press, voter interest in politics dropped from 55 percent in 1992
to 42 percent in 1996 and to a low of 38 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   These dismal figures indicate that voter turnout for the
November election will hit a new low. This means those Americans
who remain active in politics will have proportionally more clout
when it comes time to decide who gets what.
</P>
<P>
   There are no guarantees, of course, that Americans who follow
campaign issues, remain active in politics and vote in every
election will get what they want.
</P>
<P>
   It comes close to a guarantee, however, that Americans who do
not participate in the political process, which is called
representative democracy, are more unlikely to get what they want
out of government.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that younger Americans, according to the Pew
report, are more cynical and disconnected from politics than even
in the recent past. This means young people are disenfranchising
themselves from decisions that will determine their future.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that loss of interest in politics is most
pronounced among well-educated young Americans. The Pew study found
that in June 1992, 68 percent of 18-34 year-old college graduates
said they had given a lot of thought to that year's election. That
number dropped to 39 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   Older Americans have a higher interest in politics. They also
vote in greater numbers. Life has taught them that politics is
important. As a result, they are more likely to get what they want.
</P>
<P>
   This year's presidential campaign has both major parties falling
all over themselves boosting Social Security and Medicare. They
also are squabbling over which party has the better prescription
drug plan. This phenomenon will really hit home when the Baby
Boomers retire.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew study found that one reason so many more Americans have
lost interest in this year's campaign is because they believe that
who is elected president is not as important as it once was.
</P>
<P>
   They also are more satisfied with this year's candidates than
the candidates in the previous two presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Why Americans think the presidency doesn't matter as much as it
used to is beyond me.
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't make any sense that satisfaction with this
year's presidential candidates is up when the Pew study found that
the public has little know- ledge about where the candidates stand
on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   When asked which candidate has proposed building a missile
defense system and reducing the number of U.S. nuclear weapons,
even if Russia refuses to do the same, only 18 percent correctly
identified Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Rolling Stones recognized that you can't always get
what you want. But if you try sometime, you just might find that
you get what you need.

 &HT;    Wheaton grateful for peace
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, OHIO _ One of Dr. Sherry Wheaton's favorite quotes comes
from Morris West's The Shoes of the Fisherman. ``Reach out for the
risk of living with both arms. One has to embrace the world like a
lover. One has to accept pain as a condition of existence.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing to quote those words in speeches, or to share
them with the families of the Alzheimer's patients she works with
as medical director of SeniorCare at Miami Valley Hospital. After
suffering serious injuries from an attack by a German shepherd,
Wheaton is learning more about what it means to live them.
</P>
<P>
   Best known locally as a medical reporter for Channel 7, Wheaton
isn't sure when she will return to her work at the station. Because
of nerve damage, her face is partially paralyzed. She can't smile.
``This is not a face that can go on television,'' Wheaton says,
recovering at her home following the July 8 attack.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton and her husband, Terry, had arrived only the night
before for a weekend visit with Terry's daughter, Becky, and her
husband in Tucson, Ariz. Saturday morning, Wheaton and Becky were
the early risers.
</P>
<P>
   For most of her life, Wheaton had been afraid of dogs. But a
woebegone stray she picked up at Fifth and Main _ ``just a
skeleton, really'' _ changed all that. Zoe is now a member of the
family, with a beautiful golden coat and incorrigibly wagging tail.
</P>
<P>
   So Wheaton didn't think twice about getting on the floor, nose
to muzzle, with the feistier of the couple's two German shepherds,
Ulk. The dog had greeted the couple the night before by growling
and baring his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better be on your good behavior,'' Wheaton cooed,
``because Terry's afraid of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton never saw the dog lunge. ``I was looking at Becky, and I
saw it happen through her eyes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the nerve damage, she didn't feel any pain. She
immediately went into cool, collected doctor mode, telling everyone
else what to do. ``It's ironic that, after spending my career
trying to undo all that, and open up, I was the one in control,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her face was black and blue, her eyes swollen shut. She
underwent emergency plastic surgery the same day, and, less than
two weeks later, the angry scar on her right cheek has healed
considerably. The nerve damage also is expected to heal eventually.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the woman who dispenses lessons about health
and lifestyle has absorbed some lessons of her own. Sad as she is
that Ulk must be put to sleep, Wheaton said ``the biggest message
from this is that everything can be a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   A gift?
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton explained that she can't remember the last time she had
two uninterrupted weeks to read, to meditate, to bask in the
comfort of friends. ``How most of us live our lives, we're always
racing, racing, racing. I do it, too. This is giving me time to do
my own inner journey.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part has been all the people who are calling, asking
what they can do. ``It's easy to be a giver; it's hard to be a
receiver,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton will return to work at SeniorCare as soon as she can.
Although she has received nothing but support from Channel 7, she
has put her career there temporarily on hold.
</P>
<P>
   She said it's part of the journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all searching for the meaning of life _ and the meaning
of life is in living it. That means the painful times must be
embraced and nurtured and loved, just like the good times.''

 &HT;    Spalting maple considered beautiful by many
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some interesting questions about wood and wood finishes today.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, a gentleman reports that he ``recently came
across some spalted maple boards about 10 inches wide. Finishing?
Anything I should be aware of? Any thoughts on staining? Lacquer?
Polyurethane? Gluing up? Joints?''
</P>
<P>
   Spalting, for those unfamiliar with the term, refers to the fine
dark lines, like ink drawings, that appear on wood as insect
activity and decay begins. It can happen on any wood, but obviously
is more pronounced on light woods such as maple, beech and birch.
</P>
<P>
   Many woodworkers, and I am among them, consider it the most
beautiful wood in the world. However, the boards must be moved into
a dry place and the decay arrested before it has gone far enough to
weaken the wood. If there are places on it mushy to the touch, they
will have to be cut away or the board discarded.
</P>
<P>
   The very idea of staining such wood is outrageous. Don't even
think of it.
</P>
<P>
   Lacquer, I think, would be out of place on such an earthy wood,
and it's impractical anyway unless you have a spray setup and
experience using it. Forget polyurethane. I'd use my standard
oil-varnish mix.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming sound boards, glue-up is unexceptional and any
appropriate joints may be employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making a swing for outdoors out of cedar. I'm thinking for
the main spans to use a 2x6 to support the swing on each side. The
span of the 2x6 would be 65 inches with 4x4s on each end. How much
weight could I expect the 2x6 to support? Should I go with a 2x8,
or double up the 2x6? I'm hoping to support 400 pounds, given two
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll assume here that he's making a porch swing, and using
western red cedar.
</P>
<P>
   Having assumed that, I'd suggest that he forget the cedar and
use something with good strength _ almost anything is stronger than
cedar. I wouldn't expect a cedar 2x6 to support 200 pounds, let
alone 400. A 2x8 wouldn't support any more weight, since the
strength is in the thickness and not the width.
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems, too. Cedar weathers well in terms of
appearance, but not to the touch. Exposed to the elements to any
degree at all, it gets rough and splintery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am making some wooden blocks for my 5-month-old and was
wondering what finish to use. They will probably spend most of the
time in his mouth, so I want to get something real safe. Any
ideas?''
</P>
<P>
   When my granddaughters were small, I was turning wood
semi-professionally. I finished things I made for them with
Behlen's Salad Bowl Oil. I don't know how much they chewed on it,
but they never blamed it for sickening them.
</P>
<P>
   Another fellow recommended using pure walnut oil, available at
some groceries. ``It polymerizes to a nice finish and is completely
safe as it is an edible oil,'' he reports. Some turners I know use
mineral oil as a finish, but it doesn't come to much in my opinion.
It never really dries, and tends to get dirty rather easily.

   POWER-SHIP (San Francisco) _ As a PG&AMP;E barge slated for a

Canal, Bay Area residents stood on the steps of City Hall and vowed
to stop it ``on land and on sea.'' By JANE KAY.

<P>
   PRISON-INSIDER (Albany, N.Y.) _ What author Ted Conover endured
to get the inside story about working as a state correction officer
in notorious Sing Sing was only the beginning. ``Newjack: Guarding
Sing Sing'' (Random House, $24.95), Conover's grim account of nine
months working as a rookie New York correction officer, is creating
controversy in criminal-justice circles. By PAUL GRONDAHL.
</P>
<P>
   THE-PILL (Undated) _ Long before ``the pill'' came to mean birth
control, young women who had premarital sex faced a set of
potential social consequences beyond the pregnancy itself. Unwed,
pregnant women sometimes disappeared, to return and resume life
after delivering their babies in charitable homes. Infants were
represented as premature, born once couples were safely married.
Contraceptives and abortions were covertly sought. By MICHAEL
LOPEZ. (For release Sunday, July 23.)
</P>
<P>
   OLD-HOUSES (Undated) _ Authors will often write about fond
memories of the houses where they grew up. But Richard Hampton
Jenrette chronicles the history of six remarkable houses in
``Adventures with Old Houses'' (Wyrick &AMP; Co., $60). The author
writes in detail about the properties that he has preserved for
generations to come. By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS. (For release
Sunday, July 23.)
</P>
<P>
   DAY-BED (Undated) _ As the forerunner to the sofa and the chaise
lounge, the day bed served as a place for quiet relaxation and
contemplative meditation. The day bed is a long seat with a
stationary or adjustable end that can be lowered to form a bed. By
FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS. (For release Sunday, July 23.)

   CHASE-EXEC (San Francisco) _ David A. Coulter, who emerged this
week with a top job at Chase Manhattan Bank nearly two years after
being ousted as chairman and chief executive of San Francisco-based
Bank of America, isn't interested in looking back. Coulter, 52,
made that clear Thursday in his first interview with The Examiner
since BofA was purchased by Charlotte, N.C.-based NationsBank in
September 1998. By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN.

   TRAVEL (``t'' category)
</P>
<P>
   CREOLE-TRAIL (Lake Charles, La.) _ The Creole Nature Trail,
which loops through Calcasieu and Cameron parishes of southwest
Louisiana, is more Nature than Creole. The natural world laps at
the roadside from marshes, canals, beaches, lakes, piney woods and
prairies. Their mysteries and subtleties can be gleaned at three
public wildlife refuges and a bird-and-butterfly sanctuary. By
MARTY RACINE.

</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COLUMN (Houston) _ Maite Costa-Medic and Jean-Michel
Poupart are in love. In love with each other. And in love with the
world. Many of us share their dream: Pack up one morning, leave all
our worries behind and take off together to explore the unknown, to
immerse ourselves in new cultures and new adventures, to savor
every precious second until our last penny is exhausted. Yes, many
of us dream. But for Maite and Jean-Michel, fantasy became reality.

   ORIENTALISM-EXHIBIT (Williamstown, Mass.) _ The Sterling and
Francine Clark Art Institute is showing an ambitious history of
Orientalism in America, from 1870, when it gained popular currency,
to just before World War II. Orientalism, the notion of an
``Orient'' replete with sultans and dancing girls, camel drivers
and bazaars, is a concoction of myth and cliche that has served a
range of nationalist, capitalist and chauvinist purposes through
the years. By TIMOTHY CAHILL. (For release Sunday, July 23.)
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT(``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-EMMYS (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Thomas O'Neil, a journalist who
wrote a book chronicling the history of the Emmys, is a raving
zealot when it comes to the television awards. So it's no wonder
that O'Neil's head comes close to exploding whenever he thinks
about the upcoming change in voting procedures. He predicts a
calamity on par with Pompeii. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-LOSER (Undated) _ Appropriating another defeatist
term of endearment from the mouths of America's young, ``Clueless''
writer-director Amy Heckerling returns with ``Loser.'' It's a
nonevent, though. The knowing bite is gone. She seems merely bitter
now, casting about for unmitigated warmth and hating herself for
it, and punishing us in the process. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-BENEATH (Undated) _ I was calloused and skeptical
enough to know going in that ``What Lies Beneath'' would be
hell-bent on eliciting screams from anyone who watched. I knew this
from the preview, which I had seen eight or nine times (I do not
exaggerate) and which promised a film about an unreasonably
gorgeous yuppie couple. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-POKMON (Undated) _ Will children abandon their
dog-eared copies of ``Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire'' for
``Pokmon the Movie 2000?'' Wait until kids get a load of ``P2K,''
with its jacked-up self-consciousness and attempt to give kids the
summer-movie fix they may have missed with ``Chicken Run'' (though
I don't see how). By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FBN-NINERS-DEFENSE (Stockton, Calif.) _ For years, the
stereotypical San Francisco 49ers offensive lineman was a
lightweight. Bobb McKittrick, the longtime offensive line coach who
died of cancer earlier this year, favored undersized, overachieving
players. His blocking schemes were based on quickness. That's
beginning to change. By BRUCE ADAMS.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ What an embarrassment it is to be
a liberal sometimes. Not only do you have to spend your time
worrying about endangered bugs, genetically altered cornflakes and
cops playing kick the can with carjackers, but you have to listen
to some odd ideas and the most unnatural language. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   TEENS-WORK (Berkeley, Calif.) _ Freed from the classroom, record
numbers of teenagers are blowing off the old American tradition of
taking a menial summer job. Indulgent, affluent parents are backing
their kids' choices to be summertime sloths. By NORMA J. SHATTUCK.

   EDMONSON-COLUMN _ The Internet might be the greatest
communication advance since the invention of the printing press. It
could also be the unrivaled champion at spreading misinformation.
The most recent highly visible instance involves a group that
gathered about 200 years before e-mail: the signers of the
Declaration of Independence. A number of recent columns _ including
one by Ann Landers that ran July 4 _ recount what supposedly
happened to some of these men. The pieces are riddled with errors,
exaggerations and misinterpretations. (Edmonson, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ According to the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press, voter interest in politics dropped from 55
percent in 1992 to 42 percent in 1996 and to a low of 38 percent
this year. These dismal figures indicate that voter turnout for the
November election will hit a new low. This means those Americans
who remain active in politics will have proportionally more clout
when it comes time to decide who gets what. Nethaway, Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   LATHAM-COLUMN _ I can't help but wonder what a different kind of
world we might live in if all fathers pulled their sons aside on
their wedding day and told them this similar straight-forward
message. (Latham, Marshall News-Messenger) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ Baseball survives in 2000, but a night at the
park is for Bill Gates. My guess is several million dollars changed
hands on enough beer to float the Queen Mary and tacos sufficient
to fill a freight train stretching from here to Birmingham, not to
mention peanuts and Cracker Jacks at $3.75 a pop. (Minter, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVEDMCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ One of
Dr. Sherry Wheaton's favorite quotes comes from Morris West's The
Shoes of the Fisherman. ``Reach out for the risk of living with
both arms. One has to embrace the world like a lover. One has to
accept pain as a condition of existence.'' After suffering serious
injuries from an attack by a German shepherd, Wheaton is learning
more about what it means to live them. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News)

<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ In case you were wondering, all that fuss in
Washington over fixing the so-called ``marriage penalty'' _ some
couples pay more together than they would filing individually _
isn't about the marriage penalty at all. It's about snookering
Democrats. Hey, this is an election year, folks. (Tom Teepen is
national correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Kenny went out and bought his eight-year-old
grandson a baseball glove the other day. And now it was time to
break it in, which puzzled the child because most kids today just
take their glove off the store shelf and go straight to the field
-- which is why the ball bounces out of the glove so often.
(Kleinberg, Cox News Service.) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ Since the era of Huntley and Brinkley in the NBC
skybooth, wraparound convention coverage has been relegated to the
all-news cable channels. To bear witness as the Republicans perform
next week in Philadelphia, CNN alone plans to send more8 a.m. to 10
p.m. Monday-Friday, and 1-10 p.m. on weekends and holidays.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ According to the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press, voter interest in politics dropped from 55
percent in 1992 to 42 percent in 1996 and to a low of 38 percent
this year. These dismal figures indicate that voter turnout for the
November election will hit a new low. This means those Americans
who remain active in politics will have proportionally more clout
when it comes time to decide who gets what. Nethaway, Waco

   MINTER-COLUMN _ Baseball survives in 2000, but a night at the

hands on enough beer to float the Queen Mary and tacos sufficient
to fill a freight train stretching from here to Birmingham, not to
mention peanuts and Cracker Jacks at $3.75 a pop. (Minter, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVEDMCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ One of
Dr. Sherry Wheaton's favorite quotes comes from Morris West's The
Shoes of the Fisherman. ``Reach out for the risk of living with
both arms. One has to embrace the world like a lover. One has to
accept pain as a condition of existence.'' After suffering serious
injuries from an attack by a German shepherd, Wheaton is learning
more about what it means to live them. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News)

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ In case you were wondering, all that fuss in
Washington over fixing the so-called ``marriage penalty'' _ some
couples pay more together than they would filing individually _
isn't about the marriage penalty at all. It's about snookering
Democrats. Hey, this is an election year, folks. (Tom Teepen is

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Kenny went out and bought his eight-year-old
grandson a baseball glove the other day. And now it was time to
break it in, which puzzled the child because most kids today just
take their glove off the store shelf and go straight to the field
-- which is why the ball bounces out of the glove so often.

<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ Since the era of Huntley and Brinkley in the NBC
skybooth, wraparound convention coverage has been relegated to the
all-news cable channels. To bear witness as the Republicans perform
next week in Philadelphia, CNN alone plans to send more than 500
people, including a slew of interns and Internet mavens. Two weeks
later, the parallel show opens among the Democrats in Los Angeles.

   SYDNEY _Sydney _ In going from Georgia to Australia, then, the
Olympics have gone from one British penal experiment to another.
This odd kinship of outcasts dawned on me as I was sitting at a
cafe beside Sydney Cove, the aquamarine inlet that sets off the
heart of the city like a jade pendant. Ferry boats were churning
through the whitecaps of crisscrossing wakes. On one side of the
cove, the Opera House roof loomed like the upturned prows of a
dozen giant rowboats. On the other side, blue Australian flags
streamed in the breeze atop the long steel arch of the Harbour
Bridge. It's hard to imagine now, but this postcard spot was where
the First Fleet landed in 1788 with a thousand convicts and
sailors. Ten thousand miles from home, they struggled and almost
starved yet somehow managed to transform their bitter exile into a
city and nation that will soon command the world's attention.

   FAT-SOUTHERNERS _We know that America overall has a weight
problem - by some measures, 50 percent of the population is at
least somewhat overweight. But what's the Southern piece of that
pie? According to a new AJC poll, Southerners are more likely than
people elsewhere in the US to admit to being ``moderately or
seriously'' overweight - even though they set the bar for what
constitutes ``overweight'' higher than residents of other states
do, and given even more latitude to men than they do to women. At
the same time, though, Southerners are more willing to blame their
own bad habits for their weight problems. Includes interviews with
poll respondents and Southern sociologists. With charts, possible

   ENHANCER _ The Theater 2000 is a device that promises to
``enhance'' the performance of your home sound system by ``allowing

hard to describe exactly what the unit is doing, it actually does
seem to give music a more full-bodied, three-dimensional feel.

gadgets in cars and in roomy SUVs. Ever since Oldsmobile introduced

TALK MISSILE DEFENSE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Japan _ Amid criticisms that the leaders of the world's
seven richest nations have done little to meet their commitments to
reduce the debt of poor nations, the leaders pledged Friday to work
harder to fulfill their goals.
</P>
<P>
   However, critics said the countries _ the United States, Canada,
France, Italy, Germany, Britain and Japan _ are still moving too
slowly in meeting their promise from last year's summit in Cologne
to cancel up to $100 billion of debt owed by 40 of the world's
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders at Cologne made a big political statement last
year saying they'd cancel $100 billion in debt,'' said Marlene
Barrett, a spokesperson for Jubilee 2000, an organization
campaigning for debt cancellation for poor countries. ``They simply
failed to get that through.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first day of the three-day summit in this seaside resort
town on the island of Okinawa, President Clinton also held a side
meeting with Russia's president Vladimir Putin, who joined the
other nations for a working dinner later Friday _ to make it a full
Group of Eight summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting with Putin, coming just six weeks after his
trip to Moscow in June, centered largely on security issues and
Putin's trip to North Korea this week, in which he announced that
Pyongyang had offered to give up its missile program if other
nations would provide it with rockets to launch satellites into
space.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's missile program is the prime motivation for a U.S.
national missile defense which is vigorously opposed by Russia and
China. France and Germany also have opposed the defense system.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told reporters,
``I'm skeptical about it.'' He stressed that America can do what it
sees in its national interest, but said it should discuss the issue
with NATO and Russia. Chirac said he feared creation of a missile
shield could start another arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will decide this summer whether to go ahead
with the missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said Clinton discussed North
Korea's offer with Putin but added the United States still needs
further clarification.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not entirely clear what's in (North Korean leader) Kim
Jong Il's mind with regard to this possible trade-off,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``A very dangerous
idea would be the international community would provide actual
launch capability to North Korea, that is to say rockets launched
from North Korean territory.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if Kim envisions launching North Korean satellites on
foreign soil, ``it's something we'd be prepared to pursue,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the United States and Russia issued a joint
statement saying they are dedicated to finding new ways to
cooperate on controlling the spread of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   They also had a lengthy discussion on the Middle East peace
talks going on at Camp David. The White House official said Putin
offered his assistance but would not give details of the

</P>
<P>
   The G8 discussion of debt relief came one day after a meeting in
Tokyo in which leaders of several developing countries stated their
frustration with the slow pace of debt relief by the world's
richest nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of (the G8 leaders) referenced the meeting that had taken
place yesterday . . . and which gave greater impetus to the need to
get the Cologne debt commitments implemented,'' said Lael Brainard,
deputy national economic advisor.
</P>
<P>
   So far, nine countries have qualified for the debt relief
initiative and a few have had their debt repayments reduced, but
none have had their debts canceled, Barrett said. Another 11
countries may qualify by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee 2000, a coalition of faith-based groups, labor unions,
women's groups _ and a few rock stars _ has been active since 1996
and has collected 19 million signatures in 120 countries. It
believes that 52 poor countries should qualify for debt
cancellation totalling $354 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're spending more on paying back their debt than on
healthcare and education,'' said Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by G8 leaders Friday _ not including Russia
_ expressed concern that many of the poor nations are at war or
have military conflicts which prevent them from qualifying for debt
relief. They agreed to do more to help those countries qualify, but
Brainard said there was no discussion of relaxing the terms of debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee 2000 would like to see an independent process for
determining which countries qualify for debt relief, rather than
having the lender decide what loans to forgive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the creditor is the judge, jury and prosecutor all at
once,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton landed in Okinawa Friday morning and headed straight to
a peace memorial in an effort to placate criticism from another
corner _ local Okinawans unhappy with the large U.S. military
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa hosts about 26,000 American military personnel, more
than half of the American forces in Japan, even though it comprises
less than 1 percent of Japan's land mass. An estimated 27,000
people turned out Thursday to form a human chain around Kadena
Airbase in a show of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged to continue efforts to ``reduce our footprint on
this island,'' but some Okinawans were disappointed that he neither
said anything specific about base reduction nor apologized for an
incident earlier this month in which a drunken U.S. marine
allegedly entered a local house and molested a sleeping 14-year-old
girl.
</P>
<P>
   A few small, scattered groups of anti-base protesters appeared
at various summit venues and along the main road.
</P>
<P>
   The Okinawa summit is Clinton's eighth and last G8 summit. He
joined the group as the new kid on the block and leaves as the
veteran.

 &HT;    G8 LEADERS CRITICIZED AT SUMMIT OVER DEBT RELIEF; CLINTON, PUTIN
TALK MISSILE DEFENSE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   NAGO, Japan _ Amid criticisms that the leaders of the world's
seven richest nations have done little to meet their commitments to
reduce the debt of poor nations, the leaders pledged Friday to work
harder to fulfill their goals.
</P>
<P>
   However, critics said the countries _ the United States, Canada,
France, Italy, Germany, Britain and Japan _ are still moving too
slowly in meeting their promise from last year's summit in Cologne
to cancel up to $100 billion of debt owed by 40 of the world's
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders at Cologne made a big political statement last
year saying they'd cancel $100 billion in debt,'' said Marlene
Barrett, a spokesperson for Jubilee 2000, an organization
campaigning for debt cancellation for poor countries. ``They simply
failed to get that through.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first day of the three-day summit in this seaside resort
town on the island of Okinawa, President Clinton also held a side
meeting with Russia's president Vladimir Putin, who joined the
other nations for a working dinner later Friday _ to make it a full
Group of Eight summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting with Putin, coming just six weeks after his
trip to Moscow in June, centered largely on security issues and
Putin's trip to North Korea this week, in which he announced that
Pyongyang had offered to give up its missile program if other
nations would provide it with rockets to launch satellites into
space.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's missile program is the prime motivation for a U.S.
national missile defense which is vigorously opposed by Russia and
China. France and Germany also have opposed the defense system.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told reporters,
``I'm skeptical about it.'' He stressed that America can do what it
sees in its national interest, but said it should discuss the issue
with NATO and Russia. Chirac said he feared creation of a missile
shield could start another arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will decide this summer whether to go ahead
with the missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said Clinton discussed North
Korea's offer with Putin but added the United States still needs
further clarification.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not entirely clear what's in (North Korean leader) Kim
Jong Il's mind with regard to this possible trade-off,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``A very dangerous
idea would be the international community would provide actual
launch capability to North Korea, that is to say rockets launched
from North Korean territory.''
</P>

offending speech is presumed to be false, and it is up to
defendants to prove that it is in fact true. That tends to have a

someone who is powerful, rich or particularly litigious. By Sarah

OWLS SETTLE IN AND THE GARDEN BLOSSOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ We named the
first owl after my husband's late father. We call him Owlvin, for
Alvin. Now he's joined by another we call Owloise, after Eloise, my
late mother-in-law. I know their namesakes would approve. Maybe
they've come back to watch over.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Living in a place that is fast running out of wild things, we
feel charmed that these snowy creatures with caramel streaks
deigned to move into our oak tree.
</P>
<P>
   These are barn owls, endangered in some parts of the country but
still common in California even as their habitats lose ground.
</P>
<P>
   We're lucky. Friends lost the owls, red-tailed hawks and
butterflies drawn to their neighborhood by a nearby stand of
eucalyptus trees that were knocked down in favor of a subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Bird rescuer Diane Hichwa who lives on Sonoma Mountain says barn
owls are losing their haunts as barns, old buildings and water
towers are torn down. But she said we should also feel special to
be chosen. Owls are finicky.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it's probably not our charming selves that they're
drawn too, but the potential for good eats. Given a barn owl's
diet, which is mostly rodents, we offer a regular ``smorgy'' of
burrowing critters who have had their way with our field and
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Some owls can eat five gophers a day. I don't know if ours are
actually dining on gophers or just scaring the heck out of them but
we have more dahlias and zinnias left standing this summer than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   We're on different shifts, the owls and us. They're just getting
off work when we're getting up. We pass around 6 a.m. most
mornings. Whoever goes to the kitchen to start the coffee now must
make an owl report.
</P>
<P>
   They are usually there, standing in the door of their owl box,
not moving, just staring our way with those big ET eyes. They look
like two stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   We wave. We take photos. We talk to them. They probably think
we're loons.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we'll even adjust to their scream, which sounds like
Martha from ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf'' is on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   People say you get used to the screech of a barn owl just like
you get used to the smell of a skunk as a part of rural ambience.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Bentley with the Audubon Society thinks owls had a lot to
do with making people believe in ghosts. She says that long ago
when churches were next to graveyards, owls lived in the cozy
quarters of church spires and preyed on the mice that flourished in
the cemetery grass. Someone walking through a graveyard at night
would suddenly have ``this great white thing silently swooping down
toward them,'' says Martha. ``And then it would let out the most
horrible sound. It's no wonder people started telling ghost
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Owlvin and Owloise also came to us because of the wooden owl box
which we built and hoisted high up into an oak tree two years ago.
It was vacant for so long we started making jokes about our folly,
saying it was a dog house blown up into the trees by the last
tornado.
</P>
<P>
   We think Owlvin must have cruised by a few times, like you do
when you're thinking about a new house, not wanting to appear too
eager. Single at first, he joined up with a partner. Although we
haven't seen any babies we think we've heard some little owl
squeaks, which would be nice, seeing as how we already think of it
as the family tree.

BRANAGH MOVIE A LOST LABOR FOR MIRAMAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are going to fail, fail spectacularly. And in this, the
recent Miramax movie release, ``Love's Labour's Lost'' has
succeeded magnificently. According to last Sunday's Parade
magazine, ``Lost'' was playing in 14 American theaters and had
grossed barely $100,000. Miramax says the gross is $299,000; the
trade magazine Variety reports $190,000. Whatever. For Hollywood,
the number is minuscule. After the movie opened in mid-June, it
didn't even appear on the Hollywood Reporter's list of 50
top-grossing movies in the country, which included two Imax movies
that show only in special facilities, and nWaves's obscure 1999
release ``Alien Adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   How could this possibly happen? Admittedly, ``Lost,'' which
combines an exuberant Shakespeare comedy with venerable Broadway
show tunes, was a hard concept to sell. The reviews were all over
the map: Jay Carr sort of liked it; Entertainment Weekly gave it a
C+ ; Jeffrey Gantz of the Boston Phoenix awarded it five stars on a
scale of one to four. I enjoyed it. It's hard to make a
16th-century play fun, but director Kenneth Branagh _ with assists
from William Shakespeare, George Gershwin, and Cole Porter _ did
just that.
</P>
<P>
   The word among exhibitors is that, faced with conflicting
reviews, Miramax decided not to support the movie. The company's
Dimension Films division has been making untold millions with the
flashy, cashy, trashy ``Scream'' series and this summer's monster
hit, ``Scary Movie,'' so the Bard is taking a back seat. Miramax
spokeswoman Elizabeth Clark rejects this argument, saying ``we did
what we normally do'', e.g. interviews and TV appearances by
Branagh and costar Alicia Silverstone, to promote ``Lost.'' ``Not
every film is measured by its success at the box office,'' Clark
says. ``It's still something we're glad we made.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Commonwealth, you can find ``Lost'' at the West Newton
Cinema, and it will be arriving shortly at theaters in Dennis and
Williamstown.

   I have only two questions about Hell's Angels founder Sonny
Barger's new autobiography, which is selling well enough to have
appeared on several national bestseller lists. 1: Why isn't his
fabulously successful, motorycle-borne book promotion tour coming
to New England? 2: In his book, which I will surely read someday,
does Barger narrate one of the seminal moments in modern American
literature, meaning his brutal, nonfatal stomping of gonzo
journalist Hunter S. Thompson?
</P>
<P>
   The answers to these questions are: no and no.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Green, chief publicist for Barger's publisher, William
Morrow &AMP; Co., explains that Sonny's bike tour, on which he is
accompanied by a flight of 50 or more fellow Angels, has more or
less stuck to Route 66. At some bike stores _ not bookstores, bike
stores _ Barger has sold up to 600 copies of ``Hell's Angel.'' But
we have plenty of subliterate thugs who ride choppers here _ why
not bring him up to Laconia, N.H., for the big fall ride around
Lake Winnipesaukee? It's not excluded, Green told me, adding that
``Sonny has already done an event in the East, in South Dakota.''
(!) And although he does write about dealing LSD in San Francisco
in the 1960s, he doesn't include the Thompson stomping in his
memoir. For that, you'll have to read Thompson's own ``Hell's
Angels,'' which is still in print.

   Angry, unpredictable, and smart are three traits I admire in a
journalist, and Debra Dickerson has all three. I remember reading
Debra's columns in a Harvard Law School student newspaper, where
she honed an edgy, take-no-prisoners style. Her forthcoming memoir,
``An American Story,'' just received a coveted starred review in
Publisher's Weekly, and in an accompanying interview, Debra
promises to bring her book tour to the inner-city neighborhoods
familiar to her from childhood: ``I'll go out into the 'hood as
well,'' she told PW. ``I'm not Clarence Thomas. I love my people.''

This is a very beautiful book: ``A Place of Beauty: The Artists &AMP;

`WHAT LIES BENEATH' REALLY NOT SO FRIGHTENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
WHAT LIES BENEATH 
Directed by: Robert Zemeckis 
Screenplay by: Clark Gregg 
Starring: Michelle Pfeiffer, Harrison Ford, Katharine Towne,
Mirando Otto, James Remar, Victoria Bisdewell, Diana Scarwid, Amber
Valletta, Joe Morton, Micole Mercurio 
Running time: 130 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (terror/violence, sensuality and brief language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Certainly, there should be room for an adult version of ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer.'' But ``What Lies Beneath'' isn't it.
Essentially, it's claptrap, but Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer
don't take naturally to claptrap and director Robert Zemeckis stubs
his toe on it, too, especially in the end. It's meant to be a
scarefest in which Pfeiffer sees dead people, specifically a dead
woman her husband had been sleeping with. ``What Lies Beneath'' is
the kind of movie in which sins not only come home to roost but
move in under the floorboards and start doing poltergeist stuff.
Meanwhile, Pfeiffer's spooked wife starts doing a Hitchcock number
out of ``Rear Window,'' spying on the guy next door after his wife
mysteriously disappears. But clearly, that's not all there is to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, her character, a classical musician who gave up her
career in deference to that of her high-powered geneticist husband,
played by Ford, is sitting on unarticulated anger, or at least
resentment. One look at their perfect world, a handsome lakeside
house in Vermont, complete with garden, and you know it can't be
the Eden it seems. Ford and Pfeiffer make this clear in their first
bedroom scene. She looks sexy in her nightie, sexy enough to
convince her workaholic husband to detach himself from his laptop
and attach himself to her instead. But she's clearly tense and he's
prickly.
</P>
<P>
   These two are not at ease with each other. Matters aren't helped
when she turns to him, frightened after doors start opening and
closing, appliances go on and off, and noises are heard, and his
response is to bundle her off to a shrink. There's such a repressed
quality in their outwardly perfect lifestyle that a long, sustained
scream seems a valid reaction, quite apart from any poltergeists.
So far, so good with the film, which is a bit poky but of sleek
enough workmanship to keep you watching. It's interesting, too, to
discover that the word ``lies'' means as much as the word
``beneath'' in the title, as ugly things start coming to light and
the hitherto passive wife begins to think about maybe reclaiming
her life.
</P>
<P>
   The question becomes one of who's lying to whom as Pfeiffer's
increasingly confused character, ironically named Claire,
intensifies her snooping on her neighbor and also begins to examine
a few of the objects in her own house with new eyes. As Claire
begins fraying, so does her husband, Norman. His good-guy patience
evaporates and he blows up at Claire, accusing her of trying to
sabotage a paper he's preparing to deliver at an important
conference. It's about as genuinely primal as the film gets.
There's something mechanical and calculated about the way it layers
its revelations and metaphors. You receive them as information
transmitted to your data bank, not as creepy-crawly stuff making
the hairs on the back of your neck tingle.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Pfeiffer deliver craftsmanlike work, but the film
steadily unravels as Zemeckis tries to ratchet up the suspense. He
borrows from a couple of other Hitchcock films (the score also owes
much to Bernard Herrmann's music for ``Psycho''), and, apparently
sensing a shortfall in the scariness department, steers the film
into jack-in-the-box territory, hoping to yank thrills from the
sudden appearance of one character or another. But as this one or
that one _ at one point, even the couple's dog _ pops into the
frame, it becomes glumly undeniable that they're all flogging a
dead horse. At one point, in what becomes an interminable ending,
Claire accusingly screams at Norman, ``There's a presence in our
house!'' The trouble is that the presence isn't Hitchcock's. It's
more like William Castle's _ except that Castle (``The Tingler,
``House on Haunted Hill'') was much more at ease with shameless
exploitation and did it a lot better than ``What Lies Beneath.''

HEALTHY HARRIS BACK IN THE RUNNING WITH THE PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SMITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots have been searching for him for
three years now.
</P>
<P>
   He is a comparable replacement for Curtis Martin. The Patriots
thought they had him when Robert Edwards ran for more than 1,000
yards as a rookie in 1998. But an injury left his career in
jeapordy, so the search continued.
</P>
<P>
   It brought the Patriots to Kevin Faulk in the '99 NFL Draft. He
hasn't turned out to be an every-down back, though he has become
their best kick returner. So the Patriots turned to veteran Terry
Allen, who rushed for 896 yards last season. It was his only in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to this year's edition of the annual running
back challenge. All the Patriots want is for someone to give
respectability to their running game, thereby taking some of the
pressure off Drew Bledsoe. They drafted J.R. Redmond out of Arizona
State, thinking he could come in and possibly be ``the guy.'' The
problem is, he hasn't come in yet.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before they drafted Redmond, however, the Patriots
signed former Bear and Packer Raymont Harris. All he has done in
the first four days of training camp is put distance between
himself and Redmond in the race for the starting job. He has had
what coach Bill Belichick calls ``a good, solid, consistent camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris has had his share of setbacks in his five-year career.
They've made him hungry. It's still early, but you can tell by the
way Harris is running in training camp that he wants the job search
to end with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those kinds of guys that has a chip on his shoulder
when it comes to football,'' Harris said Thursday after the team's
morning workout. ``I see the type of things that they say about me,
being over the hill and slow and injury-prone and things like that.
I'm a competitor. I don't want my game to be viewed that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely taking this as a challenge, and I'm going to
prove a lot of people wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the skepticism comes from the fact that Harris was out
of football all of last year. Since being drafted out of Ohio State
in the first round by Chicago in 1994, he has played in all 16
regular-season games only once in his career.
</P>
<P>
   A broken collarbone kept him out of all but one game in 1995. A
year later, a knee injury forced him to miss four contests. After a
breakout 1997 season with the Bears, Harris signed a free-agent
deal with Green Bay, for whom he was supposed to be a steady
complement to Dorsey Levens. But he missed half the '98 season with
a stress fracture in his left leg and torn ligaments in his ankle.
The Packers released him, and he spent 1999 watching the NFL on
television, as several tryouts couldn't land him a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was really trying at times,'' said Harris, who
rushed for 1,033 yards in 1997 despite playing in only 13 games.
``I would catch myself analyzing and critiquing games. Watching
other running backs do their thing, and watching my friends go out
there and rooting for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just really tough. It was like having something taken
away from you in a way. And it was out of my control. And I usually
have control of things in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Harris appears to be in control of who will line up
behind Bledsoe. If he continues to impress while Redmond continues
to hold out, it will be very difficult for the rookie, who is
coming off groin surgery, to beat out the veteran for the starting
spot.
</P>
<P>
   For Harris, New England presented a good opportunity to start
over. He knew the Patriots needed a running back, and also knew
that he'd have a chance to play for a winning team. And it didn't
hurt that his former teammate in Chicago, fullback Tony Carter, was
also in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the team was very solid and had a chance to make some
definite waves in the league this year,'' said Harris. ``We've got
a new coaching staff, everyone's going to be starting new, and I've
got a chance to revive my career.''
</P>
<P>
   From what he's seen in training camp, Harris believes the
Patriots have what it takes to win it all. ``There's a lot of
talent here,'' he said. ``There are some guys here that are three
years removed from the Super Bowl. So the talent is definitely
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 29, comes from a great running back tradition at Ohio
State, which has featured the likes of Archie Griffin, Keith Byars,
Robert Smith, and Harris's teammate with the Buckeyes, Eddie George
of the Titans. Harris hopes that, like Smith and George, he can
become one of the league's elite backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all like great friends,'' said Harris, who started his
pro career as a fullback but moved to tailback in the fourth game
of the '97 season. ``I've learned a lot from them, and I'd like to
believe that I taught them some things here and there. They believe
in me. They know what kind of person I am on the field and off the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   The league saw a glimpse of what Harris could do with the
football while he was in Chicago. Now he's out to prove that he
hasn't lost it. One thing's for sure, he said: He's going to give
it his all whether he's the man or just one of a committee of
running backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always considered myself the kind of person that would do
anything that the team needed me to do,'' said Harris. ``If I keep
working hard, this injury stuff right here, statistically, it just
can't happen too many more times. I know things are going to work
out well.''

MESSAGE TO GORE: GO WITH MITCHELL OR KERRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I'm Al Gore, my short list for VP should have these five
names, going alphabetically: Indiana Governor Evan Bayh; Senators
Dick Durbin of Illinois, Bob Graham of Florida, and John Kerry of
Massachusetts, and former Maine Senator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know; no woman, no minority, no thinking-outside-the-box
type. Maybe Al's got a surprise up his sleeve, but after the way he
has moped through the summer, I suspect he's got nothing up his
sleeves but elbows.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the New Englander in me, but I lean toward Mitchell
and Kerry, because I think the South is largely lost to Texas
Governor George W. Bush, though Gore remains surprisingly close in
Florida, and I think the Midwest battleground states can be pitched
without having to go for a favorite son.
</P>
<P>
   Bayh's a genuine comer, a moderate New Democrat type, probably
still too callow for this cycle, and still largely unknown outside
his region. But he's leagues ahead of another little-known Hoosier
plucked to run with a plodding vice president, name of Dan Quayle.
Graham makes Gore more competitive in Florida. But with Governor
Jeb Bush flogging the patronage army for his brother, and the Cuban
community going bananas over the Elian Gonzalez fiasco, and the
longtime penchant for Southern white males voting Republican for
president, I see Florida voting for George W., even though it's
neck-and-neck today.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Southerner enough for me; having two Southerners on the
ticket, making it the third straight Democratic ticket pairing a
brace of sons of the Old Confederacy, does not do enough to
energize the Northern urban vote.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin is an affable Midwesterner with good skills, and like
Mitchell and Kerry, he's a Catholic, which seems to be an advantage
for running mates this time around, given Bush's tar-and-feather
job on John McCain at Bob Jones University last winter. (Bayh is
Episcopalian, Graham is a member of the United Church of Christ.)
Durbin probably gives Gore Illinois, but I don't think he helps as
much elsewhere as Mitchell or Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than emphasizing youth (Bayh) or region (Graham and
Durbin) I'd urge Gore to think broadband, think international.
Mitchell's background as architect of the Northern Ireland peace
deal appeals to more than just the Irish-American vote. A former
federal judge, his temperament is reassuring. His record is
flawless. And his role as Senate majority leader made him expert on
all the kinds of issues that George W. knows little about.
</P>
<P>
   There's a mischievous aspect to a Mitchell candidacy as well: He
drives the Bush gang crazy. It was Mitchell who forced Poppa Bush,
Mr. ``Read my lips: No new taxes!'' to break that pledge by
constructing a Hobson's choice in the Senate budget-balancing game.
The Bush clan still smarts at Mitchell's role in humiliating the
Old Man.
</P>
<P>
   What voters will see in Mitchell is an articulate, understated
pol with a Mainer's knack for droll humor and thoughtful pauses.
He'd wear well on TV. Plus, he's a nutty Red Sox fan. What's not to
like? If Bush, whose record is that of a not-quite-two-term
governor, picks another governor, say Pennsylvania's Tom Ridge,
you'd have a situtation where the Democrats could boast that both
ends of their ticket could handle foreign policy better.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's difficulty with remembering names of foreign leaders has
not cost him to date. But with globalization, defense, and foreign
policy as defining issues, either Mitchell or Kerry, an experienced
internationalist, could run rings around the GOP ticket. Bush's
experience with foreign policy could be uncharitably characterized
as him ordering Mexican food. He does speak Spanish readily.
</P>
<P>
   With Kerry, you get a warrior of a campaigner. Like Ridge, he's
a decorated Vietnam War veteran. Kerry is very close to John
McCain, so the Arizonan would not be able to singe the Gore team
with as much venom. Kerry's debating skills match anyone else's in
the game: He went toe-to-toe against Bill Weld in nine hours of
debates, and is very strong on the tube. And Kerry has a solid
progressive Senate record. When he ran the subcommittee covering
narcotics and terrorism, he was a dogged investigator. He uncovered
the BCCI banking scandal, and could deftly carry the argument that
the Democrats must become a party that can deal with global
economic forces. Did I mention that Kerry's wife is worth more than
$600 million?
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea how compatible Gore is with any of these five.
That'll count. You have to have a running mate you trust, which is
why Bush is afraid of McCain. The Bush family is uneasy with
independent-minded outsiders. For Gore, this is a chance to
energize his listless campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Going international, with Mitchell or Kerry, would pose a
favorable contrast with the Bush-? ticket. The whole point is to
woo independent-minded voters without alienating your base.
Gore-Mitchell or Gore-Kerry can do that.

ENDANGERED MONKEY STIRS CUSTODY ISSUE FOR N.Y. FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the 20 years since Roman and Inna Flikshtein
immigrated from the Soviet Union, they never thought anything like
what they're going through now could happen in America.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare began July 3, when the New York attorney general
put them on notice that, any day now, marshals could pound on their
door and take a loved one away.
</P>
<P>
   Their anxieties are not the slightest bit allayed by the fact
that the loved one in danger is a monkey named Cookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very depressed about this,'' Roman Flikshtein, a dental
technician, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookie is a child,'' his wife said, on the verge of tears.
``She is a very important member of this family. She won't be able
to live without us. I don't know how I'll be able to live without
her.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flikshteins' daughter, Michelle, 13, was also glum: ``I know
that she's a monkey, but we have a sisterly love. We play together
a lot, we hug and kiss. We were raised together.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fathoming the law &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This strange drama has triggered a range of questions about the
proper relations between higher and lower primates.
</P>
<P>
   As New York state sees it, the case is cut and dried. Cookie is
a diana monkey, officially an endangered species. The law forbids
people from keeping these species. Either the Flikshteins give
Cookie up _ which they refuse to do _ or the authorities will seize
her.
</P>
<P>
   To the Flikshteins, the case is more complex. They thought they
were legally purchasing the monkey when they bought her at a Long
Island pet store in February 1995, when she was 3 months old. Not
knowing Cookie was endangered, they have lovingly raised her in the
5 1/2 years since.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, on the shopowner's ill-informed advice, they early on
had Cookie neutered. If she is put in a zoo with a male monkey, she
cannot breed, cannot help perpetuate her species.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what is the purpose of taking her away?,'' Mr. Flikshtein
asked.
</P>
<P>
   He never had a chance to make this argument.
</P>
<P>
   The tale actually began two years ago, when the family was
living in Queens, before moving to their current home in a in south
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   An angry neighbor told the city health department that the
monkey had bitten someone, which the family denies. In the course
of the inquiry, the authorities realized Cookie's species was on
the endangered list _ something the Flikshteins had not known _ and
notified the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Flikshtein applied to the state's Department of
Environment and Conservation for a permit to own the animal. The
application was denied. He was informed of the rejection 11 months
later, in June 1999, on the same day he appeared in a Queens
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The state's lawyers, who had the denial letter before the family
did, presented it to the judge, who instantly ruled in favor of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals panel denied a motion to reconsider. &QL; 
 &QL; 
An unheard case &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Flikshteins' lawyer had worked up a case, but nobody heard
it.
</P>
<P>
   Kathi Travers was a key witness in that case. She had spent 13
years rescuing exotic animals for the ASPCA, had run the
international animal port at John F. Kennedy Airport, and was known
as a top specialist on monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, I'm against anybody keeping a monkey as a pet,''
Travers said Thursday. In the case of Cookie, she makes an
exception.
</P>
<P>
   She observed Cookie for a week in the Flikshtein home, and she
came away amazed. ``I have never seen a monkey who's been
potty-trained, but this monkey was,'' she said. ``I wouldn't have
believed it possible unless I saw it.'' Cookie also ``had this
ritual at night, cleaning herself with water and lemon, and I'd
never seen that, either.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cookie leaves that house, Travers concluded, ``I think she
will suffer depression, she will get very debilitated. I would like
nothing more than seeing this monkey nicely fitting in with other
monkeys, but it's too big a gamble. I believe in putting animals in
places equal to or better than where they are. Where is she going
to be better? She's living a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, Roman Flikshtein crouched near Cookie, who was
in her cage, caressing his finger while playing with a stuffed toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in trouble, Cookie,'' he said softly. ``Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Cookie stands a little more than 2 feet tall and weighs 9
pounds. She has big eyes, a pharoah beard, and a red, white, and
black coat. Out of her cage, she heads toward her leash, leaps onto
somebody's shoulder, and emits high-pitched gurgles. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Monkey see, monkey do &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Doherty, the curator of the Bronx Zoo, greatly respects
Travers _ and Travers equally respects him _ but he disagrees with
her here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This monkey should live with other monkeys,'' Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for Cookie to be placed in the Detroit Zoo
alongside a male diana, of which only a few dozen exist in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Cookie cannot breed _ and Doherty notes that some
veterinary fixes don't take _ she could be ``a good auntie to other
females brought in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty mentioned a baboon that lived its first few years with
humans, is now at the Prospect Park Zoo in Brooklyn, and recently
had a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took time for her to adjust, but now she's a wonderful
mother,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty's biggest worry is that Cookie's case may convince
people that monkeys are good pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monkeys are wild animals,'' he said. ``They frequently bite
and they're destructive. They also live long lives, 30 or 40 years;
people don't realize what a commitment they're making.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't buy the Flikshteins' picture of domesticity. ``Why do
they keep it in a cage?'' he asked. ``They don't keep their
daughter in a cage.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Flikshteins have been calling every politician
they can think of, but none has replied.
</P>
<P>
   Their neighbors are pledging to man the barricades if the
marshals come, like the Miami Cuban-Americans did for Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Flikshtein, a quiet man, is uncomfortable with the comparison.
Still, he has grown a bit disillusioned with his adopted homeland.
``I really expected somebody at least to hear our case,'' he said.
``I guess the system doesn't work.''

STEVE EARLE EXPLOITING HIS SECOND CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the casual observer, Steve Earle looks like a garden-variety
overachiever. He's just hit the road for a tour in support of his
fine new CD, ``Transcendental Blues'' _ the country music
renegade's fifth album in five years. He's finishing up a
collection of short stories, ``Doghouse Roses,'' scheduled for
spring release by Houghton Mifflin. He's producing an album for
Canadian singer-songwriter Ron Sexsmith, contributing to the
soundtrack for a film about Abbie Hoffman, and writing his first
play, about executed murderer Karla Faye Tucker. (In his spare
time, Earle is an outspoken activist for eradicating the death
penalty, eliminating land mines, and boosting welfare.) He commutes
from Nashville to Chicago to teach a songwriting class three nights
a week. As a really cool spiritual exercise, Earle is writing a
haiku a day for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to wake up in the morning to a $500-a-day
habit,'' he says, by way of explanation. Far from a stress-addicted
Type A personality, Earle fills his days and nights with the
gregariousness of someone who not so long ago filled his time with
far less constructive pursuits _ namely smoking crack and downing
Dilaudid, a synthetic form of heroin.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of 20 years, Earle was a raging drug addict.
That he managed to carve out a career as Nashville's best-loved
rebel, marry and divorce six times, father two children, and stay
alive is miraculous. A large portion of credit goes to Earle's
mentors: the late Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark, a pair of
songwriters well-versed in both and self-destruction and
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   The last five years mark an incredible creative run for Earle, a
true chameleon of a songwriter. ``Transcendental Blues'' is his
most inward-facing and ambitious album to date, a sea change from
last year's ``The Mountain'' _ a collaboration with bluegrass star
Del McCoury. It's an earthy, trippy, scorched cross-pollination of
folk, pop, rockabilly, Celtic, and country music. It includes some
of Earle's usual in-your-face narratives, but also more personal
reflections, and he lets the battle scars show.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Transcendental Blues,' the song, is pretty ambiguous for
me,'' Earle says, on the phone from E-Squared, his Nashville-based
record label. ``It's about the idea of change, and that change for
me is not elective. It's necessary for my survival. If I don't
continue to change, I'll die. I feel like a completely different
person than the person who made `Guitar Town' and `Copperhead Road'
(two albums Earle made in the '80s). Not that I'm ashamed of those
records. I just have a hard time recognizing the person who made
those records as me.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after failing to appear in court for sentencing on a
prior heroin charge, Earle was incarcerated and then sent to a drug
treatment facility because ``they didn't want me dying in their
jail.'' That's where Earle finally kicked drugs. Make no mistake,
though. There were none of the usual epiphanies or revelations
involved in Earle's recovery. He didn't turn to religion or the 12
Steps. He had, Earle says, no desire to stop using. ``I had no
intention of ever getting clean. I knew I was an addict, knew I was
dying, and didn't think I could kick it. Where did I get the
strength? I got locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Earle feels, understandably, like a man who's been given a
second chance. ``It almost feels like a second life, a second
career,'' says Earle. ``I've figured out what I missed, and I'm
living it now. I probably am doing more than I ever have. But for
the first time in five years I don't have a single song written for
another record. I have a life now. I do other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those other things are setting up house with the woman he
loves _ who has wisely, Earle concedes, decided against marrying
him _ and finding his voice as a writer of prose and poetry. He's
four months into his commitment to write 365 haikus in as many
days, a project inspired by ``just sort of wanting to learn
something about it.'' Those may sound like the words of a
dilettante; in Earle's case, they're the words of a man making up
for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got an eighth-grade education,'' Earle says. ``I never
took English lit. The way I know about poetry is I read ``The
Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test'' and then backtracked to Kerouac, and
Kerouac and (Gary) Snyder were two of the earliest people to write
haiku in English. It's a great literary exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Earle is as uninterested in the mainstream country music scene,
or Nashville's star-making machinery for that matter, as he ever
was. His label is an imprint of Artemis Records, run by respected
industry veteran Danny Goldberg, and distributed by RED, a large
independent distributor. Earle has total creative control, and all
that freedom suits him fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised by Townes and Guy, so at a very early age I met
people who weren't doing it for the money. I got lucky when, at a
certain point in time, mainstream music became interested in what I
was doing. I call it the Great Credibility Scare of the Mid-'80s.
But the last decade has been a supernova period for country, and
music that's left of center really gets obscured. I do what I do,
and I'm pretty comfortable with it. And I'll never get a lecture
from Danny Goldberg about how many records I'd sell if I'd tone
down the death penalty stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Earle has no regrets about the past. His one lingering
resentment, he says, is how his kids _ now 13 and 18 _ were treated
at school because of what parents and teachers read about him in
the papers. Likewise, he acknowledges a single thread of goodness
that's come from surviving two decades of self-abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have sort of a spiritual center now that I didn't have
before,'' says Earle. ``But my spirituality is real retarded. It
basically consists of `I believe there is a God, and it ain't me.'
It's simple, but it works.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   And now for something a little different. We are talking about
``Chuck &AMP; Buck,'' a film more loaded with originality and mercy
than any film so far this year. The Playskool resonance in its
title is deliberate. Buck, the film's geeky protagonist, is a case
of arrested development, a 27-year-old man emotionally stalled
somewhere in preadolescence. He's fixated on his boyhood pal,
Chuck, who has, shall we say, moved on while Buck has simply sat at
home replaying and replaying his childhood. When Buck's mom dies,
aided by a heavy cigarette habit, he registers no emotion. He just
moves on to Los Angeles, where he has quite a bit of emotion
invested because that's where Chuck lives. Buck can't wait to get
there and rekindle what he remembers as Chuck's affections.
</P>
<P>
   But while Buck has remained pretty much unchanged except
chronologically, Chuck has become a hard-driving music biz agent
with a smart girlfriend he's about to marry. He greets Buck's
arrival with muted enthusiasm, then makes it pretty obvious that
he'd just as soon avoid Buck. The latter's feelings are hurt, but
this only causes him to intensify his efforts to connect. While
Chuck displays increasing discomfort, Chuck's girlfriend is more
polite and humane, inviting Buck to several of their parties, where
it becomes apparent that Buck doesn't fit into Chuck's new circle.
Increasingly desperate, Buck takes most of his inheritance, rents a
theater across the street from Chuck's office, and pays for a
staging of a psychodrama he wrote, called ``Hank &AMP; Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Buck's thinly veiled view of his obsession with Chuck, and
long before it receives its one and only performance, you know that
something's got to give. Among the things that veer into
invigorating territory are the respective trajectories of each
character. Just when you think you know where they're headed, and
you think you have a read on them, you're pleasantly surprised to
discover that Mike White's screenplay is a step ahead of you,
dancing beyond your expectations for the characters. As White,
director Miguel Arteta, and the actors ratchet up the tension, you
know that something gruesome or something transformative is going
to happen, and you're irretrievably hooked. To not stick around and
see how it all goes down becomes unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Spike Jonzes' screenplay for ``Being John Malkovich''
have we encountered a piece of writing for the screen that contains
the unpredictable zigs and zags of White's script. White is best
known as a writer for ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Freaks and Geeks.''
His performance here as his own malfunctioning creation opens new
frontiers in geek chic. A large part of the considerable impact of
``Chuck &AMP; Buck'' also stems from the actors' spot-on success at
subverting our expectations. Just as dramatically potent as White's
Buck are the Weitz brothers, Chris and Paul (they made ``American
Pie''), as, respectively, Chuck, with his progressively
disintegrating cool, and a marginally functional actor named Sam,
cast by Buck to play the Chuck surrogate in his play.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, White and Arteta also make sure the women's roles
are no less faceted and engaging in unexpected ways. Beth Colt is
an important part of the film's success as the fiancee who reveals
unforeseen dimension as her patience is tested. Lupe Ontiveros, as
the savvy and pragmatic stage manager who uses Buck's vanity
project as an opening to show what she can do as a director, could
herself be the subject of a film. Director Arteta, meanwhile, more
than fulfills the promise of his 1997 debut, ``Star Maps.'' ``Chuck
&AMP; Buck'' is a screenful of freshly conceived, serendipitously
dimensioned characters going we know not where as they play out
their agendas. It's all we ask of a film but almost never get, as
it first makes us squirm, then makes us cheer.

<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ In a quiet little office on a quiet little
street in a quiet little city in a quiet little state, Les Blomberg
sits at his computer, driven to distraction by noise.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's the roar of jet engines over East Boston or the
rattle of motorcycles at a biker bar in Jerome, N.M. Recently it
was the rumble of the NASCAR cars in Loudon, N.H., which officials
at Shaker Village in Canterbury said is disturbing their historic
calm.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, it might be nothing more than a chirping pager in a
movie house, a street sweeper in the predawn hours, or a thumping
stereo in a passing convertible.
</P>
<P>
   No matter; it's all noise to Blomberg. As executive director of
the not-for-profit Noise Pollution Clearinghouse, he has spent four
years helping people across the country and the world to defeat
what he calls the forgotten child of the environmental movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the world is getting noisier,'' said
Blomberg, 38, who has a master's degree in environmental philosophy
from Colorado State University and who works for the Ski Patrol in
New Hampshire when winter snows quiet the air. ``All the old
sources of noise, the cars, trucks, airplanes, they're all getting
more numerous. And we're inventing new noise all the time. Jet
Skis, pagers, cellular telephones, car alarms. This all adds up to
one big racket that degrades the commons of the air for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Blomberg describes himself as a combination of Miss Manners and
Rachel Carson. Carson's book ``Silent Spring'' is credited by many
as having inspired the modern environmental movement.
</P>
<P>
   Blomberg and his five staff members field an average of 150
calls and e-mail messages a week from the frazzled and
sleep-deprived. They come from all over _ neighborhoods wealthy and
poor, urban and rural.
</P>
<P>
   Another 700 a week tap into the Noise Pollution Clearinghouse
Web site, which houses a massive library, as well as links to other
groups. Because his group does not advertise, Blomberg suspects the
Internet has been responsible for the organization's busy schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is annoyed by some noise,'' Blomberg said as he
fidgeted with his ponytail. ``They're just not the same ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Blomberg taps the organization's $150,000 annual
operating budget, funded by private grants and donations, to send
people a sound meter to measure a noise source. He sends sample
municipal noise ordinances for people to bring to town or city
officials. And now, with a donated $8,000 sound meter and digital
recording device, Blomberg makes occasional house calls, such as
his recent fieldwork at the Loudon raceway, recording the noise and
cutting a CD that can be played for officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If played correctly using the proper amplification, you can
really make people understand what hell you're living through,''
Blomberg said, raising his voice above the din of a CD titled
``Race Track Noise,'' which he recorded last week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some see noise as the chief complaint of underworked,
oversensitive, antimodernist fuddy-duddies _ a fact made more than
evident by the wall of critical e-mail messages that Blomberg's
organization has received from across the country in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Blomberg tends to attract critics only when he raises a ruckus
about certain issues. That happened this year when his group
released a study on Jet Skis showing that their engine sounds
constitute noise pollution.
</P>
<P>
   After the report was made public, the Personal Watercraft
Manufacturer's Association told reporters that the study was
unscientific, biased, and backward.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the time, critics tend to voice their opinions in
the form of e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you liberal whackos get a life?'' an e-mail from
Bill Stryker read. ``I guess you folks feel that any recreational
vehicle . . . that you don't use should be banned because it makes
noise. Why don't you move to a desert area so that nobody bothers
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Another e-mail message, this one anonymous, read: ``Why don't
you try and prevent real pollution? At least then you can have
meaning in your life?''
</P>
<P>
   But Blomberg sees his work as a matter of justice. Although his
office fields complaints from a wide demographic spectrum, most
emanate from poorer neighborhoods, often inhabited by minorities
without the means to pack up and escape, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Data collected at the US Census Bureau's Annual Housing Survey
appear to support what Blomberg sees. From 1973 to 1993, most
Americans pointed to noise _ more than crime, litter, traffic, or
municipal services _ as the biggest problem afflicting their
neighborhoods. Renters were twice as likely as those who own homes
to complain, and the demographic groups most likely to cite noise
were black and Hispanic, the elderly, and those below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an overlooked fact that one reason Americans fled
the city is because it's also a loud, hectic place where you can't
get any peace,'' Blomberg said. ``But I think the reason our
organization exists at all is because there's a growing belief that
we have nowhere else to go. The suburbs are loud now, thanks to
leaf blowers, SUVs, and mega shopping centers. We have to fix the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Blomberg knows from experience. About six years ago, not long
after moving to Montpelier, the Minnesota native received a rude
awakening from the city street sweeper, which made its run around
the historic downtown around 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was absolutely no reason for that in this town,''
Blomberg said. ``We only have two streets in the downtown. They
could run that thing at noon and it wouldn't be any different.''
</P>
<P>
   Noise was not always high on Blomberg's list of concerns. As a
child growing up in suburban Minneapolis, Blomberg went to bed each
evening in a home beside a busy highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a basement room, so the traffic didn't really bug me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was in his 20s that Blomberg first heard the sweet sound of
silence, while backpacking his way across the globe. At the top of
Mount Kilimanjaro, and in the jungles of Central America, he found
what he now calls ``natural quiet'' _ what the world sounds like
without human-made noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful when you find that,'' Blomberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Finding natural quiet has become pretty difficult, however, and
statistics from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics bear
that out. Between 1960 and 1995, annual air passenger miles
increased 538 percent, air cargo miles increased 2,256 percent, and
truck traffic went up 583 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation noise, Blomberg said, accounts for about
one-quarter of the complaints his office fields. That was a
surprise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first began this job, I thought I'd be getting a lot of
`neighbor from hell' calls,'' Blomberg said, walking down a
Montpelier street as a dump truck rumbled by. He paused to note
that the truck would probably register about 90 decibels, or enough
to cause hearing loss over a sustained period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that the neighbor from hell is usually the
government or businesses. When people are anonymous, they can be
obnoxious. That's why we don't hear a lot from people about their
next-door neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Blomberg sees some invariable, objective truths to noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When humans did their evolving, noise was always a signal of a
bad thing, like a baby crying, or a lion's roar, or a storm,''
Blomberg said. ``Now, we have noise everywhere, but our bodies are
still hard-wired for the fight-or-flight response, so what happens
is, noise gives us a shot of adrenaline and increases our stress
hormones. Basically, noise is unhealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   His only regret, he says, is that he believes he has grown
overly sensitive to the din around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too aware of it now,'' Blomberg said, eating a plate of
fettucine at one of Montpelier's ``loud'' restaurants. ``Once you
start this, there's kind of no way to stop.''

 &HT;    Solmen farewell to Sen. Coverdell
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Essie Foxworth had never met U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell.
But she was one of the first Georgians to say goodbye to him.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-year-old retiree from Auburn, Ga., stood lonely vigil on
the sidewalk, wringing a tissue in her hands, as the official
processional carried Coverdell's body into the Georgia Capitol
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heartbroken,'' Foxworth said. ``He just touched me so
much. He cared what happened to people, not particularly his
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxworth left home at 5:30 a.m. to be among the first of a long
line of mourners to pay their last respects to the state's senior
senator, who died Tuesday of a cerebral hemorrhage. The state's
congressional delegation and streams of state lawmakers passed
through the Capitol during a private viewing, while outside, a
couple hundred people showed up to honor the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Business suits mingled with students representing groups such as
the 4-H club.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they had never known Coverdell but were impressed by
his record of service.
</P>
<P>
   For 15-year-olds Danielle and Krista Olson, it was an
educational experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was an event we should come to because he was
our senator. We heard he was a good man. It's sad one of the good
guys is gone,'' Danielle Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   As the haunting notes of ``Amazing Grace'' echoed from a bagpipe
off the Capitol's limestone walls, a contingent of current and
former state senators lined up, two by two, to escort the
flag-draped coffin into the rotunda around 8:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   While Coverdell's career ended in Washington, most of the
escorts _ Gov. Roy Barnes, former Gov. Zell Miller, former Lt. Gov.
Pierre Howard and 12 others _ were among those who were there for
its beginning 20 years ago in the Georgia Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three military and police honor guards flanked the
sidewalk as Georgia State Patrol officers silently made the steps
from the street to the Capitol entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a handful of floral arrangements from donors ranging
from the Daughters of the American Revolution to the president of
Coca-Cola were among the sparse decorations on display for the
simple and somber ceremony that included no eulogies.
</P>
<P>
   Family members preferred a more private ceremony than the
elaborate viewing that drew more than 10,000, including President
Nixon, when U.S. Sen. Richard Russell lay in state at the Capitol
in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   They mourned in private in a closed Capitol before elected
officials and then the public were allowed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heeded (the family's) wish to keep it as simple and as
solemn as we can,'' Secretary of State Cathy Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is planned Saturday at 1 p.m. at Peachtree
Road United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors entered the Capitol, signing a guest book that later
was to be delivered to the family, before filing silently past the
casket to exit. Burgundy ropes cordoned off portions of the
rotunda, and police guards stood watch over the casket in a show of
honor to Coverdell, the former director of the Peace Corps and a
builder of the Georgia Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the Coverdell family has requested that
donations be made to the Atlanta Humane Society; The Shepherd
Center, which provides rehabilitation for catastrophic brain and
spinal cord injuries; Young Harris College, for the Paul D.
Coverdell Political Science Scholarship and Georgia College &AMP; State
University's Paul D. Coverdell Servant Leadership Program.

A LIVELY LOOK AT `COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
Compassionate Conservatism: What It Is, What It Does, and How It
Can Transform America 
By Marvin Olasky. Free Press. 272 pp. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush knew Marvin Olasky as a dreamy-eyed intellectual.
Marvin Olasky knew George W. Bush as the owner of the Texas Rangers
baseball club. In the early 1990s, the two men were brought
together. They did not talk about the infield fly rule.
</P>
<P>
   Olasky is the high priest of ``compassionate conservatism,''
which, depending upon your point of view, is either the visionary
philosophy or the deft slogan behind Governor Bush's presidential
campaign. And now, smack in the middle of the 2000 presidential
race, Olasky has produced a brisk little guide to the guiding
philosophy of the Republican candidate for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Olasky is a professor of journalism at the University of Texas
at Austin and the editor of World, a weekly Christian news
magazine. He is also a onetime fledgling reporter at the Boston
Globe. Today he is the chairman of the Bush campaign's policy
subcommittee on religion. He continues to be a prodigious author
and pamphleteer.
</P>
<P>
   His latest work is not quite a manifesto, not quite a treatise,
not quite a tour of how (and where) compassionate conservatism
works. It is, instead, a combination of all three _ readable,
approachable, and provocative.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it is an attack on the welfare state that was
constructed by one Texan, President Lyndon B. Johnson, and that
faces a new threat from another Texan, Bush. Olasky doesn't bury
his critique; here it is, right on the fourth page of his book:
</P>
<P>
   ``The major flaw of the modern welfare state is not that it is
extravagant, but that it is too stingy. It gives the needy bread
and tells them to be content with that alone. It gives the rest of
us the opportunity to be stingy also, and to salve our consciences
even as we scrimp on what many of the destitute need most _ love,
time, and a challenge to be `little lower than the angels' rather
than one thumb up from the monkeys.''
</P>
<P>
   Two major principles undergird the idea of compassionate
conservatism. The first is a form of federalism, one that prefers
private and individual assistance to government aid and that
accepts government intervention only at the closest possible level,
preferably not from Washington. The other principle is a belief
that religious organizations (the phrase you will encounter in the
news columns is ``faith-based institutions'') ought to be empowered
to reassume the positions of respect and power they had a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to look within the family first; if the family
cannot help, maybe an individual or group within the neighborhood
can; if not, then organizations outside the neighborhood but within
the community should be called on,'' Olasky writes. ``If it is
necessary to turn to government, compassionate conservatives
typically look first to municipal, then to county, then to state,
and only then to federal offices.''
</P>
<P>
   But Olasky argues that religious organizations, which minister
to spiritual needs that often are greater than people's material
needs, are best suited to assume the role of helping the poor, the
sick, and the disabled. And he contends that churches, synagogues,
and mosques engaged in social-welfare undertakings ought to be
eligible for some government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that religious organizations have special insights
and special success in these endeavors. He argues, moreover, that
resistance to providing funding to religious groups for such work
grows out of a belief that religious institutions should be
isolated completely from public money.
</P>
<P>
   Olasky points out that taxpayers have subsidized religious
institutions for years; after all, contributions to religious
groups, which constitute about half of all charitible giving from
individuals, are tax deductible, which makes such contributions a
government subsidy. Religious groups, moreover, usually don't pay
sales or property taxes, another public subsidy. ``Each level of
government has seen merit in such arrangements,'' he writes, ``and
the tax-exempt status of religious organizations has rarely caused
conflicts or jeopardized their liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the spine of the book. Much of the volume is a
travelogue, with Olasky and his son journeying around the nation _
through Texas, to the Mid Atlantic, to the Midwest _ examining the
successes of social welfare programs based on these ideas. The
examples are compelling.
</P>
<P>
   But the most provocative element of the book is Olasky's
interpretation of what the constitutional scholars call the
``establishment clause'' of the Bill of Rights: ``Congress shall
make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   Olasky argues that the primary goal of that sentence is to
provide freedom for religion, not freedom from religion. Of all the
debates of this presidential year, that may be the one most worth
having _ and the one least likely to occur.
</P>
<P>
   The volume includes a brief forward by Governor Bush and the
text of a Bush speech praising compassionate conservatism in
action.

FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So what if Peter Frampton isn't in a position to charge the high
ticket prices that some of his boomer-rock peers have demanded in
recent years. Frampton still doesn't like it _ and he's not about
to withhold his criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It blows my mind. I don't agree with it,'' says Frampton.
``It's called raping the public.''
</P>
<P>
   If only more artists, managers, and conglomerates (namely SFX)
had the same thought, right?
</P>
<P>
   Frampton is keeping his prices very reasonable by rock-veteran
standards. He headlines the South Shore Music Circus in Cohasset,
just outside of Boston, Wednesday at prices of $34 and $26 _ a
fraction of the $250 gouging to see the recently scuttled Diana
Ross and the Supremes tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a disgusting price for a fake show,'' Frampton says,
aware that Ross was the only original Supreme on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton is feeling feisty these days _ and for good reason. His
career is starting to surge again. He just released a new album,
``Live in Detroit,'' a surprisingly powerful effort that is also
out on DVD. He has a new ``Behind the Music'' episode on VH1 airing
next month. He has the ``Peter Frampton Anthology'' due next month
as well, featuring classic Frampton tracks, plus songs from his
previous bands, Humble Pie and the Herd. He also recorded two songs
for the upcoming Disney album ``Tigger Mania.'' And he has an
acting role in Cameron Crowe's long-awaited film, ``Almost Famous''
(due in theaters Sept. 16). It's a loose history of '70s rock in
which Frampton plays Humble Pie's road manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a pivotal scene where there's a table full of famous
road managers playing cards,'' Frampton says with a laugh. He also
served as ``authenticity adviser'' on the film, consulting on
hairstyles and fashions of the '70s, and helping direct the live
footage of the fictional concert band, Stillwater.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton's chief claim to fame was the 1976 album ``Frampton
Comes Alive,'' which sold 16 million copies and is still the
best-selling live album of all time. If anyone knows the '70s era,
it's Frampton, who first got to know film director Cameron Crowe
when Crowe, then known as a rock journalist, wrote the liner notes
to the live album.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton has had pronounced highs and lows ever since, enduring
record label hassles as well as stints playing for David Bowie (his
``Glass Spiders'' tour) and Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band. This year
he was asked again to be on Starr's tour, but declined because he
was too busy with his own projects. (He was replaced by guitarist
Dave Edmunds on Starr's tour.)
</P>
<P>
   He's been encouraged not just by baby boomers who are back
checking out his shows, but by a younger audience just getting
turned on to him through classic-rock stations and, yes, through
the albums of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there were young crowds last year, but this year
they're even younger,'' says Frampton. ``You've got 16- and
17-year-olds in front singing the words even to the obscure songs
on `Frampton Comes Alive.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Frampton, who now lives in Nashville (where he just joined the
Foo Fighters onstage to perform ``Show Me the Way''), is also
particularly excited about his ``Behind the Music'' special on Aug.
6. VH1 staffers conducted 12 hours of interviews with him and
chatted with his parents in England and with former Rolling Stones
bassist Bill Wyman, one of his oldest friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill was actually the first person to manage me and produce
me,'' says Frampton. ``I was in a band at age 14 called the
Preachers. The drummer was Tony Chapman, the original drummer of
the Stones before Charlie Watts. He was best friends with Bill
Wyman and he brought Bill down. Bill is very loyal. He had said to
Tony, `You get a band together and I'll produce it.' And I've been
friends with Bill ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Based on a captivating debut CD, ``Words for Living,'' not to
mention buzz that's building with each publication cycle,
anticipation was high for P. J. Olsson's set at Karma Wednesday
night. His blend of folk-rock with electronic beats and samples is
reminiscent of Beck and Beth Orton, and Olsson swings from ballads
to soundscapes to industrial-strength rockers with zonked-out grace
on record; unfortunately, the charm of his studio project was
pretty much erased by unbearably loud sound and a troubled mix.
</P>
<P>
   Words matter for a singer-songwriter, and Olsson's were largely
inaudible, with or without the groovy filters and distorters he
made generous use of. Keyboards, bass, and guitars blurred into an
indistinguishable wash, depriving these intelligent songs of all
the sonic and literary nuance that made them interesting in the
first place. It's a critical moment in Olsson's career, and a good
time to reassess his live show.

THE HARD WORK OF BEING TEEN IDOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teen idols are often called ``overnight sensations.'' True or
not, it's just the way the public perceives these unusual
creatures, who pop up on MTV as if they were hatched yesterday,
even though they might have toiled for years.
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync has heard the phrase, but will tell you strongly it does
not apply to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody hears about the work that we've been putting in the
last five to six years. Everybody just hears about the last year
and a half,'' singer Chris Kirkpatrick says of the Orlando-based
superstars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody hears about us singing at high schools for years, or
doing the national anthem at Orlando Magic games, or at baseball
games in the area,'' Kirkpatrick adds during a telephone press
conference before the current tour began in early May. ``We have
worked hard.''
</P>
<P>
   And the group is still working hard. Sure, they're being paid a
king's ransom for their work now _ that happens when you sell a
record 2.4 million copies of your new album in the first week, as
occurred in April _ but the long hours have only intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the downside of being in 'N Sync, Kirkpatrick says,
``We don't get much time to rest. Just when you think you're
getting a day off, you don't. We never get days off. In the last
five years, we've maybe had one week off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoy doing the tours, but if you have a day off, a charity
will want you to come by and say hi to some kids. Or you do your
own charity event,'' he says. ``But that is stuff you really enjoy
doing. And, mainly, we're doing what we love, so I'm not knocking
it. If you have to do it every day, then so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start out, you always have to prove yourself,'' adds
'N Sync singer JC Chasez. ``But now people are enjoying the music.
Now it's all about being creative and finding new ways to introduce
it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The way that 'N Sync is introducing it this summer is through
the massive ``No Strings Attached'' stadium tour (also the name of
their album), which uses otherworldly props, smoke bombs, hydraulic
lifts, lasers, and other goodies to create a kind of Broadway
theater for young fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concentrating on an interactive experience this time,''
says Chasez. ``This show is like 'N Sync interactive. There's some
really cool stuff that the crowd gets involved with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a special feeling to feel that you're part of the
show,'' he adds. ``When I go to a show, I always love it when
somebody stares at me or points at me. It's like, `Dude! Mick
Jagger just pointed at me!' So we're trying to make that happen a
lot in the show.''
</P>
<P>
   The group rehearsed hard for this tour _ from 6 to 12 hours a
day _ and the results were evident at the opening date in Biloxi,
Miss. on May 9. The concert was devoid of typical opening-night
glitches, as Chasez and Kirkpatrick, along with fellow members
Justin Timberlake, Lance Bass, and Joey Fatone Jr. put on a
jubilant show with enough special effects to keep the fans gasping
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync members dance so feverishly that they seem like a blur
at times. It has gotten to the point where Chasez even admits,
``Most likely we'll be doing a little less dancing on our next
tour. And hopefully we will have grown musically by then. We want
to do this for a long time. We'll be doing more writing and
producing, and as far as the shows are concerned, they will be less
dance-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be too old to dance this much!'' Kirkpatrick says.
``It's killing me.''
</P>
<P>
   Being teen idols, 'N Sync exists in a brutally competitive field
where people wonder aloud if the group is better than the
Backstreet Boys, better than Britney Spears, better than 98
Degrees, and better than all the rest. But 'N Sync doesn't
encourage such talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, other people make a much bigger deal of it than we
do,'' says Chasez. ``It's not something we're concentrating on. We
just do what we do, day in and day out, which is what we've done
from the beginning. We don't worry about comparisons. I mean, look
at baseball players. They don't go to bed thinking, `I hate those
other guys.' They just want to get up to bat for themselves, which
is the way it works for us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they're also aware that they have an image to uphold
as idols. ``When we get onstage, we don't run out there and
(swear),'' says Kirkpatrick. ``Or say, `This is the time we take
off our shirts, or this is when we moon the crowd and try to get
arrested.' We don't do that. We know we have an image to uphold _
and we try to uphold it to the best of our abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, they're also keeping an eye on Sisqo, their
somewhat risque opening act whose big hit this year was the
suggestive ``Thong Song.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make the show more exciting,'' Kirkpatrick says
of Sisqo. ``But I think he also realizes that his crowd is not 100
percent our crowd, and our crowd is not 100 percent his crowd. He's
a professional. He understands we have an image to uphold.''
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync, which has also taken control of its business affairs
(each member takes turns monitoring their business managers, for
instance), is now starting to think of long-term plans. At the head
of the list is making a ``high-school-style'' movie musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not pretending to be great actors. We just want to do
something fun,'' says Kirkpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, now that they've made it to the big time, they're
getting a firsthand taste of what being a teen idol is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stuck in hotels eating a lot of hotel food,'' says
Kirkpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get to walk around much,'' adds Chasez. ``We go to
malls occasionally, but they can get hectic if people recognize us.
Yeah, for the most part, we're stuck in hotels.''

OUTCASTS ARE LIKEABLE IN ENDEARING `LOSER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
LOSER 
Written and directed by: Amy Heckerling 
Starring: Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari, Zak Orth, Tom Sadoski, Jimmi
Simpson, Greg Kinnear, Dan Aykroyd 
Running time: 98 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari starred in ``American Pie'' last
year, although not together. And Biggs was nowhere near ``American
Beauty'' as Suvari became the rose-petal-bedecked object of Kevin
Spacey's sexual fantasies. Amy Heckerling's ``Loser'' plays A-list
matchmaker, bringing them together as two college students at a
thinly-veiled NYU. Biggs's dorky Paul and Suvari's smart, sensitive
Dora are such sweet, caring, trusting people that you hope they'll
get together, if only because the rest of New York will chew them
up and spit them out if they're left on their own. ``Loser''
doesn't quite rank with the films that bracket Heckerling's pop
culture high priestess status _ ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High''
and ``Clueless.'' But it's enjoyable enough, even if it's not as
original as the year's best romantic comedies: ``High Fidelity,''
``Wonder Boys,'' and the imminent ``The Tao of Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Loser'' has a foreordained quality. You spend a lot of time
imagining you can hear the pieces falling into place as Biggs's
upstate rube is shredded by his three rich, callous party-animal
roommates and Suvari's gifted but financially struggling coed
allows herself to be steamrolled by Greg Kinnear's smug,
self-infatuated prof, whose exploitation of Dora is by no means
limited to the sexual variety. He's even worse when she dares to
have a thought of her own and his fascist control freak side shifts
into overdrive. It's a tribute to Kinnear's innate likability that
he raises a character who could otherwise have been the film's most
two-dimensional to the level of the barely tolerable. The
manipulations of Heckerling's script are never what you wouldn't
call deeply concealed, especially when it comes to Paul's three
snaky roommates who kick him out.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they're through with him just yet. When they discover
that the university has found him a live-in job at an animal
hospital, they reopen their acquaintanceship with him, figuring
they can use the space on weekends for parties they hope will end
in date rape with the help of drugs slipped into the punch bowl. Of
course, Paul and Dora have begun to edge together, accelerated by
the chance to ooh and aah over kittens and puppies, but Paul's
three nemeses and Kinnear's slick but callow prof aren't through
with them. As the party animals, Zak Orth, Jimmi Simpson, and Tom
Sadoski are lively presences, with Sadoski hinting that he might be
the next James Spader and all three knowing just where to go with
the amusingly nasty dialogue Heckerling gives them. When Paul
enters their shared quarters wearing what is to become his
trademark fur-lined cap, one cracks: ``Did the producers of `Fargo'
have a garage sale?''
</P>
<P>
   At more than a few points, Heckerling the writer allows herself
a few easy outs. Heckerling the director usually knows how to
finesse her way around the the obviousness of her screenplay's
manipulations. Once Paul exchanges the figurative animal house for
the much more restful, healthful literal one, the script
occasionally OD's on warm, cuddly stuff. But the forces of
mendacity lined up against the couple are never more than
caricature-deep. The young lovers-to-be aren't so much menaced by
the prof and the bonehead roommates as by their own innocence.
Suvari and Biggs are pretty and sympatico, too, with Suvari the
more convincingly vulnerable one. Only once does Heckerling the
director err in her handling of them. At the end, when they move in
for the big clinch, we see them in profile and the characters'
innocence drops away, to be replaced by what clearly are the power
auras of two young stars moving up the A-list. ``Loser'' will help
them ascend.

PRIDE OF NEW ENGLAND ABOUT TO ENTER HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ After all is said and done, the Red Sox are
still his team.
</P>
<P>
   Proof of that will come Sunday when Carlton Fisk, regarded as
one of the most durable catchers in major league history, takes his
place in the Baseball Hall of Fame along with four others. On
Sunday, Fisk will become perhaps New England's most famous baseball
player.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Vermont and raised in New Hampshire, ``Pudge'' Fisk
spent his first 12 years in the majors with the Red Sox. After a
contract squabble, Fisk moved on to the Chicago White Sox in 1981,
where he proudly wore socks of a different color. But when he
looked back, Fisk found many of the same fans who supported him at
Fenway had stuck with him during his years in Chicago. He will also
have a great following Sunday, when record crowds are expected in
Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk may not know it yet, but he's going to be swamped by fans
from Boston, Chicago, and many other cities as well. An entire
generation of baseball fans has grown up watching reruns of Game 6
of the 1975 World Series. At least two million fans will swear they
were in Fenway that night and followed him through his dance up the
first-base line, and his home run trot around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Was it nice, Pudge?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he will answer. ``I hit that ball good. All I wanted
was for the ball to stay fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Why a Red Sox cap?
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to wear a Red Sox cap in the Hall of Fame was
never a difficult one. New England is still where my roots are. And
I'm a New England person even though I don't live there. I always
wanted to be a member of the Boston Red Sox. I've retired, but I'm
still working for them. I'd like to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Long before the Hall of Fame trumpets sounded, there were
stories about Fisk and his rise from a small town where his
graduating class at Charleton High consisted of 42 students.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, the Red Sox hired Jack Burns, a former major leaguer
with St. Louis and a scout with a good track record. Wilbur Wood of
Belmont and Bill Monboquette of Medford were said to be two he
recruited. But as Ray Fitzgerald, the late Globe columnist put it,
this is about one who almost got away.
</P>
<P>
   Burns had heard about a rangy 18-year-old catcher from New
Hampshire. He went to see Carlton Fisk play American Legion ball.
Burns found a game in Keene, N.H., and quickly formed this opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell the truth,'' he said, ``Fisk didn't look that good as
a catcher. He had a good swing and a strong arm, but he had a lot
of passed balls.''
</P>
<P>
   But Burns began to change his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an awful lot I did like about him, so I kept going
back. I saw Fisk play 16 times. They showed me a rock that Fisk had
hit beyond left field where the ball must have been hit 450 feet.
Anybody who can hit a ball that far, I surmised, deserved a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles were the first to give it to him, selecting him in
the 36th round of the June 1965 draft. But Fisk, who had decided to
go to college, was not eligible. The Sox made sure they would get
him the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   When it was learned that Fisk was not returning for his
sophomore year at the University of New Hampshire, Burns wrote the
office of the baseball commissioner to confirm that Fisk would be
in the June 1967 draft. The Sox took him as their first-round pick,
the fourth selection overall. The Orioles drafted infielder Brent
Nicoloff.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even today, some still doubt Fisk's Hall of Fame credentials.
Fisk didn't catch a game as a professional until 1968. Not
including 14 games in the majors, Fisk played in just 346 games in
four seasons prior to his arrival to stay in the majors in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fisk rose to stardom quicker than any would have
imagined. After a year in the service, Fisk joined the Red Sox
after catching stints at Greenville (S.C.), Waterloo (Iowa),
Pittsfield, Pawtucket, and Louisville. He wasn't considered a great
hitter, for power or average, but he was a take-charge player and
the Sox needed that type of catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 1972 season, veteran Duane Josephson, who appeared
in 26 major league games, lost the No. 1 job and never got it back.
Another veteran, Bob Montgomery, replaced Josephson briefly but
played in only 24 games. Fisk played in 131 regular-season games
that year and was selected to the All-Star Game by Orioles manager
Earl Weaver, who didn't care in the least that Fisk was not on
several ballots. It was that kind of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was brash guy,'' said former Red Sox teammate
Reggie Smith recently. ``But I have to say he was also very good. I
never anticipated that he would last as long as he did as a
catcher. He wound up having a wonderful career.''
</P>
<P>
   Said former Red Sox radio voice Ned Martin: ``He was always on
top of the pitcher and the game. He was a fierce competitor even
with his teammates. He caught every popup. He and George Scott
wanted every ball.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fisk could not be expected to keep up the pace of his rookie
season. He played in 135 games in 1973, batting .246. But he was
troubled by injuries the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the Cincinnati Reds won the World Series in seven
games, but after 25 years, people are still talking about what Fisk
accomplished in Game 6. After Boston tied the game in the eighth
inning on a home run by Bernie Carbo, Fisk hit the winning homer in
the 12th inning down the line in left for a 7-6 victory in what is
considered one of the greatest games in Series history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The celebration of that moment has made me realize how popular
baseball is and how it affects people's lives,'' said Fisk.``People
reflect on moments in baseball they can attach to things in their
own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's grown men acting like kids with sticks and
balls and gloves and relating it to something deep and meaningful.
It's still the greatest moment in my career. We were still alive in
the Series that proved out to be my only chance to win a ring. For
a little hometown boy from New Hampshire to go out on his own with
no path to follow and have this kind of success is outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the 1975 Series, the power-laden Red Sox were expected
to end the championship drought that had lasted since 1918. Fisk,
29 at the time, made a contractual commitment to Boston for three
years. With other veterans like Fred Lynn, Jim Rice, Dennis
Eckerley, Rick Burleson, and Fisk as a nucleus, Boston was able
average 91 victories over a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox failed to win the title and suffered through a
one-game playoff loss to the Yankees in 1978. Somehow, Fisk got the
blame for the failure to win a World Series. But the fact is, they
would have never have come so close without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my teacher most of the time,'' former Sox reliever Bob
Stanley said. ``In fact, when he left, I sort of went downhill.
Pudge was a great catcher. He used to yell at me a lot, something
my wife didn't like. One day she asked why he did that? He yelled
back, `Because sometimes he's stupid.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing you appreciated about Pudge was his strength was
handling pitchers and always keeping their minds focused on the
game. He taught me what I know.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The injuries
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the five years that followed that historic World Series, Fisk
batted .255, .315, .284, .279, and .289. He was now 34 and a
spirited veteran. By most estimates, injuries caused him to miss
the equivalent of six years of work, but he always found a way to
get back into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (injuries) started in Boston,'' said Fisk. ``I know I had
a couple of injuries that should have dictated I never play again.
I had my knee blown out at the plate and reconstructed. I hurt my
hand three times; a couple of groin injuries. I missed a lot of
prime time because of rehab.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I hurried back because I always felt that I had more to
contribute to a game than just catching a ball and throwing it back
to a pitcher. I always felt we needed direction, not so much
control. The idea was to provide positive direction and assurance
that what we were doing was the right way to win the game.'' It was
a way that I knew would work.''

The insult 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christmas came early for Fisk in 1980. On Dec. 20, he was a
member of the Red Sox awaiting a contract offer in the mail for
$210,000 for the 1981 season. When it didn't arrive until a few
days later, Fisk discovered he had stumbled into the rare air of
free agency with no compensation. Less than two months later, Fisk
signed a contract with the White Sox, with whom he spent the next
11 1/2 seasons before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   On advice from his attorneys, Red Sox general manager Haywood
Sullivan mailed the renewal agreement past the Dec. 20 deadline
deliberately, and Boston paid the price. Fisk appealed the
tardiness to an arbritator, won his case and signed with the
Chicago White Sox in a deal that was said to earn him $3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox at first blamed the Post Office, but the fans saw
through that. What was particularly disturbing was a claim by the
34-year-old Fisk that he had been told in 1976 that he could
renegotiate his contract if other salaries went up. Sullivan denied
such a commitment ever existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crushed when the Red Sox did what they did to me in in
1980,'' said Fisk in a recent Globe interview. ``I didn't want to
go. But once I talked to the Red Sox, I found I had no other
choice. It was like a slap in the face, and I wished at the time I
had some explanation for it. I grew up in that organization, and to
me it was a second family. Then you're told you're not wanted. It
was bewildering.''
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't have been. The $1 million-plus days were just
around the corner and it was well known that Sullivan was a
hard-liner who would rather reshape the club than pay high
salaries. Rice and Eckersley were exceptions. Fisk was not.
Sullivan was clearly unable to deal with the modern agents and
maintain a small-market salary base. (The club had been purchased
by the Yawkey Foundation a few years earlier for $15 million). But
the fans loved Fisk and his absence left a large hole in Red Sox
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wonder why they cheered so loud,'' said Fisk. ``Then
one day I realized they were yelling for me not against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rice: ``We knew his longevity would get him into the Hall
of Fame. But he had some great numbers to go along with that, which
put him on a par with all the great catchers, past and present.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fisk's Chicago days produced better numbers than he had in
Boston. Wearing No. 72, the reverse of the No. 27 he wore for
Boston, Fisk played with a fire that couldn't be dimmed,
particularly on his visits to Fenway. Fisk tortured his old team,
hitting .310 in 105 games. He had 116 base hits, including 27 home
runs and 67 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisk didn't play Boston every day. Much of his time in
Chicago was spent in run-ins with media and management. There were
many misunderstandings that left hard feelings on both sides. White
Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf and Fisk were hardly friends down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox reached the postseason once during Fisk's years in
Chicago. After winning 99 games and taking the AL West by 20 games
in 1983, they lost to Baltimore in four games. In 1986, the same
team finished 20 games behind, manager Tony LaRussa was off to
Oakland, and Fisk would begin to absorb some of the blame for the
team's slide. He found himself being assigned to DH and outfield
duties more and more. Chicago had three more losing seasons,
followed by winning seasons in 1991, 1992, and 1993. But the last
season, involved a travesty almost as bad as the one Fisk
experienced in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk needed to catch just 79 games to reach Bob Boone's modern
record, but he was getting fewer and fewer chances. And Fisk was
still smarting from a pay cut. The 1993 team was talented, and it
took some effort to put Fisk behind the plate. Once the record fell
at 2,226, Fisk's career was all but over.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever goodwill Fisk felt disappeared in the playoffs when he
was not allowed into the clubhouse as a visitor and got a police
escort out.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Fisk's name appeared on the Hall of Fame
ballot, and he will be entering with Tony Perez, a former Red Sox
teammate who played for the Reds in that 1975 Series, and Sparky
Anderson, who managed Cincinnati in '75.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, it wasn't hard to choose,'' said Fisk of his preference
of Red Sox over White Sox as he enters the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Would Fisk have been better off had he stayed in Boston?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I would have played with the same reckless
abandon as I did,'' he said. ``But I do think I was a better player
in Chicago. Maybe older and wiser. Certainly more mature. But
because of that moment in 1975 and wearing a Boston uniform many
don't even realize I played for Chicago or how well I did there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured Fisk will get a warm welcome whenever he shows up
in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware of the past,'' said Red Sox general manager Dan
Duquette. ``Others like me and John Harrington have worked hard to
see he is made to feel welcome in Boston, and he has been for
several years. He works for us as a coach in the spring. Perhaps we
can find an opportunity to do more. We enjoy having Pudge and his
family around.''

CROSSING THE OCEAN STILL A CRUCIAL TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think of the great American companies from the old
economy _ Gillette, Coke, McDonald's _ they all had one thing in
common: They made the leap from national leaders to world leaders.
By becoming dominant international players they were able to keep
growing long after their domestic markets were saturated, and they
were able to achieve a scale and a stock market value that
otherwise would have been impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But what about in the new economy? Which companies will be
global giants, and which will run into trouble when they try to
cross the ocean?
</P>
<P>
   The question comes to mind because a least a few of the hottest
American firms are getting a somewhat cool reception overseas.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is one. AOL has more Internet subscribers than
anyone else in this country, but according to a recent account in
The Wall Street Journal, AOL's track record around the globe is not
as impressive. AOL trails local competitors in Brazil, Canada,
France, and Germany, and ranks 10th among Internet service
providers in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every port overseas, AOL has run into home-grown
competitors backed by well-financed phone companies or media groups
with strong local content,'' wrote the Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm also has had trouble exporting its success. The San
Diego company has a cell-phone technology that it hoped would
become a world standard, much the way Windows has become the global
operating system for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past two months, South Korea said it might abandon
the Qualcomm system in favor of a competing European one. And
China, which already uses the European technology, said it was
sticking with that system for now. Qualcomm stock has dropped 60
percent since the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast those stories with the experience of EMC. The Hopkinton
data storage company reported terrific earnings this week, paced by
huge sales gains all over the world. EMC is the top storage company
here, in Europe, and in Asia, except for Japan. ``In Japan, the
local companies always have a hometown advantage,'' said Mark
Fredrickson, an EMC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   What's the lesson here? Money managers and analysts say there is
no one simple way to predict who will win abroad. But as a general
rule, the purer technology companies, those selling software or
hardware, should have an easier time than those selling content,
they say. And companies selling to corporate customers should have
an easier time than those selling to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are selling equipment, the differences among countries
aren't as pronounced,'' said Rob Joseph, an analyst with State
Street Research. Put another way, there is no such thing as a
French router or a German computer server.
</P>
<P>
   In many categories _ EMC in storage, Sun Microsystems in
servers, Cisco Systems in routers _ American companies already
dominate the international arena.
</P>
<P>
   On the content side, where companies like AOL, Yahoo, Amazon and
eBay play, the challenges are steeper. ``These are businesses that
can more easily be duplicated,'' said Mark Klee, co-manager of the
John Hancock Technology Fund. ``They are also businesses that have
some local character.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL has already encountered plenty of local competitors who got
there first with a comparable service. Internet retailers like
Amazon can easily be cloned. On the auction side, eBay has to deal
with language differences, plus different rules and regulations for
auctions in each country.
</P>
<P>
   The barriers can be overcome. Analysts point to Yahoo, the
popular portal, as an example of a content company that has
prospered overseas. According to Media Metrix, Yahoo ranks first in
Internet traffic in Japan and England and second in both France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo got out there before the others,'' said Barry Parr, an
analyst with Interational Data Corp., a research firm. ``They also
decided from the beginning that international was going to be a big
part of their strategy.''

<P>
   Investors looking for historical parallels might think of MTV,
an American business that has succeeded overseas by creating a
customized, localized product in markets all over the world. It can
be done. It just isn't easy to do.
</P>
<P>
   We don't pretend to know who is going to make it and who isn't
in the competition for the world. But we do know one thing: The
answer matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are looking at valuation,'' said Klee, ``you need to
know how big the available market is. By asking who is going to be
a player just in this country and who is going to be a player
worlwide you are barking up the right tree.''

FURNITURE.COM FACES DELIVERY COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Furniture.com's chief executive, Andrew Brooks, wants to
revolutionize the furniture industry. But first, according to a
leading consumer watchdog group, the Internet retailer needs to
deliver those sofas, chairs and tables.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 Furniture.com shoppers have complained to the Better
Business Bureau in Worcester, Mass. about late deliveries, damaged
goods and other problems. The bulk of the complaints were dated
over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinary number of complaints,'' said Barbara
Sinnott, president of the local BBB. ``It makes me alarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives with the Framingham, Mass. retailer acknowledged that
a surge in orders this year caused ``a few stresses in the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second quarter, there was dramatic growth in our
business,'' Brooks said. ``It was far greater than we expected. It
was far greater than our carriers and manufacturers were able to
handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com lost $43.7 million on sales of $10.9 million last
year, according to the company's IPO filing. So far this year,
Furniture.com's orders have ballooned to $20 million, Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company's call center has been unable to
handle the volume of incoming customer calls. Brooks said shoppers
nervous about Furniture.com's layoffs and the ongoing dot-com
shakeout also may have called the company to check on their orders,
causing even longer hold times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message would say, `Your wait time is more than 20
minutes. Please call back at a later date,''' said Angela Woods, a
Detroit advertising executive who has not yet received an order
placed in March. ``That scared a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say they have been addressing customer
complaints. Woods, for example, said she has been promised that her
glass table with mahogany legs will be delivered. In addition, she
said, the company has thrown in four free chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Executives say Furniture.com also has taken steps to solve the
internal problems that contributed to the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the retailer began working with a telemarketing
center handling many of its customer service calls. It also
abandoned a national carrier and has begun working with several
regional shippers with extensive experience in delivering
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   During the switch, however, the company believes several orders
were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com officials downplayed the customer complaints,
saying they represented a small percentage of the company's total
orders. ``Our overall complaint rate is low _ and it's low in an
industry that typically has a high complaint rate,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sinnott said she had never seen as many complaints in such a
short time frame. Even giant retail chains like Framingham-based
Staples Inc., which had $8.9 billion sales last year compared to
Furniture.com's $10.9 million, have not racked up as many
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com is among many online retailers that are slashing
costs and laying off employees, hoping that the capital markets
will exhibit renewed interest in dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the furniture seller announced plans to raise up to
$50 million in an initial public offering. But by spring, it was
clear that Wall Street investors had developed a distaste for
unprofitable dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   The company delayed its offering, which has been formally
withdrawn, and laid off 29 employees. Last month, the company laid
off another 80 workers.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Furniture.com's troubles, investors have stood by
the Web's largest seller of home furnishings even as they have
withdrawn support from other e-tailers. Last month, an investor
group led by (at)Ventures, the venture capital arm of Andover-based
CMGI, gave the company a $27 million lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   But industry observers have long predicted that furniture
sellers will have a tough time on the Web due to high costs
associated with shipping and returns, as well as limited experience
dealing with manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furniture is a very difficult commodity,'' said Barry
Tatelbaum, an executive with Jordan's Furniture, one of Greater
Boston's best-known furniture sellers. ``You need to be so
systemized. You need to have your back-end (distribution system) so
well thought out _ and many stores don't.''

MALLON'S SIDE TRIP PUTS HER IN THE FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. _ She may be the most famous athletic daughter to
come out of Natick, Mass., but after Thursday, Meg Mallon may be
the US Women's Open's most infamous woman. And the impish Mallon
could care less.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon took the opening-round lead in the 55th Women's Open with
a solid 4-under-par 68 Thursday at the Merit Club, giving her a
one-stroke lead over two Australians, Karrie Webb and Shani Waugh.
But it is how Mallon approached her round _ especially the 14th
hole _ that created a buzz throughout the course, among the
golfers, the caddies, and the United States Golf Association.
</P>
<P>
   She started the week hitting it ``sideways in practice,'' as
Mallon described her wayward ways, but Thursday, on the 14th tee,
Mallon more or less hit the ball sideways again. But this time she
did it on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon chose to play the 14th hole (par 4, 406 yards) by hitting
her ball down the parallel 13th fairway, which is separated from
the 14th by a large pond. And when her ball landed on the wrong
fairway, recalled Mallon of the merry scene, ``all the USGA ladies
got on their little speakers and said, `We've got a situation
here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A situation?
</P>
<P>
   A situation.
</P>
<P>
   For sure. Mallon's drive flew right over the head of Laura
Davies and shocked a threesome of former Open champions, Davies,
Annika Sorenstam, and Se Ri Pak, all blissfully playing what they
thought was their hole, the 13th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it right over Laura Davies's head,'' said Mallon, ``and
it certainly shocked them when I did that. They weren't quite sure
what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mallon was. She had played a practice round earlier in the
week with Pat Hurst and decided the best way to approach the 14th
green was down the 13th fairway. Ah, but with the advice and
consent first of Mallon's caddie, John Killeen. ``He's the star in
this,'' said Mallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hit it in the water (on the 14th, in practice), I had
hit it in the bunker, so I decided that going over the 13th
(fairway) was the better option,'' said Mallon. But when Mallon
tried the indirect route in practice, Hurst said to her, ``Meg,
what are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   But Mallon went ahead Thursday anyway, sent ``all those USGA
ladies'' scurrying ``to their little speakers,'' and parred the
hole. ``So I don't know what the USGA is going to do now,'' said
Mallon. ``I don't know if they're going to put a tree up there or a
row of (portable toilets).''
</P>
<P>
   As word spread and golfer after golfer asked witnesses exactly
which path Mallon had chosen to take, the USGA also was all ears.
The USGA placed the 14th tee to force golfers to carry the water
from the tee.
</P>
<P>
   Kendra Graham, the USGA's director of Rules and Championships,
said she ``was as surprised as many of you were to hear how Meg
played 14. I guess creativity is the hallmark of US Open champions.
I think it's ingenious. I mean, it just shows there are many ways
to skin the cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham was asked if the USGA had any plans to follow its
precedent from the men's 1979 US Open at Inverness when Lon Hinkle
took an unorthodox route with his tee shot. The USGA then planted a
tree, forever known as the ``Lon Hinkle tree,'' to block Hinkle's
route.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham said she believes the USGA will do nothing. ``I will
give you my personal opinion, and my personal opinion would be that
we would do nothing,'' said Graham. ``That's because I think Meg
took some chances by playing the hole that way.'' (Mallon's drive
had to go over a tree to reach the wrong fairway.)
</P>
<P>
   The 68 by Mallon, the 1991 Open champion, was scored in the
relatively quiet morning breezes, which freshened considerably in
the afternoon. Webb, who has been frustrated in four Open attempts,
was able to fashion her 69 despite the breezes and despite having
to wade into a pond on the par-3 seventh to try her unorthodox
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Webb had to take off her right shoe and sock, plant that foot in
the water and mud, choke up on her club, and swat her ball from the
edge of the water. Her magnificent shot landed 8 feet from the pin
and, after wiping off the mud that was nearly up to her knee, she
sank the putt for par.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back home in Australia, I have a place where we go fishing and
I have to walk through mud like that,'' said Webb. ``So it felt
like I was back home fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Also one stroke behind Mallon is Webb's fellow Australian,
Waugh, who is appearing in her second Open. And Waugh said she
learned much from her first Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in Australia, we didn't really know about the US
Open,'' said Waugh. ``I believe Jan Stephenson (an Australian) won
it a few years ago and I have to admit my ignorance, but I didn't
even know. But I've learned something about this tournament is
different; you see how excited the players are about the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Two strokes behind Mallon are Juli Inkster, the defending
champion, and Kellee Booth. Seven players finished at 71, three
strokes behind the leader, including Betsy King, Kelli Kuehne, and
Beth Daniel. All told, 12 players broke par and 10 others are even.
</P>
<P>
   Among local golfers, Carri Wood of Hyannis, Mass., ``was
thrilled and excited'' about her 1-over 73, which tied her for 14th
place. ``I had gone to bed (Wednesday) night hoping for maybe a
75,'' said Wood, a former Massachusetts Amateur champion who
carried her own bag in an Open qualifier that earned her a spot
here.
</P>
<P>
   Wood's score might have been better except her 3-footer for
birdie on the par-5 18th lipped out in the growing darkness and
drizzle. ``It hit a spike mark,'' said Wood, ``but I'll take 1
over. I'm very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the disappointing side, Sorenstam, a tourney favorite, shot a
1-over 73. ``It's only Thursday,'' said the Swede. ``There are
three more days of golf. I had a few chances out there with my
putter that I should have made, but other than that I am happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallon's 68 was her lowest opening-round score. And also her
most interesting, especially now that ``my little secret'' on how
to play the 14th hole is out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting to see what happens now,'' she said.

 A FEDERAL TAX WITH ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you believe the rhetoric coming off Capitol Hill, ending the
federal tax on inheritances would either: (a) help the rich get
richer, or (b) stamp out an unfair system that reaches into the
grave to tax the same money twice.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the gravitational pull of election-year politics, the
issue isn't so simple _ or polarized.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, quashing the estate tax would lower tax bills
for many but raise them for a few, simplify tax planning while
threatening the livelihood of tax planners, and give the wealthiest
Americans a boost, at the expense of charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public discussion to this point has been largely driven by
politics,'' said Neil Harl, an agricultural law professor at Iowa
State University and the author of three books on the estate tax.
``The spin hasn't had much to do with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the so-called death tax, adopted early in the 20th
century, may not survive long in the 21st.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Senate voted 59 to 39 to phase out the estate tax
between now and 2010. The House of Representatives approved the
same legislation by a 279 to 136 margin in June.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has promised to veto the measure when it
reaches his desk, which congressional leaders say should happen in
September. In its place, Clinton has proposed a partial rollback
aimed specifically at farms and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, we are on the verge of eliminating this tax, no
matter what the president does,'' said Jim Hirni, chief tax
lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business, which
supports the bill. ``The anti-death-tax push has gained so much
momentum that it's only a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's true remains to be seen, but there is little
question the public would like to see the tax scrapped. A Gallup
poll taken in late June found 60 percent of those surveyed favored
its elimination.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy, especially in regions such as New England,
is at least partially responsible. As stock prices and home values
rose in recent years, millions of middle-class families faced the
possibility of dying with a big enough estate to trigger the tax.
</P>
<P>
   One out of six questioned in the Gallup poll said they were
likely to ``personally benefit'' from repeal of the tax, which
experts say is probably too rosy, even in the strongest of
economies. In 1998, the latest year for which the Internal Revenue
Service has released estimates, only 2.1 percent _ or one out of 48
_ of those who died were hit with the levy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a pretty big disconnect between the perception and
reality of who is affected,'' said Steven Riley, a Florida
estate-planning lawyer and author of ``Generations: Planning Your
Legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, individual estates up to $675,000 pass
tax-free to heirs. Couples are allowed twice that amount, or $1.35
million, before the tax kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   By 2006, the exempt amounts rise to $1 million and $2 million,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers and owners of family businesses are allowed even more
before the tax takes effect. The basic exemption, for example, is
$1.3 million per individual or $2.6 million per couple.
</P>
<P>
   (The White House proposal would increase those amounts to $2
million and $4 million, respectively.)
</P>
<P>
   The IRS also lets farms subtract as much as $750,000 from an
estate's value to account for the fact that farmland is worth less
than land used for, say, apartments or shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is rare for a farm to be impacted at all,'' said Harl, the
Iowa State professor. ``I have been involved in this area for
almost 36 years, and I've never seen an instance where a farm had
to be sold as a result of the federal estate tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling the family business, though, is precisely what Cliff
Sjoberg's accountant suggested recently. Sjoberg, who owns a metals
fabrication company in Cranston, R.I., rejected that idea but is
still working with a lawyer and accountant to pass the firm to his
sons.
</P>
<P>
   When he took over the operation in the late 1960s, Sjoberg said,
his father simply gave him shares of closely held stock over a
couple of years. That way, they stayed within guidelines that limit
the size of tax-free gifts in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   But the current gift limit, $10,000 per person per year, is too
low for the 69-year-old Sjoberg to transfer the company in his
lifetime. And with the business valued at more than the estate-tax
exclusion, his family faces a whopping bill if he simply leaves it
to his sons when he dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see my kids take and work the business,'' he said.
``This idea of selling it because we can't afford to take and
handle the transfer is repugnant to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, many people with sizable estates avoid paying the
tax through complex planning, often involving trusts and charitable
donations. But when the numbers get too big, they typically have no
choice but to give up some of the assets _ or pay the piper, at
estate-tax rates that top out at 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hirni, of the NFIB, said that Sjoberg and other business owners
should not be forced into that decision, or forced to spend
thousands of dollars on lawyers, accountants, and financial
planners to deal with the tax. The NFIB prefers Congress's all-out
repeal to President Clinton's modifications, Hirni said, because it
would simplify business owners' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Killing the tax wouldn't eliminate the need for all estate
planning, of course. Individuals and business owners would still
have to decide how assets should be divvied up at their deaths, and
have legal documents drawn up to make their wishes known.
</P>
<P>
   It would, though, end much of the complex planning done
specifically to avoid the estate tax. That's especially true for
the handful of Americans with estates valued at $5 million or more,
who paid more than half of the tax in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   An unintended consequence of the change would be an estimated
decrease of $5 billion to $6 billion annually in charitable
donations from high-net-worth estates, which have traditionally
chosen philanthropy over taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Not every millionaire would save equally, though, if the death
tax is deep-sixed.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the current system allows a ``step-up in basis''
on stocks and houses when a person dies. The assets are counted for
tax purposes at their value on the day of death, rather than on the
day they were purchased. Heirs, therefore, are never taxed on the
often substantial gains in between.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system Congress has proposed, step-ups in basis are
limited to $1.3 million for individuals and $3 million for couples.
Heirs who inherit sizable investment portfolios or expensive homes
might face more in capital-gains taxes, which are hard to avoid,
than they would have in estate taxes, which can largely be
sidestepped with careful planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proponents of the (congressional) plan have sort of finessed
that issue,'' Harl said. ``For farmers in Iowa and homeowners in
Boston, who have a lot of wealth wrapped up in land values, it's a
pretty big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepped-up basis also plays a role in countering the belief that
the estate tax amounts to double taxation _ the government tapping
money it has already nicked once. Stocks and homes, which now
account for more than half of the typical estate, according to the
IRS, almost always include tax-free gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start putting these things together, and you realize it's
not a simple case of the world being better or worse without this
tax,'' said Riley, who teaches seminars for the National Network of
Estate Planning Attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Riley said, both clients and his fellow
professionals seem to be expecting a major overhaul in the estate
tax soon, if not its outright demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are just waiting and watching,'' he said. ``It's
kind of crazy, but a lot of planning is on hold until Washington
gets done with this thing.''

 &HT;    Solmen farewell to Sen. Coverdell
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Essie Foxworth had never met U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell.
But she was one of the first Georgians to say goodbye to him.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-year-old retiree from Auburn, Ga., stood lonely vigil on
the sidewalk, wringing a tissue in her hands, as the official
processional carried Coverdell's body into the Georgia Capitol
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heartbroken,'' Foxworth said. ``He just touched me so
much. He cared what happened to people, not particularly his
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxworth left home at 5:30 a.m. to be among the first of a long
line of mourners to pay their last respects to the state's senior
senator, who died Tuesday of a cerebral hemorrhage. The state's
congressional delegation and streams of state lawmakers passed
through the Capitol during a private viewing, while outside, a
couple hundred people showed up to honor the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Business suits mingled with students representing groups such as
the 4-H club.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they had never known Coverdell but were impressed by
his record of service.
</P>
<P>
   For 15-year-olds Danielle and Krista Olson, it was an
educational experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was an event we should come to because he was
our senator. We heard he was a good man. It's sad one of the good
guys is gone,'' Danielle Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   As the haunting notes of ``Amazing Grace'' echoed from a bagpipe
off the Capitol's limestone walls, a contingent of current and
former state senators lined up, two by two, to escort the
flag-draped coffin into the rotunda around 8:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   While Coverdell's career ended in Washington, most of the
escorts _ Gov. Roy Barnes, former Gov. Zell Miller, former Lt. Gov.
Pierre Howard and 12 others _ were among those who were there for
its beginning 20 years ago in the Georgia Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three military and police honor guards flanked the
sidewalk as Georgia State Patrol officers silently made the steps
from the street to the Capitol entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a handful of floral arrangements from donors ranging
from the Daughters of the American Revolution to the president of
Coca-Cola were among the sparse decorations on display for the
simple and somber ceremony that included no eulogies.
</P>
<P>
   Family members preferred a more private ceremony than the
elaborate viewing that drew more than 10,000, including President
Nixon, when U.S. Sen. Richard Russell lay in state at the Capitol
in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   They mourned in private in a closed Capitol before elected
officials and then the public were allowed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heeded (the family's) wish to keep it as simple and as
solemn as we can,'' Secretary of State Cathy Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is planned Saturday at 1 p.m. at Peachtree
Road United Methodist Church.

   LONDON-CULTURE _ LONDON _ Take a walk in Brixton. Four miles
from the gray postcard propriety of Westminster, Brixton is a riot
of noise and color. It pulsates with hefty bass riffs and reggae
rhythms dancing from knee-high speakers on the sidewalks outside CD
stores and appliance shops. In the borough's lively street market,
you hear the melodious sounds of Yoruba, Shona, Arabic, Spanish ?
occasionally even English. No less than Parliament House with Big
Ben and Churchill's statue, however, Brixton now is a part of the
fiber of modern London, a city rapidly being redefined by its
ethnic variety. ``Multiracial London is coming of age, and it is
this that is igniting such energy, buzz and creativity,'' wrote
Yasmin Alibhair-Brown, a columnist for the Independent newspaper
and author of ``Who Do We Think We Are: Imagining the New
Britain.'' (Roughton, Cox News Service).

   COVERDELL-VIEWING _ATLANTA _Essie Foxworth had never met U.S.
Sen. Paul Coverdell. But she was one of the first Georgians to say
goodbye to him. The 65-year-old retiree from Auburn, Ga., stood
lonely vigil on the sidewalk, wringing a tissue in her hands, as
the official processional carried Coverdell's body into the Georgia
Capitol today. ``I'm heartbroken,'' Foxworth said. ``He just
touched me so much. He cared what happened to people, not
particularly his party.'' Foxworth left home at 5:30 a.m. to be
among the first of a long line of mourners to pay their last
respects to the state's senior senator, who died Tuesday of a
cerebral hemorrhage. (Pruitt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH

<P>
   EDMONSON-COLUMN _ The Internet might be the greatest
communication advance since the invention of the printing press. It
could also be the unrivaled champion at spreading misinformation.
The most recent highly visible instance involves a group that
gathered about 200 years before e-mail: the signers of the
Declaration of Independence. A number of recent columns _ including
one by Ann Landers that ran July 4 _ recount what supposedly
happened to some of these men. The pieces are riddled with errors,
exaggerations and misinterpretations. (Edmonson, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ According to the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press, voter interest in politics dropped from 55
percent in 1992 to 42 percent in 1996 and to a low of 38 percent
this year. These dismal figures indicate that voter turnout for the
November election will hit a new low. This means those Americans
who remain active in politics will have proportionally more clout
when it comes time to decide who gets what. Nethaway, Waco

<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ Baseball survives in 2000, but a night at the
park is for Bill Gates. My guess is several million dollars changed
hands on enough beer to float the Queen Mary and tacos sufficient
to fill a freight train stretching from here to Birmingham, not to
mention peanuts and Cracker Jacks at $3.75 a pop. (Minter, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVEDMCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ One of
Dr. Sherry Wheaton's favorite quotes comes from Morris West's The
Shoes of the Fisherman. ``Reach out for the risk of living with
both arms. One has to embrace the world like a lover. One has to
accept pain as a condition of existence.'' After suffering serious
injuries from an attack by a German shepherd, Wheaton is learning
more about what it means to live them. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News)

   GAPACIFIC-future _ What's in store for the new and improved

proposed deal to buy rival Fort James and become the world's
largest maker of tissue products, Georgia-Pacific sent a strong
signal this week that it's heading in a new direction. Analysts
expect Georgia Pacific to sell a significant number of paper mills

   BASS-NAME _ Bass PLC may soon be changing its name. The

who'll play a cunning vixen this fall on NBC's deliciously campy

don't know why it took people this long to get it,'' Bleeth says.
In fact, Bleeth admits she's quite the naughty girl. She certainly

   TAX STRATEGIES AND DIVORCE, by Tracy Byrnes
</P>
<P>
   The tax implications of divorce spawn loads of issues, including
how to handle alimony payments and what to do with the house.
</P>
<P>
   Alimony payments are deductible to the payer. Child-support
payments are not. Some people paying child support may try to
disguise it as alimony. But if that ``alimony'' ends on a child's
milestone, i.e., his 18th birthday or the day he goes off to
college, the Internal Revenue Service will know that you have been
camouflaging your child support. You will then be required to pay
tax on all that previously deductible money.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of playing games with the IRS to mitigate your tax hit,
consider a divorce settlement trust, also known as an alimony
trust.

<P>
   The tax implications of divorce spawn loads of issues. Here are
a couple of estate-planning techniques to consider when pondering
how to handle alimony payments and what to do with the house.
</P>
<P>
   THE ALIMONY TRUST
</P>
<P>
   Alimony payments are deductible to the payer. Child-support
payments are not. Some people paying child support may try to
disguise it as alimony. But if that ``alimony'' ends on a child's
milestone, i.e., his 18th birthday or the day he goes off to
college, the Internal Revenue Service will know that you have been
camouflaging your child support. You will then be required to pay
tax on all that previously deductible money.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of playing games with the IRS to mitigate your tax hit,
consider a divorce settlement trust, aka alimony trust.
</P>
<P>
   In simplest terms, you put income-producing property (i.e.,
stocks, real estate, cash) in a trust and use that income to make
your alimony payments, says Seth Starr, a partner at Frankel
Loughran Starr &AMP; Vallone, a financial advisory firm in New York.
Because it's your trust, you can decide when the payments will end,
with no interference from Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you put $1 million in a trust. You mutually decide
that the trust will pay your spouse $50,000 in child support
annually until your child hits 18. You can then leave whatever is
left in the trust to your child. It achieves the same results as
paying child support.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, you don't get an alimony deduction for the money paid
out to your spouse, but it's almost like you do, notes Starr. The
money now is out of your estate so you won't owe tax on the
appreciation, unless the appreciation is higher than your spousal
payments. If you decide to pay your spouse $60,000 a year and the
trust earns $80,000, your spouse will owe tax on $60,000 and you
will owe taxes on the $20,000 difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an alimony trust with an estate-planning twist,'' says
Carlyn McCaffrey, a partner in New York law firm Weil, Gotshal &AMP;
Manges and co-author of ``Structuring the Tax Consequences of
Marriage and Divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, you've shifted the tax burden to your ex. So it's as
if your spouse received an alimony payment, instead of child
support through a trust. Remember, the receiving spouse pays tax on
alimony, but child support payments are tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   There are perks for the receiving spouse. A trust offers payment
security. The money is going to keep coming for the allotted time
because a trustee, a person other than your spouse, will control
the trust. So you don't have to worry about your ex-spouse skipping
town with your child-support money.
</P>
<P>
   Note: You may owe a bit of gift tax on the present value of all
your alimony payments when you set up the trust. But check out
Section 682 of the tax code for more grist on these trusts.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO WITH THE HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   You understand that your spouse needs to live there while the
kids are still at home, but you don't want to turn over the title.
</P>
<P>
   So don't.
</P>
<P>
   If you jointly owned a house and believe that you can sell it
for at least $250,000 more than you originally paid, consider
keeping the home in both your names. At a minimum, you deserve a
piece of the gain.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the home-sale exclusion rules? As long as the home was
your principal residence and you lived there for two of the last
five years, as a married couple you won't owe capital-gains tax on
a maximum of $500,000 of profits from the sale. Single people get a
$250,000 exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to a quirk in the tax code, there's a perk for
divorced people. As long as the home's title is still in both of
your names, you'll each get a $250,000 exclusion at the time of
sale -- even if you haven't lived there in years. So if the home
sells at a $300,000 profit, you'll each get $150,000, capital
gains-tax-free. Just make sure you have that written into your
divorce decree, reminds Starr.
</P>
<P>
   If, instead, you had fully transferred the home's title to your
spouse, you'd lose that ``free'' money. Granted, it's unusual to
own something jointly after a divorce, but for tax purposes you may
want to consider it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another scenario to ponder. It was decided in the divorce
settlement that your spouse will live with the kids in your family
home. But not only do you not want your spouse to end up with the
house, your intent is to leave it with your kids.
</P>
<P>
   So consider a qualified personal residence trust, suggests
McCaffrey. A qualified personal residence trust, or QPRT, is an
irrevocable trust that allows you to give your home away at a
discounted price. Basically, you transfer the home to the trust for
a determined number of years but retain ownership of it. The value
of the house is discounted over those years, so when the trust
expires, the value of the house is worth much less on paper (even
though its market value may be much higher). And that discounted
amount is what you may owe gift tax on. So when you turn the house
over to your kid, your gift-tax bill will be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to write something in the trust's documents that says
your spouse can live there until, say, your child goes off to
college.

England, the burden is in exactly the other direction: the
offending speech is presumed to be false, and it is up to
defendants to prove that it is in fact true. That tends to have a
dampening effect on what newspapers print and what publishers
include in books, especially when the material is likely to offend
someone who is powerful, rich or particularly litigious. By Sarah

 NOTHING IS CERTAIN EXCEPT DEATH, TAXES AND CONGRESSIONAL RACES  
 By CARL HULSE  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   WASHINGTON _ In a new twist on the
old saw, the 2000 congressional campaign is shaping up as a debate
over sickness and taxes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Democratic leaders try to position their party as the
champion of Medicare drug coverage, Republicans _ with the help of
some Southern Democrats _ are countering with a string of tax cut
proposals they think will resonate with voters of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just plain wrong for death and marriage to trigger
increased taxes,'' declared Sen. William Roth, the Delaware
Republican who chairs the Finance Committee, after the House and
Senate cut estate taxes and eased the penalty on married couples
who pay more together than they would if they filed separately.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP believes it has backed Democrats into a corner, putting
them in the difficult position of defending higher levies on
families trying to hang on to their inheritance and hard-working
two-income couples.
</P>
<P>
   Many moderate and conservative Southern Democrats are just as
enthusiastic about the tax cuts; a substantial number of the 51
House Democrats who backed the marriage-penalty measure hailed from
the region and five of nine Democratic senators who backed the GOP
on estate taxes were Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fundamental question of fairness,'' said Rep. Mike
McIntyre, D-N.C., about the marriage penalty bill. ``We want to do
everything we can to make sure we are honoring society's most basic
institution. This is one family-friendly way Congress can help
married couples.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bud Cramer, D-Ala., agreed. ``Marriage is not an excuse for
raising more tax revenue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats contend the tax cuts are too expensive and will
benefit mainly the wealthy when most Americans would prefer that
surplus dollars be used to pay down the national debt. Critics tied
the GOP proposals to the Democrat's key issue, saying the money
going for the tax cuts is being siphoned away from a possible
Medicare drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership says, no, we can afford these tax
cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of families, but we cannot afford
that expensive old Democratic prescription Medicare program that is
going to help seniors not have to choose between eating properly or
taking their medicine properly,'' said Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   DELICATE POSITIONING
</P>
<P>
   It is always a touchy matter when the death of a prominent
politician creates a strategic opening. Potential candidates have
to be sensitive to the community grieving a lost leader while
laying the groundwork in cases where time is of the essence.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty was never more clear than with the passing
Tuesday of Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga. With Democratic Gov. Roy
Barnes expected to quickly name someone to serve a brief four
months before a November special election, those interested in the
post had to quickly make their intentions known but be as
respectful as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights hero, was among the
first to go public, saying he would gladly accept a Senate
appointment though he noted he was still coming to grips with the
loss of Coverdell. Popular former Gov. Zell Miller, a favorite of
state Democrats, took the route of avoiding quick comment while
others expressed surprise at their names even figuring in the
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's death presents Democrats with a unexpected
opportunity to gain a Senate seat, but they must tread carefully.
An attempt to install a Democrat in a vacant Texas Senate seat in
1993 backfired badly when Election Day rolled around.
</P>
<P>
   SWEET SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   Even Mr. Reform himself isn't strong enough to defeat the sugar
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is arguably the
nation's most electrifying political personality at the moment,
tried a new tack in aiming to kill sugar price supports. He
proposed eliminating federal salaries for Agriculture Department
workers who administer the sugar program, effectively scuttling it.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate sugar backers defeated his provision by a wide 65-32
vote, reinforcing recent House action maintaining the controversial
program. Sugar producers were happy about escaping yet another
legislative assault and blamed large sugar users such as candy and
food makers for the persistent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THOSE PRIORITIES STRAIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Republican insiders are packing for Philadelphia and the
whirlwind of parties, rallies, parades and other glitzy affairs
that will swirl through the Republican National Convention
beginning July 31. But the Alabama delegation obviously knows the
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The packed day-by-day calendar of events issued by the state
party carries only one entry for Aug. 4, the day following the
convention: ``Begin campaigning for George W. Bush.''

 &HT;    Web makes it easy for errors to be perpetuated
 &HT;    By George Edmonson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet might be the greatest communication advance since
the invention of the printing press. It could also be the unrivaled
champion at spreading misinformation.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent highly visible instance involves a group that
gathered about 200 years before e-mail: the signers of the
Declaration of Independence. Several recent columns _ including one
by Ann Landers that ran July 4 in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
_ recount what supposedly happened to some of these men. Many of
the pieces are riddled with errors, exaggerations and
misinterpretations.
</P>
<P>
   Fact-checking isn't really my intent here. Numerous writers,
many on the Internet, have pointed out mistakes in the material. If
you go to the Web site below, I'll guide you from ajc.com to Web
sites with more information.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also not bashing the Internet. It can be a marvelous tool.
And, in truth, electronic communication isn't a requirement for the
distribution of erroneous material. The scurrilous and widely
disseminated ``Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion,'' for
instance, managed to promote hatred around the world almost 100
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet does make it easy for errors to be promulgated
and perpetuated. Landers' Wednesday column brought another example.
A reader's letter reprinted something she said she had ``found ...
on the Internet.'' It attributed a ``bill of no rights'' to
Mitchell Kaye, a Republican state representative from Marietta, Ga.
Kaye, incorrectly referred to by Landers as a congressman, didn't
write it. Kaye and the author said they believe the attribution
mistake began some years ago when Kaye forwarded it in an e-mail,
and a recipient thought Kaye had composed it.
</P>
<P>
   What I want to do is raise a red flag, for you as readers and
for us as journalists.
</P>
<P>
   There are two lines that I think every reporter has heard at one
time or another:
</P>
<P>
   ``If your mother says she loves you, check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When in doubt, leave it out.''
</P>
<P>
   We forget these at our peril.
</P>
<P>
   Picking material up from the Internet and printing it without
checking is like playing Russian roulette with five loaded
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is very conducive to the spread of folklore,''
said Timothy Noah, a writer for the Web magazine Slate and author
of several columns on the Declaration mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it gets on the Internet ... there's no stopping it,''
said Lewis Napper, who actually wrote the ``bill of no rights.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of examples I've seen more than once are Adolf Hitler's
supposed remarks on the success of Nazi gun control and the U.S.
government's alleged 26,911-word regulations on the sale of cabbage
(that one's been printed in the Journal-Constitution at least twice
in recent years _ in syndicated writer Donald Lambro's column and
in Q&AMP;A on the News).
</P>
<P>
   Although a Web site traces the stories about the signers of the
Declaration back at least as far as a 1954 Collier's article, it
seems to have been the Internet that provided a boost. Reading
through several of the variations brings to mind the children's
game of telephone, where a tale twists and turns from beginning to
end.
</P>
<P>
   Researcher Richard Hallman helped me look into some of the
statements. I also talked with historians _ what you as a reader
should reasonably expect from anyone planning to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation, historian Edward Ayers
noted that scholars can get a reading on the credentials of a book
by noting the publisher, the author's background, legitimate
reviews, the footnotes and sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no filter out there on the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what draws so many people to what could be called ``junk
history''?
</P>
<P>
   ``People,'' Ayers said, ``like to go for simple ... things that
are easily understood.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be right. But I think that if we get it right, we would,
more often than not, prove the cliche to be true: Truth is stranger
than fiction.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, it's the only thing that belongs in the newspaper.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Here's a tip: Appreciate a good
waitress
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I love good waitresses. If I had my way, along
with Mother's Day and Secretary's Day, there would be a special day
to honor good waitresses everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, not all waitresses everywhere are good. Here's a
couple of waitress stories, one good and one bad.
</P>
<P>
   Story No. 1:
</P>
<P>
   An older fellow, obviously a cafe regular, had been kidding with
the waitress, no youngster herself, since he sat down at his booth.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were they on a first-name basis, it seemed that they
were also neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've noticed you had a lot of company visiting this week,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Lordy, yes,'' she sighed. ``Too much, if you want to know
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   She was sort of an Aunt Bea type of the old TV show
``Mayberry,'' and worked her tables quickly and efficiently,
bustling from one to another with a friendly word for each
customer.
</P>
<P>
   But anybody can make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lookee here,'' the older fellow said, raising his voice to
reach her several tables away. ``I ain't got no spoon. I ain't got
no ice water. I ain't got no _ ``
</P>
<P>
   At which point she broke into song:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahhhhhhhhhhh ain't got nobody,'' she warbled, ``and nobody
cares for me!''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling grandly, she added, ``Do you remember that old song?''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she returned with a spoon and a glass of ice water,
he was still laughing, and so was most everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Good waitress!
</P>
<P>
   Story No. 2:
</P>
<P>
   A man came into a cafe at noontime, sat down on a counter stool
and, holding the menu in one hand and massaging his swollen jaw
with the other, considered the choices.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress, a younger, no-nonsense type, had her pencil poised
to take his order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just come from the dentist,'' he said, wincing as he
spoke. ``I'm not sure I can manage to chew much of anything, but
maybe an egg sandwich would be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   She shook her head and frowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We serve egg sandwiches only at breakfast,'' she said, her
lips pursed. ``You'll have to select something from the lunch
menu.''
</P>
<P>
   The customer made a groaning noise. At the same time, so did the
man sitting on the stool next to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, come on,'' the other fellow said to waitress. ``He's just
had his teeth worked on. He doesn't have any other choice. Surely,
it can't be that much trouble to fix him an egg sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   The waitress paused, thought for a half-moment, but then shook
her head again.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're using the grill for hamburgers and -- ``
</P>
<P>
   ``And you can use the grill for eggs, too,'' he said, his voice
a bit stern, his glare a bit demanding. ``Just this once, all
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Without a word to either of them, she whirled around and stomped
off toward the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``One ... egg ... sandwich,'' she all but yelled.
</P>
<P>
   The man with the sore mouth turned to his benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' he said, nodding. ``Thank you very much!''
</P>
<P>
   And he got his egg sandwich, ate it, paid his bill and left,
never knowing that the man next to him just happened to be the cafe
owner.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't have known, either, that the particular waitress _
who couldn't be agreeable even with his boss, much less the
customers _ would soon be looking for a new job.
</P>
<P>
   Bad waitress. Good story.
</P>
<P>
   (P.S. Observe Good Waitress Day every day. Tip generously.)

   DEATH -- THE ULTIMATE FREE LUNCH by Michael Kinsley
</P>
<P>
   Even by current low standards, the campaign to abolish the
estate tax has been remarkably disingenuous. It does not take
Sherlock Holmes to know that with a minimum of foresight and
offspring, and no fancy footwork, you can pass on several million
dollars tax-free _ not the official exemption of $675,000 (already
scheduled to rise to $1 million).
</P>
<P>
   But the most deceptive argument in the debate is that it is
unfair to tax the same money twice _ once when you earn it and
again when you die.

   &UR; BY MICHAEL KINSLEY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today's puzzler: The family (plus a couple of interlopers) is
gathered for a holiday dinner. Grandpa stands up to speak. ``In
this wonderful country,'' he says, ``our family has been blessed.
We have prospered. Our wonderful children have married wonderful
partners and given us many wonderful grandchildren. Your
grandmother and I love you all very much.''
</P>
<P>
   He then goes around the table giving each family member and
in-law (but not, alas, the interlopers) a kiss and an envelope
containing two checks.
</P>
<P>
   Question: What was the amount on the checks?
</P>
<P>
   Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.
</P>
<P>
   Time's up. The answer: The checks were all for $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egad, Holmes! How in blazes did you know that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elementary, my dear Watson. The two checks were the vital
clue. Why two? Because the law exempts gifts of up to $10,000 a
year, per recipient, from the confounded Estate and Gift Tax _ or
'death tax,' as the Republicans so wittily call it. The
grandparents were clearly attempting to take maximum advantage of
this law by issuing separate checks from each of them to each
family member. Inclusion of the in-laws merely confirms the
hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think, Watson! If Grandpa and Grandma do this for just 10
years, with four children, their spouses, and 12 grandchildren, $4
million will escape the clutches of the big-spending Democrats!''
</P>
<P>
   Even by current low standards, the campaign to abolish the
estate tax has been remarkably disingenuous. It does not take
Sherlock Holmes to know that with a minimum of foresight and
offspring, and no fancy footwork, you can pass on several million
dollars tax-free _ not the official exemption of $675,000 (already
scheduled to rise to $1 million).
</P>
<P>
   But the most deceptive argument in the debate is that it is
unfair to tax the same money twice _ once when you earn it and
again when you die.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the Friday, July 14 edition of the Wall Street
Journal, economist Martin Feldstein grandly calculates that if you
start with $1,000, you pay income tax on it, you sock it away for
30 years and pay income tax on the interest, then you die and your
estate pays the death tax ... the effective tax rate on your $1,000
is a shocking 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein calls this ``very unfair.'' And maybe it would be, if
it ever happened. Professor Feldstein has surely made far more than
$1 million over the years telling wealthy Republicans things they
like to hear. May he live long and prosper. But were he struck down
tomorrow _ possibly by the sight of President Clinton vetoing
Congress' estate tax abolition bill _ I bet there aren't many
dollars in his estate that will have come through a tax gantlet of
anything like 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that most of the accumulated wealth that is subject
to the estate tax was never taxed at all as income. Repeat: never
taxed at all. If the estate tax is abolished, the average
billionaire's billion-and-first dollar will be subject to a
cumulative tax rate of zero. By comparison, the very first dollar
earned by someone frying burgers at McDonald's is subject to the
FICA tax of about 15 percent (Investment income is exempt from
FICA).
</P>
<P>
   Tendentious comparisons of this sort are often dismissed these
days as outmoded ``class warfare,'' unless the complaint is about
unfairness to the rich. Nevertheless, taxing Dollar one at 15
percent and Dollar billion-and-one at zero percent seems, to quote
Feldstein, ``very unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason most inherited wealth was never taxed as income is
that it consists of so-called ``appreciated property.'' The
simplest example is shares of stock. If you buy at $100 and die at
$120, your $20 profit is never taxed as income. When your heirs
sell the stock, their profit is calculated as if they bought at
$120
</P>
<P>
   Stocks aren't the best example, though. The best examples are
the poster children of the campaign to abolish the estate tax:
farmers, ``small''-business owners, and people who have suffered
the terrible tragedy of buying a house cheap and watching it become
phenomenally valuable. When the owners die, not a penny of the
value of these farms, businesses, and houses has ever been subject
to the income tax.
</P>
<P>
   We can have a metaphysical argument about whether this is fair
or not. But it is simply wrong to say that subjecting these assets
to the estate tax means taxing them twice.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Feldstein claims that abolishing the estate tax would
actually increase total tax revenues. By cherished Republican
tradition, this Free Lunch Guarantee must be part of the argument
for any tax cut. Feldstein _ actually, the most sober of leading
Republican economists _ at first hangs a nervous little
``probably'' on it, but the assertion gains certitude with
repetition.
</P>
<P>
   So, how does he figure? The usual free-lunch argument is that
lowering the tax on some activity will stimulate more of that
activity. But the proposition that lower death duties will
encourage more people to die is both implausible and unappealing.
There's also the problem that a tax rate of zero will not bring in
any revenue no matter how stimulating it may be.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein, undeterred, tries a new twist: The estate tax, he
argues, encourages people to make deductible contributions to
charity, so abolishing the estate tax will make them stingier,
which will mean fewer income-tax dollars lost to the charitable
deduction. Possibly true, but I'd like to see the Republicans this
fall campaigning on a call to increase tax revenues by discouraging
donations to charity.
</P>
<P>
   As a special treat, Feldstein throws in a similar argument that
abolishing the estate tax will encourage rich parents to hoard
their wealth until the end, rather than helping out their children
in lower income-tax brackets. Another good one for the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa is right: This country has been good to most of us _ and
spectacularly good to a few. Is it really so unreasonable for the
luckiest 2 percent to pay some taxes on their good fortunes at
least once in a lifetime? Even if they happen to be farmers or
small-business owners or winners of the real-estate lottery?

 &HT;     UNDERCOVER `NEWJACK' LOOKS AT LIFE BEHIND BARS  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;    
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ What author Ted Conover endured to get the inside
story about working as a state correction officer in notorious Sing
Sing _ boot-camp-type hazing at the training academy, inmates
tossing feces and assaulting him, nightmare-inducing fear and a
paltry salary _ was only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing'' (Random House, $24.95),
Conover's grim account of nine months working as a rookie New York
correction officer (he remained a stealth journalist during his
employment by the state) is stirring controversy in
criminal-justice circles.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published in early May, is barred from inmates at
state prisons pending a media review by a staff committee at Sing
Sing, in Ossining, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Although Conover's book has been selling briskly and is in its
fourth printing with more than 40,000 copies in print, state
Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) spokesman Jim Flateau
said he has not read ``Newjack'' and neither has department
Commissioner Glenn Goord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares?'' Flateau said. ``Why would I be interested in the
view of a newjack?'' (The book's title is prison slang for a rookie
correction officer.)
</P>
<P>
   ``My book is banned de facto and I think that's a totally
indefensible position on the part of DOCS,'' Conover, 42, said in a
recent phone interview from his home in the Bronx, where he lives
with his wife, Margot, a magazine editor, and their two
preschool-aged children.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from other insiders has been less adversarial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty much on the money in his portrayal,'' said Denny
Fitzpatrick, spokesman for New York State Correctional Officers
Police Benevolent Association, a union representing approximately
24,000 state prison guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just talking about the book this morning,''
Fitzpatrick said recently, adding that he didn't have a problem
with letting prisoners read it. ``It took a lot of gumption just to
get the story. My hat's off to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good read and an important book,'' said Bob Gangi,
executive director of the state Correctional Association, a prison
watchdog and reform group. ``It puts you in the shoes of a CO
(correction officer) and helps you understand their fears and gives
a very human sense of who they are and how they approach inmates.
Ultimately, it's a very sympathetic portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   Gangi tried to take a copy of ``Newjack'' inside Sing Sing on a
recent visit, but was denied. Gangi argued in favor of allowing
inmates to read Conover's expose. ``It's not a subversive
document,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gangi said correction officers in Sing Sing told him ``the book
was the best thing that ever happened to us'' in terms of raising
public awareness and respect for a job that a veteran officer
described for Conover as ``a life sentence in eight-hour shifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Conover's enterprising journalism and resolve to risk
moment-to-moment mortal dangers in one of the most disturbing
labors in state government has been hailed by critics.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post said: ``The stories are spellbinding and the
telling is clear and cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times Book Review praised the book as ``compelling
and inescapable ... it proves his point, that everyone is
dehumanized within the world of our prisons ... a world better at
creating animals than at civilizing criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Conover and DOCS officials, who are portrayed in the
book as remote, disconnected state bureaucrats, continue to engage
in a battle of wills.
</P>
<P>
   Conover considered the fact that DOCS officials would not
cooperate with The New Yorker's fact-checkers prior to the
magazine's April 3 excerpt of ``Newjack'' typical of the
obstructionist behavior the writer said he encountered with the
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not our role to sit around and recheck his work,''
Flateau said. ``He wrote his book. He's responsible for its
content.''
</P>
<P>
   Conover said he tried to no avail as a free-lance magazine
journalist on three occasions to get permission from Flateau's
office during 1994-95 to shadow a correction officer recruit
through the DOCS training academy in Albany for a profile in The
New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here, basically, because the department had told me I
couldn't be,'' Conover writes in the second chapter of his book.
``The academy, they said, was off-limits to journalists _ no
exceptions, end of conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Conover is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine
and the author of four books, an anthropologist by training who
specializes in immersion journalism. He has spent long periods
inhabiting the lives of his subjects, which range from
long-distance truck drivers in Africa to Mexican illegal aliens to
railroad hoboes. He relished the challenge of piercing the DOCS
fortress.
</P>
<P>
   Conover sidestepped DOCS' media gatekeepers in 1995 by taking a
civil service exam. On the application, he used his real name and
listed his occupation as free-lance writer and researcher. He
passed the test and was summoned to Albany in December 1996 for
medical and psychological tests. He was interviewed by a DOCS
psychologist in Albany in 1997 and a few months later received
notice that he was to report to the DOCS training academy in two
weeks _ March 2, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Flateau said he did not have any recollection or paper record of
Conover's journalistic requests.
</P>
<P>
   Conover said he considers the DOCS response an attempt to wipe
the egg off their administrative faces. ``I think they're
embarrassed that they let me in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all officers, I kept a small spiral notebook in my breast
pocket for note-taking; unlike most of them, I took many notes,''
Conover writes in his book's foreword. ``Most of the individuals in
the book are identified by their real names. But to protect the
privacy of certain officers and inmates, I have made up the
following names for real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Conover admitted he may have been rubbing it in by sending Goord
a signed copy of ``Newjack.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office acknowledged receipt of the book with
a form letter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cold shoulder from DOCS officials, Conover is proud
that he passed muster with his toughest critics, fellow officers
into whose secretive subculture he takes readers without pulling
punches.
</P>
<P>
   After a recent book singing event, Conover was surrounded by
gray uniforms. Several correction officers posed for snapshots with
the author. Conover also has received approximately 100 e-mails
from officers on his Web site www.tedconover.com) and the response
has been mostly positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful, because it's all in there about COs, warts and
all,'' he said, adding there have been no threats of payback.

</P>
<P>
   Conover has not returned to the prison since the day he quit his
$23,500-a-year job, shortly after New Year's Day 1998. As a
newjack, he'd had to work New Year's Eve and he describes, in his
book's chilling conclusion, an apocalyptic scene in which inmates
set fires in their cells and tossed burning debris into the gallery
in primal protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he hated us, maybe he hated that inmate, maybe he didn't
know what he hated, but eventually the pile caught fire,'' Conover
writes. ``We felt the heat from a sudden inferno on our backs and
leaped out of the cell. Dragging corners of things that weren't yet
alight, we pulled the bonfire apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Conover walked out of Sing Sing for the last time in early 1998
without fanfare. ``Newjacks quit every day. It's just expected,''
he said. ``So many people are constantly leaving Sing Sing that a
lot of effort is taken not to become too close to people.''

 &HT;    SENATE PANEL APPROVES NEW VERSION OF OLDER AMERICANS ACT
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Senate committee Friday unanimously re-authorized
the Older Americans Act, a program that has provided the elderly
with home and community-based services since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new bill represents a modernized and streamlined Older
Americans Act, but it also maintains the very programs that have
made the act so important,'' said the bill's co-sponsor, Sen. Mike
DeWine, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's new provisions include the National Family Caregiver
Support Program, which will send money to the states to help local
agencies provide information to families about care options, help
set up support groups, provide counseling and respite care to
families caring for older relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes the Nutrition Services Incentives Program,
which will make it easier for some elderly to qualify for
federally-subsidized meals.
</P>
<P>
   First authorized in 1965, the Older Americans Act has provided
such services as home-delivered meals, in-home care, respite care,
and ombudsman programs to the elderly so they can live with
independence and dignity, said the committee's chairman, Jim
Jeffords, R-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been amended several times since its
introduction in 1965, and the current bill will reauthorize the act
for five years. The bill also authorizes a White House conference
on aging in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1972 we created an elderly national nutrition program, in
1978 we established a separate title in the act for Native
Americans, and in 1987 we established programs to prevent abuse,
neglect, and exploitation of the elderly,'' Jeffords said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we have taken one more step to recognize the needs of
family caregivers because they deserve a helping hand with their
tireless efforts and sacrifices in caring for their parents and
grandparents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donna E. Shalala, secretary for the Department of Health and
Human Services, said the department is grateful that the bill
included the caregiver support program, which she said ``will help
thousands of family members who are struggling to care for their
older loved ones who are ill or have disabilities.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Maite Costa-Medic is 27, Jean-Michel Poupart 29. And
in Maite's words, ``We are in love.''
</P>
<P>
   In love with each other. And in love with the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us share their dream: Pack up one morning, leave all our
worries behind and take off together to explore the unknown, to
immerse ourselves in new cultures and new adventures, to savor
every precious second until our last penny is exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, many of us dream. But for Maite and Jean-Michel, fantasy
became reality.
</P>
<P>
   The young couple's odyssey began last year in Nice, France,
their hometown, where Maite, who has a college degree in foreign
studies, entered a contest sponsored by a government agency. The
objective: Devise a project that promotes tourism in France and
educates residents _ especially children _ about life-styles in
other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Maite's proposal: Visit each of Nice's designated ``sister
cities,'' live with local families and report home through daily
e-mails to elementary schools along with periodic journals,
photographs and follow-up presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Her vision represented well the goals of the sister-cities
program _ an international exchange of people, ideas and cultures
in hopes that these relationships lessen the chance of world
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Maite won first prize. But the challenge was only beginning.
Nice has 26 sister cities, including Houston and Miami, and the
cash award would go only so far. She had to solicit sponsors and
make all arrangements to fit a limited budget.
</P>
<P>
   And it only made sense for Jean-Michel to accompany her. With an
undergraduate degree in journalism and experience as a special
envoy in South Africa, Mexico and the United States, he was
well-equipped to chronicle their adventures. Graduate degrees in
political science and law were assets, and the two spoke five
languages between them.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there was that not-so-insignificant matter of love.
</P>
<P>
   So last Oct. 15, they departed Nice. When they paused in Houston
in late June, Maite and Jean-Michel still were two weeks from
returning home _ and then only for an interlude. During their
travels they stayed one month each in China, Japan, Thailand and
Australia; three weeks in the Philippines, New Zealand and Brazil;
and two weeks in New Caledonia.
</P>
<P>
   They'd spend a week to 10 days in a sister city, then venture to
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   They had no money for fancy hotels. ``But the families we stayed
with in our sister cities treated us like special guests,'' Maite
said. ``In Japan, we stayed with families the whole month.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brazil, we lived for one week in an orphanage. It was a
wonderful experience: We speak French and the children speak
Portuguese, but we were able to communicate and share good times.''
</P>
<P>
   As for getting around, Jean-Michel said, ``We walk a lot. And we
ride buses. In the Philippines, we couldn't find room inside, so we
rode on the roof of the bus. We had to lie down when we passed
beneath trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of their favorite experiences were unplanned.
</P>
<P>
   ``One morning in China, we met a man on the street,'' Maite
said, ``and he said, `Would you mind if I spent a day with you and
just practiced my English?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And in New Caledonia, we went to see tortoises, and a man
said, `Have you ever seen sharks?' Before we knew what happened, we
were swimming with the sharks.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bangkok, Maite said, ``We went to the zoo, and after eating a
lot of unusual food on our trip, we were so pleased to see what
looked like French bread for sale. So we bought what we thought was
a brioche and started eating it. Everyone kept staring at us, and
we couldn't understand why. Afterward, we found out that the bread
was only to feed the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tasted good, though.''
</P>
<P>
   The only real mishap occurred in Brisbane, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a bag stolen,'' Maite said. ``All our pictures were
inside. It was sad. But we've been quite lucky. Before we left, ]gy

&HT;        GRAHAM: VEEP SHOULD BE ACTIVIST
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Anand Giridharadas  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (July 21) - If Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., eventually
lands the job of vice president, this much is clear: the veteran
lawmaker will be no potted plant.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Graham refuses to wade into mounting media
speculation that he might soon become Vice President Al Gore's
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   But in a brief interview on Capitol Hill today, Graham said he
views the vice presidency as a platform for action. The office has
evolved in the last 50 years, he said, leaving the veep not so much
a patient understudy as an architect of his own political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The office has undergone significant change in the last
half-century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Vice President Harry Truman took the White House reins upon
Franklin D. Roosevelt's death, he was famously unaware of his
surroundings, Graham noted. An aide is said to have told Truman to
snap out of his daze and act presidential.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Graham said, the vice president has increasingly
taken on more responsibilities - and also grown more privvy to all
the information, intelligence and strategizing floating around the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The modern vice presidency is characterized by access,
openness and respect,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   He said admiringly that Gore had taken the level of awareness
and action to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore pushed it forward by being given a series
of specific responsibilities,'' he said, pointing to Gore's role in
U.S.-Russian relations, government reinvention and technology
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he painted a picture of the vice president as an
informed activist with his own set of duties, Graham declined to
offer any insight into his own priorities, if chosen, or to
speculate about his chances.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about a New York Times report yesterday that
President Clinton has been plugging Graham for veep among close
friends, the senator only said it was ``flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't answer that,'' he said repeatedly, when the
questions got more personal.

   When you go: Creole Nature Trail National Scenic Byway
</P>
<P>
   Getting around: Driving the Creole Nature Trail's loop from
Sulphur, take Louisiana 27 south (Exit 20 off I-10) to Holly Beach,
then east to Creole, then north toward Lake Charles. An alternate
approach to Lake Charles is via Louisiana highways 384 and 385.
Eastern and western spurs jut from the loop along Louisiana 82.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights: The Sabine National Wildlife Refuge visitor center
is located south of Sulphur along Louisiana 27, which passes
through 10 miles of the refuge's eastern edge. The visitor center
is open 7 a.m.-4 p.m. weekdays and noon-4 p.m. weekends. A
11/2-mile walking trail is about four miles south of the visitor
center and also along the scenic byway. Alligators often are
sighted in the area, especially during warmer months. Call
337-762-3816 for information; inquire about usage fees.
</P>
<P>
   The 84,000-acre Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge is located at
the eastern terminus of the trail. The East End Boat Launch is
accessible for fishing and boating from sunrise to sunset between
March 1 and Dec.
</P>
<P>
   1; a fishing or hunting license or a ``Wild Louisiana'' stamp
(available for $5 at convenience stores) is required. Call
337-538-2276.
</P>
<P>
   The 9,621-acre Cameron Prairie National Wildlife Refuge is
located along Louisiana 27 between Holmwood and Creole. The visitor
center is open 7:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Mondays-Fridays and 10 a.m.-4 p.m.
Saturdays. Call 337-598-2216; inquire about usage fees.
</P>
<P>
   Although not directly on the Creole Nature Trail loop, the
35,000-acre Lacassine National Wildlife Refuge - at the edge of
Grand Lake and about 15 miles from the Gulf of Mexico - makes an
easy side trip. The dominant feature is Lacassine Pool, created by
enclosing a 16,000-acre marsh with a low levee. Up to 800,000 ducks
and geese have been observed here. The refuge office, at the end of
Highway 3056, is open 7 a.m.-3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   daily; some portions of the refuge are open from one hour before
sunrise to one hour after sunset. Call 337-774-5926.
</P>
<P>
   The Holleyman, Sheely and Henshaw Bird Sanctuaries are located
near the western terminus of the nature trail along Louisiana 82.
They are open daily. More than 2 billion birds use these
sanctuaries each year; for human visitors, much of the area is
accessible only by boat. A ``Wild Louisiana'' stamp is required to
bird-watch, bike, picnic or camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Imperial Calcasieu Museum, on the scenic byway at 204 W.
Sallier in Lake Charles, occupies the homesite of Charles Sallier,
an early settler for whom Lake Charles is named. Exhibits include
original Audubon bird and animal prints, an early-1900s barber shop
and an antique apothecary collection. Hours are noon-5 p.m.
Tuesdays-Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $1; 50 cents for children. Call 337-439-3797.

<P>
   LAKE CHARLES, La. _ The Creole Nature Trail, which loops through
Calcasieu and Cameron parishes of southwest Louisiana, is more
Nature than Creole. For culture, the first designated National
Scenic Byway on the Gulf Coast is a sampler.
</P>
<P>
   The region is part Cajun, but not the heart of Acadiana. It is
Creole, but not the cradle of zydeco. It's the Old South, yet not
plantation country.
</P>
<P>
   The natural world laps at the roadside from marshes, canals,
beaches, lakes, piney woods and prairies. Their mysteries and
subtleties can be gleaned at three public wildlife refuges and a
bird-and-butterfly sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the Nature Trail is a 100-mile U-shaped loop that
begins in Sulphur and ends in Lake Charles. Eastern and western
spurs that jut from the southern corners near the Gulf of Mexico
increase the trail's length to 180 miles, but some travelers may
find them to be too out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Those accustomed to panoramic horizons can breeze the 100-mile
loop in mere hours. Other than the wildlife centers, there are no
official rest stations or learning centers to distract you. Only a
handful of small towns beg your pause. You can drive the route
visiting two refuges in a not-so-hectic day trip.
</P>
<P>
   By slowing down, however, you begin to absorb the rhythms of
this watery tableau. Take three days, and fleeting impressions will
spin into focus, clarifying a land and its people.
</P>
<P>
   WEST LOOP: ``They won't bother you. He's just swimming around.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading south from Sulphur on Louisiana 27, the coastal prairie
frays into the marshland at the Cameron Parish line. Sunlight
shatters and refracts on backwaters sunk into the horizon. Leon
Redbone is drawling Up the Lazy River on the car radio.
</P>
<P>
   This is the outback; elevation: pretty darn low.
</P>
<P>
   In the roadside canal, or ``road ditch,'' Hilton and Mabel Boyer
(Boy-AY) of Lafayette are crabbing the afternoon away. Using fresh
shrimp as bait, they've almost filled a bucket with blue crabs.
</P>
<P>
   In season the Boyers also catch catfish, gar, flounder, speckled
trout and reds in these waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what, we do like fish,'' Hilton says. ``Seafood is
healthy for a person.''
</P>
<P>
   One weekend an alligator jumped on this bank and snacked
impolitely on the Boyers' nice picnic basket of chicken legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened its mouth that big,'' Mabel says, eyes wide, arms
spread. ``Big one like this, you think it never come on the ground,
but they can do it fast and catch a bite. Ooh-wee.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, by Second Bayou Bridge, Moses Taylor of Lake
Charles points out a gator lurking near the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't bother you,'' he says casually, as if it were a
common yard lizard. ``He's just swimming around.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is here to catch shrimp. He uses a cast (or throw) net
legally not exceeding 6 feet. When tossed, it opens like a
parachute.
</P>
<P>
   The legal limit is 5 gallons, or 25 pounds, and in the
capricious cycle of shrimping, this is a good year, he says. ``They
runnin' good.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a drought-stricken region where even the water is thirsty,
the air grows dense and scuds over the lowlands in ragged, metallic
clouds. Now it's rising, releasing a warm, healing rain. Shrimpers
scattered along the canal are too preoccupied to pay heed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is the Sabine National Wildlife Refuge, established in
1937 to preserve a stretch of coastal wetlands for wintering and
migrating waterfowl from the Mississippi and Central flyways. This
marshland is huge, linking Calcasieu Lake on the east with Sabine
Lake at the Texas border.
</P>
<P>
   Marshland is formed by impenetrable clay soils that keep water
from draining. In a setting where changes in elevation are measured
in inches, a marsh is slightly lower than the surrounding prairie.
A 1.5-mile walkway penetrates the marsh, but in warm weather beware
of mosquitoes and dive-bombing deerflies. Wear long sleeves and
pants or slather on the people's choice: Avon Skin So Soft.
</P>
<P>
   The reward is in seeing turtles, rabbits, muskrat, nutria,
raccoons and, in season, any of 250 species of birds. And leash
your dog, for gators love a picnic.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH LOOP: ``You put a little roux in there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooh wee, they had a racket last week,'' Mabel Hilton had said
of Holly Beach on Memorial Day weekend. ``All day. All night. They
play that boom-boom music, the kids, they had big stereos in the
back of their trucks. Those windows were shaking, hmmm, hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this weekend should be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   On a hung-over Sunday morning the kids are already blasting
boom-boom music, firing up barbecue grills and drinking beer.
</P>
<P>
   Bumper sticker: ``Work is for people who can't fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Holly Beach is a salty, unincorporated enclave of weathered
shacks, rusted trailers and crooked cabins on a milelong grid of
narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   The speed limit is 15 mph, like driving in a permanent school
zone. Like being in your own movie. This is the edge of America and
thus it feels; Key West should be so rustic.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's patrols are visible, but the ambience is basically
self-regulated, the locals say, by a simple code: Don't act stupid.

   MONKEY-FLAP (New York) _ In the 20 years since Roman and Inna

   &UR; LAKE CHARLES, La.: x x x act stupid. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And no glass on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Decorum is ensured by the stability of old-line families, many
of them Cajun.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come here with families to relax, let their kids swim,
catch crabs,'' says Elrick Taylor, who owns the Holly Beach Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Elrick and his wife, Betty, hail from near Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born a Cajun; I'm gonna die a Cajun,'' he says. ``I'm
proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   We enjoy living. If you don't stop and smell the roses, what's
it worth to you? I hope one day I get rich, but if I don't I know
I've lived a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   When they were raising five children, Holly Beach was the only
vacation the Taylors could afford. Then they dreamed: Let's buy a
business and not leave. Ten years ago Elrick kissed his insurance
career goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is the busy season. Winter brings oil workers.
Regardless, Holly Beach is hardly the Cajun Riviera, as it so
claimed before an annual festival of that name went broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it did 40, 50 years ago,'' Taylor says.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor leans back in the morning shade; Cajun tunes squawk on
with fiddle and accordion over the speaker. Not much to do; no
one's checking in at this point. In the afternoon he'll follow the
shadows across the street to Edward and Linda Hebert's fixit
garage, where they'll chat up fishing and such and pass comment on
the flesh-baring, lobster-red beach crowd lugging 12-packs out of
the T&AMP;T Market.
</P>
<P>
   The Heberts (AY-bears) met long ago at a dance at the Four
Corner Bar, now closed. He fished for a living and paved county
roads with oyster shells. Then they opened a gas station. Today
they'll sell you a part or fix a flat. Mostly, they sit.
</P>
<P>
   Their sons are commercial fishermen, but a ban on gill netting,
supported by sportsmen claiming overfished waters, has hurt, Taylor
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame what they done to the fisherman. They don't
realize how many lives they're affecting. You used to be able to
catch thousands of pounds of flounder, sell that for $2 a pound.
You could make some money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heberts fish for food, and Linda's ``gar balls,'' fashioned
from the maligned garfish, are legendary around here. This, she
says, is the secret:``You take your fish, and you grind it up. I
use boiled potatoes; some people use bread. They have to be real
potatoes, not that instant kind.
</P>
<P>
   You mix that up in there with that fish with all your
seasonings, onions, bell peppers, celery, salt and pepper. You mix
it up real good, and you form yourself a little patty, like a
meatball, and you mash it flat, not too flat, about that thick, and
fry it in hot grease.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, ``You make a tomato gravy. You smother your tomatoes down,
and you put a little roux in there to thicken your gravy, with your
onions and parsley and green onions and celery and bell peppers.
And then you mix that with your seasoning, and then you drop your
little patties of fish in there, and you put that on rice.''
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon the barbecues are snuffed and the Sunday exodus
is on.
</P>
<P>
   Several blocks from the carefree, sunshiny beach is the Daiquiri
Days' Bar &AMP; Grill, a Confederate emblem in front. Inside it is
dark, and two men sit over beers. Tom is 47, Herman 51. They are
angry. Politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers. Blacks. Taxes. Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daddy told me when I was a young kid that in my lifetime
I'll see another Civil War,'' Herman says. ``I believe it's headed
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we're gonna have a revolution,'' Tom replies. ``It's
comin'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It better hurry up and happen, I'm getting a little older all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Late afternoon, only ghosts and oldtimers remain in Holly Beach.
In shadow's length the Gulf looks muddy - swollen with silt, locals
claim, by dredging 10 miles up the coast by the Army Corps of
Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   No one here is very proud of that water.
</P>
<P>
   Pyramids of slimy seaweed raked from the surf line the beach
like rusted sculptures. A lone vehicle trolls for parties past,
leaving tread marks in the sand. Empty beer cans glint off the
crimson sunset. A soft breeze skates in off the sea. A black alley
cat pads under the vapor lights of Porpoise Avenue, poking for
skeletons from the deep.
</P>
<P>
   Another sundown, another weekend gone.
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN SPUR:``We're destroying what was an abundant way of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The air smells like boiled cabbage on the approach to the
Cameron Ferry that crosses the Calcasieu Ship Channel. Dark columns
discharge from the Omega Protein plant.
</P>
<P>
   Sign at the ferry landing: ``Trucks hauling flammables must
cross separately.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many outsiders speak fondly of industrial Cameron, but there
are reasons to stop. Fresh- and saltwater fishing abound, and
deep-sea charters may be arranged. The Cameron courthouse dates
from 1937, and its walls whisper of the time in 1957 when it
sheltered hundreds from Audrey, the last direct hurricane.
Historical homes grace some neighborhoods, and on Monkey Island,
the dead from both sides lay buried as a result of an 1864 Civil
War naval battle.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve miles east you can veer left to Lake Charles or head
straight out a lonely spur to the Vermilion Parish line. Straddling
a chenier plain, a sandy, tree-covered ridge paralleling the coast,
Louisiana 82 ducks under moss-covered trees toward the Rockefeller
State Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Sabine and Cameron Prairie refuges, Rockefeller is a
``scientific site.'' A small visitor center at the refuge office is
open year-round, and a boat launch is open March 1-Dec. 1 for
fishing, crabbing and alligator sightings.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby Grand Chenier is basically a grocery, and inside you
might come across lifelong resident Teddy Broussard.
</P>
<P>
   Broussard, 53, is not overly optimistic about southern Cameron
Parish.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is stagnant, still top-heavy in oil and fishing. The
freshwater marshes are messed up, contaminated, he asserts, by Lake
Charles processing and chemical plants and by saltwater flowing
inland from the ship channel. Salt kills plants, eroding the soil
and transforming fertile marshes into open water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a lot of silting problems, a lot of salinity,
things that normally would be as God created it and would take care
of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But the environment can't repair itself, he says, due to
over-engineering. Ship channels, dredging, weirs, levees and
impoundments have remade the coastline in the government's image.

something isn't done in the very near future we're gonna lose what
we got.''

   EAST LOOP: ``Them mosquitoes eat you alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Northbound on Louisiana 27 from Creole, the Intracoastal
Waterway Bridge has a bird's-eye view of marshland lapping the
prairie, as if the waterway divided a neighborhood in half.
</P>
<P>
   Just beyond the bridge is Cameron Prairie National Wildlife
Refuge, a birder's paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Waterfowl and raptors migrate from the north to spend the winter
here.
</P>
<P>
   In May, roseate spoonbills and egrets begin nesting. Tropical
birds arrive for the summer from the Caribbean. Shorebirds are
abundant on the mud flats in late summer, and in the fall
blue-winged teal populations are peaking.
</P>
<P>
   A footbridge over a moat near the visitor center offers, in
season, an opportunity to see gators. Not exactly in the wild, but
a gator's a gator. Inside the center are displays detailing the
region's ecology and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Toward Lake Charles it's cattle and rice country, though sugar
cane, called the ``lazy man's crop'' because it can't be rotated,
has moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar is cheap. Doesn't make a man money.
</P>
<P>
   It is Saturday morning at the Holmwood Grocery _ the sign says
``Beer, Boudin and Cold Worms'' - and in front a young lady is
tending the register. The men are around the corner, in the back
where the bar happens to be, discussing the day's fishing
expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam got him a case of beer. Barry got a case of beer. Shep got
a case of beer. Let's see, Aaron got a case; Barry's girlfriend got
a 12-pack; and Billy Joe got half a keg of beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody hoots.
</P>
<P>
   The grocery has been in the Natali family for two generations.
In segregation days the barroom was divided in half by a wall.
Blacks used the other side, says Entienne ``Jackie'' Lognion, 66.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could only see 'em through that mirror (over the backbar).
You wanted to talk to one of the blacks, you had to talk through
the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all friendly. We'd buy liquor and go sit outside and
drink with 'em. It's hard to hate somebody you work side by side
all day long with. He's human. Got a heart just like us. You needed
help, shoot, about six of 'em would give you a hand. Best people in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the bar Steve Natali, groggy from allergy medication,
rests his head on the counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the hives,'' he manages. Tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah right, tomatoes, somebody retorts. ``It's the fish. He ate
40 pieces of fish last night. No wonder you breakin' out.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he did cook four batches, Natali acknowledges. ``Everybody
was outside; all of a sudden, just out of the blue, boy, the
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Them mosquitoes were so little you couldn't see 'em on your leg.
Eat you alive. I tell you what, I'm fryin' a lot of them with my
french fries.''
</P>
<P>
   Get some Cajuns in a bar and soon enough they're talking food.
They'll rhapsodize over butter pickles like they were communion
wafers. Bologna? Filet mignon. ``He starts slicing that bologna;
you get them big onions, goes to slicing them onions ... that man
was happy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lemme tell ya,'' the fellow in the corner says, ``there's two
things he likes _ watermelon and boiled crabs. I say `likes,' but
he'll whip your butt for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Already in May the gardens are producing. Lognion shows off a
cucumber the size of a football.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a squash,'' one of the men says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a squash; that's a cucumber. Cross my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Piggly Wiggly's got boudin,'' someone announces.
</P>
<P>
   Lognion turns to a visitor. ``They make (boudin) all over around
here.
</P>
<P>
   But order it spicy. Down here in southern Louisiana, if it ain't
spicy, people don't mess with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Natali, back among the living, is talking mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love mushrooms in my gumbo. Take some of those portobello
mushrooms, slice a big ol' bunch of 'em, put 'em in with a little
butter. Smother 'em. Unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to pick them pink ones,'' Lognion advises.
``You get a high. You won't remember nothin'. But them kids, after
a rain, they go to the piney woods and get 'em for dope, boil 'em,
drink that juice, put your lights out. One kid died from it; that
fad there kinda changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lognion's father farmed rice, and during the Depression the
grain kept his family alive. Jackie eats it almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get some gravy, you know, gosh darn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't eat rice,'' the man seated beside him confesses. ``I
hauled so much rice, I'm mad at it. You don't need rice to eat
gumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what? Did I hear you straight? Jackie wants to know. ``Me, I
got to have rice in that gumbo ...''

TEENS WITHOUT SUMMER JOBS ARE MISSING OUT ON LESSONS OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NORMA J. SHATTUCK  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Freed from the classroom, record numbers of
teenagers are blowing off the old American tradition of taking a
menial summer job.
</P>
<P>
   A Georgetown University junior was quoted in an Associated Press
article as saying: ``I know it sounds arrogant, but my time is
worth more than $8 or $10 an hour . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Indulgent, affluent parents are backing their kids' choices to
be summertime sloths. Other teenagers may deign to take jobs, the
AP article said. But ``not in low-paid and mind-numbing wage
slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   In my late teens and early 20s, I too felt deserving of
dignified, rarified summer employment. Still, I found myself
punching time clocks as a low-paid serf yearning to breathe free
from the ``mind-numbing'' toil at which privileged kids now sneer.
</P>
<P>
   My unhappily employed status stemmed from having admirable
parents. They had prevailed by sweat and strong wills over the
starkness of the Depression and the stresses and dislocations of
World War II. Their four-letter word of choice was w-o-r-k.
</P>
<P>
   My string of jobs had one common factor: a high DQ (Dreariness
Quotient). One was a clerical stint in the stuffy attic of a
neighborhood pharmacy. Fellow toilers in what I saw as a distinctly
Dickensian setting were two aged women _ the firm's bookkeeper and
her assistant, who chain-smoked and rasped out frequent bulletins
on her iffy state of health.
</P>
<P>
   The bookkeeper _ when taking a break from pounding a formidable
looking business machine called a comptometer _ sometimes recounted
anecdotes about her days as a flapper. During her flaming youth,
she confided, she'd been ``a dancin' fool!''
</P>
<P>
   If I closed my eyes, I could imagine Bob Cratchit hovering
nearby, nodding merrily.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, I'd taken this attic serf position (and a cut in pay) to
escape the multiple miseries of two previous summers working the
swing shift at a fruit cannery. It was a noisy, ear-offending place
where overhead tracks moved lines of clinking, rattling cans to be
filled with peaches, pears or fruit cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   I proved poorly qualified. Sorting fruit at a conveyor belt made
me nauseated (a form of motion sickness) while my brief stint
overseeing the bubblings and burpings of an enormous tomato paste
pot left me as red-splattered as a casualty carted into an
emergency room. I had, oddly, never been told what to do if the vat
threatened to erupt.
</P>
<P>
   A less stressful assignment _ to the maraschino cherry position
of the fruit-cocktail line _ proved to mesh perfectly with my skill
level.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside pear, peach, and seedless grapes serfs, I
settled into the routine of measuring out exactly 24 neon-bright
cherries and tossing them into half-gallon cans. We prayed for
equipment failure, because that allowed us _ mainly students and
purse-poor young teachers _ to talk without screaming and to share
common feelings of summer forlornness.
</P>
<P>
   Following long, tedious weeks at such jobs (it helped to think
of them as equivalent to Dickens' blacking factory ordeal) another
trial awaited. Tan-challenged and bereft of vacation chatter, I
returned to a campus that seemed awash in toasty-brown goddesses.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, my self-esteem suffered until I adopted a
psychological strategy. I'd imagine some glossy sorority girl as
the babbling wreck she'd have been after a swing-shift of watching
tomato paste boil.
</P>
<P>
   The AP article suggests that summer job shirkers may be `` . . .
missing out on what some consider a hallowed American coming-of-age
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it never occurred to me at the time, I know today that my
humble toil taught me lessons in, well, knowing how humble I truly
was.
</P>
<P>
   At every job site, others had skills and know-how that told me I
wasn't such a whiz once I left the classroom. What better lesson
could we wish for the legions of over-indulged youth in Year 2000?

HONG KONG TYCOON SPINS LITTLE-KNOWN TELECOM VENTURES INTO GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hong Kong, Germany, Britain, Wash.)  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ For years, Li Ka-shing has foraged in the darker
corners of the telecommunications industry: a paging service in
Australia, an upstart mobile-phone operation in Britain, a
little-known provider of personal communications services in
Bellevue, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Now that last company, VoiceStream Wireless, is weighing a $53
billion takeover bid from Deutsche Telekom. And Li, a Hong Kong
multibillionaire for whom the phrase Midas-touch seems almost
inadequate, may have found gold in another dark corner.
</P>
<P>
   If Deutsche Telekom acquires VoiceStream for the price being
floated _ a very big if _ the 23 percent stake owned by Li's
company, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., would be worth nearly $12 billion.
That is 10 times the $1.2 billion Hutchison has invested in
VoiceStream since late-1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely amazing,'' said Sanjeet Devgan, the head of
Hong Kong research at Prudential-Bache Securities. ``But this
management team has done it time and again.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Li reaped a $22 billion profit when Hutchison
sold its British mobile-phone company, Orange, to Mannesmann of
Germany _ then watched as Britain's Vodafone AirTouch waged and won
history's largest takeover battle for Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts criticized Li for the Orange and VoiceStream
investments, saying the price of entry was high and the technology
unproven. But in both cases, Li correctly foretold the market.
Hutchison wound up owning assets the titans of the
telecommunications industry felt they could not live without.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're comfortable taking calculated risks in industries they
understand,'' said Tim Dattels, the head of investment banking in
Asia for Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., who has advised Li on several deals.
``They make very quick decisions, and they're not sentimental about
selling assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike AT&AMP;T, Vodafone or Deutsche Telekom, Hutchison does not
aspire to build a global telecommunications empire. It is driven to
wring the highest returns from its investments in the least amount
of time. If Deutsche Telekom were to buy out Hutchison's stake in
VoiceStream, analysts said Li would happily forsake the U.S. market
after less than three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their strategy is to buy early, build the network to a certain
extent and, when the market values are peaking, sell out,'' Devgan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cautioned that Deutsche Telekom's bid for VoiceStream
could founder for several reasons, not least cold feet on the part
of the German company's board. But if the deal unravels, the giant
Japanese mobile phone operator, NTT DoCoMo, is said to be
contemplating an offer.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As in the Mannesmann-Vodafone battle, Li's hand will weigh
heavily on the scales. In addition to its 23 percent stake,
Hutchison has five directors on VoiceStream's board.
</P>
<P>
   Devgan calculated that Deutsche Telekom's offer would value
VoiceStream at more than $15,000 per subscriber. That compares with
the $10,000 per subscriber that Hutchison got for Orange. And it is
more than double the per-subscriber valuations of most publicly
traded mobile phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Li, 71, emigrated to Hong Kong from neighboring Guangdong
Province in the 1950s and got his start selling plastic flowers. Li
soon graduated to property development, and in 1980, he made a run
at Hutchison Whampoa. It was a milestone: Li was the first Chinese
businessman to control one of the great colonial hongs, or trading
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Li did not change the wheeler-dealer culture of Hutchison _ only
its scale and geography. Where once Hutchison ran docks and ships
in this former British colony, it now runs ports in the Panama
Canal, an oil company in Canada and mobile-phone networks in Europe
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Hutchison paid $6.7 billion for a license to offer
next-generation cellular services in Britain. Analysts shook their
heads at the lofty price-tag. But a few months later, the company
recouped more than half its investment by selling a 35 percent
stake in its European mobile venture for $3.15 billion to NTT
DoCoMo and Royal KPN, the Dutch mobile phone operator.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's goal of offering Europe-wide mobile service will not
be cheap. The European subsidiary, Hutchison 3G, must obtain
licenses in Germany, France and Belgium, in addition to building
the network. Analysts estimate that Hutchison's share of the costs
could reach $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may lead to their downfall, because they are getting
carried away bidding for 3G licenses in Europe,'' said one analyst,
who, like most here, requested anonymity when commenting on
Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   Li's recent European deal bore another hallmark of his operating
style: the use of partners to spread risk and provide an exit
strategy. In the case of VoiceStream Wireless, people who know Li
said he was attracted by the company's founder and chief executive,
John Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stanton, who helped start McCaw Cellular, built VoiceStream by
stitching together wireless licenses and buying his two principal
rivals, Aerial and Omnipoint. It was a hard slog; cellular stocks,
particularly those of personal communications services companies,
were languishing.
</P>
<P>
   One day two years ago, Stanton traveled to Calgary, Alberta, to
meet with Li's chief deputy, Canning Fok, and discuss Hutchison's
investment in VoiceStream. People who recall the meeting said
VoiceStream's stock hit an all-time low that day. But Fok was
undeterred. Hutchison had invested millions of dollars, and endured
heavy losses, before Orange turned a corner in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Today, VoiceStream is an alluring prospect to globally minded
telephone companies like Deutsche Telekom. It is one of the few
independent cellular operators in the United States. And its
digital network uses GSM technology, which is compatible with the
network operated by Deutsche Telekom in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, another German company needed a similar wireless
asset to fulfill its ambitions. That company, Mannesmann, paid Li
$14 billion for Hutchison's controlling stake in Orange.

THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES TO BE A LIBERAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What an embarrassment it is to be a liberal
sometimes. Not only do you have to spend your time worrying about
endangered bugs, genetically altered cornflakes and cops playing
kick the can with carjackers, but you have to listen to some odd
ideas and the most unnatural language.
</P>
<P>
   Homicides are up 29 percent this year so far in Jerry Brown's
fair city of Oakland. A police spokesman was quoted as saying of
the increase, ``It's not gang-related, it's not dope-related. We
still have some narcotics-involved homicides, but the majority has
to do with just plain anger management.''
</P>
<P>
   Murder as bad anger management. That's like describing the
failure of a $100 million anti-missile system as a ``glitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland police gave some examples of badly managed anger. In one
case, a 75-year-old man shot his wife to death during an argument
in their home, and in another case a man shot another man dead
because he spilled beer on his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Blow someone to kingdom come because his Budweiser dampened your
loafers? I'd say that's worthy of a lifetime scholarship to the
graduate school of anger management at Folsom U.
</P>
<P>
   Please bring closure to the field of anger management. And all
you cops, please peer-counsel fellow officers so they'll stop
talking like that, and just kick the bejeezus out of us instead.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, as a liberal, you have to believe in the most curious
solution to gun violence: When guns are locked up, you won't have
to lock up criminals.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, cops and volunteers will go through East Oakland
knocking on doors (gingerly, I hope) and offering tips on anger
management and peer counseling, as well as giving away gun locks in
hopes that the five seconds it takes to unlock the gun will be
enough time to cool off and say, ``So what's a little beer on my
shoes?''
</P>
<P>
   Is the kind of person who might shoot someone over spilled beer
going to put a lock on his gun in the first place? I'd say this is
a case of poor brain management on the part of the Oakland P.D.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, for the days when liberals didn't have to believe in stuff
like this, and liberals like Harry Truman gave people hell instead
of managing it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As good liberals we're never supposed to manage our anger toward
tobacco companies. We're supposed to cheer when a Florida jury pins
$145 billion in damages on cigarette makers to punish them for
marketing a defective product.
</P>
<P>
   What's defective about it? Cigarettes do exactly what they're
supposed to do: give people a good smoke, a bit of relaxation, a
cool image in some circles and a hell of an addiction.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that's what they're designed to do, and they do it
very well.
</P>
<P>
   You might as well call lawyers defective because they earn
millions of dollars convincing jurors that the big bad tobacco
companies made smokers ignore all those surgeon general's warnings
and poison themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Well, bad example. Lawyers are a defective product. The Florida
tobacco verdict will be under appeal longer than any kid now taking
up cigarettes will live.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the tobacco companies have a history of lying,
manipulation and fooling young people into doing things that are
bad for their health. But so has the U.S. government, whenever it
has decided to commit troops to dubious interventions.
</P>
<P>
   You can't even get the government to pay money to those who
fought good fights they didn't choose, like veterans of Bataan. But
the government and trial lawyers are happy to give millions to
those who voluntarily took up a habit they knew wasn't good for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Risk and reward are a little out of whack, especially since
lawyers get an inordinate amount of the action from class-action
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Liberalism is dead in legislatures, but lives in perverse form
in the law. It has nothing to do with freedom or the autonomy of
the individual, unless that individual is a lawyer out to make big
bucks from a big business.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What happens if I get colon cancer from eating meat? Should I
sue Iowa Beef? What happens if I get cirrhosis of the liver from
drinking beer? (Instead of getting shot for spilling it on the
wrong guy's footwear.) Should I sue Anheuser-Busch?
</P>
<P>
   What happens if I suffer second-hand SUV poisoning by rolling
over my other car in the driveway? Should I sue Land Rover?
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, beef, beer and big vehicles will be banned by the
righteous, but go ahead and enjoy them, even though you know
they're hazardous to the health. But for now the answer to all of
the above questions is to get on the phone to a lawyer, because
individuals apparently are not responsible for their own choices
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   And if the phone is a cell phone that causes brain cancer, make
another call to another lawyer.

   SEX-ABSTINENCE (Undated) _ In a culture saturated with sexual
messages, where consenting adults seem to hop into bed at the bat
of a feathery eyelash, a small minority are willfully dropping out
of the game. Calling themselves ``born-again virgins,'' they
embrace abstinence not so much on moral or religious grounds, but

   KINA-PROFILE (New York) _ The hot new pop star Kina has the
boundless, often angry energy of a young Tina Turner, and the same
never-ending legs, planted wide in a prizefighter's stance. She
wears her hair in a blond-dyed, Afro and wears like skintight red
leather pants and stiletto heels. A gut-bucket soul singer with the
attitude and style of a rock star, she is the latest of a recent
wave of African-American women to break from the rigid formula of
contemporary R&AMP;B. By Douglas Century. WITH PHOTO.

<P>
   EMAIL-ROMANCES (Undated) _ Yes, I have had seductive e-mail
relationships with men. But I never got in over my head until I
started e-mailing old boyfriends. Suddenly, I had Internet
relationships with two men simultaneously, both of them former
lovers I found on the Web. With one, I was like a frisky Doris Day.
With the other, I was Catherine Deneuve. With both of them, I was
in trouble. By Linda Lee.
</P>
<P>
   FASHION-FLATTERY (Undated) _ A look at the pervasiveness of
flattery in the fashion business _ it is coin of the realm _ and
its remarkable, necessary plasticity. ``The E mores of the fashion
industry were taken from 18th-century Versailles,'' Simon Doonan
was saying. ``It's a structure that's complicated by the fact that
everyone in it is terrified of losing advertising _ the sword of
Damocles. So fragility and fear are driving this need, these
conventions.'' By Penelope Green.

<P>
   ESZTERHAS-RHAPSODY (New York) _ George W. was getting into full
stride and pulling some pretty decent laughs. Bill Clinton was
making some comic headway explaining the cosmic unfairness of the
whole Monica thing. (``A little reward. Just a little reward. A
piece of angel food cake to recharge my batteries.'') Monica told
all, once again, to Linda Tripp. And Joe Eszterhas, sitting front
row center at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater, listening to the words
of his ``American Rhapsody'' wash over him, expertly delivered by
seven actors, looked like a happy man. By William Grimes.

LIBEL SUITS FLOURISH IS PLAINTIFF-FRIENDLY BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Ideas)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When she first heard about it, Deborah Lipstadt believed that
David Irving's threatened libel suit would be little more than a
fleeting inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `This is a classic nuisance suit,''' said Lipstadt,
the author of ``Denying the Holocaust,'' which portrays Irving as a
Holocaust denier who manipulates history to further his own agenda.
``I thought there would be a few lawyers' letters, and then it
would go away.''
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't go away. Five years later, Lipstadt, a professor
of Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at Emory University in
Atlanta, won a drawn-out court case along with her publisher,
Penguin Books, but only after spending more than $3 million and
enlisting a formidable army of experts who had to prove that what
she had said about Irving was true. The victory left Lipstadt with
an unusually personal understanding of the vagaries of English
libel law.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, with its ironclad belief in the First
Amendment right to free speech, libel plaintiffs like Irving need
to prove not only that the speech in question is false, but also
that it was published with a reckless disregard for the truth. In
England, the burden is in the other direction: The offending speech
is presumed to be false, and it is up to defendants like Lipstadt
to prove that it is in fact true.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound reasonable, but it can be prohibitively
difficult, said Helena Peacock, the legal director of Penguin Books
in Britain. ``Quite often, things are true, but it's very hard to
provide evidence in court that shows they're true,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the British system tends to have a dampening effect
on what newspapers print and what publishers include in books,
especially when the material is likely to offend someone who is
powerful, rich or particularly litigious. ``A lot of journalists
feel very strongly that the libel laws support the very people they
are traditionally supposed to call to account _ those in
authority,'' said Bob Jones, an emeritus fellow in journalism at
City University in London. ``In a profit-oriented, highly
competitive media industry, managements are not too keen on taking
risks when it comes to powerful people, because they know how
expensive it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the difference in laws is that England
has never held free speech in as high esteem, as the United States
has; English courts have tended to regard it as subordinate to
things like reputation, for instance. ``It's all connected with the
English culture of deference,'' said Eric Barendt, a professor of
media law at University College London.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, because of its plaintiff-friendly libel laws, London
is not-so-affectionately known among lawyers as ``a town called
Sue.'' ``We're becoming the libel capital of the world,'' said Mark
Stephens, a lawyer specializing in free speech cases here. ``The
U.K. is probably the best plaintiff jurisdiction anywhere, and as a
consequence we get increasingly sophisticated plaintiffs looking at
which country is best to sue in and being increasingly attracted to
the U.K.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent ruling by the House of Lords, which serves as England's
court of last resort, has not helped. The case concerned the effort
of a high-profile Russian politician and businessman, Boris
Berezovsky, to bring a libel suit against Forbes, the American
magazine, in England. A 1996 Forbes article said that Berezovsky
was followed by ``a trail of corpses, uncollectible debts and
competitors terrified for their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Forbes argued that since the case involved a Russian
citizen and an American publication with a circulation in England
of less than 2,000, it had nothing to do with England. When a
lower-court judge agreed, Berezovosky appealed to the House of
Lords and won.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes plans to bring up the matter with the European Court of
Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, whose decisions can overrule
even those of the House of Lords. But if the case ends up going to
trial, Forbes will be put in a highly awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   ``One will have to ship a sizable number of members of the
Russian underworld here to testify,'' said David Hooper, a lawyer
on Forbes' English legal team. ``The whole thing is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   When they do find themselves sued in English courts, American
publications tend not to fare well. In a recent case, The New York
Times and The International Herald Tribune lost a libel suit
brought by Marco Pierre White, a celebrity chef in London, who said
that a generally favorable Times article from 1998, reprinted in
The Tribune, libeled him when it said he had had a
``well-publicized bout with drugs and alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times drew this inference from White's autobiography, in
which he referred to having embarked on a ``big bender,'' only
reforming his ``decadent'' ways because ``eventually I couldn't
stand watching another person getting drunk or someone else
injecting smack into his veins.'' Had the case been heard in
America, The Times would have argued that its characterization was
an honest interpretation of what White himself had said and did not
show a reckless disregard for the truth. But in England, the jury
took a dim view of the American free-speech tradition. It found for
White and ordered the papers to pay him some $125,000 in damages,
as well as his legal costs, which are likely to be several hundred
thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, when American courts have occasion to
consider England's libel laws, they are hard-pressed to contain
their dislike for a system so antithetical to their own. This was
made abundantly clear in 1996, when _ asked to enforce an English
libel judgment because the defendant had moved to Maryland _ the
Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signing of the Declaration of Independence, the adoption
of state constitutions and the later ratification of the First
Amendment signaled a major departure from English law and policy
concerning free speech and freedom of the press,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The concern for American newspapers and magazines, lawyers say,
is that the recent Berezovsky ruling, as well as the growing
availability of American publications on the Internet, will make
them increasingly vulnerable to plaintiffs seeking to take their
grievances to English courts. ``In the Internet age,'' said Patrick
J. Carome, a specialist in defamation law in Washington, ``there is
a worry that we're going to see more and more situations where
foreign defendants are being hauled into court in countries like
England.''
</P>
<P>
   Why does England persist in holding on to its libel laws? They
certainly have few champions among newspapers in Britain. But
because of the news media's almost universal unpopularity among
lawmakers (who know only too well what it feels like to be on the
wrong side of a tabloid article), Parliamentary efforts to amend
the system have generally failed.
</P>
<P>
   There are some good aspects to the laws, argues David Price, a
defamation lawyer in England: ``I would defend them on the basis
that whether something is true or false is a useful piece of
information. A trial on whether a public figure has or has not been
guilty of wrongdoing is a much more useful exercise than one on
whether a newspaper believed he was guilty of wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Lipstadt believes that fighting Irving in court, as
unpleasant as it was, had an unforseen benefit: ``In the U.S., this
would have been thrown out of court, but if it had been thrown out,
Irving would have been able to say that he never got his day in
court. I thought, `This British law is making me jump through
hoops.' But he was the one who was stripped naked.''

WEEKEND EXCURSION: URBAN NOCTURNE BY FIRELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  Paula Deitz is the editor of The Hudson Review.

<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Last New Year's Eve the unexpected happened.
Cities everywhere planned pyrotechnic and other elaborate public
displays to celebrate the millennium individually, but what evolved
was a confluence of ancient rituals linked across time zones as the
new year repeatedly unfolded out of darkness on television screens
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   From the first torches lighted on South Pacific islands to fire
dances in the Judean Hills in Israel and flames on the Thames in
London, a global community of viewers was mesmerized not by
technological razzmatazz but by age-old ceremonies featuring the
primal elements of fire and water.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most evocative of these quasi-primitive rites anywhere
was an artist's installation called ``WaterFire Providence.'' But
when throngs promenaded along the banks of a cove in the
Woonasquatucket River on that memorable evening to view the
braziers of burning logs reflected in the dark waters, they had
more to celebrate than the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years before, the city had regained its rivers by
rescuing the Providence River from under generations of road
decking and relocating its confluence with the Moshassuck and
Woonasquatucket, which flow into it at a strategic juncture near a
new inner harbor at the cove called Waterplace Park.
</P>
<P>
   In place of polluted waters and a dead ``downcity,'' as the
business district is called, Providence has become more like those
vibrant European cities with rivers running through them and
picturesque bridges joining the two banks. Suddenly buildings that
were previously on back streets, like the cluster that forms the
Rhode Island School of Design, found themselves looking out on
riverside greenswards.
</P>
<P>
   Three major department stores have appeared as part of the new
downtown Providence Place Mall designed by Friedrich St. Florian,
an architecture professor at the school, with a view of Waterplace
Park through a three-story-high Winter Garden. (The railroad tracks
that divided the city have also been permanently detoured to a new
station, with the old Union Station as the centerpiece of another
attractive development.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, as families escape to Cape Cod and other New England
vacation spots, it has become de rigueur to stop in Providence on
the way for a summer weekend featuring as its centerpiece one of
the many Saturday night reprises of WaterFire, with its haunting
musical accompaniment, along with dinner at a riverside cafe with a
view of the fires or a quick turn at an instant outdoor ballroom on
a nearby plaza.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, tree-lined Benefit Street on College Hill near
Brown University is still one of the most beautiful historic
districts in the country, with its four centuries' worth of major
domestic architecture: colorful clapboard Colonial houses along
with Federal, Greek Revival and Victorian mansions.
</P>
<P>
   And the RISD Museum (pronounced RIZ-dee) never ceases to amaze
with its exotic exhibitions plumbed from the depths of a collection
that represents its well-traveled donors.
</P>
<P>
   Voices in the Fire
</P>
<P>
   When William D. Warner, a local architect and planner,
masterminded the uncovering and rerouting of the rivers, he also
designed the 12 new bridges, including five for pedestrians only,
that appear to have been there for eons, so well does each blend
with the period of its neighboring buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The iron arch of one brick bridge echoes the main gates of Brown
University just up the hill and serves as a kind of processional
entry to its academic halls. Painted tiles inlaid into bridge walls
recount with maps and images the history of the adjacent areas for
a self-guided tour along the river walks, which themselves feature
linked bollards and piers as true remnants of river life.
</P>
<P>
   When the work was completed, Warner left protruding in the
middle of the Providence River a series of granite piers that had
supported decking over one section of the river. ``I thought these
would make appropriate bases for sculpture designed by students at
RISD,'' he said. Little did he know of the glorious future in store
for these stolid cubes as torchbearers.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence eventually fired the imagination of the artist
Barnaby Evans, a 1975 graduate of Brown, who created WaterFire in
the small cove up the river as a public artwork that would, in his
words, ``invite people back to celebrate the city as the core of
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he originally intended WaterFire as a one-time
happening on First Night 1995, after the following performance, in
1996, Joan Slafsky, a prominent arts supporter who was among those
encouraging him to produce it regularly, spearheaded the fund
raising that established WaterFire as integral to Providence's
community and cultural life.
</P>
<P>
   Evans likens WaterFire to his Southwestern childhood experience
of sitting around a campfire in the desert with his family at
twilight. As the evening wore on, he would listen to the intimate
murmur of voices in the fire glow that dwindled to embers under a
vault of stars.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense WaterFire recreates this campfire mode for the
thousands who gather along the river walks, as they did on a recent
midsummer Saturday night, to participate in this theatrically timed
event. The braziers are lighted during the last glimmer of daylight
on designated evenings and burn until 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The artist envisions this glittering stream of firelight on
water as a kind of preverbal experience that appeals on many
different levels to children and art historians alike. Everyone
merges individual memories with the visual reality of the 97 metal
braziers that illuminate the central spine of the rivers. Set 20 to
35 feet apart, the braziers are neatly stacked with fragrant pine
and cedar logs from storm-felled trees that could no longer be
salvaged.
</P>
<P>
   For one visitor they recalled the moment at an outdoor Noh
performance in Japan when the Buddhist priests ignited braziers to
light the stage at cherry blossom time. The magical simplicity and
beauty of the crackling fires reflected in the water belie the
complex preparations that make WaterFire possible and add to its
charmed and quiet atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Music of the Night
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Evans and his staff, 140 volunteers are on board
for the occasion, most of them silently plying the quiet waters in
flat-bottom barks heaped with wood to stoke the pyres. (With a nod
to fire mythology, the boats are appropriately named Prometheus,
Daedalus, Icarus and Athena.)
</P>
<P>
   Dressed entirely in black like the Japanese Bunraku puppeteers
who disappear onstage behind their colorful puppets, the volunteers
are instructed how to place each log in turn with the simple
gesture of an outstretched arm as the boats glide stealthily by the
blazing braziers.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally a Venetian gondola traversing the waters is
silhouetted against the firelight. Waves of people jamming the
river walks briefly vanish into dark passageways under bridges
illuminated by candle-lighted chandeliers. Others crowd riverside
restaurants for a close-up view. In brief, the bateaux-mouches that
brighten the Seine at night in Paris don't have a patch on the
communal ceremony that is WaterFire.
</P>
<P>
   Further aural enchantment is provided by taped music that
resonates across the waters, with different selections made by
Evans for each performance and listed in the evening's program. To
reflect the varied cultures represented by the spirit of WaterFire,
he combines Buddhist chants with Armenian folk songs and
compositions by the contemporary Estonian composer Arvo Part with
Maria Callas singing an aria from ``La Wally'' by Catalani.
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment after midnight when Luciano Pavarotti boomed
``Nessun dorma'' from Puccini's ``Turandot,'' and everyone appeared
to stand stock still at Waterplace Park to listen and gaze at the
panorama of firelight against the glittering lights of Providence's
new skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Never was a city better named to reflect cultural and artistic
freedom than at that moment, which also reflected Roger Williams'
original vision when he founded the city for religious freedom in
1636.
</P>
<P>
   As a way of drawing the crowds into the adjoining side streets
and plaza, Evans also invented the outdoor Sovereign Plaza Ballroom
for WaterFire nights. Red drapes were hung behind an arcaded
building facade, the decorative stone Turk's head above was
lighted, and a glamorous instant ballroom was created with a
polished black octagonal dance floor over the cobblestone street.
</P>
<P>
   With lessons given before sundown, couples danced the night away
by tangoing to live music on one WaterFire night. Other WaterFire
performances will also feature dancing this summer, from swing and
salsa to waltzes and fox trots. No one goes home unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Night life in Providence is complemented by a rich cultural
program of daytime events before the David Hykes' ``Hallelujah''
signals the lighting of the first torch of WaterFire at sunset. In
addition to its excellent permanent collection of arts and
artifacts, the RISD Museum has two summer exhibitions on the
subject of traveling.
</P>
<P>
   The first, ``The Far Traveler,'' follows the history of travel
in the 19th and 20th centuries through fashions specific to modes
of travel (automobile, railway, steamship and airplane) along with
the decorative and functional objects (portable desks and wardrobe
trunks) that were necessary conveniences. By combining these
displays with paintings and prints, the show represents the depth
of the museum's stores.
</P>
<P>
   Wanderlust and Mansions
</P>
<P>
   Last year the museum was offered a collection of clothes
selected for Virginia Hardesty Moss by Glamour magazine when her
essay won the magazine's prize trip to Paris and London in 1948.
This donation sparked the exhibition, which evokes a long era when
travel dress _ from early motoring coats and veils (1905 and 1906)
to a Vera Maxwell Ultrasuede suit (1974) _ was considered stylish
as well as practical.

   Nothing nowadays among the jeans-clad populace can touch Moss'
red flared coat and leopard-skin beret in a wardrobe that also
included a ``big occasion'' dress with a velveteen jacket that one
could walk away in today. Evidently she had a wonderful time, and
``Madame Schiaparelli even gave her a blouse in Paris,'' said
Madelyn Shaw, the curator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tokaido: The Lure of the Open Road in 19th-Century Japan''
equally inspires wanderlust through Abby Aldrich Rockefeller's
suite of Hiroshige prints following the Eastern Sea Route between
Edo (now Tokyo) and Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the prints in sequence, the viewer gets into the
spirit of the trip, which proceeds past tea stands and inns and
sometimes across fields under a full moon or over bridges where
feudal lords are given the right of way. In another example of
RISD's strengths, a circa 1900 fragment of tie-dyed cloth in indigo
on view in the gallery nearly matches those displayed in stores in
a print of Narumi, where travelers bought the famous local products
as souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the museum are two historic mansions that
demonstrate the great wealth and enterprise of early Providence
citizens. The interior of the 1865 palazzo-style Governor Henry
Lippitt House on Hope Street is one of the best examples of local
workmanship, both in the Herter-style decorative woodwork and in
the faux-wood and hand-stenciled finishes on walls and ceilings
executed by church decorators.
</P>
<P>
   On a weekend afternoon, it was the scene of a private summer
wedding that gave the house a certain elegant panache of reality
that it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   The 1786 late-Georgian house on Power Street built by John
Brown, a great China Trade merchant from the family that eventually
financed Brown University, possesses one of those wonders of
Providence furniture design, a rare nine-shell, blocked-front
bookcase and desk, as well as many treasures from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Equally historic is the carriage house across the street where
Providence's longtime mayor, Vincent A. Cianci Jr., lives
surrounded by massive plantations of red impatiens that harmonize
with the brick surrounds. Cianci is the enlightened spirit and
dynamic force behind Providence's revival. When he dined with
friends at the riverside Cafe Nuovo during the last WaterFire, he
said it was gratifying to be mayor and see the rivers reborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with America is that we do not appreciate our
cities enough,'' he said, criticizing suburban sprawl. His next
project? ``I am going to run I-95 out of town, so that we can heal
and rebuild our neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more to come in Providence.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's see if you're smarter than the presumptive Democratic
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Put on some earth-tone casual wear and take this simple quiz.
</P>
<P>
   1.Does Al Gore need to do something to shake up the race? Yes.
No.
</P>
<P>
   2.Should this be a stunt, something ``cute''? Yes. No.
</P>
<P>
   3.Should this stunt involve the vice presidential selection and
its announcement? Yes. No.
</P>
<P>
   4.Will the electorate be entitled to gag if Al Gore tries this?
Yes. No.
</P>
<P>
   5.Will any of this have the slightest effect on the presidential
race? Yes. No.
</P>
<P>
   See, wasn't that easier than the draw-me cowboy for a mail-order
art course?
</P>
<P>
   But for the half-fast or folks who've spent the last few months
on Uranus, here's the crib sheet.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 is something of a trick question. Gore's need to shake up
the race depends on whether you believe his protestations that the
current national polling means ``next to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The quicker Gore does the attempted shaking up, the clearer it
will be that he's just as worried as most Democrats about George W.
Bush's lead in about nine out of 10 polls over the last three
months.
</P>
<P>
   The slower Gore takes it, the more faith he has in his claim
that the issues _ education, Social Security, Medicare, patients'
rights, drugs costs, gasoline prices _ are on his side and that
voters will come around once they start focusing on the election.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't a discussion question, now, was it?
</P>
<P>
   Of course Gore needs to shake up the race. But he had better be
careful how he does it. And that means the answer to Nos. 2 and 3
is not only no, but hell no.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is worried that Bush, already marginally ahead, will get a
traditional bounce from the Republican National Convention and pull
farther in front. That means the vice president would just have
more ground to make up around the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   So there are now reports Gore will attempt to short-circuit the
Bush bump by announcing his own choice for vice president within
hours of the close of the Republican show in Philadelphia and be
out on the stump with his running mate that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Voters know a gimmick when they see one _ artifice masquerading
as substance. (Review videotape of Michael Dukakis in the tank.)
</P>
<P>
   And if there is one thing that Al Gore does not need, it's to
look more calculatedly programmed.
</P>
<P>
   With a quick announcement of a running mate, Gore would also be
giving up an opportunity to review the initial public reaction to
Bush's convention performance and that of the GOP vice presidential
nominee. That won't be clear until early the next week.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine that any of the Democratic vice
presidential prospects would be so stunning that the public
reaction (especially on a midsummer weekend) would be profitably
astonishing for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   One has trouble imagining a scenario in which the public
response is: ``Oh, thank God, Al has chosen (John Kerry, Bob
Graham, Evan Bayh, Joe Lieberman, etc.) and rushed to tell us about
it.'' It's not that any of them are seriously problematic, it's
just that none is a silver bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Two asterisks:
</P>
<P>
   (1) This dullsville angle was pointed up by the brief frisson
that ran through the chattering classes with the idea that Gore,
improbably, might select House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt.
It's not that Gephardt is Mr. Scintillating, it's just that he
would have been a more interesting choice than the remaining White
Boys.
</P>
<P>
   (2) Having two weeks ago questioned whether George W. Bush had
the courage to take the somewhat pro-choice Tom Ridge as a running
mate, I'll raise the same issue for Gore regarding Bayh, whose less
than perfect abortion-rights voting record has sent several
feminist arrows his way.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of this digression. The answer to No. 4 is yes, the
electorate would be entitled to gag if Gore tries to be too tricky
with his veep selection or timing of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to No. 5. Here the key word is ``slightest.''
Only if the race comes down to the 1 or 2 percentage point range
are the vice presidential candidates likely to make much of a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Barring some political cataclysm, it will be Bush plus X vs.
Gore plus Y. And in this equation, both X and Y almost certainly
equal zero.

WIND CHIMES NEED FLEXIBLE CORDS TO SOUND IN THE WIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July   23, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I replaced the cords on my wind chimes because they had
rotted, using nylon fishing line. Now the tubes don't move or sound
in the wind. What did I do wrong?
</P>
<P>
   SUSAN McANDREW, Carlisle, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think the nylon fishing line will work because it is
not flexible enough. I think a thin cotton or polyester cord would
be more flexible. Also, check out similar chimes to see if you can
determine what the cords are made of. Or, ask a wind chime dealer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I decided to replace the carpet on my hardwood stairs, I
found the steps to be in good shape except for a few spots where
the tack board splintered the wood. I'd like the nice-looking
treads to show on each side of the new carpet, so I plan to
refinish them.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of wood filler should I use, and should I apply it
before I apply the oil-based polyurethane varnish, or before
sanding?
</P>
<P>
   MRS. R.H. MAYER, Metairie, La.
</P>
<P>
   A. For the holes in the treads, use a wood filler. Wood filler
is what wood fillers are called. Use a latex-based filler in a
plastic bucket. It's a neutral color, good for most floors. Apply
the filler directly into the holes. If the varnish is dark, you can
buy a dark filler to match; it comes in all colors. Then you can
sand the treads lightly, and apply two coats of oil-based varnish.
</P>
<P>
   The following does not apply to your situation because your
treads are varnished. If you run into a situation where you must
fill holes on an unvarnished surface, here is how to do it with
perfect results:
</P>
<P>
   Sand the surface smooth, wipe with paint thinner, then apply the
varnish, at least one coat. Let dry, then fill the holes. The
reason you apply the filler over one coat of varnish is to prevent
the filler from smearing the wood. Sanding the stain from a filler
smear is impossible. After the filler sets overnight, you can apply
a second and possibly third coat of varnish.
</P>
<P>
   If you stain the tread, the procedure is the same. After
varnishing the stained wood, apply a filler of the same or similar
color as the stain. And, if the filler is a bit darker than the
finish, that is OK, because dark marks show up less than light
ones.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a 9- by 12-foot rug on my wall-to-wall carpeting. It
looks great but insists on curling on one side. It is hazardous and
annoying. I have tried laying patio brick on the curl. That works
for a time, but after a while, the curl returns. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   CURLING, JUST CURLING, San Leandro, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is some hope. Rug and carpet stores and dealers carry
special mesh pads to keep throw rugs from throwing, and to keep
corners and edges down. One is called Blue Miracle (the mesh is
coated with vinyl).
</P>
<P>
   If pads don't work, try this for the curls: double-faced carpet
tape.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My ranch house has a one-foot projection over the foundation,
about 16 feet long. The windows are triple-glazed, but the ceiling
of the projection is not insulated. Warm air in the house hits the
cool ceiling, and I get a lot of moisture and mold on the ceiling.
The house is 46 years old. How can I insulate that ceiling?
</P>
<P>
   RAYMOND BARRETT, Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Insulation is the only thing that will prevent mold from
growing. Mold grows on damp surfaces. The surface gets damp because
water vapor condenses on it. Warming up that ceiling will help
prevent anything from condensing on it. You can't get to the space
above the ceiling of the projection, either from below or through
the attic. So, the ultimate is to cut.
</P>
<P>
   I said that insulation is the only thing that will prevent mold
from growing. That is only half true. Another way to stop the mold
is by ventilating, to reduce or eliminate the water vapor. That is
not practicable.
</P>
<P>
   Cut out the ceiling and put in rigid insulation. I think four
inches will do; that much Styrofoam will give an R value of 20;
that much High R Sheathing (a modified urethane foam) board will
give an R value of 28. Put in six inches if you like, and rebuild
the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Another, easier way is to glue 2-inch-thick rigid insulation
(one of the above) on the ceiling, border it with decorative wood
trim and glue or nail a new ceiling on the insulation, driving
nails through the insulation. It will not give you as high an R
value, but it will be enough to stop the condensation.
</P>
<P>
   You can do this if it does not bring the ceiling down enough to
cover the window.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The metal soap holder in my bathroom looks pretty good until
it turns green. I use bleach to get rid of it, and it is fine for a
while, but it always comes back. It is silverish in color. How can
I keep that green away?
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN FITZGERALD, Milton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the green goes away with a bleach solution, it may be
algae, and there is little you can do except continue with the
bleach treatment. I can't imagine that it comes back so quickly and
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   But it might also be corrosion of brass or copper, which creates
a green or greenish-blue color. Since it looks silverish, it may be
chrome plated, but there might be copper or brass exposed to cause
the greening.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: Keep washing off the green or get a new, ceramic
soap holder.
</P>

SIGN OF THE TIMES: CLINTON PRESS AIDES SEEKING JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HELEN THOMAS  
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With time running out on the Clinton
administration, staffers in the White House press office are
looking to their futures.
</P>
<P>
   Press secretary Joe Lockhart has passed the word that he does
not expect to remain on the job beyond early fall. His likely
successor is deputy press secretary Jake Siewert, who pinch-hits
for Lockhart on many occasions in his absence. Lockhart has been
job hunting on the West Coast, but with his expertise in politics,
he is likely to get offers in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy press secretary Jennifer Palmieri is leaving her White
House post at the end of the month to start a new gun-control
advocacy group in Washington. Press assistant Julia Payne has moved
over to Vice President Al Gore's staff.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's aide de camp Chris Engskov has joined a
venture capital group in Seattle. He was the ``Man Friday'' for the
president, always at his side and ready to do whatever needs to be
done. He's the guy who puts Clinton's speech text on the podium
right before a speech.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, who took over the post from McCurry in the aftermath
of the impeachment ordeal, learned the ropes rapidly and fell
quickly in step with President Clinton. He is a straight shooter
and has the respect of the press corps.
</P>
<P>
   New York has become the hunting ground for some of the White
House job seekers. With their credentials and insider knowledge
they are bound to land on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As far as reporters are concerned the second Camp David has been
deja vu all over again, although press secretary Joe Lockhart
insists otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart warned reporters against drawing ``too many parallels''
with the first Camp David summit in 1978 when Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin negotiated
for 13 days before achieving a breakthrough settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not 1978,'' Lockhart warned.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are some similarities such as the news
blackout. Lockhart behaves just like then-White House Press
Secretary Jody Powell did in 1978. Both gave ``news briefings''
about the Camp David meetings but there was no news in those
briefings.
</P>
<P>
   The tidbits at both summits dealt with the menu at the Camp
David meals, what the negotiators were wearing and a few words
about the general mood.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters learned that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was
given the ``Dogwood'' cottage and Palestinian Yasser Arafat was
assigned to the ``Birch'' cabin. In 1978, Egyptian President Sadat
occupied ``Dogwood'' and Begin was in ``Birch.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp David, near Thurmont, Md., was created during World War II
as a retreat for President Franklin D. Roosevelt near Washington.
He dubbed it Shangri La.
</P>
<P>
   The barbed wire encampment guarded by Marines in camouflaged
fatigues has always been no-man's land for reporters and a haven
for presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the grounds are 20 cabins _ most of them built in the
Nixon era _ including Aspen Lodge, a spacious hideaway for
presidents, nestled in the woods on a mountaintop.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton spoke at the recent ceremony on Capitol Hill
when the legendary Father Theodore Hesburgh, president of the
University of Notre Dame for 35 years, was presented the
Congressional Gold Medal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recalled that Hesburgh's first job at Notre Dame was as
chaplain for the married veterans who had enrolled under the GI
Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The pregnant wife of one of the veterans was rushed to the
delivery room and the baby, taken by a Caesarean section, had a
heartbeat but no breath. The medical team could not induce the
infant to breathe. But the instant Hesburgh baptized it with cold
water, the baby began to cry loudly, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, some members of the clergy criticized
Hesburgh for his focus on academic improvement. His retort: ``Piety
is no substitute for competent scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Once at Notre Dame, a young Jewish student from Boston left
campus two weeks into the semester because two freshmen hurt him
deeply with anti-Semitic slurs. The freshmen were sent to Hesburgh,
who told them to go to Boston and try to persuade the young man to
return to Notre Dame. If they failed this mission, he said, don't
bother to come back to the university. Clinton said all three came
back and they all graduated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that is leadership,'' the president added.

FOR NEW DOGGIE PARENTS, IT'S ALL A MATTER OF BONDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it ``pet-ernity'' leave _ a period of time that new owners
take off from work to be with their new bundle of joy.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, with animals, it's usually counted in weeks, or
weekends, and not months (the injustice!), but there are huge
similarities between bringing home a baby and bringing home
something with a little more fur. That heady mix of exhaustion and
infatuation is identical.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one friend _ the mother of a 2-year-old toddler _
swears that today, she'd be better at raising a puppy than she was
years ago, when she had a brief but disastrous fling with a very
energetic Vizsla pup. In the interim, through her baby, she's
learned to be a parent. Raise a child, she says, then try a puppy.
</P>
<P>
   Many make the comparison. Robin Matloss of Newton, Mass. brought
home Marley, her West Highland white terrier, a few months ago, on
a Thursday, and then spent the entire next day alone with the
puppy. ``I had the same overwhelmed feeling I had had with the kids
when I first got them home,'' she says. ``And when my husband came
home that night, it was like `Here! Take her!' I even felt
housebound the way I had with the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Matloss, who teaches dental hygiene at Mount Ida College, had
carefully planned her summer vacation time to coincide with the
arrival of a new pup. In fact, she had turned down puppies from two
earlier litters. Time spent right away with the new pup was vital.
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics revealing how many of us indulge in
``peternity'' leave. But, clearly, for many in the doggie set, it's
de rigueur. And though we may claim it's about housetraining and
practical issues, it's really more a matter of bonding and emotion.
Dog trainer Kathy DeNatale of Waltham, Mass., who specializes in
puppy classes, says many of her clients do it, but a surprising
number won't admit it.
</P>
<P>
   Gerri Gauthier, who is on the faculty at UMass Medical School,
readily testifies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an academic, so I've been a little more free with my
schedule,'' she says. ``But you can't just take this little
creature into your life and then leave him or her all alone.''
Throughout her life, Gauthier, who lives west of Boston, has taken
at least two weeks off to settle a new puppy, as she did almost a
year ago when she got Jasper, a mini schnauzer.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier says that initial time period helps with housebreaking,
and with making the pup feel more secure. There's another element,
too, something Gauthier says is almost too obvious to mention _ the
pleasure of spending time with a little puppy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better way to spend a vacation?'' asks Gina Spadafori,
author of ``Dogs for Dummies,'' and an essayist for Pets.com.
``It's just plain fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to all that rollicking play, Spadafori says, some
important things take place during that initial time together. ``A
lot of serious bonding goes on, and learning,'' she says, ``Puppies
are born with more dog knowledge than any human will ever have.''
</P>
<P>
   But DeNatale adds a caveat. She's seen too many owners take time
off and simply overload the new pup with excitement and attention.
When the owner suddenly disappears and returns to work, the
bewildered animal suffers separation anxiety. And that can manifest
itself in destructive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you do take time off with a new pup, be sure to leave the
house occasionally without the dog so she can get used to being
alone. It is also good to bring the pup with you on errands
sometimes so she can get used to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   DeNatale certainly does not see ``peternity'' leave as critical.
But taking time off when you bring a puppy home, she says, will
help greatly with housetraining.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Bishop, owner of Puppy Manners dog training in
Woodinville, Wash., calls herself a ``Dear Abby of the dog world,''
because she dispenses advice on greatpets.com. ``In an ideal world,
everyone getting a new pup would be able to take a week off,'' she
says. ``Housebreaking is much easier that way. You can take the dog
out every 30 minutes even, and they learn quickly. It takes much
longer for a latchkey puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Kaufman, of Watertown, Mass., says the two weeks of vacation
time she just spent with Sophie, her 4-pound poodle/Lhasa
apso/Maltese mix, entailed much more than housebreaking. She even
threw a ``puppy shower'' for her new arrival _ pink balloons and
all. ``I was thrilled to do it,'' Kaufman says. She's seen Sophie's
confidence grow, she says, and the pup has actually been able to
focus her ``boundless energy.''
</P>
<P>
   As Spadafori says, ``Young pups are like Velcro. They really
want to bond. And they develop so quickly, you'll never have that
time with them back again.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
TIPS FOR NEW DOG PARENTS
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Whether or not you have a few weeks to spend with a new puppy,
dog trainer Kathy DeNatale has a few tips: &QL; 
--If you can't take vacation time when you bring home a puppy, try
to get her on a Friday so you have the whole weekend together. &QL; 
--Walk around the house _ inside and out _ to acquaint him with his
new surroundings. &QL; 
--Get the puppy accustomed to handling. Gently pat her all over and
be sure to include ears and feet (even squeeze gently between the
toes). These are two areas where dogs can be sensitive unless they
are used to being touched there. &QL; 
Be sure to take the bowl away while the pup is eating, and return
it. This will prevent her from becoming protective about food. &QL; 
--Don't forget in all the excitement that a puppy is a baby. He
will need downtime. It will help with confidence if the pup can
count on being left alone to snooze several times throughout the
day. &QL; 
--Don't tiptoe around the pup. Play your piano. Rattle the pots.
Run errands. Let this puppy get used to your routine. &QL; 
--Start basic training right away. ``Why waste time?'' asks trainer
DeNatale. As soon as the pup comes home, he can begin to learn
``come'' and ``sit.'' But don't press on the back to teach sit; a
young pup isn't developed enough for that. Initially, says dog
trainer Becky Bishop, the pup wants to stick close. You can use
this desire in teaching the come command. Hide behind a tree for a
second. When the pup becomes concerned, pop out and call her.
She'll learn that ``it feels good to find you.'' Always use just
food and voice rewards, no punishment. &QL;

IN SANTA BARBARA, A PRESS ROLE FOR A MEDIA-SHY MOGUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Few cities do a better job of smoothing
the rough edges of movie moguls and business gladiators than this
quaint, impeccably groomed seaside paradise 100 miles north of the
shark-infested studio commissaries of Hollywood. The wealthy often
come here not to forget who they are, but to take a break from some
of the forces that made them rich.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the recent announcement that the local newspaper,
the 145-year-old Santa Barbara News-Press, had been sold by a large
publishing company _ The New York Times Co., as it happens _ and
acquired by a local philanthropist was received in some circles as
a victory of community spirit over the homogenizing influence of a
distant corporate overseer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be quality before the bottom line,'' said Wendy P.
McCaw, the buyer, who paid roughly $100 million. It seemed that an
act of public spiritedness had drawn one of the wealthiest, if not
best known, women in America out of her shell.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, McCaw, 48, demonstrated the hard business acumen that
she uses to manage a fortune that Forbes magazine has estimated at
about $1.5 billion, most of that a product of her divorce from
Craig O. McCaw, the telecommunications entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested in an interview _ she supplied written
answers to written questions _ that she may have made the
investment for altruistic reasons, she crisply shot down the
notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition fits with my investment philosophy and meets
my IRR targets,'' said McCaw, using the Wall Street language for
internal rate of return. ``I don't invest in assets for purely
sentimental or other nonbusiness reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaw's acquisition stands in counterpoint to a trend in which
large chains have been gobbling up small publications and using
economies of scale to wring out higher profits. She has said not
only that she will avoid layoffs and leave the newsroom alone, but
that she will explore environmentally sound alternatives to using
newsprint made from tree pulp.
</P>
<P>
   But the acquisition will also provide an opportunity to find out
just what McCaw is made of as she cautiously _ so cautiously that
an assistant leapt at a photographer snapping a shot of her as she
emerged from her unmarked office on a quiet street here _ steps
onto a stage she has long avoided.
</P>
<P>
   She gave a rare personal interview to her own newspaper after
the deal was announced, but insisted that no photographs be taken.
When she first visited the newspaper after the purchase, she
casually strolled the five or so blocks from her office and
introduced herself to the staff. But it was on a Saturday, when the
offices were all but empty.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw is an avid jogger and a vegetarian, well known for her
divorce from Craig O. McCaw. The two met while undergraduates at
Stanford, where she was known as Wendy Petrak. She was at his side
as he cleverly assembled a nationwide cellular communications
empire, which he sold in 1994 to AT&AMP;T for $11.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The two separated shortly afterward, in January 1995, and then
engaged in an expensive divorce battle that ended in her placing
business ownership over cash. She became something of a business
partner of her former husband, taking large stakes in several
companies in which he had invested, including Nextel
Communications, in which she now owns 4 percent, according to
public filings, and Nextlink Communications, in which she owns a
reported 14 percent through her investment company, Ampersand
Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   She has said she protects her privacy in large part because of
security concerns, but in response to a question she added that
being a woman was also a factor. When it was pointed out that
billionaires from Steve Jobs to Donald Trump lead public lives, she
responded: ``They are all men _ some of them happen to enjoy the
spotlight. I'm not and I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   And though she is quiet, she is not anonymous. She formed the
Wendy P. McCaw Foundation, which has more than $53 million in
assets, to finance some of her favorite projects. These have ranged
from returning Keiko, the killer whale that starred in the movie
``Free Willy,'' to the waters around Iceland, to preserving
architectural drawings.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw was so involved in freeing Keiko that in January 1996,
when the animal was flown from his home in Mexico to a temporary
home in Oregon, she was on board the chase plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wendy was very personally involved,'' said David Phillips,
executive director of the Earth Island Institute, which managed the
project. ``She'd come up to see him when we had him in a sort of
rehab in Oregon. She has continued to provide funds to help in his
eventual release.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that when a reception celebrating the journey included
platters of seafood, she was incensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on?'' McCaw demanded to know, said Phillips.
``We're supposed to be saving this stuff, not eating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her stewardship of the newspaper could prove a challenge. Most
experts agree that the paper is likely to be a reliable if
unspectacular investment. It is expected to take in about $30
million in revenue this year and earn pretax income of $4.5 million
to $6 million, company officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have good, steady growth, but it won't be explosive,''
said Allen Parsons, the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Edward J. Atorino, a media analyst at Wasserstein Perella
Securities, commented, ``It's in an affluent area, but there's
limited growth.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaw said she would do well, while respecting the paper's
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not have any role in the news-gathering or reporting
process,'' she said. ``I would hope that no friend or acquaintance
of mine asks me to intercede with the paper; but if they did, I
would tell them what I just told you.''

NASCAR DRIVERS FEEL TIRE PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett has struggled a little, Jeff Gordon has struggled a
lot, and many other top NASCAR drivers are somewhere in between as
Winston Cup racing continues through one of its most unusual
seasons in years.
</P>
<P>
   The season's first 13 races saw 12 different winners, including
two rookies. No truly dominant car, or group of cars. Drivers who
almost never run up front were suddenly doing well.
</P>
<P>
   Why? To sum it up in one word: tires.
</P>
<P>
   At the race track, tires are perhaps the most critical element
in setting up a car to run fast. The chassis is adjusted to work
with the tires. Each track is different, and over the years, the
elite teams compile extensive notes on what works best for each
race.
</P>
<P>
   So, while the tires and cars themselves change, there has always
been a base line to work from, a place to start.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a change in the tire,'' explained Jarrett, the
defending Winston Cup champion. ``There has been a total
reconfiguration of the tire and it's totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear decided to make changes after tire failures caused a
number of serious accidents during the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was wrong with the tire Goodyear produced, but it had a
stiff sidewall, which made the cars hard to turn. To compensate,
the teams ran with low air pressure and a lot of camber in the
front tires.
</P>
<P>
   On a passenger car, the tires are straight up and down because
the car runs on flat roads. But to make race cars faster through
the corners, teams tilt the top of the right tire front-in and the
top of the left front-out so that as much tread as possible grips
the banking. Excessive camber, as this is called, combined with low
air pressure, causes severe wear on the inside sidewall of the
right front as it goes through the turns, which can cause the tire
to fail.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent that, Goodyear came out with a new generation of
tires this year with a softer sidewall. That meant the teams
couldn't tilt the right front-in as much, because it would roll
over on the sidewall, and it also meant they had to use higher air
pressure to keep the tire up.
</P>
<P>
   The new tire made the cars easier to turn, but it made
everyone's notes obsolete because the tire's characteristics were
almost the opposite of what the teams had worked with before.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the amount of flex in the sidewall, or tire
spring rate, varied from one set of tires to the next. Teams would
get their cars set up to work with a certain stiffness in the tire,
then suddenly find the car was handling totally differently because
a new set of tires was either stiffer or more flexible than the set
before.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, most teams were reluctant to make major
changes at first, going with what had worked in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys were putting a lot of camber in to make sure the car
would turn, and that was blowing the right front,'' said Larry
McReynolds, who is the crew chief for Mike Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was making Goodyear look bad and it wasn't their fault.
So they came up with a new tire with a softer sidewall,''
McReynolds said. ``The car turns better now, but our notes are
worthless. We had to go 180 degrees the other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds said the new tires helped Matt Kenseth and Dale
Earnhardt Jr., two rookies with rookie teams. ``They didn't have
any notes, and they just did what the tire wanted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half of the season, Earnhardt Jr. won two races
plus The Winston and Kenseth won once, a success rate unheard of in
Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   It appears, however, that the elite teams are starting to regain
their advantage as the season moves along. For example, Tony
Stewart has won three of the last six races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're getting better, and I think there are five or
six teams out there, if somebody hits on the combination, they
could break away,'' said Robbie Loomis, Gordon's crew chief.
</P>

AWAITING PEARLS FROM THE IPO PIPELINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nasdaq seems to have gotten beyond its valuation problem,
sort of. Earnings from most technology companies remain strong. And
the market for initial public offerings, many of them technology
issues, is showing signs of cranking up again after a sharp
slowdown this spring.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 104 new issues were priced in the second quarter,
according to Thompson Financial Securities Data. That was down from
141 in the first quarter and 166 in the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures are relative: In the first quarter of 1999, when
the stock market was booming, only 73 new issues were priced.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a lot in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   IPOfinancial.com, publisher of a twice-a-month newsletter, is
tracking more than 300 companies that are waiting to come to
market. More than two-thirds of those got in line before May 1 and
are awaiting improved conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Bronson, a senior analyst for IPO Monitor, a research firm,
and a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, took some time last week
to talk about the new-issue market. Following are excerpts from the
conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q. The stock market appears to have stabilized, and the deal
flow has picked up a bit over the last few weeks. Is the new issue
market ready to fly again?
</P>
<P>
   A. It seems like we have washed a lot of the speculative nature
out of the market, but there is a long list of issues that have
been pulled, and those issues haven't come back. We are in the
summer doldrums. I suspect there are many significant IPOs related
to the Internet and telecommunications that are holding back to the
fall in anticipation of a more robust market. Those companies that
have been in registration that have postponed their deals or cut
back on their size are smart. You want to come out in the most
stable Wall Street environment that you can. How your stock does
when it goes public colors a company's capability for the following
six months to a year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did the meltdown in the Nasdaq make investors more selective
about new issues?
</P>
<P>
   A. In the past couple of years, we have seen companies go out
and be very successful as story stocks, companies with some
revenues but no real prospects for earnings in the near term. You
are not going to see as many of them. In order to garner strong
interest in the public market, companies that go public over the
next few quarters will be able to promote the fact that they will
have earnings in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The drop-off in initial public offerings has been sharp, but
the decline in secondary sales of stock has been even more
pronounced. Are some companies not going to be able to tap the
market?
</P>
<P>
   A. I am not aware of anyone giving up on a secondary offering.
But you will see a lot of consolidation, with companies that are in
vertical spaces buddying up. There is just not enough consumer
support to sustain all of them. And this is healthy, because only
the strongest survive ... Now is a great opportunity for companies
to just buy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A lot of the Internet mania seems to have evaporated. Does
that reflect changing attitudes about the commercial potential of
the World Wide Web?
</P>
<P>
   A. Marketing on the Net will always be a wonderful tool, but it
is doubtful it will supplant or cut into sales traffic. At the end
of the day, companies will discover that the Internet is a good way
to cut the cost of doing business as opposed to augmenting
revenues. That is why it is a very exciting time to be part of the
infrastructure build-out for the Internet and related platforms.
There is all sorts of activity in what is now the second chapter of
building the next level of Internet infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Aside from infrastructure companies, what sorts of companies
will likely be well received by investors in coming months?
</P>
<P>
   A. Biotechnology is very much coming into its own now. Companies
have been doing research to the point where they now have something
to sell in the marketplace. This is different from the biotech wave
in the early 1990s, when there was a ground swell of enthusiasm
that faded because there were no real products. Now we have
companies with real products that are based on biotechnological
innovations. And those companies will probably come to market.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last year, tons of money was invested by venture capitalists.
Have those flows slowed?
</P>
<P>
   A. There doesn't seem to be any less interest in investing money
privately to help build out this second wave of infrastructure,
much less vertical market companies. Everyone continues to be very
enthusiastic about the potential. When that potential is realized
in terms of companies producing net profit remains to be seen. And
the IPO event is simply the last step in the venture capital cycle.

 &HT;    Armstrong to become tour de force
 &HT;    By Sheryll Poe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe they should call it the Tour de Cash. Should 28-year-old
Lance Armstrong win his second Tour de France Sunday, he will
become an even more powerful marketing machine.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of seeing a yellow racing jersey, some companies are
seeing gold.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, Armstrong was making $500,000 with
endorsements from the U.S. Postal Service team and $30,000 per
speaking engagement. Now he commands $100,000 per speech and an
estimated $5 million per year in endorsements, some through the
year 2004. Analysts can only debate how much he would be worth with
a second Tour de France victory.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his endorsement deals, Armstrong has another year
on his $2 million-a-year contract with the U.S. Postal Service
team.
</P>
<P>
   His total income of about $7 million this year is roughly the
same salary as Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a very hot name in sports over the past year, and
this will continue to keep him on the hot list for another year,''
said sports marketer Bob Williams of Chicago-based Burns Sports
Celebrity Service Inc., who ranks Armstrong with former Denver
Broncos quarterback John Elway and Washington Redskins cornerback
Deion Sanders in public speaking fees. ``There aren't many athletes
that can charge six figures for a speech. For appearances, he's at
the top of the list,''
</P>
<P>
   But it might be too soon to start comparing him to fellow Nike
spokesmen Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods, Burns said. ``Jordan and
Woods don't even do appearances and if they did, no one could
afford what they (would) charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Schinman, the president of New York-based entertainment
consulting company Platinum Rye Entertainment, who represents
Charles Schwab and the New York Stock Exchange, agrees. ``He's not
even close to being the next Tiger Woods. It's comparing apples and
oranges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the remaining 129 from the original 190 Tour competitors,
no one comes close to attracting Armstrong's level of the media
attention. In France, he is known as ``Lance Inc.'' Teammate Cedric
Vasseur said traveling with Armstrong is like ``traveling with a
rock star.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong products have been good for Austin retailers, who are
seeing $58 official cycling jerseys fly off the shelves _ mostly to
fellow cyclists. Sun &AMP; Ski Sports Expo stocks the official team
jerseys, matching socks, hats and yellow T-shirts with sponsor
logos. ``Lance has been beneficial to cycling overall,'' said
general manager Jeremy Trudeau. ``It's not really about the sales,
but about broadening a lot of people's expectancy of the biking
industry. He's opening a lot of eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   That level of adulation comes as a surprise to Schinman at
Platinum Rye. ``Find anyone who can name a cyclist besides Greg
LeMond or Lance Armstrong. He's a B-level marketer, recognized in
his sport, but below the Jack Nicholas', Mark McGuire's, Ken
Griffey's or Kobe Bryant's.''
</P>
<P>
   The week after his 1999 victory, Armstrong appeared in a ``Just
Do It'' commercial by Nike, one of his longtime apparel and
equipment sponsors. Nike took out a double-page ad in Paris' daily
newspaper L'Equipe this week featuring Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is certainly one of our top overall athletes,'' said
spokesman Scott MacEachern. ``He's really proven himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike will continue to use Armstrong in its retail advertising
campaign, MacEachern said, adding that the cyclist is as marketable
as Woods, Marion Jones, Maurice Greene and Jordan. Nike spent about
$10 million on its Armstrong campaign during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Williams believes the nature, as well as the price of
Armstrong's future public appearances will change. With potential
offers of more money, Armstrong might choose to do more television
and print jobs. ``He can do those in one day, and they can use it
for the entire year, and spend more time training or with his
family,'' he said. ``I think he'll start charging more for his
television commercials, and he might increase his appearance
fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Schinman remained skeptical. ``He's not going to take a product
over the top,'' he said. ``Even if he won five Tour de Frances in a
row, he still wouldn't be in the upper echelon of spokespeople.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schinman said Armstrong might have more pull in Europe,
where cycling is a more visible sport, and with companies
interested in promoting cycling gear. But, he said, ``if you pulled
100 people aside and asked them if they even knew the Tour de
France were going on right now, most of them wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen companies, from the U.S. Postal Service to local
e-tailer bike.com, are paying Armstrong a minimum of $500,000
annually for endorsements and at least $250,000 to use the
cyclist's name or image in their commercial pitches.
</P>
<P>
   To earn his $5 million in endorsements, Armstrong has been
featured in eight national television commercials since August,
including three with Nike, as well as pictured on two Wheaties
boxes. He also has deals with American General Insurance, AIM
Mutual Funds, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Bridge Information Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts believe Armstrong has the potential to add even
more corporate clients. ``I wouldn't market him aggressively, maybe
the top companies with each industry,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Bike.com hopes to continue its two-year contract with Armstrong
at the end of this year, but remains cautious in the face of higher
prices. ``Lance has a reputation of being loyal to the people who
believe in him,'' said chief executive Bill Hayden. ``We don't know
what his needs are, but we'll try to understand and meet his
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also received a $400,000 book contract last year for
his autobiography ``It's Not About the Bike,'' which hit the
shelves in May. Two major studios are negotiating for film rights.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service team also has benefited from Armstrong's
presence. The team increased from 16 to 19 riders and has gained 22
sponsors paying a minimum of six figures to have their logos worn
on the team uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service certainly won't make the same mistake
Armstrong's former biggest sponsor made. In 1996, Cofidis, a French
revolving credit company, cancelled a $2.5 million contract to have
Armstrong on its racing team after it was discovered that he had
testicular cancer that had spread to his brain and lungs.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving chemotherapy, brain surgery and surgery to
remove his testicle, Armstrong made a comeback in 1997. In
co-operation with the Lance Armstrong Foundation, sponsor
Bristol-Myers Squibb to developed Cycle of Hope, a major cancer
education campaign. Since 1997, the Lance Armstrong Foundation has
raised $10 million to fight cancer, with approximately $600,000 of
that coming from Armstrong's pocket.

   (UNDATED) _ ``This is really, really hard,'' groaned President
Bill Clinton in the early hours of July 20, as he left Camp David _
a day late _ for the weekend G8 summit in Okinawa. For nine days
Clinton had been talking around the clock with Israelis and
Palestinians in one final pursuit of a Mideast peace treaty. One of
the greatest obstacles yet to overcome is the future status of
Jerusalem _ the deeply symbolic, coveted stone-built city which is
claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians as their capital. &QL;

jury decided on July 14 that America's largest tobacco companies
should pay $145 billion _ yes, folks, that's billions, not millions
_ in punitive damages to thousands of Florida smokers for damaging
their health. By awarding such an absurd figure, the jurors _ quite
inadvertently _ sent an important message: that it is high time
Americans abandon their misguided attempt to ``punish'' the tobacco
industry through lawsuits. &QL;

power. At the G8 summit of rich, democratic nations, which opens in
Okinawa on July 21, it will indeed be the odd one out. While the
other seven leaders from North America, Europe and Japan fret about
the digital divide, and the poor health and bad debts of the
world's hard-up nations, Russian President Vladimir Putin, by his
own admission, is struggling to avoid his country's relegation from
the big-power table to the ranks of the Third World. Putin knows
that, if Russia is to grow strong again, it needs to link its
future with the world's rich democracies _ the folk around the G8
table _ not the world's few surviving dictators. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ The Big Apple's media are easily bored, and the
Senate race between Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton was in
danger of being written off as the mother of all snores. So it was
with relish that they seized on reports that Hillary had once
called somebody a ``(expletive) Jew bastard.'' The New York Times
suggested that racist obscenities were unlikely to have been
uttered by ``one of the most politically correct people on the
planet,'' even if she has a foul temper. But Hillary still has
plenty of reason to worry: before the recent controversy, polls
showed her winning only 54 percent of the Jewish votes to Lazio's
34 percent. &QL;

   LA PORTE, TEXAS _ The Texas Independence Trail, a dreary stretch
of road on the outskirts of Houston, is lined with some of the
state's largest oil refineries and petrochemical plants. The trail
ends in the murky town of La Porte at the monument to the Battle of
San Jacinto. In the smog that hangs over this hallowed ground, it
is hard to conjure up images of 1836, when Texas soldiers crying
``Remember the Alamo!'' defeated the advancing Mexican army. If Al
Gore has his way, this place will generate a new rallying cry in
the closing the months of the 2000 presidential campaign:
``Remember La Porte!'' In its bid to undermine George W. Bush's
record as governor of Texas, the Gore campaign is painting a grim
picture of the state's environmental woes on Bush's watch. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although America remains, on average, a cheap
place to live by European standards, it has pockets where the
dynamism of the economy has fuelled not only tremendous growth in
wealth, but also steep inflation in the cost of living. The
sharpest price rises have come in the heartland of the new economy,
California's Silicon Valley. The average monthly rent for a
one-bedroom apartment in Palo Alto is $1,900, and the prices in
some complexes have jumped from $1,550 at the beginning of the year
to $2,200 in June. Buying is just as daunting: the median house
price in San Francisco's Bay Area is $370,000, compared with
$135,000 for the country at large. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ A ghost at Camp David has been America's Congress.
This week, as musing turned to the monetary rewards for peace, the
speaker of the House of Representatives, Dennis Hastert, wrote to
President Bill Clinton, tartly reminding him that Congress is the
sole authority for spending money. ``We expect to be kept fully
apprised of all aspects of the negotiations prior to entering into
any commitments,'' he warned. America bankrolled the first Camp
David agreement, between Israel and Egypt in 1978. If there should
be a second deal, might Congress scupper it? The possibility seems
real. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ This year's powwow of the rich world's leaders _
the G8 summit _ is taking place between July 21 and 23 on the
Japanese island of Okinawa. Since all the world's big economies,
except for host-nation Japan's, are in relatively good shape, there
is no real impetus for the economic navel-gazing and criticism that
has long characterized these get-togethers. So, with little chance
of big breakthroughs on big international controversies, the
summiteers will try to divert attention away from their differences
by talking grandly about development. The hot new topic will be the
``global digital divide.'' &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Russia has long thought of itself as a singular
power. At the G8 summit of rich, democratic nations, which opens in
Okinawa on July 21, it will indeed be the odd one out. While the
other seven leaders from North America, Europe and Japan fret about
the digital divide, and the poor health and bad debts of the
world's hard-up nations, Russian President Vladimir Putin, by his
own admission, is struggling to avoid his country's relegation from
the big-power table to the ranks of the Third World. Putin knows
that, if Russia is to grow strong again, it needs to link its
future with the world's rich democracies _ the folk around the G8
table _ not the world's few surviving dictators. &QL;

Senate race between Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton was in
danger of being written off as the mother of all snores. So it was
with relish that they seized on reports that Hillary had once
called somebody a ``(expletive) Jew bastard.'' The New York Times
suggested that racist obscenities were unlikely to have been
uttered by ``one of the most politically correct people on the
planet,'' even if she has a foul temper. But Hillary still has
plenty of reason to worry: before the recent controversy, polls
showed her winning only 54 percent of the Jewish votes to Lazio's
34 percent. &QL;

San Jacinto. In the smog that hangs over this hallowed ground, it
is hard to conjure up images of 1836, when Texas soldiers crying
``Remember the Alamo!'' defeated the advancing Mexican army. If Al
Gore has his way, this place will generate a new rallying cry in
the closing the months of the 2000 presidential campaign:
``Remember La Porte!'' In its bid to undermine George W. Bush's
record as governor of Texas, the Gore campaign is painting a grim
picture of the state's environmental woes on Bush's watch. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although America remains, on average, a cheap
place to live by European standards, it has pockets where the
dynamism of the economy has fuelled not only tremendous growth in
wealth, but also steep inflation in the cost of living. The
sharpest price rises have come in the heartland of the new economy,
California's Silicon Valley. The average monthly rent for a
one-bedroom apartment in Palo Alto is $1,900, and the prices in
some complexes have jumped from $1,550 at the beginning of the year
to $2,200 in June. Buying is just as daunting: the median house
price in San Francisco's Bay Area is $370,000, compared with
$135,000 for the country at large. &QL;

This week, as musing turned to the monetary rewards for peace, the

President Bill Clinton, tartly reminding him that Congress is the
sole authority for spending money. ``We expect to be kept fully
apprised of all aspects of the negotiations prior to entering into
any commitments,'' he warned. America bankrolled the first Camp
David agreement, between Israel and Egypt in 1978. If there should
be a second deal, might Congress scupper it? The possibility seems
real. &QL;

the G8 summit _ is taking place between July 21 and 23 on the

except for host-nation Japan's, are in relatively good shape, there
is no real impetus for the economic navel-gazing and criticism that
has long characterized these get-togethers. So, with little chance
of big breakthroughs on big international controversies, the
summiteers will try to divert attention away from their differences
by talking grandly about development. The hot new topic will be the
``global digital divide.'' &QL;

AUTHOR CRITICIZES NEW VOTING METHOD FOR EMMY AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Thomas O'Neil, a journalist who wrote a book
chronicling the history of the Emmys, is a raving zealot when it
comes to the television awards. So it's no wonder that O'Neil's
head comes close to exploding whenever he thinks about the upcoming
change in voting procedures. He predicts a calamity on par with
Pompeii.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest tragedies in show-biz history is about to
take place,'' said the author of ``The Emmys,'' first published in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the Emmys _ where no one, including critics, is ever left
entirely happy. The Emmy nominations were announced Thursday
morning, and while my skull is in no danger of flying apart, there
are certainly some areas that leave me with a headache.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list: Where is ``Malcolm in the Middle?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the first-year Fox comedy netted five nominations,
including an obviously deserving bid for Jane Kaczmarek for her
role as the terrorizing/terrorized mom Lois. But the rookie show
failed to get a nomination for best comedy. Wrong, wrong, wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The five nominees: ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' (CBS),
``Frasier'' (NBC),``Friends'' (NBC), ``Sex and the City'' (HBO) and
``Will &AMP; Grace'' (NBC)are all great, but ``Malcolm'' was simply the
funniest show on television this past season.
</P>
<P>
   Also not nominated was Kaczmarek's husband, Bradley Whitford of
NBC's ``The West Wing.'' (Another husband-and-wife team was
nominated: Michael J. Fox as best comedy actor for ``Spin City'' on
ABC and Tracy Pollan as best guest actress in a drama for NBC's
``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the White House drama's first season earned 18 nominations,
tying HBO's ``The Sopranos'' for most of any show this year. Both
are nominated for best drama along with last year's undeserving
winner, ``The Practice,'' ``Law &AMP; Order'' and the over-the-hill
``ER.'' A very early prediction: Look for the mob show to win as a
payback for last year's snub.
</P>
<P>
   The Emmy Awards will air on Sunday, Sept. 10, on ABC. Garry
Shandling will host.
</P>
<P>
   Other first-glance observations:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' (WB) earned a nomination for best
writing in a drama. That show deserves some recognition from the
academy; it's much, much more than some brat show.
</P>
<P>
   _ The wonderful ABC television movie ``Annie'' received 12
nominations, but none for Alicia Morton in the title role. She's
the best Annie I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Star Trek Voyager'' (UPN) received more nominations (seven)
than the great-but-grim HBO miniseries ``The Corner'' (four), which
received the same number of nods as the eminently forgettable ABC
musical ``Geppetto.'' A quirk of numbers, yes, but yeeeecccch. The
fact that Khandi Alexander is not nominated is so mystifying that
I'm torn between amusement and fury; young Sean Nelson also
deserved a nomination.
</P>
<P>
   _ NBC had the most nominations of any network with 97, followed
by HBO with 86, ABC with 64 and CBS trailing far behind with 41.
Fox had 26 bids, while the WB and UPN combined had the same number
of bids as PBS by itself (12).
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil is outraged about a decision by the Academy of Television
Arts &AMP; Sciences to change the way voting is done. Instead of
bringing voters into a Los Angeles hotel for a 48-hour viewing
binge of all the nominees' submissions, this year's episodes will
be sent to voters' homes.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, O'Neil said, is that voters, once subject to strict
monitoring rules, might not even watch the tapes, and instead vote
for shows based on reputation or the influence of friends.
</P>
<P>
   The old system ``guarantees every single nominee that their work
will be seen by every single voter,'' O'Neil said. ``It is all
being destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The author said the Academy changes were a result of the
organization getting hammered by critics after ``The Practice''
beat out ``The Sopranos'' for best drama last year. Critics' picks
can differ from Emmy voting: Writers often base their opinions on a
season of work rather than individual episodes. O'Neil fears the
new policy will decrease the chances for a deserving upset winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you realize from now on we will have a popularity
contest?'' he said. ``There is nothing less at stake here than the
next `Hill Street Blues' or the next `Cheers.'
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, say advocates of the change, noting that the old
system often limited the pool of voters to those able to make an
extensive time commitment (read: retirees). Academy officials said
the tapes will be watched at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the members of the Television Academy take the
Emmys quite seriously,'' Chairman Meryl Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil's predictions of disaster may be hyperbole, but the
academy is certainly put on notice.

CONNECTICUT COVERS THREE CENTURIES LIGHTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the New York art scene simmers down for the summer,
Connecticut museums offer a kaleidoscope of exhibitions that range
from American impressionism of the 19th century to video imagery
for the 21st, with Connecticut itself or art produced there as a
prime subject.
</P>
<P>
   You can see riches from London and local sources in New Haven
and Greenwich, visit a sprightly Calder display in Hartford,
explore the art of the video screen in Ridgefield, and in New
Britain follow part of the American Impressionist Art Trail, which
winds through the state.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, for the most part you're in green country, where
outdoor pleasures complement the art inside. Here is a rundown of
some art shows that give added dimension to Connecticut as a summer
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth Athenaeum
</P>
<P>
   Of Calder shows there is no end. But just when you think you've
seen enough of the wizard's work for a while, along comes another
irresistible opportunity. Such is the case with ``Calder in
Connecticut,'' at the Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford, a banquet of
more than 150 objects, including letters, photos and sketches.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania-born Calder (1898-1973) established a home and
studio in Roxbury in 1933. What's different about this show is that
all of it is drawn from Connecticut sources. Eric M. Zafran, its
curator, suggests that Connecticut influenced the style and content
of Calder's work in many ways, from the rolling terrain of its
hills to the flora, fauna and climate there.
</P>
<P>
   The artists, collectors and friends with whom Calder surrounded
himself in this rural retreat of New York culturati also helped
stimulate and shape his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Works on view range from the monster orange stabile
``Stegosaurus'' (1973), 50 feet high and weighing 40 tons, a
permanent installation on the Athenaeum's grounds, to his first
wood sculpture, the small ``Very Flat Cat'' of 1926, a reclining
feline made from an old oak post found on a visit to a friend in
the hamlet of Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings, drawings, rug designs, jewelry, toys and personal
mementos _ many of them gifts bestowed by the artist _ augment the
fancy-free mobiles and stabiles in which the show abounds.
</P>
<P>
   Calder's connection with the Wadsworth was for life. His work
first appeared there in a 1935 show at the invitation of the
museum's dynamic director, Chick Austin. Of the three entries in
that show, ``Little Blue Panel'' (1935), an electrified mobile in
which a spindle and two balls rotate at different rates, was bought
by the Athenaeum for $75. One of the first Calders to enter a
museum collection, it is in the current show, still doing its
little act in an overall brilliant presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Yale University Art Gallery
</P>
<P>
   An important artist from Calder's era was Philip Guston
(1913-1980), whose work shares the spotlight with two other
exhibitions at the bustling Yale University Art Gallery in New
Haven. In 1967 Guston made a shocking transition from his
established mode of lyrical abstract expressionism to figurative
painting of a cartoony, often bizarre nature that made some critics
gag. But Guston, ``tired of all that purity,'' wanted to try his
hand at what he called storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   This small but stimulating show explores the four-year period of
his transition, focusing on an ``alphabet'' of individual images he
developed for his new work: Klan-like hoods, bricks, cups, clocks,
picture frames, an easel and so forth, each painted on a small
panel. The crudity of the images is offset by lush painting and a
robust color sense.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the full-scale canvases that Guston worked his alphabet
into are on view, like ``Riding Around'' (1969), in which three
Klannishly robed figures with big cigars tour the city in a
menacing black open jalopy. Some of his earlier abstract
expressionist works from the '60s are also displayed. Altogether
the show gives an illuminating glimpse of the work of an artist
courageous enough to make a drastic change.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way spiritually from Guston to Gothic Revival, but
physically, just a step. The first-floor galleries also house
``Modern Gothic: The Revival of Medieval Art,'' an exploration of
Gothic Revival architecture in the United States and Britain from
1830 to 1875.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 objects _ paintings, sculptures, architectural
drawings and models, along with furniture and decorative objects _
are on display, including the work of American talents including
Alexander Jackson Davis and Richard Upjohn, and the British
architects A.W.N. Pugin and Sir Charles Barry.
</P>
<P>
   Gothic Revival came about from the yearnings of some scholars,
artists and clergymen for the purity of pre-Renaissance days. The
show focuses on the style as it was used in houses, churches, civic
buildings and universities (including, of course, Yale), and on the
patrons who commissioned it and the reasons they did so.
</P>
<P>
   Anglophilia, the novels of Sir Walter Scott and the appeal of
picturesque ruins were some factors that influenced Americans, as
seen in a rendering of Lyndhurst, the medieval-looking stronghold
in Tarrytown, N.Y., originally designed by Davis in 1838 for a Gen.
Paulding and redone by him around 1865 for George Merritt, a
wealthy New York businessman.
</P>
<P>
   A useful feature is that the exhibition catalog is a guide to
Gothic Revival architecture still standing in the Northeast,
combining architects' drawings with modern photographs and even
providing itineraries. So even after it closes, this show goes on.

LAWYERS GRILL EX-IRISH PRIME MINISTER IN CORRUPTION PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ The official interrogation and humiliation of Ireland's
former prime minister, Charles J. Haughey, began in earnest Friday
as lawyers began grilling him on accusations of soliciting some $12
million in bribes, gifts and kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   As he arrived at Dublin Castle, where the nation's most
far-reaching investigation into corruption is being held, Haughey
was showered with abuse by about two dozen demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   They threw pennies at him, shouting that the coins were
``legitimate campaign contributions'' compared to the millions
Haughey is alleged to have solicited from businessmen, mostly
property devleopers, from 1979 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haughey! Haughey! Haughey! Jail! Jail! Jail!'' they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey accumulated a fortune during his three terms as prime
minister. He lives in a $30 million, 300-acre estate lined with
fine art, some of it given to him by businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey ignored the taunts, but once inside the ornate Georges
Hall where Justice Michael Moriarty is presiding over the tribunal
probing widespread influence-peddling, his humiliation continued.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's session resembled the first round of a boxing match, as
Haughey and his interrogators took a measure of each other. As he
did in 1997, when he admitted he took $2 million from supermarket
magnate Ben Dunne, Haughey Friday claimed his financial matters had
been handled by his close friend, Des Traynor, who has since died.
</P>
<P>
   But tribunal counsel John Coughlan made it clear that he intends
to prove that Traynor is nothing more than a conveniently dead
scapegoat and that Haughey ran his own finances. Backing his
claims, Coughlan produced a series of embarrassing memos from
Allied Irish Bank, which spent most of 1974 trying to force Haughey
to pay some $350,000 in debts.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey sat impassively as Coughlan read the memos aloud. In
one, a banker complained that Haughey had a ``proclivity toward
making arbitrary, unauthorized'' withdrawals. Another concluded
that Haughey's ``living expenses are huge and totally unrelated to
his ... salary.''
</P>
<P>
   Still another said, ``Mr. Haughey is quite irresponsible in
money matters. He cannot be trusted.'' Long before he settled his
debts, Haughey was Ireland's finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   One plaintive memo from an exasperated banker who had tried to
get Haughey to pay his debts seemed to encapsulate the allegations
against Ireland's most charismatic, controversial leader of the
last century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haughey,'' the banker wrote, ``has abused our confidence and
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   As Coughlan read the embarrassing memos, Haughey momentarily
glanced at the ceiling, where three elaborate crystal chandeliers
hang, and then to the lime green walls adorned with chiarascuro
paintings, the sort of artwork that Haughey filled his mansion with
and is accused of buying with money shaken down from people wanting
to do business in Ireland during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey acknowledged to Coughlan that he was financially
overextended in 1974. At the time, Haughey had been banished to the
backbenches of his Fianna Fail party as punishment after being
narrowly acquitted of criminal charges that he had supplied weapons
to the Irish Republican Army after civil unrest broke out in
Northern Ireland in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was borrowing from Peter to pay Paul,'' Haughey said.
</P>
<P>
   So far has Haughey's esteem fallen that an Irish journalist
sitting in the press gallery remarked in a stage whisper, ``Sure,
Charlie, but what did you get from the other 10 apostles?'' Several
people snickered at the remark.
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal lawyers plan to grill him on how he allegedly pocketed
most of the $300,000 he raised for the liver transplant of his
close friend and deputy prime minister Brian Lenihan, who has since
died.
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal lawyers also want to ask Haughey how he suddenly paid
off the Allied Irish Bank in 1979, just before becoming prime
minister. By that time, his debt had grown to more than $1.5
million but he abruptly settled it after being a deadbeat for five
years. A developer claims he gave Haughey nearly half of the money
needed to settle the debt, but tribunal lawyers will be pressing
Haughey to name the other contributors.
</P>
<P>
   If Haughey refuses to name those who gave him money, the
tribunal lawyers say they will try to make him pay the cost of the
investigation, which so far is about $10 million. That will make
little dent in Haughey's estimated $150 million war chest.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the witness stand Friday, Haughey paused to sign an
autograph for Pat Cahill, a teacher. Haughey probably assumed that
Cahill was a fan, but Cahill later revealed himself to be anything
but.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very angry with Mr. Haughey,'' said Cahill, who asked for
the autograph as a souvenir rather than out of admiration.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks Haughey should be jailed, as do about two-thirds of
Irish people, according to recent polls. Cahill, 55, said his two
daughters had to move to Boston to find work as waitresses at Irish
pubs in the city's Dorchester section, while he and other Irish
workers were told by Haughey to tighten their belts in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like so many other young Irish people, my daughters had to go
abroad to find work. They had to live in Savin Hill (part of
Boston) instead of at home, and I was unable to get a pay rise
while Charlie Haughey and his cronies were getting rich. It isn't
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Haughey is nearly 75 and undergoing treatment for
prostate cancer, Moriarty said he would limit Haughey's testimony
to two hours a day. The tribunal will break for the summer next
Friday, meaning that Haughey will return to the stand in Septem
ber, and could remain there through much of the early fall.

 UNDATED: goes on.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Britain Museum
</P>
<P>
   The New Britain Museum of American Art is a prime stop on the
so-called Impressionist Art Trail, a group of Connecticut museums
with significant collections of American impressionist art. So it
is altogether fitting that the museum has mounted what it calls the
first major treatment of Connecticut impressionists in several
decades, with no fewer than half the 70 paintings in this mixed bag
of a show drawn from its permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   Before the turn of the century, the shoreline art colonies in
Connecticut _ Cos Cob, Lyme and Mystic among them _ were a hotbed
of artists influenced by the French movement.
</P>
<P>
   Those who either lived in Connecticut or spent extensive periods
there included Childe Hassam, Julian Alden Weir, John Twachtman,
Theodore Robinson and Willard Metcalf, but there were plenty of
lesser-knowns as well as later also-rans who produced weak American
translations of the work of their French predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with this show is that it includes too many of the
latter, with the time line going all the way to the 1950s, well
past the golden age of American impressionism.
</P>
<P>
   Hassam, whose work looms large here, is best represented by a
big oil, ``On the Way to the Grand Prix'' (1887), a Paris scene of
horse-drawn carriages carrying fashionable revelers. A couple of
black-and-white etchings and lithographs uphold his reputation as a
printmaker. Weir, whose work is the subject of a comprehensive show
at the Bruce Museum, shines with ``Windham From Mullins Hill''
(circa 1895), a lyrical rural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights include ``Noank, Conn.'' (1905) by Walter
Griffin, a peaceful late afternoon scene on the water in pale blue
light, and two lovely floral still lifes (circa 1885) by a
little-known artist, Charles Ethan Porter, inspired by the French
painter Henri Fantin-Latour.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Moment's Rest'' (undated), a poignant but light and airy
rendition of a mother watching her sleeping child, is the work of
another artist whose name rings few bells today, Louis Paul Dessar.
Although a bit late in the game, Ernest Lawson's large ``Spring
Tapestry'' (1930), a thawing landscape seen through a screen of
bare trees, makes a good impression.
</P>
<P>
   In short, this overly ambitious anthology offers the good, bad
and indifferent. A little editing would have helped.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Museum
</P>
<P>
   Another stop on the Connecticut Impressionist Art Trail, the
lively Bruce Museum, has zeroed in on the work of Julian Alden Weir
(1852-1919), whose Weir Farm _ his home and studio straddling
Ridgefield and Wilton _ is now a National Historic Site. ``A
Connecticut Place: Weir Farm, an American Painter's Rural Retreat''
displays more than 70 paintings, some by prominent artists who
visited him there, among them Hassam, Twachtman, John Singer
Sargent and Albert Pinkham Ryder.
</P>
<P>
   Weir, who began as an academic painter and whose impressionist
phase lasted only a decade, starting about 1890, is also
represented with some of his friends in the ``Connecticut
Impressionists'' show at the New Britain Museum. He acquired the
farm in 1882, and it became not only a beloved refuge from city
life but also the subject of more than 250 of his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Outstanding among those shown at the Bruce in Greenwich are
``Lengthening Shadows'' (1887), a view along a winding path framed
by young trees to a sunny hilltop; ``Landscape: Branchville, the
Palace Car'' (early 1890s), a softly lighted springtime reverie
that includes a small shack on runners, known as the Palace Car,
that was drawn by oxen to different painting sites; and the
strongly brushed ``High Pasture'' (1899-1902), a gentle, summery
impression of rolling land, trees and shadows that tilts toward
abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   In his painting Weir never strayed far from the figure, and a
few figure and portrait subjects are also shown here, but the focus
of the show is rightly on landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby gallery ``Earth's Elusive Shores: The Art of Mapping
After 1500'' provides a fascinating look at how mapmaking evolved
after Gutenberg's invention of movable type, the voyages of
Columbus and other Europeans and the translation of Ptolemy's
second-century ``Geographia'' from Greek into Latin.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 50 maps on view from the 16th and 17th centuries
range from crude, ill-informed endeavors to models of accuracy for
their day. They include treasures like Heinrich Buenting's
cloverleaf world map of 1581 with Jerusalem as its center, and
``Atlas of the Whole World'' (1570) by Abraham Ortelius, famed for
its beauty and fidelity to known fact.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrich Museum
</P>
<P>
   Eleven artists, some well known, some not, present videotapes
and mixed-media installations in this live-wire (to use an
old-brain term) show, meant to explore how the wily video medium
can affect the viewer's sense of time. ``Speed of Vision'' is the
Aldrich's first full video show, and to put the concept across, the
Ridgefield museum has divided itself into three ``time zones'':
slow motion, real time and hyperspeed. Hold on to your hat.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely on the slow-motion side is Nam June Paik's ``Buddha
Watching TV'' (1974-2000), a rare event in this artist's manic
work. A Buddha head, half buried in dirt, is in front of a
television monitor on which a similar Buddha head appears. The two
eye each other motionlessly, presumably until the end of time.
</P>
<P>
   Hovering on the very edge of hyper is Charles Atlas' ``Martha,
Martha, Martha, Martha, Martha,'' a tribute to the choreographer
Martha Graham. In it shots of Graham and dance images from every
source you can think of, including a series of nightclub events
previously devised by Atlas (even Martha Stewart appears,
presumably because of her name), are made into a five-monitor
collage that beguilingly blitzes the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   The better attractions also include Annika Eriksson's deadpan
``Connecticut Firefighters Pipes and Drums,'' a tape of a community
marching band in full regalia performing with military precision,
projected at movie-screen size in the same gallery where it was
shot, and Matthew McCaslin's ``Bloomer,'' a 12-monitor speeded-up
spectacular in which flowers appear as buds that, in split seconds,
miraculously burst into bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be passed up either are Jonas Akerlund's ``Ray of
Light,'' in which, to music by Madonna, the passage of a frenetic
24-hour urban day is compressed into five minutes of fly-by
imagery, and Doug Aitken's powerful ``Diamond Sea (Linear
Version),'' a rhythmic photographic essay on the desert, coast and
well-guarded diamond mines of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   Give it real time; by and large ``Speed of Vision'' is more
rewarding than not.

 CAN REITs BECOME A TECHNOLOGY PLAY?  
 (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By SANA SIWOLOP  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real estate investment trusts have played yin of late to the
technology sector's yang.
</P>
<P>
   When the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index has risen,
shares of REITs have generally fallen, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts and money managers suggest that investors look
to certain REITs as technology plays in and of themselves. They
point to the growing number of REITs that are either actively
investing in technology to improve their businesses, or that cater
to the real estate needs of e-commerce companies, which often
require huge distribution facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts recommend that investors also keep tabs on those
REITs that are busy rolling out new high-speed, high-bandwidth
telecommunications and Internet services for their tenants. These
companies, they say, are poised to benefit from the federal REIT
Modernization Act of 1999, which, when it takes effect in January,
will allow REITs to widely offer nontraditional services like
landscaping, parcel delivery, concierge services and
telecommunications _ to their own tenants as well as to other
parties.
</P>
<P>
   REITs are now allowed to generate only 5 percent of revenue from
such ancillary services. The new law is ``probably the biggest
development in the REIT industry since 1986, when REITs were
permitted to both own and manage real estate,'' said Anthony R.
Davis, an analyst at UBS Warburg Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some experts say investors may be getting carried away if
they think that the REIT sector will furnish the world's next Cisco
Systems. Arthur J. Hurley, portfolio manager for the SSGA/Tuckerman
Active REIT fund, said technology, at least in the near term, would
benefit REITs mostly by allowing them to operate more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley pointed to AvalonBay Communities of Alexandria, Va., an
apartment REIT that is already using an Internet-based system for
leasing and managing its properties. ``It's not too early to look
for technology plays in this industry, but it's too early to look
for revenue streams,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, as REITs keep focusing on owning or managing real
estate, Davis said, only 4 to 5 cents a share in funds from
operations typically come from ancillary services.
</P>
<P>
   But that's for now. He said income from ancillary services would
grow at least 20 to 40 percent annually over the next four to five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Jay P. Leupp, a managing director at FleetBoston Robertson
Stephens, said the industry's overall technology investments might
account for 10 to 20 percent of its revenue by the end of 2002.
While bullish on the technological promise of REITs, Leupp urged
investors to scrutinize the managers of REITs that are moving into
new service areas.
</P>
<P>
   Davis agreed. ``The mistake that some REITs will make is to go
too fast and too much, and lose sight of their core businesses, so
it all boils down to management, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the industrial real estate market, Leupp says two early
leaders are ProLogis Trust of Aurora, Colo., and AMB Property of
San Francisco, which is already building large distribution
facilities for electronic commerce companies like the Webvan Group,
the online grocer. As for office REITs, he says he thinks the
leader in that market is Equity Office Properties Trust of Chicago,
which is aggressively rolling out high-tech telecommunication
services to its office tenants. Leupp also likes Spieker Properties
of Menlo Park, Calif., which owns and manages both office and
industrial space.
</P>
<P>
   Among shopping-center REITs, Leupp likes Pan Pacific Retail
Properties, an operator of strip centers that is based in Vista,
Calif. He says it has invested in a service that lets shoppers do
online comparison-shopping among tenants of the company's shopping
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Leupp and Davis say the Simon Property Group of
Indianapolis is the technology leader among REITs that are focused
on malls. They cite the 50 percent stake that Simon holds in
MerchantWired, a high-speed communications network that will
provide retailers with services like the ability to authorize a
credit card purchase in less than two seconds.  &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Here's a tip: Appreciate a good
waitress
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I love good waitresses. If I had my way, along
with Mother's Day and Secretary's Day, there would be a special day
to honor good waitresses everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, not all waitresses everywhere are good. Here's a
couple of waitress stories, one good and one bad.
</P>
<P>
   Story No. 1:
</P>
<P>
   An older fellow, obviously a cafe regular, had been kidding with
the waitress, no youngster herself, since he sat down at his booth.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were they on a first-name basis, it seemed that they
were also neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've noticed you had a lot of company visiting this week,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Lordy, yes,'' she sighed. ``Too much, if you want to know
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   She was sort of an Aunt Bea type from the old TV series ``The
Andy Griffith Show,'' and worked her tables quickly and
efficiently, bustling from one to another with a friendly word for
each customer.
</P>
<P>
   But anybody can make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lookee here,'' the older fellow said, raising his voice to
reach her several tables away. ``I ain't got no spoon. I ain't got
no ice water. I ain't got no _ ``
</P>
<P>
   At which point she broke into song:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahhhhhhhhhhh ain't got nobody,'' she warbled, ``and nobody
cares for me!''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling grandly, she added, ``Do you remember that old song?''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she returned with a spoon and a glass of ice water,
he was still laughing, and so was most everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Good waitress!
</P>
<P>
   Story No. 2:
</P>
<P>
   A man came into a cafe at noontime, sat down on a counter stool
and, holding the menu in one hand and massaging his swollen jaw
with the other, considered the choices.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress, a younger, no-nonsense type, had her pencil poised
to take his order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just come from the dentist,'' he said, wincing as he
spoke. ``I'm not sure I can manage to chew much of anything, but
maybe an egg sandwich would be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   She shook her head and frowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We serve egg sandwiches only at breakfast,'' she said, her
lips pursed. ``You'll have to select something from the lunch
menu.''
</P>
<P>
   The customer made a groaning noise. At the same time, so did the
man sitting on the stool next to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, come on,'' the other fellow said to waitress. ``He's just
had his teeth worked on. He doesn't have any other choice. Surely,
it can't be that much trouble to fix him an egg sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   The waitress paused, thought for a half-moment, but then shook
her head again.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're using the grill for hamburgers and -- ``
</P>
<P>
   ``And you can use the grill for eggs, too,'' he said, his voice
a bit stern, his glare a bit demanding. ``Just this once, all
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Without a word to either of them, she whirled around and stomped
off toward the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``One ... egg ... sandwich,'' she all but yelled.
</P>
<P>
   The man with the sore mouth turned to his benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' he said, nodding. ``Thank you very much!''
</P>
<P>
   And he got his egg sandwich, ate it, paid his bill and left,
never knowing that the man next to him just happened to be the cafe
owner.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't have known, either, that the particular waitress _
who couldn't be agreeable even with her boss, much less the
customers _ would soon be looking for a new job.
</P>
<P>
   Bad waitress. Good story.
</P>
<P>
   (P.S. Observe Good Waitress Day every day. Tip generously.)

KELLEY GOES BACK TO SCHOOL WITH NEW FOX TEACHER DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ He has done lawyers on ``L.A. Law,'' ``The
Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal.'' He's done doctors on ``Chicago
Hope.'' He's even done small-town folk on ``Picket Fences.''
</P>
<P>
   But David E. Kelley says he has been wanting to do a series
about teachers for a long time, and, like an assignment for extra
credit, he just never got around to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blessing of a series being successful, like `The Practice'
and `Ally McBeal,' is also a curse that you've got to wait before
you get to the next one,'' the prolific writer/producer said. ``So
this has been gestating with me for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice'' are still going
strong on Fox and ABC, respectively, on Oct. 23 Kelley will give
birth to Fox's ``Boston Public,'' another ensemble drama about
imperfect people trying to do the right thing, usually for the
right reasons, sometimes for the wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, who grew up in the Boston suburbs and went to law school
at Boston University, says teachers are his heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that teachers are the most powerful people in
the world and the least recognized,'' he said. `I've just always
admired the commitment that teachers have, how they stay committed
in the face of a world that is so often without immediate reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, whose portrayal of heightened reality usually gets him
in hot water with the particular group he is depicting, will no
doubt hear from educators who don't appreciate some of the antics
of his characters on ``Boston Public,'' but he is steadfastly
unapologetic in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you knew the stories that I'm already getting from teachers
_ `You wouldn't believe what's happened to me' or `You wouldn't
believe what's happened in our school' _ a lot of those things I
won't dare tell in the first few episodes because you'll think it
couldn't be true,'' Kelley said. ``But those things are happening,
and maybe one of the reasons they continue to happen is that there
is an ignorance out there that these kinds of things don't go on.''
</P>
<P>
   When last we saw special agents Mulder and Scully, the former
appeared to be taking a trip on an alien spaceship, and the latter
revealed she was in a family way.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be? Mulder gonzo? Scully prego?
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carter, the man with all the answers when it comes to
``The X-Files,'' says we'd better believe it. 'Course, this is the
same guy who once said the series would end after seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares for an eighth, Carter told TV critics this week
that David Duchovny will appear in 11 of the 20 episodes this
season and that Robert Patrick (``Terminator 2'') will come aboard
to play special agent John Doggett.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett will be the new man in Scully's life, but not her
partner in any sense. Carter describes Doggett as a ``knee-jerk
skeptic,'' a by-the-book FBI veteran who is as much an insider as
Mulder is an outsider. (And for all you baseball fans, the name
Doggett was inspired by Jerry Doggett, former broadcast partner of
L.A. Dodgers play-by-play man Vin Scully, the inspiration for
Gillian Anderson's Dana Scully.)
</P>
<P>
   Carter is aware that Duchovny's occasional appearances on the
show and Patrick's addition to the cast may eliminate the sexual
tension between Mulder and Scully that has always given ``The
X-Files'' its special cachet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's afraid of change,'' he admitted. ``Everyone says,
`That's what made the show work, and that's what's great about the
show.' That's true, David and Gillian are the reason for the show's
great success. But that doesn't mean you can't threaten the
paradigm, you can't threaten the model, you can't threaten the
relationship. I think, dramatically, you'd better do that every
once in a while, or else you're going to have a very stale show.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's season premiere is scheduled Nov. 5.

 UNDATED: he asked. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a result, turnover on customer service desks runs as high as
100 percent per year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One author has even suggested that dissatisfaction has to do
with customers' experiences with good service. Dr. Leonard Berry, a
professor of marketing at Texas A&AMP;M University and author of
``Discovering the Soul of Service'' (Free Press, 1999), agreed that
service was not good. ``I give service in America a C minus,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Berry added, people's expectations for
service are rising. ``We want better service even though we think
we'll get worse service,'' he said. ``And part of the reason is
because we have experienced excellent service enough to know that
it's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the explanation, there seems to be no dispute about the
reality of the decline. Complaints to the Better Business Bureau
have risen sharply in recent years, said Ron Berry (no relation to
Leonard Berry), senior vice president of the Council of Better
Business Bureaus in Arlington, Va. Even so, Berry added, only a
small percentage of disgruntled customers actually file formal
complaints to bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Barany, an educational consultant in New York, is a
conspicuous exception. In March, she bought a Sony VAIO notebook
computer at Data Vision, a computer retailer in Manhattan, but she
was unable to get the computer to work properly. After several
rounds of phone calls and repeated trips to the store, she sent off
a raft of letters and copies to the Better Business Bureau, Sony,
The New York Times, Data Vision and American Express, whose card
she used to pay for the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, last month, Data Vision allowed Barany to exchange her
computer for a less expensive IBM Thinkpad. The difference in price
was issued as a store credit.
</P>
<P>
   But Barany is unhappy with the store credit. She wants a refund.
</P>
<P>
   Every dispute has at least two sides. Jim Garson, a vice
president of Data Vision, said that there was nothing wrong with
Barany's laptop and that all it needed was a software patch for the
internal modem. He said that he had offered to install the software
for her but that she had declined. By allowing her to trade for the
newer computer, he said, he took a loss on the old one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take back a notebook three months later, especially
when there's nothing wrong with it,'' he said. ``How much more
customer service can you give?''
</P>
<P>
   Garson said many of the complaints against his store were
unfounded. One customer called Garson to say she had bought an
Olympus camera a year ago and seldom used it, so she wanted to
return it, he said. ``I said: `Ma'am, there's nothing I can do. Try
to sell it on eBay.''' She complained to the Better Business
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers do not feel satisfied unless they make themselves
heard. Julie Kennedy, a corporate lawyer in San Francisco, is a
customer service maven if ever there was one.
</P>
<P>
   On the phone, she always presses ``0'' immediately to reach a
human. She shops only in stores that will give refunds, and she has
no qualms about firing off a letter if she is dissatisfied. ``I
think there's a social contract that goes beyond courtesy,''
Kennedy said. ``You pay someone money and you expect to be valued.
It ticks me off when I find people so oblivious to that
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy also makes a point of sending a letter when she
stumbles upon excellent service.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Kennedy called United Airlines to reserve a
flight to Ireland, using her free miles. Dodging the thicket of
blackout dates made the task look formidable until she found an
agent as interested in making the trip work as she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying everything,'' she said. ``I was on the phone
with him for over two hours. He tried every date, every time, and I
got to use my free tickets.'' She sent a letter of praise to the
airline.
</P>
<P>
   Another consumer who keeps careful watch over the service he
gets is Jim Hobby. He has a professional interest in the subject as
well: he is vice president of customer client care at Gateway and
has spent 25 years in the customer service business, including time
at American Express and Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids call me the client from hell,'' he said. ``They say
when they're out with me and I get this look, they run, because
they know someone is going to get my lecture on what customer
service should be.''
</P>
<P>
   What customer service should be, he said, is a collection of
thoughtfully placed ``pleases'' and ``thank yous,'' combined with
careful listening. These are known as soft skills. ``It's showing
that you care and you want to work with the customer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Service via live chat is growing in popularity, Hobby said, and
so is the use of e-mail for such interactions. Gateway has also
simplified its automated phone system in response to what Hobby
described as a great deal of customer frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining is getting easier in some places. Many companies
that emphasize customer service, like American Express, now let
customers dispute charges on line.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Business Bureau has seen a rise in the number of
online complaints it gets. And a growing number of sites dedicated
to filing gripes are cropping up online.
</P>
<P>
   One such site, called uGetHeard.com, allows consumers to send
both gripes and praise. Complaints are followed by efforts by
uGetHeard.com to resolve the disputes. The average resolution is
small _ around $50 _ but the gratification for the customer is
beyond measure, said Michael Chen, the site's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said he was inspired to set up the site after a
particularly unpleasant experience he had last spring at a private
mailing center in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he went to mail
a package. After paying, he grew nervous when he saw that no one
was wrapping the package, so he decided to do it himself.
</P>
<P>
   But when an employee demanded that he pay for the sealing tape
he was using, he protested. After a while the manager emerged from
the back. ``She said: `You're really irritating. We're too busy to
deal with you,''' Chen recalled. ``I've never been spoken to like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   That was all the impetus he needed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jason Gill is clocking 80 mph in his green Miata convertible,
heading north out of San Diego. The 31-year-old computer software
consultant is doing what he often does on weekends _ looking for
someplace new to live. He hates the idea of giving up his bungalow
one block from the beach in La Jolla, Calif. But three years after
he moved in, the neighborhood is not what it once was.
</P>
<P>
   The couple next door have had a baby, and with the lots so close
together, Gill can hear every wail and whimper. The family on the
other side has a baby girl and two young sons who used to peer at
Gill through the grape-stake fence until he replaced it with a
solid redwood one. Now the boys use that fence as a soccer goal.
The teen-agers down the block have formed a rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Countless fences divide the American landscape, and while some,
like race, loom large and visible, others are deceptively
transparent, subdividing people who are the same except for the
choices they have made. Mothers with jobs vs. mothers without.
Those who own guns vs. those who would abolish them. Smokers vs.
nonsmokers. Home-schoolers vs. public-schoolers vs.
private-schoolers. And, most recently and vociferously, those who
have children vs. those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   We believe we can see through these fences; we can even pretend
they aren't there. But like mottled glass, they warp and distort,
so that what we see from where we stand is not how things look from
the other side. As the mother of two young sons and as a writer on
work-life issues, here's what I see when I look at the world:
parents who are stressed. Workplace policies that try to ease that
stress but can go only so far. The cost of child care and summer
camp and orthodontics, which makes it tough to save for tomorrow's
cost of college.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Jason Gill sees when he looks at that same world:
colleagues who are stressed, yes, but only because they choose to
have children. Employers who expect people like him to work longer
hours so that employees who are parents can balance their lives.
Benefits packages full of maternity leave, pregnancy coverage,
dependent health insurance and other benefits that mean parents
effectively earn more than nonparents. Infants who cry during
R-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   He is hardly the only one with that view. An organization called
No Kidding! which schedules social events for those who remain
childless, had just two chapters five years ago; today it has 47.
And there is no way to count the number of ``child free'' sites
online (with names like Brats! and
alt.support.childfree.moderated), but together they make up a
parallel and expanding universe where the printable names for
children include ``anklebiters'' ``crib lizards'' and ``sprogs.''
In this world, couples in which one parent stays home are called
SITCOMS (Single Income, Two Children, Oppressive Mortgage). Those
enlightened enough not to have children are THINKERS (Two Healthy
Incomes, No Kids, Early Retirement).
</P>
<P>
   There have always been people with children and people without.
Why all this anger now? The answer lies in the confluence of nearly
every major social and economic trend of the past 30 years. Start
with the birth control pill, which transformed parenthood from an
assumption to a choice. Add the women's rights movement, which sent
women into the workplace in record numbers. Mix in the baby boomers
(who have produced a baby boomlet of their own) and technology
(which allows infertile couples and gay and lesbian couples to have
children). Then there's the fact that, statistically, parents are
older and more affluent, meaning youngsters can now be found
everywhere _ at the theater, in upscale restaurants, kicking the
back of your airplane seat. The world as we know it can sometimes
seem infested with children.
</P>
<P>
   When I first heard the phrase ``child free,'' I rolled my eyes.
Here's another politically correct and therefore politically loaded
term, I thought, and a combative one at that. It smacks of
eradication, like ``smoke free'' or ``pesticide free.'' Those who
use it, however, say it's not about hating children (some do; some
don't). ``Childless'' has connotations of loss or regret; ``child
free'' implies satisfaction and deliberate choice. To be child
free, they argue, means giving far more thought to not having
children than most parents give to having them.
</P>
<P>
   Melody Fohr, 30, who works as a telephone operator at a national
chain store outside of Pittsburgh, has a similar story. ``I knew
from an early age that I didn't want to be a mommy,'' she says.
``It just never appealed to me. I was never a kid like the other
kids. It took the relatives a long time to realize that I never
played with dolls. They kept buying them for me.''
</P>
<P>
   I have heard this tale before. In fact, I have lived this tale,
to a point. When my friends began producing newborns, I held them
awkwardly, and only when I couldn't find a way out. Four years into
my marriage I was still waiting for my maternal urge to kick in,
and when it didn't, I closed my eyes and took a leap of faith. Not
until my son's first smile did I catch the fever and become a
besotted parent.
</P>
<P>
   It might be easy to find a moral here, but those who call
themselves child free warn the rest of us to stop assuming that
they will somehow see the light. ``No one goes up to the
goo-goo-eyed mother of a baby and says, 'I'm sure you'll change
your mind,''' Gill says. In fact, he would argue that my life is an
example of how society pressures people to have children against
their better judgment. There would be fewer neglected children, he
says, and fewer stressed and miserable adults, if more people felt
free not to reproduce. ``This isn't some cute stage that I'll grow
out of,'' he says. ``It's a legitimate life choice.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the last day of school at Prior Lake High School in
suburban Minneapolis, and Elinor Burkett wanders the halls,
gossiping with the graduating seniors. Burkett, 53, is the author
of ``The Baby Boon: How Family-Friendly America Cheats the
Childless,'' a book that accuses parents of wanting ``their child
and their Lexus, too'' and describes having children as ``squirting
out spawn.'' (Burkett doesn't actually use that term herself, but
approvingly quotes someone who does.)
</P>
<P>
   Burkett's next book will be about a year at Prior Lake, which
means she has spent an entire year with teen-agers. When I comment
on the fact that the ``Betty Friedan of the childless'' has
surrounded herself with children, she dismisses it as missing the
point. Too many childless people, she says, focus on the wrong
things _ the undisciplined toddler at the next table; the
insensitive comment by Aunt Marge. ``This isn't about hurt
feelings,'' Burkett says. ``This is about a political and economic
structure which relegates the childless to second-class citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of Burkett's list of targets is the federal tax code,
which has long allowed a ``dependent deduction'' ($2,800 at the
moment, which is worth about $784 to a family taxed at 28 percent).
To that is added a dependent-care credit (up to $4,800 in expenses
for two or more children, which is worth about $960 to that same
family) or, if sponsored by an employer, a dependent-care spending
account (up to $5,000, worth $1,400). Then, in 1997 _ ``just when
political consultants became obsessed with soccer moms'' _ Congress
added a $500 per child tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett is in favor of the deduction for dependent care. ``That
says that we as a society believe that those people who take care
of dependent people _ children or adults _ need some help. I don't
have a problem with that.'' Nor would she have had a problem, she
says, if Congress had increased that existing deduction by $500 so
that it applied to all dependents. But by creating a tax credit
solely for the care of children, she explains, ``we said implicitly
that we think that socially that's more valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   How is this different, I ask, from something like a mortgage
deduction, in which the tax code is used to shape behavior or
reflect social priorities?
</P>
<P>
   It isn't, Burkett replies, adding that mortgage deductions are
just as arbitrary. ``There are renters who are not terribly happy
about it, I can tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the tax credits would not infuriate her if they were not
part of a definite and very recent trend. During the 106th Congress
alone, she says, dozens of bills designed to lighten the tax burden
of parents were introduced, including ones that would increase the
child tax credit to $900. Most ``absurd'' of all, she says, is an
executive order, signed back in May, prohibiting discrimination
against parents in all areas of federal employment. Forget the fact
that the White House could not produce a single convincing example
of a parent who had actually faced such discrimination, Burkett
says. More troubling to her is the fact that the law takes sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``If employers are refusing to hire or promote parents because
they believe they won't work as hard as nonparents, that's
unconscionable,'' she says. ``But I also think that if that is
illegal, discrimination against nonparents should be illegal as
well. Why not bar discrimination on the basis of family status? Why
not make it illegal to presuppose that a nonparent is free to work
the night shift or presuppose that nonparents are more able to work
on Christmas than parents?''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the workplace, which promises to be the
bloodiest beachhead in the brewing war between parents and
nonparents. From where I sit, the increasing insistence by
employees that employers accommodate their lives has been a welcome
revolution _ and I don't think that ``revolution'' is too strong a
word. But where I see progress, Burkett sees something else
entirely. All these fancy benefits, for instance, like on-site
child care, and even the most basic ones, like health insurance for
dependents, are examples of perks the childless are not getting.
</P>
<P>
   A more rational approach, she suggests, in a voice that says,
``See, I can be reasonable,'' is a ``menu'' of benefit options.
Every employee would be given a dollar allotment for benefits that
they might divide as they choose. A parent might spend most of
those dollars on health insurance. A nonparent might choose
additional vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   When the conversation shifts to workplace flexibility, Burkett
loses her ``let's be reasonable'' tone. ``Every time someone takes
off for that sick child or that school conference, then someone
else has to pick up the extra work,'' she says. ``And the
supposition on the part of management almost always is that the
person without kids is more able _ and it's true _ to do that than
a parent. And it happens again and again and again. After a while
you're doing two jobs for one salary.''
</P>
<P>
   The unwritten rule at work here, Burkett says, is that people
with greater needs should receive more, and people with fewer needs
should do more, which goes against the doctrine of equal pay for
equal work and is a step back to the days when married men were
paid more than single men because they had families to feed.
Childless workers have ``had it up to here'' with this, she warns,
and those childless workers are the one of the fastest growing
segments of the work force. The childless also make up nearly 10
percent of registered voters, meaning employers and politicians
better start to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Already there are signs that the ``child free'' are taking a
page from Burkett, who has become a cult figure in these circles.
``The book put hard numbers to my feeling of being ignored by
politicians and my vague sense of being ripped off in general,''
Jason Gill says. ``I've gotten more politicized,'' he adds. ``I
used to keep my mouth shut to be polite, but now I'm more willing
to tell people what I think.''
</P>
<P>
   I spent weeks interviewing childless people, and hearing how
sick they've become of parents who chatter endlessly about their
children. In fact, escape from that kind of talk was one reason
Jerry Steinberg, a Canadian schoolteacher, became ``founding
nonfather'' of the group No Kidding! in the first place.
``Conversations with my child-burdened friends became monologues,''
he says. ``I'd say, 'How's it going?' and they'd bombard me with
information about the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jason Gill well knows, the ``child free'' do not live in a
world by themselves. Sylvia Ann Hewlett, a Harvard-educated
economist who founded the National Parenting Association, said at a
recent meeting of the organization: ``There are 63 million
parents'' _ of children under 18 _ ``in the United States, and if
they were to vote as a bloc they could swing the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett is the co-author (with Cornel West) of ``The War Against
Parents,'' and from her side of the looking glass parents are
anything but pampered and powerful. Everywhere parents turn, she
says, they are told they are doing a bad job _ simultaneously
ignoring and spoiling their children so that they grow into obese
adolescents whose reading and math scores are low and who are
likely to blow up the school cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing represents this backlash better than what Hewlett calls
that ``contemptible'' book. ``Baby Boon'' (which mentions Hewlett
numerous of times, none of them complimentary) ``is making my blood
boil,'' she says in an interview in the association's offices in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pernicious, it's brand-new, it's gaining traction,''
she bristles, as she proceeds to take ``Baby Boon'' apart fact by
fact. Yes, there is a new per-child tax credit, she says, ticking
her objections off on her fingers, but that paltry $500 hardly
``redistributes the nation's wealth to those with children,'' as
Burkett claims. Hewlett says the standard dependent deduction has
decreased as a percentage of income, and parents are getting far
less help from the government than they did a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That deduction,'' she fumes, ``is one of the things she harps
on because it's one of the few things you can hang your hat on
because it's one of the few things parents do get.'' But look at
the cost side of the balance sheet, she says. She points out that a
two-parent household with an income of up to $62,000 a year will
spend about $160,000 to feed, clothe and shelter a child until the
age of 18. Quoting data from a 1998 study, Hewlett says that
childless women now earn 90 percent of what their male counterparts
earn, while mothers earn only 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett's contention that benefits packages and family-friendly
policies are de facto bonuses for parents also rankles Hewlett. How
many working parents, she asks, actually receive such benefits?
According to a 1998 study by the Families and Work Institute, 46.8
percent of companies with 100 or more employees offer a
family-friendly package that includes flex time, paid parental
leave and child-care assistance. But, Hewlett points out, ``We must
remember that the majority of women work for firms smaller than
this, and these firms typically offer much less.''
</P>
<P>
   In France, new mothers are guaranteed 16 to 26 weeks of paid
maternity leave. In Ireland, children are welcomed everywhere
(including the family-friendly local pub). If parents are to get
all they deserve, Hewlett argues, they must flex their political
muscles as well as their economic ones.
</P>
<P>
   The language of politics over the past four years hints that
this is happening. Gun control used to be about reducing crime; now
it is about protecting children. The fight against smoking used to
be about lung cancer; now it is about Joe Camel's influence on
youngsters. ``It's absolutely exploitative and disgusting,'' Gill
says.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett, not surprisingly, sees progress where Gill sees
pandering. Framing policies in terms of children, she says, is the
only way to challenge the belief at the core of the ``child free''
worldview _ that caring for children is in no way an obligation of
the childless. The dismissal of parenting as a ``choice'' is
``outrageous,'' Hewlett says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This assumes that having a child is the moral equivalent of
buying a boat or getting a manicure,'' she says. ``True, not having
children is an option for each individual. In some cases it is an
honorable choice. But childlessness is not a choice for society.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonparents have heard that before, and point out that
overpopulation is a bigger problem than underpopulation, and that
parents rarely decide to be parents out of a perceived obligation
to humankind. Parents have children, nonparents say, because they
are selfish _ because they want a baby to coo over, or a genetic
link to the future, or the family of their own childhood dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this whole debate can be distilled down to the word
``selfish,'' and Ruth Wooden, president of the National Parenting
Association, throws it right back at the child free. Parenting, she
says, means ``realizing that someone else's needs are more
important than your own.'' In that way, she argues, becoming a
parent means becoming ``a grown-up,'' and as the percentage of
childless adults increases, the result is a society that is ``not
as mature.''
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, my answer to those who think my life intrudes on
theirs is simple: Every person with children was once a person
without children, so you have to take our word when we say we can't
do it without help and without spilling over into your space all
too regularly. The life of any given parent is more complicated,
stressful and expensive than the life of that same person would be
if he or she were not a parent. Feel sorry for us if you'd like.
Avoid us if you need to. And, in several decades, when the children
are grown, we can all live side by side again, in child-free
retirement homes.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you first think about it, it's a no-brainer. When the final
stages of mapping the human genome were hyped last month, both
President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain called
for a swift, extensive ban on using genetic information to
discriminate in employment or insurance. Clinton had already signed
an executive order back in February, banning such discrimination
for federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, both politicians had polling data to support them.
A 1998 survey of 1,000 randomly selected Americans found that 63
percent of them balked at any genetic testing if an employer or
health insurer could have access to the data. So a ban on genetic
discrimination not only secures privacy and fairness; it also
protects good research by reassuring study volunteers that the
information they provide is in completely safe hands.
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like? Well, quite a lot, actually. Like most
notions that command almost universal assent, the proposed ban on
genetic discrimination makes far less sense the more you think
about it. A few brave souls, like the writer Michael Kinsley, have
pointed this out, but even he admitted that he wasn't sure what
conclusion to draw. So here goes: genetic discrimination, however
troubling, is both rational and inevitable. And the sooner we get
over our hand-wringing, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the analogy to racial discrimination. It's bogus. The
point of laws against racial bias is to outlaw irrational
discrimination based on irrelevant characteristics. The point of
laws against genetic discrimination is to outlaw rational bias
based on relevant information. The two principles aren't merely
different; they're opposite. We perform individual, rational acts
of discrimination all the time. In fact, it would be hard to
function without them. Deciding not to put an art historian in
charge of a nuclear power plant is not bias but common sense.
Similarly, discriminating against a blind person when hiring a
baseball umpire is certainly not a function of hostility to blind
people in general and wouldn't even be illegal under the Americans
with Disabilities Act. Sure, it's discrimination _ but it's
rational discrimination and is not, and shouldn't be, illegal. So
why should genetic discrimination?
</P>
<P>
   The best answer to this is that most genetic information is
speculative. It doesn't tell you what a person is; it tells you
what she may be. Right now, it could tell an employer that a job
applicant might have a propensity for heart trouble in the future,
or for Parkinson's disease. Within the foreseeable future, it might
even reveal that a person's genetic spatial skills are particularly
good or that her verbal fluency is genetically high. But it won't
tell you what a person has actually made of her natural gifts or
whether she might be lucky and avoid certain likely genetic fates.
It might tell you that a person has the genes to make a fine
pianist, but it won't tell you if he has practiced or even knows
how to read music.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's executive order rested on this distinction. It bans
the use of genetic testing to determine if a person has a
propensity for being bad at a certain job or for having a specific
physical ailment in the future, but it allows such testing to see
if a person has an actual existing condition that makes him less
able to perform a certain task. So it's O.K. to test if a fighter
pilot has a genetic condition that makes him liable now to have a
sudden heart attack on the job; but it's not O.K. to test him to
see if his genes suggest that he could develop Alzheimer's in
preretirement years.
</P>
<P>
   I get the distinction. I just don't see the ethical difference
between using genes to hazard future performance and using other
means to do so. After all, we already use countless ways of
discriminating rationally on the basis of the likelihood of future
ability. What else is an SAT score, if not an attempt to predict
future performance? Or a garden-variety letter of recommendation?
What are these but predictors exactly analogous to genetic testing
_ not destiny as such, but pretty reliable guides? The real
question, then, is, Why should imprecise and often dangerous
predictors (like SAT results) be morally acceptable but more
precise methods (like genes) be morally repugnant? If anything,
genetic testing for future capacities is less objectionable because
it's more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Most of our current worries stem, of course, from insurance.
What's to prevent insurers, we fret, from demanding genetic tests
to see if someone is more likely to have breast cancer or heart
disease than another random person? The result could be the end of
insurance pools as we know them. But it's worth noting one thing.
Genetic testing is not a reversal of the principle behind
insurance; it's just an elaboration of it. All insurance is about
predicting the future based on imperfect knowledge of the present.
The point of genetic testing is to give us a better idea of the
present and future. Young single males, for example, have a harder
time getting car insurance than married middle-age women. We accept
this principle as a recognition of reality. But why is it less
objectionable than testing individuals for a genetic predisposition
to high blood pressure? At least that doesn't extrapolate from a
general population to an individual.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening is that the veil of ignorance that once covered
our inner lives is wearing increasingly thin. The change will
thrill and dismay us, whatever our politics. It seems to me, to
take one obvious consequence, that socialized medicine is now all
but inevitable. It's inevitable not because it's inherently better
than an insurance-based system. It almost certainly isn't. It's
inevitable because the ignorance on which an insurance-based system
necessarily rests is slowly disappearing. We'll either have to
force insurers to ignore glaring, easily obtainable facts relevant
to their business - and see the numbers of private entrepreneurs
prepared to enter the market gradually shrink - or we'll have to
make it illegal for individuals with great genetic results to use
and market that information to insurers for cheaper coverage.
Eventually, as the writer Clive Crook has argued, the private
sector will either be so expensive it will be beyond most of our
reach or so regulated it will look like a public system anyway. In
the long run, only the government will be dumb enough or
enlightened enough to mandate a national insurance pool that works.
</P>
<P>
   Simply ban all genetic testing of any kind? That would mean
losing a historic chance to cure countless diseases and develop
unique health strategies for individuals who will want them.
Prevent employers and governments from testing? Sure, but what do
you do when private individuals get their own tests done and then
bring them to job interviews? How do you practically stop an
employer from being influenced by that information in a free
society? And if some employers are high-minded enough to keep their
eyes shut in a fiercely competitive market, others will realize
that ignorance is too costly a financial risk to bear.
</P>
<P>
   The twists won't end there. As the potential for rational
discrimination grows, the space for old-fashioned bias may shrink.
Men and women will increasingly be judged not by the color of their
skin but by the content of their chromosomes. The irrational
cruelty of bias will be replaced by the rational cruelty of fate.
In retrospect, we may miss the evils we could do something about.

 By ELIZABETH WEIL  
 c.2000 Elizabeth Weil  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a story about wealth and space and America and Russia,
and it begins with one man, Walter Anderson _ 46 and worth almost a
billion dollars. He lives in Washington _ the city he grew up in, a
city he hates; his hatred of the government is, as he puts it,
``personal'' _ in an apartment adorned with a painting he
commissioned based on a Smashing Pumpkins lyric, ``I am still just
a rat in a cage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we are,'' Anderson explains, ``rats in a cage. And
we're going to gnaw through the bars because we've got about a
30-year window here, and we'll starve if we don't get out.'' The
cage Anderson refers to is Earth itself, and he has taken it upon
himself to ensure we get off. In 1989, Anderson gave $80,000 to the
International Space University; in 1991, $100,000 to the Space
Frontier Foundation; in 1995, $5 million to start the Foundation
for the International Nongovernmental Development of Space; and
between 1996 and 1999, $35 million to build the Roton, a manned,
reusable spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few months ago, in one of our periodic check-ins, he
rang me up. ``I'm calling from the little phone!'' he said. ``I'm
in Russia!'' Anderson was midway through three days of talks with
Yuri Semyonov, president of the private Russian space corporation
Energia, and in a move that would later marginalize NASA from the
Anderson-Russia-America love triangle, he was arranging on behalf
of a new company, called MirCorp, to lease the space station Mir.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had been dreaming of leaving Earth since he was a
little boy. He wired the Russians $7 million before he even signed
Mir's lease. Anderson put up $21 million in seed money toward a
lease that will eventually cost $200 million a year. It will give
MirCorp the rights to Mir for the remainder of its lifetime, the
use of two or three manned Soyuz rockets and two or three unmanned
Progress rockets annually, exclusive control over Mir's visitors
and technologies, 40 days of active operation and the privilege of
fixing Mir up. All of this has put Anderson more cozily into bed
financially with Energia, thereby creating a situation highly
threatening to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The American space agency, after all, was already embroiled with
the Russians in the way-over-schedule, way-over-budget, politically
Pollyanna-ish International Space Station, a project announced 17
years ago under President Ronald Reagan, one that was already the
subject of several congressional hearings and that space patriots
in Washington were determined to make ``the only space in space.''
Specifically, at the time Anderson leased Mir, NASA was blaming the
Russians for being two years behind in launching the service
module, or living quarters, for the International Space Station.
(It was finally launched on July 11.)
</P>
<P>
   A less brusque man than Anderson might have chosen to sweet-talk
and pacify the NASA brass. But Anderson is arrogant in such
matters, and is, as he terms himself, an anarcho-capitalist. He
flies around the world in his private jet pledging allegiance to
the laws of global free trade. Thus, instead of calling NASA,
Anderson called his friend Chirinjeev ``Baboo'' Kathuria, 35, a
megamillionaire Sikh. Kathuria told Anderson that he, too, was
``interested'' in Mir, which in megamillionaire-speak meant he was
willing to chip in $4 million to help form MirCorp and start
upending the last century's notions of international relations in
space.
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp is registered in Bermuda, run out of Amsterdam and
structured as a 40-60 partnership with Energia (38 percent of which
is owned by the Russian government). Anderson's plans include
rehabbing the station and expanding its volume to nine or 10 times
its present size. He wants to sell joy rides on Mir to wealthy
individuals (Dennis Tito, a 59-year-old money manager and former
rocket engineer, is the first to sign on, planning to spend 10 days
on Mir sometime early next year) and advertising on Mir to
commercial companies (``We'll paint it up like a Nascar'').
Anderson expects to offer access to Mir equipment to corporations
and governments and to sell intellectual rights on Mir's
considerable patents so that, as Anderson puts it optimistically,
``NASA won't be able to build so much as an air lock without paying
MirCorp something first.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he intends to move into even more dubious but
potentially lucrative markets, like in-orbit satellite assembly and
satellite repair. I do not know if Anderson's vision amounts to a
dream or a pipe dream, a gift or a curse.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is loose-limbed and gangly, with an oddly
unused-looking body. He favors black jeans, suede sport coats and
moccasins. Ever distrustful of his fellow men, he zealously guards
his personal privacy; his name is not on the marquee of his office
in Washington, and neither are the names of his companies. In the
alternative space underground, which Anderson has bankrolled pretty
much singlehandedly, he is known, by those who know him at all, for
being generous, ruthless, overimpassioned, incisive, philanthropic,
libertarian and shy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Anderson was one of the first 300 employees at MCI; in
1984 he founded Mid Atlantic Telecom, a regional long-distance
carrier and the first to integrate phone and voicemail service.
Seven years later he started Esprit Telecom Group, cracking into
the newly deregulated European market. That same year, he created a
British Virgin Islands-based holding company called Gold &AMP; Appel,
named after ``The Golden Apple,'' the second volume in the 1970s
sex-and-conspiracy-theory cult pulp trilogy, ``The Illuminatus!
Trilogy.'' He has more or less doubled his capital every year
since. In 1998, Anderson sold Esprit for $1 billion in stock and
assumed debt. He presumed he would need all that money to build
rockets and space colonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now with this Mir thing,'' Anderson says, tapping the tips of
his fingers together, ``if it works, it's such a nice shortcut.''
</P>
<P>
   I ask if it won't make NASA extremely nervous _ a lone,
superwealthy ubercitizen challenging its authority and dominance in
space?
</P>
<P>
   ``In my life,'' he says, his eyes lighting up like a
teen-ager's, ``if the U.S. government doesn't try to kill me, I
probably won't have succeeded in meeting my long-term goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Among spacers _ the polite name for space obsessives _ such
sentiments are not uncommon. Anderson was 4 when Sputnik flew, 15
when Neil Armstrong first stepped on the moon, 19 when Eugene
Cernan left the last moon-dusted boot mark. And Anderson still
seems not to have recovered fully from the magic of those memories,
from the implicit promise, now broken, that someday soon we will
all be living in the heavens, shouldering power packs and wearing
jumpsuits in a better, higher, lighter world.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old, 130-ton Soviet space station Mir, designed to
orbit only five years, has been spinning almost a decade beyond its
expected life. The station suffers many nicknames _ the porcupine,
the dragonfly _ most referring to its ungainly assortment of
modules and solar arrays. Inside, it's sorely in need of
remodeling. For the past 10 years, the station has been beset by
significant money problems. As early as 1992, top Russian officials
were comparing their own space program to a chicken: ``You cut off
its head, and it runs around the yard for a while thinking it's
still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the late 1990s, Mir suffered a string of high-profile,
high-altitude disasters _ a collision, a fire, several massive
computer shutdowns _ troubles so vast and so economically
intimidating that Energia's president, Semyonov, decided to deorbit
his outpost and call in his final crew. NASA, ever covetous of
Russian resources for the International Space Station, waxed
ecstatic. That is, until in a move that the chairman of the House
Science Committee would call ``a real kick in the jaw,'' Anderson
flew in his jet to Moscow to meet with Semyonov, playing the board
game Risk on the way. Among the first things Anderson said to
Semyonov was, ``I don't necessarily agree with the views of my
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's first foray into the commercial space sector proved a
huge debacle. He financed the development and construction of what
he hoped would be the first generation of privately financed manned
space transports: the Roton rocket, a vehicle initially conceived
to be 65 feet tall and shaped like an upturned egg. On the skyward
end of the Roton, four rocket-tipped rotor blades were to flail,
while the landward end would feature a 22-foot-diameter rotating
rocket engine ringed with 96 fuel nozzles, each slightly larger
than a can of Coke. When complete, the Roton was to be the world's
first single-stage-to-orbit, fully reusable rocket. But when the
project ended, Anderson had instead spent $40 million on the
oddest, tallest helicopter on earth. In its last flight test, the
Roton flew 1,400 yards down a runway in Mojave, Calif., at a speed
of 53 mph and an altitude of 75 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's second foray, MirCorp, seems to be going better,
thanks largely to his decision to handle MirCorp, he says, ``like a
business,'' something almost all other private space companies
neglect to do. To make MirCorp financially sound, Anderson joined
forces with a newcomer to the space world, his fellow telecom
tycoon Kathuria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mir is definitely a real business,'' Kathuria says,
``definitely undervalued'' and ``definitely cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Anderson not amassed nearly a billion-dollar fortune from an
offshore holding company or had he not nurtured a libertarian
obsession with government evil, you might wonder if he has
intentionally upset the historic and economic status quo. But
Anderson is a 21st-century antihero. He clearly knows how to
manipulate economic arrangements to produce the effects he wants.
Thus you have to assume it's by design that the Russians sound
swoony and triumphant about the MirCorp deal (``Investment not so
good from their part,'' a chief Energia officer gloats, suggesting
he outmaneuvered Anderson) while Daniel Goldin, the NASA
administrator, sounds defensive, embarrassed and left out. ``My
feelings are bruised,'' Goldin uncorks effusively in a thick Bronx
accent from his Washington office. ``I have a hurt. I'm not saying
MirCorp shouldn't have done what they did. I'm just saying I'm in
the book, they've got my number and it might have been nice if they
called.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin sounds conflicted and disrespected, like a sidelined
mafioso. Conflicted because, theoretically at least, he favors
space commercialization. ``Competition is great!'' rings one of his
mantras. Under Goldin's watch, NASA has contracted out some $3
billion annually with fledgling space businesses. At the same time,
however, his lumbering bureaucracy has burned through, almost
literally, some $60 billion on the International Space Station. In
1999, NASA suffered one of its worst years ever, losing two robotic
Mars landers.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich credited Goldin with making ``space as boring as
possible.'' The Economist magazine dubbed the International Space
Station ``the black hole in the sky.'' Thus Goldin is sincere in
saying, ``If MirCorp can finance Mir and get an unsubsidized
positive cash flow, I think that's fabulous!'' But he also finds it
deeply humiliating to explain to Congress why (a) he lacks the
clout to force the Russians to abandon Mir and meet their
International Space Station milestones and (b) a certain
international financier is able to negotiate far better prices with
the Russians than he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that money is being diverted,'' Goldin
protests, intimating that the Russians may be siphoning money from
the International Space Station and dumping it into Mir. ``I'm just
saying the arithmetic doesn't add up. I read in the papers that
private United States investors paid $20 million for six weeks of
operation of the Mir space station, a Soyuz vehicle, a Progress
vehicle. They got the operations center. They got the training. And
now I understand they're going to get another flight up there? The
Russians charged us, last year, $65 million for one Soyuz vehicle!
And $135 million for two! I'm just saying that it's frustrating,
year after year, when the Russian government doesn't give us any
vehicles to work with. So like I said, I have some bruised
feelings. And the arithmetic! I'm confused.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, MirCorp will send Dennis Tito, its first
citizen-explorer, into orbit. Energia will provide Tito with rocket
transportation and cosmonaut training while NASA, on the sidelines,
will continue feeling bruised and hurt, continue its public
kvetching, continue exerting pressure on Putin to dump his old heap
into the sea.

<P>
   Political junkies, fear not: The Internet has got your fix.
</P>
<P>
   As the television networks retreat from coverage of the
Democratic and Republican national conventions this summer, dozens
of Internet sites are poised to take up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   From the skyboxes to the convention floor, keynote speeches to
behind-the- scenes chatter, online journalists will be converging
on the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia and the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in heretofore
unimagined numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, there were two of us covering the conventions for
online magazines. This time there will be hundreds, maybe
thousands,'' said Jacob Weisberg, chief political correspondent for
the online magazine Slate.
</P>
<P>
   While the networks turn up their noses at gavel-to-gavel
coverage of the conventions, Web operations like America Online,
Voter.com, Pseudo.com, C-SPAN.com, FedNet.com and many more will be
beaming live coverage of the quadrennial political gab-fests to
desktops around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the television networks scale back their coverage of the
political conventions, we are stepping up ... convention
programming,'' said Kathleen deLaski, director of political
programming at America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Both conventions have designated special areas for online media
for the first time: Internet Alley for the Republicans and Internet
Avenue for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Keenan, deputy director of the Senate Press Gallery, said
the gallery issued convention credentials for more than 70 online
organizations and that doesn't count those that applied through the
Radio and TV Gallery and the Periodicals Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has definitely been a dramatic increase. Last time we
had only one online news service apply and it went out of business
before the conventions began,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the lack of any real political drama, all of the major
networks are planning to scale back coverage of the conventions.
ABC is opting to air exhibition NFL football games on the opening
nights of both conventions. Wider coverage is planned on cable
stations C-SPAN, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC. The Republican
convention begins on July 31 and the Democratic one on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``First off, the networks are not going to be providing much
coverage,'' said Michael Bustamante of Voter.com. ``Secondly, with
the Internet, individuals have the ability to get the information
they want when they want it. If it's 1 in the morning and they're
just getting home, they can look at what's going on and everything
they missed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is fast becoming the medium of choice for political
junkies, according to a survey done for American University's
Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,005 people taken last March found that 19 percent
said the Internet is a ``very important'' source of political news,
while another 32 percent said it is ``somewhat important.''
Eighteen percent said it was ``not very important'' and 21 percent
said it was ``not important at all.''
</P>
<P>
   What that means for Internet news and entertainment sites is
that a sector of the public is hungry for the kind of
around-the-clock political coverage only the Web can provide.
</P>
<P>
   The online news operations see the conventions as an opportunity
to demonstrate the advantages of a medium that is not reliant on
ratings like the networks and not tied to deadlines and delivery
restraints like newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Some predict that the around-the-clock coverage capabilities of
the Internet could lead to changes in the conventions themselves,
which have been tailored over the years to meet the needs of the
prime-time media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem for us that the conventions are still revolving
around the broadcast media, so all the major events are happening
in the evening. Things might be different next time around once it
becomes clear that daytime events will be covered,'' said Keith
Carney of FedNet, which will be providing live video feed from the
conventions to Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   David Bohrman, CEO of Pseudo.com, said he expects the Internet
to have the same kind of effect on the conventions that television
did when it was first used at the 1948 Republican convention, also
held in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years ago, TV technology changed politics by ushering in
the era of the sound bite. This year, (Internet) technology will
open up the process again,'' Bohrman said. Pseudo.com will
broadcast live video from skyboxes at both conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Pseudo and the television networks in the skyboxes is
America Online, the nation's largest Internet service provider with
22 million subscribers. AOL plans live gavel-to-gavel coverage of
the events and ``24-hour access to newsmakers and events.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the explosive growth in use of the Internet since the
1996 convention, technological advances also are contributing to
the massive increase in online coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Most important is the increase in bandwidth that speeds the flow
of data between computers and allows video signals to travel the
Internet. The technology is far from perfect, though, and the video
images most people will see will be no bigger than a playing card.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology wasn't there in '96,'' said FedNet's Carney.
``There was audio technology, but there was not sufficient video
technology during the last election. That's where the real change
will be seen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most innovative new technologies to be offered for
the conventions come from Congressional Quarterly, which will be
feeding hourly reports to hundred of reporters and others via
wireless Motorola two-way e-mail devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition to get information out has never been this
intense,'' said David Rapp of Congressional Quarterly. ``It's a
whole new world in the political news business.''

 ART ADV: 2 photos, of Siefker (NNS1) and fossil (NNS2). 
 By MARY KATE FRANK And MARK MUELLER  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In August 1960, three teen-age boys with a passion for old bones
made the discovery of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Siefker, Michael Bandrowski and Joseph Geiler,
dust-covered fossil hunters who regularly plumbed the earth for
ancient secrets, knew there was something important about the
winged reptile they found embedded in the rock of a North Bergen
quarry.
</P>
<P>
   They were right.
</P>
<P>
   Little bigger than a dragonfly, Icarosaurus siefkeri, as the 200
million-year-old relic would later be called, took the scientific
world by storm, showing that vertebrates glided through the air far
earlier than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, the once-famous fossil is again grabbing
attention.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 27, Siefker, who maintains possession of the prehistoric
prize that bears his name, will put it on the auction block for a
minimum bid of $250,000. The Los Angeles auction house handling the
deal suspects the fossil could fetch much more.
</P>
<P>
   But the sale, which Siefker contends is necessary to help pay
medical bills he incurred after suffering a debilitating stroke, is
tinged with controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Some paleontologists call the idea of an auction an appalling
intrusion of modern commercialism into a scholarly field that
traditionally shuns such acts.
</P>
<P>
   And Siefker's old digging partners were unaware the fossil even
had been removed from the American Museum of Natural History in New
York, its resting place for three decades before Siefker demanded
its return in 1989. Geiler and Bandrowski said this week they had
no idea Siefker was planning to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Both dispute that Siefker, 56, unearthed the fossil on that
overcast afternoon in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it,'' Bandrowski, 55, of Cliffside Park, N.J., said
this week when alerted to the auction. He declined further comment.
It was unclear whether he plans to seek a portion of the fossil's
sale price.
</P>
<P>
   Geiler, also 55 and now living in Cambridge, Ohio, backs up
Bandrowski's account. Moreover, as Geiler remembers it, Siefker
wasn't even there when he and Bandrowski struck archaeological
gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went home with Michael,'' Geiler said. ``Some time later,
Mike showed it to Al, and immediately Al wanted to bargain for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Geiler said Siefker, then 16, made Bandrowski an offer for the
fossil that he couldn't refuse: a telescope and $30. Today Siefker,
who lives in North Bergen, says he doesn't remember the trade,
though in a 1989 newspaper story about the fossil he acknowledged
the deal. But he insists he helped unearth the fossil. ``It was
like seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Geiler, for his part, said he isn't particularly troubled by the
auction. ``At this point, science has already studied it,'' he
said. If the money from the Icarosaurus will help Siefker's health,
then the sale ``is not the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   To this day, the find, the only complete imprint of the
Icarosaurus siefkeri, remains a significant one.
</P>
<P>
   The creature lived an estimated 200 million years ago, in the
late Triassic period, predating dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx,
evolution's first true bird, by 50 million years. Resembling a
large dragonfly, the Icarosaurus measured 7 inches long and
stretched 10 inches from wingtip to wingtip.
</P>
<P>
   At the time it was found, the Icarosaurus became the oldest
airborne vertebrate known to scientists. Its discovery was a
monumental event that shed new light on prehistoric times.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiling the fossil with great fanfare at the American Museum
of Natural History in New York in 1961, Edwin H. Colbert, then the
museum's chairman, said the discovery upended science's known
timetable on animals' first airborne efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proves that vertebrates attempted flight some 10 million
years earlier than anyone suspected,'' Colbert said.
</P>
<P>
   The shape of the fossil's delicate webbed wings and its
elongated ribs indicated the creature couldn't actually fly,
Colbert said. Instead, the Icarosaurus siefkeri glided from tree to
tree, in the manner of a flying squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   Avid amateur fossil hunters who hoped at the time to become
paleontologists, Siefker, Geiler and Bandrowski prowled North
Bergen's Granton Quarry at every opportunity, collecting dozens of
fish fossils dating back hundreds of millions of years.
</P>
<P>
   Over long hours, they patiently chipped at pieces of soft black
shale, gingerly sifted through dirt and carefully studied what
others might regard as mere rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Geiler called the discovery of the Icarosaurus ``pure, dumb
luck.'' He remembers spending hours helping Bandrowski extricate
the bones as the sky grew dark and a soft drizzle began to fall.
The two boys were 15 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that Mike was very excited that he might've found
something that was extremely different,'' Geiler said. ``That was
probably the reason why we stayed longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Siefker soon became the bones' caretaker. Museum officials later
named the creature after him, a customary honor bestowed on fossil
finders.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, Siefker kept the Icarosaurus in the bedroom of
his West New York home. Using needles, he cleaned the specimen
carefully ``every night till I got tired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling it was very important,'' he said. ``I was very
careful with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But during one of the nightly cleanings, Siefker punched a hole
in the creature's left arm bone. Worried, he told his science
teacher about the mishap and was advised to take the fossil to the
American Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, Siefker turned over his prized relic to the museum
for ``safekeeping,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, he said, gave him a receipt stating that the fossil
was on loan for study purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The museum spent months cleaning and studying the fossil before
putting it on display in April of 1961.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   All three boys, hailed as heroes by the national media, were
present at the exhibit's unveiling. Time magazine noted their
achievement on April 14, 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Siefker's fame, however fleeting, lasted slightly longer than
the exposure enjoyed by his teen-age buddies. At one point, he
appeared on the popular television game show ``To Tell the Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Smitten with science more than ever, the three friends worked
together after school in the museum's vertebrate paleontology
laboratory, cleaning specimens and preparing them for study.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the creature -- previously unnamed -- was designated the
``Icarosaurus siefkeri.'' The museum's action irritated Siefker,
who claimed scientists promised him he could choose the moniker.
Siefker's choice: ``Siefkerosaurus.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 30 years, Siefker was content to leave the fossil
with the museum. That changed in 1989, when Siefker, with no income
at the time, decided to sell the piece.
</P>
<P>
   When the museum balked, Siefker sued the revered institution for
$60 million. The museum relented.
</P>
<P>
   With the Icarosaurus back in his possession, Siefker shopped it
around, seeking $5 million, said David Herskowitz, a natural
history specialist for California-based Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield,
which is handling next month's auction.
</P>
<P>
   Informing Siefker the price was too high, the auction house
declined to sell the fossil, Herskowitz said, adding that Siefker
also pitched the petrified remains to museums. There were no
takers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Siefker was dealing with the effects of a
stroke he suffered within a year of reclaiming the fossil.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, mounting medical bills persuaded him to lower his
selling price.
</P>
<P>
   When the auction takes place next month in Los Angeles, it will
be simulcast in the agency's San Francisco office and carried live
over the Internet, Herskowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's priceless,'' he said of the fossil. He added that he has
received more catalog requests for the Icarosaurus sale than for
any other natural history auction.
</P>
<P>
   While the auction house expects bidding to reach $350,000,
Herskowitz said he wouldn't be surprised if dinosaur fever drives
the price considerably higher.
</P>
<P>
   But if Herskowitz and Siefker are optimistic about the prospects
of a bidding war, some paleontologists are hoping the auction is a
bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good fossils ought to be in museums where they get proper care
and attention,'' said Colbert, the former chairman at the American
Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Now 95 and working as a research assistant at the Museum of
Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Colbert said the chance that the
fossil could end up with a private owner is reason enough not to
auction it off at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``In private collections, they usually suffer damage or are
lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Icarosaurus fossil, Colbert added, is particularly
vulnerable because of its delicate, hollow bones.

to prove not only that the speech in question is false, but also
that it was published with a reckless disregard for the truth. In
England, the burden is in the other direction: The offending speech
is presumed to be false, and it is up to defendants to prove that
it is in fact true. That tends to have a dampening effect on what
newspapers print and what publishers include in books, especially
when the material is likely to offend someone who is powerful, rich

SO YOU WANT TO BECOME A CORPORATE DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corporate boards aren't what they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The average length of tenure is dropping and turnover is rising.
More seats are going to outside directors. Chief executives are
joining fewer boards, the better to focus attention on the ones
they choose.
</P>
<P>
   This evolution, over the last decade, has made boards better at
dispensing tough, objective advice, say corporate governance
experts, and may even be playing a role in American companies'
current run of success.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes also mean that there are many more opportunities
than before to become a director for the first time _ if you can
catch the eye of a recruiter or a nominating committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, boards mainly found new members through their
existing members,'' said Peter D. Crist, the vice chairman of
Korn/Ferry International, the executive search firm, who spends
about half his time filling directorships. ``We've tended to move
away from that model, although it certainly still occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the competition is tough. The valuable career-building
experience of serving on a board, not to mention the prestige,
stock options and other perquisites that come with a director's
seat, attract many more interested people than there are openings.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say executives can take a number of specific steps to
improve their chances. Some are obvious _ like adding overseas
experience or a successfully executed Internet strategy to a
curriculum vitae. Others are more subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Following are some strategies that management experts suggest
for getting your name among the most promising candidates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SET THE STAGE _ Most companies, and virtually all large ones,
want their directors to have experience running something big _ a
company, a division, a business unit _ of their own. Executives do
not usually reach this level, generally executive vice president or
chief financial officer, until their 40s or later. But recruiters
say up-and-comers in their 30s can take steps now to help
themselves in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Ilene S. Gordon, then in her late 30s, was a
rising executive in Chicago. She had put in some time at Boston
Consulting Group, but most of her experience was in the packaging
industry. ``I wanted to get on a board to be exposed to broader
issues,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   So she did what she could to get noticed. She joined the
Economic Club of Chicago and volunteered for the membership
committee, allowing her to meet many local executives. She also
signed up with two networking groups for women and, later, became a
director of a hospital in Evanston, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gordon serves on two corporate boards _ at A.J. Gallagher
and United Stationers _ and has completed terms at three others.
</P>
<P>
   Executives recruiters say her approach _ working hard to meet
people outside her company and joining the board of a nonprofit
organization _ are among the most effective strategies for aspiring
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit groups are often eager for advice, and may be more
willing than a corporation to name a younger manager who is
enthusiastic about the group's mission. A stint on a nonprofit's
board yields a sense of how boards function in general and a chance
to meet other director-level executives.
</P>
<P>
   PUT YOUR NETWORK TO WORK _ The chief executive of almost every
big company in the country receives stacks of board invitations but
turns most of them down. But a growing number of bosses take
advantage of the requests to refer their lieutenants for board
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Some are even more proactive. John Hawkins, a recruiter at
Russell Reynolds, a search firm, says he has received calls in
recent months from three chairmen, asking him to meet with
high-ranking executives at their companies and size them up for
directorships.
</P>
<P>
   More than friendship is involved: the chairmen hope that their
proteges will learn from executives at other companies and become
stronger potential chief executives, Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The message for aspiring board members is clear: If the chance
presents itself, tell your boss that you think that joining an
outside board could make you more effective at your own job. Few
bosses are likely to be put off by this, because most were once in
the same position. ``I felt it was important, to prepare myself to
be CEO, to have the experience of being on an outside board,'' said
Sidney Taurel, the chief executive of Eli Lilly, who is now on the
boards of ITT and McGraw-Hill.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes sense to let an executive recruiter know about
your interest. But an unsolicited letter is not usually the most
effective strategy, recruiters say. ``I get letters every day, and
I read them,'' Crist said. ``But clearly, as you can imagine, if
someone is introduced to me by a friend or someone I respect, I'm
going to pay attention to that,'' more closely than an
over-the-transom note from a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Osar was the treasurer of Tenneco in 1997 when, during a
performance review, the chief financial officer told her that
joining a board would be an important way to broaden her
experience, she said. Osar then called a recruiter she knew and
expressed her interest. The recruiter set up a breakfast for her in
New York with a colleague of his who specializes in board searches
_ Hawkins. Within a year, Hawkins had connected her with Allergan,
the pharmaceuticals company, which made her a director. Osar is now
the chief financial officer of Westvaco, a packaging company. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   SEE FIRSTHAND, AND BE SEEN _ One of the best ways for executives
to learn how boards work _ and, in turn, to become attractive
candidates _ is to get in front of the board at their own
companies, recruiters say.
</P>
<P>
   ``CEOs want to know that whoever's coming on their board
understands the dynamic,'' said Andrea Reynolds, a managing
director at Russell Reynolds. That means leaping at any assignment
that might result in a presentation to directors.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the experience may lead to an invitation to
join another board _ on which one of your own company's directors
already serves. At the least, the experience adds an important
credential to a dossier, recruiters said.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing beats actually serving on a board, and management
experts say small companies can provide the ideal initial
directorship for many executives. ``At some point, you have to do
your starter-upper board,'' Crist said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a board, he said, lets a new director have an immediate
effect by providing a perspective not previously represented.
</P>
<P>
   KNOW WHAT YOU WANT _ Once elected to a first board, an executive
should forswear other board assignments for a few years, recruiters
said.
</P>
<P>
   Being a productive director typically requires more than 150
hours a year, on top of one's day job. New directors should devote
their energy exclusively to the first company that trusts them with
a director's chair (unless lightning strikes and Ford or Coca-Cola
calls).
</P>
<P>
   When Judith A. Sprieser became the chief financial officer of
Sara Lee six years ago, she was already on the board of a much
smaller manufacturing company. Her promotion led to a flood of new
board offers, she said, but she turned them down, choosing to focus
on her new job and to wait for an invitation from a company that
was similar in size.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard, because there were a lot of very, very
interesting companies,'' said Sprieser, who last week became the
chief executive of Transora.com, a business-to-business exchange
for the food industry. But the forbearance paid off last year, she
said, when she received an offer to serve on the board of Allstate
_ which brings in more revenue than Sara Lee and is also based in
Chicago, minimizing the travel time away from her family.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE BASICS _ Executives can increase their
odds of board selection in many ways, but recruiters say the most
important is also the most obvious: ``The best way to get on a
board is to do your job,'' said Ted Jadick, a managing partner in
the board practice of Heidrick &AMP; Struggles in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Crist added: ``Just do exactly what you're paid to do
exceedingly well. You will be found. I guarantee it.''
</P>
<P>
   A sense of serenity can help, too. The selection process for
almost any board is complex and carefully calibrated, having as
much to do with the group's current makeup as with the credentials
of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the keys here is, be patient,'' Hawkins said. An
executive may rise to president or chief financial officer of his
company, he added, but his selection to an outside board ``may not
happen even in the first year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very quirky,'' he said.

VERIZON CLIMBS AFTER SAYING IT WILL MEET PREDICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH RUBENSTEIN   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Verizon Communications (VZ:NYSE), which had seen its shares lose
about 15 percent this week, announced Friday that it expected its
second-quarter earnings to be what its predecessor companies
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Verizon reversed their downward trend Friday,
finishing up 3 3/4, or 8 percent, at 48.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, the wireless combination of Bell Atlantic and GTE that
was created June 30, issued a statement to ease any investor
concerns about its growth potential and profitability. It said it
would most likely meet its prediction of 15 percent consolidated
revenue growth for the second quarter. Analysts polled by First
Call/Thomson Financial expected the New York-based company to post
earnings of 77 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance of our companies in the second quarter gives
us the confidence that we will be able to realize the strategic
advantages of our merger to the fullest extent possible,'' Charles
R. Lee, the company's chairman and co-chief executive, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Klugman, who analyzes Verizon for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, said the company's shares were falling recently because
of ``a lot of speculation that they would have a lot of substantial
downward earnings estimate revisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The silence was deafening as the stock kept dropping a couple
points every day,'' Klugman said, explaining the company's
motivation to issue the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its preliminary second-quarter results show
that it more than doubled the number of long-distance customers it
attracted in the first quarter, adding 878,500 for a total of about
4.4 million. Subscribers to the company's high-speed digital
subscriber line service increased 47 percent in the quarter to
221,000.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon also said it accrued about 800,000 wireless net
additions, about 21 percent more than a year ago, bringing its
total wireless customers to about 25.6 million. Verizon's data
revenue growth was more than 30 percent, and the company generated
more than $3 billion in cash through the completion of previously
announced asset sales.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon is scheduled to announce its second-quarter results on
Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the company will provide revised guidance about
the goodwill associated with the assets contributed to Verizon
Wireless _ a separate joint venture in April between Bell Atlantic
Mobile and the U.S. assets of Vodafone AirTouch (VOD:NYSE) _ by
Vodafone and PrimeCo Personal Communications, another Bell Atlantic
Mobile-Vodafone combination that was added to Verizon Wireless.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon will also present revised information on conforming
accounting practices to develop a unified approach for the combined
company, as well as new guidance about the conditions of the
Federal Communication Commission's approval of the merger. It will
also discuss the effects of the separation of Genuity, GTE's
Internetworking business, from Verizon, and the deconsolidation of
Genuity's results from Verizon's.
</P>
<P>
   David Frail, a spokesman for Verizon, said the company could not
say at this point whether its revised guidance would be positive or
negative.
</P>
<P>
   Although Verizon's projections Friday fell in line with earlier
predictions, they have not necessarily silenced all the concerns of
investors, said Klugman, who rates Verizon a market perform. The
new guidance that the company plans to release at the Aug. 8
meeting ``strikes me as a downward revision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klugman said Verizon will most likely portray any issues
surrounding its accounting or goodwill as ``fairly benign,'' but he
does not know at this point if that portrayal would be an accurate
one.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette acted with several other firms as a
co-manager for the offering that resulted in the separation of
Genuity from Verizon, Klugman said.

 McCAIN STIRS SPECULATION AS BUSH'S VEEP  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By STEWART M. POWELL   
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers    WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
the feisty maverick who galvanized independent voters with a
populist crusade that won seven presidential primaries, stirred
speculation Friday that he would be willing to join the Republican
ticket as George W. Bush's vice presidential running mate. McCain
and his allies repeatedly declined to rule out the possibility that
the three-term senator would accept an invitation from Bush to join
the GOP ticket. McCain coyly insisted Friday that ``nothing has
changed'' since he told a news conference in Pittsburgh in May _
following a private post-primary reconciliation summit with Bush _
that he did not want to be considered as Bush's running mate. ``But
if Gov. Bush called, I'd certainly like to talk to him about the
weather and how things are going and how good a campaign he's
running,'' McCain added.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A McCain associate who is close to the three-term senator
elaborated, saying that even though McCain did not wish to be
considered for the No. 2 post and ``would prefer that Gov. Bush not
offer him the job, if he did, he would serve.''
</P>
<P>
   The associate added, speaking on condition of anonymity: ``If
Sen. McCain is asked by Gov. Bush to serve his country, he would _
he can't say `no' to that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain indicated that he didn't think he was on Bush's short
list of running mates, telling CNN that he had ``not been vetted or
asked for my tax returns or anything like that. I do not believe
that I'm in the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain associate raised the possibility that McCain and Bush
might get together following their attendance at the Atlanta
funeral of the late Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens,'' the associate said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy Ives, who serves as McCain's Senate press secretary,
said that the senator had ``no plans'' to meet privately with Bush
before flying home to Arizona for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, engulfed by mounting speculation over his choice for a
vice presidential running mate, began a weekend of planned
seclusion at his sprawling ranch in Crawford, Texas on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make up my mind over the weekend,'' Bush said,
adding: ``The days of speculation are over.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about McCain, Bush did not repeat his usual response that
McCain had asked not to be considered and that Bush was taking him
at his word.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's a good man. He's a friend of mine,'' Bush said, adding:
``He'll be a loyal soldier for my candidacy. He is a man of duty
and he loves his country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain still captivates many Republican leaders and independent
voters. The latest Fox News survey completed July 13 found that 23
percent of 900 registered voters surveyed believed that McCain
``should be the Republican vice presidential nominee.'' McCain
outpaced every other likely vice presidential prospect by a
three-fold margin with the exception of former Republican Cabinet
officer Elizabeth Dole. Twenty two percent of those surveyed said
Dole should be the GOP running mate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's political fortunes also were buoyed by a letter
circulated by House Republicans urging Bush to choose the former
Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war to help Republicans retain
control the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., chairman of the House Republican campaign
committee, urged the Bush campaign to choose McCain in a telephone
call earlier this week to Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary
and ex-White House chief of staff who is vetting prospective
running mates for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has campaigned for the re-election of 13 House members
and three senators since abandoning his own presidential candidacy
after setbacks in the March 7 Super Tuesday primaries. McCain has
been asked to appear on behalf of more than 100 other House members
or House candidates by election day, said Todd Harris, spokesman
for McCain's political action committee, Straight Talk America.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation about McCain was triggered by an Associated
Press dispatch late Thursday that cited four independent sources
who recounted comments made by McCain to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom
Ridge in a private telephone call last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know me, Tommy. If the governor asked, you know I would
serve. I would prefer not to, but I'll serve,'' McCain told Ridge,
according the sources quoted by AP.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not deny the quotation in subsequent comments to
reporters late Thursday and Friday. McCain only dubbed the
conversation with Ridge ``private'' and insisted that he did ``not
tell'' Ridge that he was ``interested'' in serving as Bush's
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments _ and the absence of a denial _ cracked open a
door that McCain had closed following the former rivals' meeting in
Pittsburgh on May 9. At that time, McCain firmly rejected in
advance any invitation to join Bush's ticket as the vice
presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked that I not be considered for vice president of the
United States,'' McCain told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bush quickly replied: ``I take him for his word.''
</P>
<P>
   William Schneider, a political scientist with the American
Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., said McCain's readiness
to stoke speculation about partnering with Bush sowed ``trouble''
for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is supposed to be Bush's moment when he makes up his mind
_ and McCain is saying, `If he really begs me I'd be willing to
consider it,'' Schneider said. ``Does Gov. Bush really need to be
overshadowed by his vice president?''

&HT;     GOP PRO-CHOICE FORCES FACE UPHILL CLIMB AT PLATFORM MEETINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 23   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They know they face virtually insurmountable odds,
but pro-choice Republicans are running a stealthy campaign to
moderate the Republican Party's strong anti-abortion platform
plank.
</P>
<P>
   Their first target is the 107-member GOP platform committee,
which will meet in Philadelphia Friday and Saturday, just before
Monday's opening of the Republican national convention.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion rights advocates say that if they cannot persuade
the committee, they will switch to an alternate strategy: They will
seek to win over the majority of delegates from each of at least
six states.
</P>
<P>
   If they succeed, then under the party's parliamentary rules, the
2,066 convention delegates will have to vote on the platform plank
by plank. That would force a debate on the abortion issue, and, the
pro-choicers hope, give them a chance to soften or even eliminate
the plank. If they do not succeed, the platform will be voted on in
its entirety early in the convention, and the plank will remain.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Stone, who heads Republicans for Choice, a political action
committee that raises money for pro-choice Republican candidates,
recognizes the odds against opening the issue to floor debate.
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive nominee, and Republican
elders want seriously to head off an abortion firestorm before a
national TV audience because it would crack the image of party
unity they hope to generate at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening it up would be Bush's worst nightmare,'' Stone said in
an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign staff appears unperturbed by the pro-choice
effort.
</P>
<P>
   `` You're going to see a more unified Republican Party than
you've seen in years,'' said one Bush senior adviser, who asked not
to be named. ``We expect a relatively smooth convention. There's no
concern on abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made his position clear. To appease the Christian right
and other conservatives opposed to abortion, the governor, who once
favored exceptions to the ban, has said he wants no changes in the
GOP's 1996 abortion plank.
</P>
<P>
   The plank does not mention any exceptions _ such as in cases of
rape, incest or where the woman's life is at stake _ in its
opposition to the procedure. It says, ``The unborn child has a
fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We
support a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse
legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's
protections apply to unborn children.'' Ray Sullivan, a Bush
campaign spokesman, said campaign aides are not quizzing platform
committee delegates about their views on abortion. But he said,
``We do have policy staff working with the platform committee to
help minimize any inconsistencies and encourage compatibility
between the Bush campaign and the Republican platform.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-choice side insists that eliminating or softening the
plank is the only way to reach out to moderate women voters. ``If
you want to reach out to women, you have to talk about choice,''
said Susan Cullman, co-chair of the Republican Pro-Choice
Coalition. Without the anti-abortion plank, ``we might lose some
extremists on one side, but we'll gain people who stay home or
register as Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-choice Republicans are under no illusions about the
difficulty of getting the party to change direction on abortion,
Cullman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still outnumbered at this convention,'' she said. ``But
there are more people this time who support us than in 1996 or
1992. Our hour is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone pointed to a poll her organization commissioned earlier
this year showing that while 54 percent of the Republican
respondents described themselves as pro-life, 69 percent strongly
agree that government should not be involved in making a decision
on whether to have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   If recent history is a precedent, the pro-choice advocates'
chances of success appear dim. In 1996, the platform committee
embarrassed presidential candidate Bob Dole when it rebuffed his
attempt to add a ``tolerance provision'' to the abortion plank. The
provision said the party tolerates differing views on the procedure
and that some Republicans favor abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   While Dole opposed abortion, he favored the rape, incest and
life-of-the-mother exceptions to any ban. That put him at variance
with the party's abortion plank.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Washington-based American Conservative Union
released a survey of 393 of the GOP convention's 2,066 delegates,
showing that 57 percent of respondents favored banning abortion
with exceptions in cases of rape, incest and danger to the woman's
health. Eighteen percent favored a total ban on abortion.

VIDEO AS ART IN A WORLD ON TAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The word NUMBER in parentheses has been used instead of the
symbol, which is nontransmittable to many newspaper systems.) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The chorus of an old John Prine song asks, ``Wouldn't
we be in good shape/if our lives were on videotape?''
</P>
<P>
   We shouldn't have to wait much longer for an answer, since it
often seems these days that no aspect of our private and communal
lives is shielded from the patient, prying lens of the video camera
_ though the tape itself, in the digital era, may soon be obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   From amateur pornography to security surveillance loops, from
home movies of weddings, childbirths and family reunions to C-Span
and ``Big Brother,'' video records and shapes what we know of
reality. It takes our confessions, tells our secrets and presents
our public rituals of shame and celebration. So what kind of shape
are we in anyway?
</P>
<P>
   One place to look for an answer might be at the New York Video
Festival, which opened Friday and runs through Thursday at the
Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. The ubiquity of the medium
makes this year's festival, part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000,
especially interesting. It also may present the programmers, the
audience and the video artists whose work is being shown with a
newly acute challenge.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes video as an art form _ which often presents
apparently undigested slices of quotidian experience in grueling
real time _ from video as a tool for making family albums or
catching shoplifters, which does the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, what separates video from the movies? Recent
films like ``Chuck and Buck,'' ``Time Code'' and ``Thirteen''
exploit the rough textures and bumpy rhythms of video to create
effects of unnerving intimacy similar to those found in many of the
festival's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The awarding of this year's Palme d'Or at Cannes to Lars von
Trier's ``Dancer in the Dark'' raised the possibility that digital
video might come to the rescue of auteur cinema, but von Trier's
work also decisively blurs the distinctions between cinema and its
protean stepchild.
</P>
<P>
   Which is, all in all, a good thing, or at least an interesting
development. What's the difference between a video and a movie?
What separates reality from artifice? As it happens, the festival's
first offering, Trent Harris' ``Beaver Trilogy'' (showing
Saturday), is a work that raises these questions, and a number of
others including ``What in the world was that?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else it is, ``Beaver Trilogy'' is a rivetingly strange,
multilayered inquiry into celebrity, obsession and serendipity. It
begins in 1980, with a parking-lot encounter between Harris and
Larry Huff, a voluble young man whose consuming ambition is to be
``on the tube, the set, television.''
</P>
<P>
   He introduces himself as an impressionist _ ``the Rich Little of
Beaver,'' the small Utah town that gives the film its name _ but
his enthusiasm seems to exceed his talent. Though Huff does a
little John Wayne and an almost passable Sylvester Stallone, his
real passion is for Olivia Newton-John, whom he impersonates,
resplendent in blond chicken-wing wig, at a local talent show that
he organizes for Harris' benefit.
</P>
<P>
   By itself ``The Beaver Kid'' _ which ends with Huff's heartfelt
performance of Barry Manilow's ``New York State of Mind'' (an
encore after his signature piece, the Newton-John ballad ``Please
Don't Keep Me Waiting'') _ would be an appealing curiosity, a
window into a half-forgotten moment in American popular culture and
a premonition of the current obsession with gender-bending
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But Harris followed his initial cinema verite oddity with two
remakes, the first starring an as yet unknown Sean Penn, the second
featuring the madcap emoting of Crispin Glover.
</P>
<P>
   Each installment makes explicit some of the buried themes of the
original _ the exploitive relationship between filmmaker and
subject, the thin line between glory and humiliation, and the
tension between conformity and self-expression in small-town
America.
</P>
<P>
   The second part is an almost verbatim re-enactment of the first.
The third, ``The Orkly Kid'' _ edited like a made-for-television
movie and boasting a full battery of credits _ makes Huff's story
into a tongue-in-cheek morality play about daring to be different
and following your dreams, however ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   But not even Glover's uninhibited performance can match the
uncanny sincerity of the real-life Huff, who comes from somewhere
beyond any filmmaker's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   What place is that? ``The Beaver Trilogy'' makes several
references to ``Real People,'' a long-forgotten forerunner of the
current flood of reality programming. And scattered through the
festival's diverse thematic programs are a number of arresting,
horrifying and sometimes boring real people, including some of the
artists themselves, presented amid the background noise and surface
clutter of their very real lives.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon and again on Monday evening you can take
an invigorating tour through several states of misery and squalor
in ``All Too Human,'' described as ``Three Chronicles of Abject
Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   These videos are queasily fascinating and morally troubling.
Richard Billingham, known for his unflattering photographs of his
working-class parents in northern England, brings us into their
midst in ``Fishtank,'' which observes his father's drunkenness and
his mother's needy melancholy, as well as their pet goldfish.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Loss Prevention,'' Jeanne C. Finley describes her elderly
mother's arrest for shoplifting and reflects on her own unhappy
childhood as the daughter of a kleptomaniac. The program's capper,
``If Only I,'' consists of Donigan Cumming's grueling, captivating
interviews with a woman named Colleen, whose biography moves from
childhood sexual abuse to alcoholism, institutionalization and a
failed suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Only I'' is the emotional equivalent of a snuff film. It's
clearly meant to disturb, but it crosses an ethical line that other
pieces, including ``The Beaver Trilogy,'' attempt both to demarcate
and to skirt. The video not only records Colleen's abjection but
also participates in it. That she may be too far gone to care or to
protect herself hardly excuses the invasion of her privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the age of celebrity _ the age of ``Survivor,''
cyberspying, and eager auto-surveillance _ the concept of privacy
may be obsolete. In any case, not all the violations of it recorded
at the festival are so grim, so emotionally charged, or so morally
questionable. Which brings me to George Kuchar, an experimental
Super 8 maven of the 1960s (``Hold Me While I'm Naked,''
``Corruption of the Damned'') turned indefatigable video diarist.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's program includes a selection of recent work
from Kuchar's extensive catalog _ visits to friends and neighbors,
travels here and there, all featuring his walrus-mustached visage
and his variously solicitous and sarcastic commentary. This
program, at which Kuchar will appear in person, is an antipasto for
the feast of episodic eccentricity that is ``Secrets of the Shadow
World,'' a two-hour ``miniseries'' about UFO conspiracy theories
and a whole lot of other things, which will be presented on Sunday
and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a long episode of ``The X-Files'' shot with the cheesy,
prefab special effects of a prepackaged wedding video and
accompanied by generic movie-score bombast. Now add a cast of
garrulous oddballs in costume-shop robes and makeup, arts
administrators, avant-garde filmmakers and a very indulgent cat.
</P>
<P>
   But really you can't imagine what ``Secrets of the Shadow
World'' is like, any more than you can imagine a day in the life of
a tirelessly inventive, endlessly curious artist with a video
camera, or a day in your own life.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar's artistry is not immediately apparent. Watching his
jerky, spontaneous recordings of life's pleasant inanity, you may
say, ``Hey, I could do that.'' Which is part of the point. What's
stopping you?
</P>
<P>
   If the video camera seems uniquely adept at registering living
human presences, in all their uncomfortable specificity, it also
offers a special access to the human interior, a vehicle for
fantasy, speculation and dreaming, exemplified in a program called
``Electronic Unconscious,'' which will be shown on Monday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Harris' and Kuchar's works, the films in this
program seem somewhat arch and self-conscious. The most interesting
of them is Chris Petit's ``Asylum,'' an hourlong ``sci-fi narrative
collage'' which is a bit like a condensed, British version of
``Secrets of the Shadow World'' without Kuchar's genially anarchic
presence.
</P>
<P>
   And though video art has at times in its short history been
dominated by abstraction, by an aesthetic of the image, this year's
festival, like the reality programming that is both its cultural
context and its cultural antithesis, is dominated by images of
people. If video is a way of exploring often uncomfortable personal
connections _ between videomakers and their subjects, parents and
their children, young men and their alter egos _ it can also
explore loneliness, disconnection and loss.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday a half-dozen brief studies in alienation will be
screened in a program called ``Only Disconnect,'' the best of which
is a collage of disjointed, abstract narratives called ``Nest of
Tens,'' by Miranda July.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most moving evocations of the irreplaceable quiddity
of a person is Elisabeth Subrin's ``Fancy,'' which will be shown in
the program ``Brought to Light'' on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The video is devoted to the life and work of a photographer,
Francesca Woodman, who committed suicide in 1981 at the age of 22.
Her work, which consisted almost entirely of nude self-portraits,
never appears on screen. Instead we see her possessions, laid out
like auction lots, and hear descriptions of her pictures as fully
clothed stand-ins re-enact her poses.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Subrin confers immortality on her subject while at the
same time making vivid her irrevocable absence.
</P>
<P>
   The commemorative power of video is related to its alchemical
capacity to confer renown. The confessional impulse and the urge to
perform are not entirely separable, as the examples of Larry Huff
and George Kuchar suggest. Huff dreamed of making the big time in
his blond wig and leather boots just before the advent of MTV,
which has, in the decades since, come to dominate and to transform
the culture of videomaking.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the New York Press film critic Armond White, a
mainstay of the festival since 1993, will present a selection of
music videos, including work by the directors Mark Romanek and Hype
Williams, and musicians like Bjork, Mos Def, and Macy Gray. Like
the more rarefied (and rarely seen) work that dominates the
festival, music video, according to White, ``gives a chance for
filmmakers not connected with the Hollywood mainstream to express
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though music videos are commercial,'' White said in a
telephone interview, ``they are also experimental. They set the
tone for visual language, and they do what no other videomakers can
do: They reach a public.''
</P>
<P>
   White's cherished pop-music videos, with their fast editing and
smoothly polished surfaces, stand in obvious contrast to the rough,
knotty work of artists like Kuchar and Harris. The abundant and
varied material on display at this year's festival is evidence of
the medium's almost infinite variety and elasticity, its ability to
comprehend, in small increments and at great length, in real time
and on landscapes of fantasy, the breadth and scope of contemporary
life.

49ERS BEEF UP THEIR OFFENSIVE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE ADAMS  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. - For years, the stereotypical 49ers offensive
lineman was a lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   Bobb McKittrick, the longtime offensive line coach who died of
cancer earlier this year, favored undersized, overachieving
players. His blocking schemes were based on quickness.
</P>
<P>
   That's beginning to change and is especially noticeable with the
arrival of two veteran free agent tackles _ 6-foot-8, 315-pound
Matt Willig, signed in the offseason, and 6-foot-8, 325-pound Scott
Gragg, signed earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   These two look the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be the first guys off the bus,'' coach Steve Mariucci
said.
</P>
<P>
   Willig was with the St. Louis Rams last year and Gragg comes
from the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have some depth,'' said Mariucci, who has
mentioned Gragg as a possible starter with Dave Fiore still
recovering from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how his regulars felt about the team signing two proven
NFL starters, Mariucci said, ``It's a competitive world out there.
It makes us all better.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JERVEY'S MANDATE: Running back Travis Jervey was excused from
the morning practice Thursday with a left hip flexor strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to get some ice on that and get a haircut,''
Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   CLOSE ON PETERSON: Julian Peterson, the team's top draft pick,
may be closer to signing.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, a pass-rushing linebacker expected to take over the
starting spot vacated by Lee Woodall, was the 16th pick overall in
this year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   He was due in camp Saturday with his fellow rookies, but has
stayed out while the team and his agent negotiate a contract.
General manager Bill Walsh said Thursday the two sides are close.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci talked with Peterson by telephone Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Julian and his father,'' he said. ``He's working
out three times a day.''

`ANNE OF GREEN GABLES': TIMES CHANGE, AND ANNE MUST FACE A MESSY
WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., Broadcast notes are at the end of the review. Broadcast time
and station are for New York; please check for your area) 
 By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story,'' Anne Shirley
makes her way to a publishing house in New York to peddle a
manuscript. It's 1915, but her meeting with the company's head
would sound familiar today. After complaining about the sorry state
of the business, he compliments her work and then rejects it.
</P>
<P>
   He does give her a job as an editor and tells her what kind of
book he wants to publish. With the war in Europe diverting the
attention of men, he says, he wants stories that will appeal to
women, but they should be adventure stories.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the creators of this two-part mini-series, which
presents the famous red-haired orphan girl as an adult, have taken
the publisher's advice to heart. They have catapulted their heroine
into the thick of all kinds of adventures that merely include
engagement and marriage to her longtime beau, Gilbert Blythe, a
romantic triangle, publishing intrigue, espionage and war.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Anne has gone a long way from Avonlea, the Canadian
setting of ``Anne of Green Gables,'' a book that remains on
sixth-grade reading lists almost a century after it was first
published. The book was made into a silent film in 1919. A 1934
version starred an actress named Dawn O'Day but she changed her
name to Anne Shirley for her first starring role.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Follows has resisted that temptation, though she began
playing Anne in 1985, when she was 16, in the television
mini-series that would become a popular video Cliff's Notes for
young readers, and again in a 1987 sequel. ``The Continuing Story''
completes the trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   Though also the work of Kevin Sullivan, who created this
handsomely produced Canadian series, ``The Continuing Story''
differs significantly from the first two parts. While those
productions took some liberties, particularly with time (placing
Anne in the early 1900s instead of the 1880s), they faithfully
remained connected to the books by Lucy Maud Montgomery. For this
installment the dramatists have gone off into dangerous territory,
to create what Sullivan has described as ``a completely original
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, who wrote the script with Laurie Pearson, has
developed a plausible adult version of Anne, the shrewd, plucky
orphan who had to win the hearts of the elderly couple with whom
she had gone to live. They were Matthew and Marilla, a brother and
sister who lived together on a farm called Green Gables and who
were hoping for a boy to help with the chores. Now Matthew and
Marilla are gone, though Anne remains shrewd and plucky, ready to
conquer all obstacles the way she conquered Matthew and Marilla's
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   But separated from her source material, Montgomery's books, Anne
has also lost much of her childhood poetry. She no longer says
things like ``my life is a perfect graveyard of burned hopes now''
with the same charm. Nor could she. She has grown up, and so has
Follows, but the filmmakers haven't found a comparable way for her
to express her adult longings and fears.
</P>
<P>
   They have replaced Anne's filigreed musings with action. As the
mini-series opens, she is returning to Green Gables from a
five-year stint away, working with orphans. But she arrives only to
find that the place she once described as ``a beautiful dream'' is
run down and occupied by trashy people.
</P>
<P>
   Though she says she wants to return there when she has children,
she leaves for New York with her fiance, Gil (again played by
Jonathan Crombie), who has been invited to work as a surgeon at
Bellevue Hospital. Soon enough, they both become disillusioned with
the politics and perfidy of the city's institutions, medical and
publishing, and head back home.
</P>
<P>
   But before returning to Canada, Anne becomes entangled _
professionally on her part, and also romantically on his _ with a
famous writer of adventure stories, Jack Garrison Jr. (Cameron
Daddo). Then everyone becomes engulfed in World War I, and so does
the mini-series. Anne forges through the hugger-mugger with aplomb,
relentlessly unflappable in the face of battlefront explosions,
remarkable coincidences and neck-wrenching plot twists. She even
disguises herself as a nun to cross enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story'' is clunky at
times. The actors are good but too restrained, unable to swell to
the scenario's melodramatic proportions (though the music has no
such problems). But it is engrossing all the same, especially for
those who feel as if they knew Anne as a girl and want to see what
happens to her when she grows up.

TRUTH OR LIES? IN SEX SURVEYS, YOU NEVER KNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH BOXER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wardell Pomeroy, one of Alfred Kinsey's associates in the 1940s,
was interviewing a man about his first ejaculation. He asked,
``When?'' The man answered, ``Fourteen.'' Pomeroy then asked,
``How?'' and was surprised at what he heard: ``With a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new biography, ``Sex the Measure of All Things: A Life of
Alfred C. Kinsey,'' Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy records what happened
next. Pomeroy asked the man, ``How often were you having
intercourse with animals at 14?''
</P>
<P>
   The man looked confused and said, ``Well, yes, it is true I had
intercourse with a pony at 14.'' Pomeroy, it turned out, had
misheard the man's previous answer. It was ``with whores,'' not
``with a horse.'' So the man was stunned that Pomeroy had had the
insight to ask him the horse question out of the blue.
</P>
<P>
   Sex surveyors are bedeviled scientists. Beyond the problems of
hearing the respondents correctly and not making imaginative
suggestions themselves, they face a number of obstacles. People lie
about sex. Those who don't lie often say inaccurate things. And
most sex researchers aren't exactly neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Two battling biographies of Kinsey, ``Alfred C. Kinsey: A
Public/Private Man'' by James H. Jones, published in 1997, and
Gathorne-Hardy's book have recently brought the issue of truth in
sex into focus again. And this December a new book, ``Sex, Love and
Health,'' further analyzing the results of the National Health and
Social Life Survey on sex, will be published, raising the question
again: How much can we really know about other people's sex lives?
</P>
<P>
   Sex surveys give ``a hardened imitation of reality,'' says John
H. Gagnon, an emeritus professor of sociology at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook who studies sex. Certain
kinds of questions elicit certain answers, and certain questions
are asked because of fear.
</P>
<P>
   If you look back at American sex surveys, Gagnon says, you can
see that most are concerned with risk: the risk to marriage, the
risk to virginity, the risk of sexually transmitted diseases,
violence, teen-age pregnancy and child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The first sex survey published in the United States, according
to Julia A. Ericksen's book ``Kiss and Tell: Surveying Sex in the
20th Century,'' was F.S. Brockman's study of adolescent boys around
the turn of the century. College-age men were asked about their
boyhoods: What was your severest temptation? Did you yield? The
results were published in ``The Pedagogical Seminary,'' edited by
G. Stanley Hall, a prominent psychologist who believed that
masturbation depleted a man's energy. The study showed what was
feared: Young men were in spiritual crisis, and masturbation was
partly to blame.
</P>
<P>
   By 1916 concerns had changed. Walter Robie, a neurologist and
advocate of birth control, was worried about premarital sex and
venereal disease. He believed, Ericksen writes, that occasional
``autoerotism would help prevent nonmarital intercourse.'' His
survey confirmed his belief that masturbation saves marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Later sex surveys were probably no less biased; it's just that
the biases had changed. Jones writes in his biography that Kinsey's
sex studies were an effort ``to help himself.'' From childhood on,
Kinsey ``lived with two shameful secrets: He was both a homosexual
and a masochist.'' Jones writes that ``he was determined to strip
human sexuality of its guilt and repression.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Jones says, the ``homosexual cases composed
approximately one-fifth of the sample.'' And so Kinsey vastly
overstated the incidence of homosexuality (10 percent for men).
</P>
<P>
   Gagnon takes a different slant on Kinsey's bias. What affected
the data, he says, is that Kinsey's subjects were ``all white,
Midwestern or Northeastern, young and highly educated.''
</P>
<P>
   The surveys that followed were even less representative: In the
1970s Shere Hite, the Cassandra of women's sex, was criticized for
choosing a sample that included too many women who had emotional
problems with men in the ``Hite Report on Female Sexuality.'' The
sex surveys done by Redbook, Cosmopolitan and Playboy were based on
the responses of readers, a self-selected group.
</P>
<P>
   But even if such biases are removed, will the whole truth out?
Apparently even the sternest scientific studies _ mass surveys of
randomly selected people, conducted by interviewers trained to look
unbiased, unimpressed and unembarrassed _ are not beyond reproach.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago the results of the National Health and Social Life
Survey were published in ``The Social Organization of Sexuality''
by two sociologists, Edward O. Laumann and Gagnon; an economist,
Robert T. Michael; and a researcher, Stuart Michaels. The study,
which was motivated by the AIDS epidemic and was supposed to be
publicly financed, ended up being paid for privately when the
Senate, at the urging of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., voted against
support.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to prurient expectations, the survey, based on
interviews with a random sample of 3,432 people between 18 and 59,
was a picture of sexual squareness: low rates of homosexuality and
promiscuity, high rates of marital fidelity and connubial bliss. It
showed that in a given year most Americans have only one sex
partner; that the median lifetime number of partners for women is
two and for men is six; that most people have sex less than twice a
week and it's over quickly; that most Americans are happy with
their sex lives and partners. It also showed that people most often
have sex with members of their own class.
</P>
<P>
   This survey was to be the most representative and accurate ever.
Indeed, the researchers took extreme precautions against lying. For
potentially embarrassing questions, they had the respondents give
written as well as oral answers. And only written answers were
given for the two questions that the researchers considered the
most sensitive: masturbation and total household income.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rigor, the study did not persuade everyone. In The
New York Review of Books, Richard Lewontin, a population geneticist
at Harvard, complained that the researchers still had no way of
knowing how many people had lied. And even admirers of the study
sounded disappointed. Paul Robinson, a history professor at
Stanford University and the author of ``The Modernization of Sex,''
says that the survey ``had little resonance _ it didn't make much
of a splash.''
</P>
<P>
   So where is the science of sex surveys now? In December ``Sex,
Love and Health,'' an extension of the project begun in ``The
Social Organization of Sexuality,'' will be published. In keeping
with the concerns of the time, it will focus less on AIDS and more
on teen-age sex, race, class and gender, sex between adults and
children, circumcision, sexual dysfunction and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But something more basic is on the horizon. It appears that
researchers are abandoning the dream of quantitative carnal
knowledge. ``We are not in the truth business,'' Gagnon says.
``People tell us the truth as they see it.'' But they forget, and
the stories they tell are altered by having told the story before,
by storytelling conventions, by the audience and by the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Maines, the author of ``The Technology of Orgasm,'' says
sex surveys won't tell you people's deepest, darkest secrets. But
over time sex studies do show changes. For example, people used to
say they disliked using condoms because it suggested premeditated
sex, Maines says. Now they might say that they don't like them
because of the loss of sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Lewontin wrote: ``The answer, surely, is to be less ambitious
and stop trying to make sociology into a natural science. There are
some things in the world that we will never know and many that we
will never know exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   Such reduced expectations seem to have brought Kinsey new
respect. Gathorne-Hardy's biography defends him by suggesting that
he wasn't really out to find sex norms. Kinsey, who started off as
a biologist specializing in the study of the gall wasp, was not so
much a statistician as a taxonomist, someone who studied the
variety of sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Gathorne-Hardy notes that Kinsey never asked, ``have you or did
you ever?'' but rather ``when did you first do something _ have
intercourse with a woman, a man, an animal?'' By assuming that
everyone had done everything, he encouraged people to talk. Kinsey
got 18,000 people to reveal the ``details of sensitive matters like
homosexuality, extramarital affairs, masturbation, child-adult sex
and so on,'' Gathorne-Hardy writes.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsey's work ``probed the limits,'' Gagnon says. He was the
first to break open the doors. In the tradition of American
reformers, he believed that sexuality, if liberated, was
redemptive.
</P>
<P>
   But do people read sex surveys for liberation? No, says
Robinson. They ``want to know how many people are like me.''
</P>
<P>
   And for that ``people want absolute truth from science,'' Gagnon
says. ``There is a desire for the gold standard, the real
numbers.'' People want to know how they stack up. They don't want
to hear stories about a boy and his horse.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another in the recent series of systems of thunderstorms over
the southern tier of the nation will roll east-southeastward from
Oklahoma into portions of Arkansas, southwest Tennessee,
Mississippi, Alabama and perhaps Georgia by day's end. Locally
heavy rain, gusty winds and hail will affect some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms will erupt over eastern parts of Colorado and New
Mexico and western parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas as cold
winds from the northwest at 18,000 feet work in tandem with humid
surface winds to destabilize the atmosphere. A few storms will
approach severe levels.
</P>
<P>
   Variable clouds and sun with scattered showers and thunderstorms
will be the tenor of the day across parts of the Northeast, as a
pool of cold air 20,000 feet above the ground allows cumulus clouds
to build.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DERECHO
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, straight-line winds from a system of thunderstorms
prompted more than 200 reports of damage in Oklahoma, Arkansas,
Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. Such a long-lived
windstorm is a derecho. For a system of storms to qualify as a
derecho, the length of the path of damaging winds must be at least
250 nautical miles. Moreover, the pattern of strong winds must show
a clear chronological progression, with no more than three hours
between damage reports. There must also be at least three reports
of gusts of 74 mph or more that are at least 40 nautical miles
apart.

BIGGEST MINING COMPANY IN BID TO TAKE OVER NORTH LTD. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia)   By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Making another move to expand its
interests outside South Africa, Anglo American PLC, the world's
biggest mining company, on Friday announced a bid worth $1.8
billion to take over Australian iron miner North Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Anglo's offer of 4.20 Australian dollars a share, or about $2.45
a share, and the assumption of $263 million in debt is 11 percent
higher than an offer for North from Anglo rival Rio Tinto PLC made
last month. There were expectations that Rio Tinto would sweeten
its offer.
</P>
<P>
   North Ltd. is the world's fourth-largest producer of iron ore
and is a major supplier to Asia, where demand has been strong and
where Anglo has been trying to position itself as prime distributor
of metals and minerals.
</P>
<P>
   With its growth prospects in Africa limited, Anglo has been
looking outside South Africa for opportunities to expand, and
Australia has been one of its favorite targets. Last month, Anglo
acquired several Australian coal mines, and last year, the company
acquired a 23 percent stake in an Australian nickel-mining house.
</P>
<P>
   Anglo's latest acquisition attempt also underscores the changing
corporate focus of the company, which had evolved into an array of
assets across many industries. Since shifting its primary listing
to London last year, the company has been focusing on mining and
shedding unrelated interests.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover bid for North is another step in that strategy.
Anglo, which purchased 6 million shares in North several weeks ago,
said Friday that it had been evaluating the Australian company as a
possible acquisition for some time and that the circumstances were
right to make a move now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expansion of our mining and natural resources operations
and the application of our mining expertise across commodities
where we can add value is a key element of Anglo-American's growth
strategy,'' the company's chief executive, Tony Trahar, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   North's board has indicated that it supports Anglo's approach,
and the Australian company's major customers in Japan are said to
support it as well. Anglo is the largest producer of gold and
platinum. Securing a bigger stake in the essential, if less exotic,
base metals sector has been an important objective for the company,
said Mannie Rahn, who tracks the mining industry for Standard
Equities in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such a large acquisition, more than half of Anglo's
assets would still be in South Africa, the company said. That makes
it certain that Anglo will make other acquisitions overseas, Rahn
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they would be loathe to make any other investments in
southern Africa,'' he said. ``If they have a choice they would much
rather go somewhere else. They still see South Africa as a very
large part of their portfolio and they want to diversify. I think
it's just good business practice.''

CHINA REORGANIZES ITS DOMESTIC AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China announced a vast reorganization of domestic
airlines Friday, merging seven carriers into the three largest to
reduce the overlap of routes and half-empty planes that have
plagued the industry for years.
</P>
<P>
   Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines
will absorb the other carriers, giving each of the three surviving
airlines roughly $6 billion in assets, China's state news agency,
Xinhua, reported. It did not give a timetable for the mergers or
indicate which airline would merge with which. Shares of China
Eastern and China Southern are listed in New York and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   China's airline industry has had a turbulent ride since the
country broke the Civil Aviation Administration of China's state
airline monopoly into six regional carriers in the late 1980s and
later allowed provincial governments to start their own airlines.
The idea was to better serve the enormous increase in passengers
that came with relaxed controls on air travel by Chinese citizens
and a subsequent economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion led to a series of crashes that made China the
most dangerous place to fly during the early 1990s. China rectified
that with increased pilot training and a moratorium on aircraft
purchases. But a second wave of expansion left the industry with
far more airline seats than passengers when the growth of air
travel tapered off with the 1998-99 Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   China's airline industry, which includes 34 airlines, lost over
$72 million in 1998 as companies cut ticket prices in a frantic
scramble for passengers. China fixed prices and banned discounts in
1999 to try to stop the bleeding. It delayed delivery of aircraft
that had been ordered. It cut air routes.
</P>
<P>
   It even demanded that all airlines pool 80 percent of their
ticket revenue on specific routes and divide it among the carriers
servicing that route. The industry edged back to profitability last
year, but none of that solved the problem of too many planes and
too few passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The country is loath to allow the market to solve the problem by
letting money-losing airlines go bankrupt, a solution considered
too brutal in China's planned economy.
</P>
<P>
   The seven airlines to be absorbed employ about 73,000 people and
carry heavy debts. It is not clear how much of those burdens the
three surviving airlines will be forced to assume.
</P>
<P>
   The seven airlines are China Southwest, China Northwest, China
Northern, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Great Wall and Zhejiang,
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation would in theory create economies of scale and
give the industry the potential to develop hub-and-spoke networks
similar to those of airlines in the United States. China Southern
is based in the southern city of Guangzhou, China Eastern in the
eastern commercial hub of Shanghai, and Air China in Beijing, in
the north.
</P>
<P>
   And it could prepare the industry for increased competition
after China's entry into the World Trade Organization, expected
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners are expected to be allowed up to 49 percent stakes in
China's airlines, up from the present limit of 35 percent.

&HT;     REMARKABLE HOUSES DETAILED IN A NEW BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: For release Sunday.)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     BY FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Authors will often write about fond memories of the houses where
they grew up. But Richard Hampton Jenrette chronicles the history
of six remarkable houses in ``Adventures with Old Houses'' (Wyrick
&AMP; Co., $60).
</P>
<P>
   The author writes in detail about the properties that he has
preserved for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   Jenrette, co-founder in 1959 and former chairman and CEO of the
investment-banking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc., has a
lifelong passion for grand old houses. He is dedicated to historic
preservation, and not only tenderly restores each house, but enjoys
playing detective to find and restore the 19th century art and
antiques that once belonged in them.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn to classical architecture, Jenrette currently resides
among five of the six houses he has meticulously restored along the
East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   He owns Millford Plantation and Roper House, both in South
Carolina; Ayr Mount in his native North Carolina; the Baker House
in New York City; Cane Garden in St. Croix, and Edgewater in the
Dutchess County hamlet of Barrytown, N.Y. Jenrette wrote
``Adventures in Old Houses'' _ in longhand _ at the St. Croix
house.
</P>
<P>
   Jenrette, who calls himself a house-aholic, has either sold or
given away eight other houses.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, the author describes Edgewater, the property that
he first saw over 30 years ago, as the great architectural love of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1820, the classically styled villa sits on a winding
peninsula that was originally part of the rolling, bucolic lands
owned by the Livingston family, the landholding patrons of the
Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of this pristine estate changed in 1852 when New York
state severed the main house from its rolling fields by laying
railroad tracks approximately 20 yards from the back door.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II the double tracks were heavily used to ship
war supplies to the port of New York, the soot and noise rendering
Edgewater an unlivable white elephant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are just cleaner passenger trains that go by very
quickly every hour or so,'' said Jenrette, during a recent visit to
Edgewater. To visually block the tracks and trains he has planted a
hedge wall.
</P>
<P>
   When Jenrette first saw the estate in 1969, it was owned by
author Gore Vidal, who had rescued the house at the end of World
War II. Since purchasing it, Jenrette has snapped up additional
parcels, bringing the total area from 7 acres to more than 100
acres. He continues to landscape the large parcel on the far side
of the railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Porter, a neighbor, said that when Gore (Vidal) heard a
train coming, he would turn to the dinner guest next to him and
say, `Now tell me about your life,''' said Jenrette. ``Just as the
person began to talk, the roar of the train would drown out all
conversation. Once the train passed, Gore would resume his
dominance over the conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Casually attired in white tennis shoes, white polo shirt and
blue and white seersucker suit, Jenrette walked across the verdant
park-like setting shaded by stately locust trees and lush floral
hedges and gardens. He also has rights to Daisey Island, a short
distance out in the river.
</P>
<P>
   The whole shoreline to Edgewater features a stone wall to
prevent erosion. A stone boat slip originally featured a Chinese
boathouse, built by Robert Donaldson of Fayetteville, N.C., who
bought Edgewater in 1852.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the happiest days in a man's life is when he gets a
boat,'' Jenrette mused. ``The second happiest day is when he sells
it! I had too many mechanical problems with the first and second
boat here. So no more boats.'' Now he enjoys the river as he sits
on his joggling board, made out of cypress wood. ``Every house in
South Carolina has one,'' he said. ``You just sit and joggle up and
down on it. It's very relaxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenrette relocated the swimming pool to the south side of the
house, deliberately hiding it behind a slight rise in the lawn.
Michael Dwyer designed a pool house and Michael Pelletier built it
in a classical style with four Doric columns facing out to the
pool, and a brick wall to further muffle the sound of the passing
trains.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Jenrette also added a small Palladian-style guesthouse
on a point of land he bought to the north of the main house around
a lagoon. Viewed from the front porch of Edgewater, the small
Grecian temple guesthouse provides visual interest as an
architectural folly.
</P>
<P>
   Edgewater represents one of the earliest uses of columns on
residential buildings in America. Along the first floor facing the
columned porch are five French doors topped by louvered fanlights
and shutters. The home appears to be two stories high from outside,
but actually contains four full floors.
</P>
<P>
   To break the symmetry of the main core of the house, an
octagonal library was added to the north side in 1854 by architect
A.J. Davis. A small-screened five-sided porch, where morning coffee
is served from the service kitchen, was added off the dining room
in later years.
</P>
<P>
   The pinkish brown stucco exterior, scored to resemble stone, has
been painted to a faux marble finish. Robert Jackson of Columbia
County, a painter with an international reputation, executed all of
the custom faux finishes in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to the house is through a smaller columned portico
on the land side. The entrance hall with winding staircase features
a painted floor copied from an inlaid floor Jenrette admired in
Russia's Hermitage Palace in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Two doors in the foyer lead to two connecting 14-foot-high rooms
that face the river. The dining room to the south can be separated
from the living room by double sliding mahogany doors.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the era, dining room walls are painted to look
like delicate blocks of white marble. The oval dining table is
surrounded by a rare suite of 12 Duncan Phyfe dining chairs and
French porcelain (each piece stamped in gold with an `L'), which
belonged to the Livingstons. The eyes of an 1821 portrait of former
owner Robert Donaldson follow visitors around the room.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing room is an eye-catching composition consisting of a
pair of gilt Albany mirrors, matching pier tables, a suite of late
Federal style Duncan Phyfe furniture (circa 1815-20), white silk
window treatments and the omnipresent faux marble block walls.
</P>
<P>
   All of the original late Federal-style moldings, medallions and
fireplace mantles have been restored.
</P>
<P>
   To the north on an axis with the dining room and living room is
the octagonal library. A small low-ceilinged connecting hall off
the living room leads into the dramatic 26-foot-high library. A
skylight illuminates the creamy faux marble block walls and green
patterned carpet copied from a ceiling in the Roman Baths of
Pompeii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore (Vidal) converted this lower section of the main house
into a one-car garage,'' said Jenrette. ``I think this may have
originally been the servants' room, because of the fireplace. Not
many garages have a fireplace.''

<P>
   George W. Bush said today he'll make up his mind on a running
mate this weekend, one week before the GOP presidential convention
in Philadelphia. ``The days of speculation are over,'' he said. A
number of House Republicans were circulating a letter for
signatures, hoping to persuade Bush to pick former foe John McCain.
The letter said the only thing Al Gore fears ``is George W. Bush
calling John McCain.'' Asked about the senator specifically, Bush
said, ``He'll be a loyal soldier for my candidacy. He is a man of
duty and he loves his country.'' Bush only smiled when asked what
rank McCain might have in that campaign.
</P>
<P>
   BUT IT'S A GOOD ATTENTION-GETTER
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear today whether the reported conversation between
John McCain and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge would in fact put
McCain seriously in play as an option for George W. Bush, who is
nearing a decision on his running-mate. Sources close to McCain
said, according to several news outlets, that when Ridge reported
the senator's potential interest to the Bush campaign, a senior
aide there received the news coolly. And the Bush campaign
apparently has not requested any of the financial or other
background information usually demanded of a potential vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   COLD WAR HANDS AT THE READY
</P>
<P>
   Cold War diplomatic veterans George Shultz, Henry Kissinger and
Colin Powell are George W. Bush's vision of a great foreign policy
team in a new administration. ``Some of whom, you know, may be a
part of the administration, but all of them are my supporters and
friends,'' Bush teased during an interview with CNN's Larry King.
Also on Bush's list is his campaign's foreign policy chief,
Condoleeza Rice, a Russian and Eastern European affairs specialist
at the National Security Council during Bush's father's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   PLANES, TRAINS AND BUSES
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a stronger commitment from labor, Al Gore tried to rouse
the union faithful in Washington today by accusing George W. Bush
of proposing a Social Security plan that would drain the retirement
trust fund. ``I'm on the side of the men and women who work hard
physical jobs all their lives, who drive those buses and lay down
train track and carry bags at airports for others, and they need
something more than an IOU when they retire,'' Gore told a
convention of the AFL-CIO. The meeting brought together the
federation's transportation trades workers, who include the
Teamsters, machinists and bus drivers who make up about a quarter
of the AFL-CIO's membership.
</P>
<P>
   LABORING HARDER FOR DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor is preparing for the fall campaigns like never
before, boosting campaign contributions and stepping up its efforts
to pull union members to the polls. The goal is to keep the White
House Democratic and return Congress to Democratic control. The
importance of turnout was described by House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, who noted that union members accounted for 13 percent of
the vote in 1994, when the Democrats lost control of Congress, and
23 percent of the vote in 1996 and 1998, when the party added seats
to its House minority.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING THEIR MARKS MONEYWISE
</P>
<P>
   In a year of record-breaking fund-raising, Al Gore has received
$14.6 million in taxpayer funds for his campaign, more than any
other presidential candidate ever. Gore, who agreed to limit his
spending to $40.5 million in exchange for the subsidies, broke the
old mark of $13.5 million by Republican Bob Dole in 1996. George W.
Bush declined to accept federal funds and the spending limits that
accompany them _ but went on to smash all fund-raising records by
taking in $96 million and spending $88 million.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY LEFT OVER FOR SOME EXTRAS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has so much money left over in his campaign bank account
that he is increasing his travel, opening campaign offices around
the country and tripling his campaign staff from 100 to 300 people.
With $7.6 million in the bank as of June 30, Gore also is setting
aside some funds to pay the travel expenses of his vice
presidential choice, should he name the person before the
convention. ``We really tightened the belt and focused on winning
the primaries early,'' said campaign spokesman Douglas Hattaway.
``That has put us on a very sound financial footing now when it
really matters.''
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA TRIAGE
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating on four states that political strategists say
could tip the electoral balance this fall, George W. Bush's
campaign began running its first major TV ads of the general
election. The spots went on the air in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida
and Washington state. But the choice of locales was an instant
subject for dissection by Al Gore aides, who pointed to the
inclusion of Florida as a sign that some crucial states that might
normally be safely in the Republican column were viewed by the Bush
side as in need of some maintenence.
</P>
<P>
   SLIPPAGE IN OHIO
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has lost some ground to Al Gore in Ohio,
considered a swing state in the fall election, a new poll shows.
The University of Cincinnati Institute for Policy Research poll (4
percentage point margin of error) has Bush leading Gore 49-45
percent in a two-candidate field and 47-41 percent when Pat
Buchanan of the Reform Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party are
included. In April, the poll gave Bush a 9-point lead over Gore in
a two-candidate race and an 8-point lead in a four-man race.
</P>
<P>
   TWO WOMEN WITH THE GAVELS
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic convention will shine a spotlight on the fact
that California _ the largest state in the country with 34 million
people _ has elected two women senators. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and
Barbara Boxer will wield gavels in Los Angeles next month as the
first two women co-chairs of a national political convention. Two
women previously chaired Democratic conventions as single chairs:
Texas Gov. Ann Richards in 1992 and Kentucky Gov. Martha Layne
Collins of Kentucky in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   BATTLE ON THE HOME (LOAN) FRONT
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that her New York Senate opponent cared more about
wealthy campaign donors than about constituents, Hillary Clinton
attacked Rick Lazio for trying to kill legislation in 1998 to
expand a federal program that helps first-time home buyers obtain
mortgages. The program, run by the Federal Housing Administration,
assists first-time home buyers or those with shaky credit. Lazio
had vigorously fought it, saying at the time that it was an
unacceptable intrusion by government into private industry. The
program provides competition for mortgage insurance companies,
which charge fees to guarantee mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   KEATING'S HOPES NOT UP
</P>
<P>
   Whoever George W. Bush chooses for a running mate, Oklahoma Gov.
Frank Keating guesses it won't be him. ``I'm not holding my
breath,'' said Keating. ``It's my own intuitive sense. ... I just
don't think it's going to happen.'' Keating, a Catholic with
anti-abortion views similar to Bush's, is mentioned near the top of
almost all guess-lists of possible candidates Bush may be
considering.
</P>
<P>
   IF IT ISN'T ONE THING, IT'S ANOTHER
</P>
<P>
   Her race and Mississippi's once whites-only political machine
kept Mamie Cunningham out of the 1964 Democratic National
Convention. This time she's being sidelined because of gender.
Cunningham was pulled as a delegate to next month's convention in
Los Angeles because Mississippi's racially diverse delegation would
have had two more women than men. She was replaced with state Sen.
David Jordan after another delegate, Balwant Singh, filed a
challenge with the Democratic National Committee. So Cunningham, a
schoolteacher will be making the trip as an alternate instead.
</P>
<P>
   STUPID CANDIDATE TRICKS
</P>
<P>
   ``Late show'' host David Letterman is asking Al Gore and George
W. Bush to debate on his show. Gore quickly accepted the
invitation. Bush didn't immediately respond, but Letterman has been
known to publicly badger politicians into appearances. ``Do you
want a guy that doesn't return calls?'' a smiling Letterman asked,
feigning anger. ``We don't care who wins; we just want to know what
the deal is.'' Both candidates have been on the show. But in an
appearance via satellite earlier this year, Bush's jokes fell
rather flat.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM PARTY IN A FRAZZLE
</P>
<P>
   Factional fighting within the Reform Party has escalated, with
Pat Buchanan forces warning they may try to throw out the party's
primary ballot and seek their candidate's presidential nomination
on the convention floor. Maryland State chairman Robert Bowles, a
Buchanan ally, said the effort to rescind the primary is one way to
retaliate against ``rogue'' forces from the Ross Perot wing of the
party who seek to thwart Buchanan's nomination. John Hagelin, who
one was a Natural Law Party nominee, is the only opposition
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   HOME AGAIN TO CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley will campaign in his
hometown of Crystal City, Mo., Saturday with Gov. Mel Carnahan, a
Democrat trying to unseat Sen. John Ashcroft, a one-term
Republican, in one of the year's hardest-fought congressional
races. Bradley will be campaigning for just the second time since
he dropped out of the Democratic presidential primaries in March.
Last week, he endorsed Al Gore in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   YOU CAN'T GO HOME AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   He has never given any real indication that he might try it, but
President Clinton would face a hard fight if he ran for the Senate
in his native Arkansas, a new poll shows. The Mason-Dixon poll (4
percentage point margin of error), commissioned by the Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette, shows Clinton trailing Sen. Tim Hutchinson, a
Republican whose first term ends in 2002, by 49-41 percent, with 10
percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   SON OF THE PREACHERMAN
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Graham, eldest son of the Rev. Billy Graham and also an
evangelist, will deliver the benediction that closes the first day
of the Republican convention on July 31. Graham, who lives in North
Carolina and is president of Samaritan's Purse, a Christian relief
organization, offered a prayer at the 1996 GOP convention in San
Diego. Graham will fly in from an international evangelists'
conference in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

S.F. RESIDENTS TAKE AIM AT BARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As a PG&AMP;E barge slated for a floating San
Francisco Bay power plant sails through the Panama Canal, residents
stood on the steps of city hall here and vowed to stop it ``on land
and on sea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gravely concerned about plans to moor an antiquated
power plant in our bay,'' said Robert James, a spokesman for the
BayKeeper, a private environmental watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as paving the way for using the bay as an
industrial parking lot,'' James said at a Thursday press conference
held to oppose PG&AMP;E's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, four five-story jet-fueled turbines set atop
the 300 foot by 90 foot barge would send electricity through wires
wrapped in cable, lying on the bay floor, to a newly built
temporary substation on land.
</P>
<P>
   The turbines would generate the same amount of pollution as a
747 flying 55 feet above ground for every hour of every day that it
operated, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the floating power plant surfaced after a
June 14 brownout. Weeks later, PG&AMP;E asked the California Energy
Commission for emergency approval to generate 95 megawatts from its
barge, for up to 15 months, during high-peak use, possibly starting
next month.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E announced Thursday that it wanted to locate the barge in
the bay near San Francisco International Airport. PG&AMP;E said it had
dropped any plans to put the barge, which it bought in the spring,
offshore of San Francisco's Bayview-Hunters Point and Potrero Hill
neighborhoods. Both neighborhoods had strongly opposed the project.
</P>
<P>
   Bayview-Hunters Point residents raised racial and economic
issues, saying the community with the city's largest African
American population already bears the greatest amount of industry.
</P>
<P>
   Potrero residents said they already have a power plant, and
don't know the health effects from those emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Inside city hall later Thursday, after a public hearing, the
commissioners of the Bay Conservation and Development Commission
voted to send a strong letter to the state Energy Commission,
deeming the power plant environmentally unsuitable for the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Many commissioners cited concerns over air and water quality,
wildlife, recreation and scenic beauty. They chided PG&AMP;E for not
anticipating power needs but trying to place BCDC and other
agencies in the position of having accept a poor project.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Betsey Cutler said it was unfortunate that the only
example of offshore power plants that PG&AMP;E could give were the 40
barges that ring Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler called them ``a blight on the landscape'' that reminded
her of the garbage scows that were supposed to be temporary but are
still there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, BCDC can't stop the project if PG&AMP;E is successful in
getting approval from the state Energy Commission for a so-called
energy emergency.
</P>
<P>
   If Gov. Gray Davis grants this emergency status, and he would
have to do so to bring the floating power plant to the bay, the
state Energy Commission can proceed without adhering to the
California Environmental Quality Act. If Davis doesn't grant the
status, then BCDC probably would deem the project unsuitable under
state environmental law.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the PG&AMP;E National Energy Group, a PG&AMP;E
business that develops power plants, told the BCDC commissioners
the utility needed a short-term solution to meet high-energy use
until a permanent plant is ready in 2001.

   GAPACIFIC-future _ What's in store for the new and improved
Georgia-Pacific? The king of plywood and boxes wants to turn away
from its commodity roots and duke it out against consumer marketing
giants such as Procter &AMP; Gamble and Kimberly-Clark. With its
proposed deal to buy rival Fort James and become the world's
largest maker of tissue products, Georgia-Pacific sent a strong
signal this week that it's heading in a new direction. Analysts
expect Georgia Pacific to sell a significant number of paper mills
and operations that don't fit its new consumer-oriented focus.

   LONDON-CULTURE _ LONDON _ Take a walk in Brixton. Four miles
from the gray postcard propriety of Westminster, Brixton is a riot
of noise and color. It pulsates with hefty bass riffs and reggae
rhythms dancing from knee-high speakers on the sidewalks outside CD
stores and appliance shops. In the borough's lively street market,
you hear the melodious sounds of Yoruba, Shona, Arabic, Spanish ?
occasionally even English. No less than Parliament House with Big
Ben and Churchill's statue, however, Brixton now is a part of the
fiber of modern London, a city rapidly being redefined by its
ethnic variety. ``Multiracial London is coming of age, and it is
this that is igniting such energy, buzz and creativity,'' wrote
Yasmin Alibhair-Brown, a columnist for the Independent newspaper
and author of ``Who Do We Think We Are: Imagining the New

goodbye to him. The 65-year-old retiree from Auburn, Ga., stood
lonely vigil on the sidewalk, wringing a tissue in her hands, as
the official processional carried Coverdell's body into the Georgia
Capitol today. ``I'm heartbroken,'' Foxworth said. ``He just
touched me so much. He cared what happened to people, not
particularly his party.'' Foxworth left home at 5:30 a.m. to be

   EDMONSON-COLUMN _ The Internet might be the greatest

The most recent highly visible instance involves a group that

Declaration of Independence. A number of recent columns _ including

&HT;     BIRTH CONTROL PILL SIGNALED THE DAWN OF FEMINISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before ``the pill'' came to mean birth control, young women
who had premarital sex faced a set of potential social consequences
beyond the pregnancy itself.
</P>
<P>
   Unwed, pregnant women sometimes disappeared, to return and
resume life after delivering their babies in charitable homes.
Infants were represented as premature, born once couples were
safely married. Contraceptives and abortions were covertly sought.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine P. Henrikson recalled just what was at stake in the
1960s, while she was a graduate student and sought the pill, which
carried greater health risks than today's version.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remote possibility of a blood clot would have paled by
comparison of being pregnant and not married,'' said Henrikson, now
a 60-year-old research scientist and the new board president of
Upper Hudson, N.Y., Planned Parenthood. ``The social and family
consequences would have been a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The pill in its 40th year has been praised as a revolutionary
breakthrough that freed women and couples to decide the size and
timing of their families. Religious opposition aside, the pill,
too, was criticized, particularly when early forms were linked to
health risks, including possible stroke and blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was perceived differently by different people in
1960, this pharmaceutical form of birth control would become an
undeniable social force, entering the marketplace with a push from
the feminist movement, the sexual revolution and the fight for
civil, including reproductive, rights. A Smithsonian researcher has
called the pill one of the most socially significant medical
advancements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was utterly revolutionary. It really revolutionized birth
control,'' said Janet Farrell Brodie, associate professor of
history at Claremont Graduate University, near Los Angeles. ``It
was relatively cheap, it was relatively safe and accessible, and it
was very, very effective. It gave women the control of fertility
that women wanted for 160 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodie wrote about the history of birth control in ``The
Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History'' (1998 Houghton Mifflin
Co.). Recalling the desperation of poor immigrant women, who in the
early 1900s beseiged birth-control advocate Margaret Sanger for
contraceptive secrets, ``the pill was that thing that women
wanted,'' the historian said.
</P>
<P>
   History shows that the pill had several fathers: scientist Carl
Djerassi in 1951 led the team that developed an early synthetic
progesterone, which, with estrogen, mimics the hormones' natural
function to inhibit ovulation as the body prepares for pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The pill also was the dream of feminists Sanger and Katherine
McCormick, who backed the successful scientific partnership that
created the first one.
</P>
<P>
   Several pharmaceutical companies held a skittish race in the
conservative 1950s to harness the synthetic compounds'
contraceptive power before scientists Gregory Goodwin Pincus and
John Rock successfully developed Enovid for G.D. Searle &AMP; Co. The
U.S. Food &AMP; Drug Administration approved Searle's first
birth-control pill in 1960. Other major companies followed suit,
and within five years, the pill became the most popular
contraceptive in the United States. A woman would take 21 active
pills, stopping to allow menstruation. Some products included seven
placebos, as reminders to continue taking it during the average
28-day cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Henrikson was among the young women for whom the pill meant the
difference between sexual freedom and social disgrace in the
conservative climate of Boston in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   She attended graduate school at Harvard Medical School
throughout most of the 1960s. In Massachussetts, the sale of
contraceptives to unmarried people was illegal until 1972, when the
U.S. Supreme Court struck down the law.
</P>
<P>
   Henrikson had to summon the nerve to seek the pill, once she
began a relationship in college.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls the prevailing view of sex, and the pill's power
over it, this way: ``The great advantage to the pill was it
separated contraception from sex. If you relied on some mechanical
method, that meant you were taking it with you on a date and that
meant you were a bad girl. When people worked up the nerve to ask
for the pill, you still had to get over the idea that this was
premeditated. It meant you were planning to have sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Those young women who got caught by becoming pregnant often
faced circumscribed paths. ``They would simply disappear'' to
deliver the baby into the hands of adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining the pill, too, was often done on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Retrospectives of life in the 1960s are full of stories about
women who were on the pill without admitting it, said Patricia
Gossel, chair of the Division of Science, Medicine and Society at
the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. While it
certainly freed couples from worry about pregnancy, the pill also
occurred in concert with the changing role of women and more
liberal attitudes of the 1960s generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time was right for the pill to come and participate in so
many of the social changes of the 1960s,'' said Elizabeth Siegel
Watkins, author of ``On the Pill: A Social History of
Contraceptives'' (1998 Johns Hopkins University Press).
</P>
<P>
   While the media made the pill an icon of the sexual revolution,
the symbolism oversimplifies a complex era, Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a relaxing of a moral code ... There's got to be
a social shift to make premarital sex more accepted before birth
control is going to be handed out,'' Siegel Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The press speculated greatly about the pill's role in
promiscuity, giving it greater or lesser weight depending on the
medium's editorial slant. But even as news swirled about sexual
revolution, liberal attitudes were slow to reach America's
doorstep. Some conservative middle- and upper-class Americans
considered the pill as part of the problem of wanton premarital
sex, Siegel Watkins found.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, when people had better access, the pill indeed
allowed single men and women to more freely have sex.
</P>
<P>
   Henrikson in 1965 had to work up considerable nerve to ask her
physician. ``I was very nervous about it, but I was trying to
control my own life.'' Like millions of American women, Henrikson,
once married in 1966 and free of side effects, also would use the
pill to time the birth of her two children.
</P>
<P>
   Henrikson is slightly older than the feminists who came behind
her who would question the safety of the pill.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Jaffe attended college in Boston in the early 1960s, but
it wasn't until she had graduated and was working in Syracuse that
she sought the pill. Jaffe traveled alone to a New York clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very scary. It was still very new. It was something to
make a special trip to New York and you didn't tell anyone,'' said
Jaffe, 57, now executive director of a women's philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   The pill's early use coincided with the early stirrings of
feminism. ``At first people felt that one of the results of our
struggle around women's liberation was freer access to birth
control. We felt that the pill and other forms of birth control,
that the availability of birth control was in part a success of our
women's movement,'' Jaffe said of the reaction of women she knew at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   That perception shifted, for Jaffe and some feminist
contemporaries, as awareness of reports of incidents of stroke and
blood clots accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   The pill's possible health complications prompted some women to
look askance at the varying opinions of the mostly male medical
profession, author Watkins writes in ``On the Pill.'' She argues
that this growing skepticism stressed the importance of informed
consent, and the detailed inserts that now accompany many
prescription drugs are the result of those health controversies.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe watched the tide of optimism surrounding the pill change,
once she joined the feminist movement in New York City in the late
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think anymore that the medical establishment was
doing what was best for us,'' said Jaffe, who went off the pill
after a female gynecologist warned her of the possible health
risks. ``The first stage was great, it was something to pop in your
mouth to keep you from having babies.''

<P>
   little too late to save a country beset by violence, civil war
and a powerful leftist guerrilla army. Some critics fear the U.S.

lords, who along with Marxist guerrillas control vast areas in the

   ALADUMP _ LOWNDESBORO, ALA. _ The historic Selma-to-Montgomery
voting rights trail, U.S. Highway 80, runs through rural Lowndes
County, meandering past tracts of dusty farmland, boarded-up gas
stations and sacred civil rights-era ground. A racially mixed group
of developers and county officials, including some who hold office
thanks to the voting rights crusade, feel the 670-acre landfill is
just the thing to jump-start the economy of one of the state's
poorest counties. But landfill opponents, also a mix of blacks and
whites, say a dump near U.S. 80 would be an affront to the memory
of the marchers and hurt both the environment and a fledgling
tourist industry. Last week, the Alabama Department of
Environmental Management granted a permit for a landfill. We take a

   SHUTTERS _ CHARLESTON, S.C. - As he strolls amid the history of

Pinckney Seabrook Wilkinson is alarmed by the declining population.
Not of people, but of shutters. ``You see how silly the house looks
without them,'' said the College of Charleston English instructor
and self-appointed guardian of the historic district's exterior
window dressings. Though few, if any, are so fretful, Wilkinson
said the shutters are disappearing as well-heeled out of towners
snap up historic houses and, during renovation, are not aware, or
do not care, about zoning rules that require shutters to be
replaced. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

   BRUNSWICK _ BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ When Kendra McCrae stormed into the
Brunswick city manager's office recently and demanded an audience,
it was another sign of the continuing unrest in the coastal city
that has spawned violence, marches and calls for change. McCrae, a
28-year-old secretary, was upset over mistreatment she says she and
other blacks received at the hands of police during a July 4th
altercation. That holiday weekend confrontation, which eventually
turned violent, led to a subsequent protest march on Monday (July
17) with others planned. It has also revealed a wider set of
grievances. A loose coalition of residents and ministers is now
calling for sensitivity training for police, a community-wide forum
to discuss racial differences and better economic opportunities for
the city's black population. We examine the continuing evolution of
a city in transition. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

Internet. The system seems simple and settled, but a global battle
is being waged this summer over how addresses will be assigned to
keep pace with rapid Internet growth. The

   stakes are enormous. If plans to establish private control over
the Internet's address system founders on technical details and
political disputes, the global

   VOTERS-SUBURBMOMS _ DATELINE TK _ Four years ago, ``soccer
moms'' gained almost mythical stature as the coveted voting bloc
that would reelect President Clinton or give Republican Bob Dole a
fighting chance. In a close presidential race in 2000 between Al
Gore and George W. Bush, the women's vote is all-important, but
</P>
<P>
   more difficult to define and to attract. So far, polls are
showing that more men are strong supporters of their choice, where
women tend to be more flexible _undecideds or soft supporters of
Gore or Bush. In addition to the gender gap, there is a
particularly large ``marriage'' gap. Clinton led Dole among married
women 53% to 43% in 1996; Gore trails Bush 42 percent to 50

one local official, Sangpo is now a wired outpost. Its 4,800
residents boast private cars, cellular phones, about 100 personal
computers and a bustling Internet cafe. In 20 years, the village
has grown a sheepskin backyard business into a multi-million dollar

half of China's total sheepskin imports. Technology has helped fuel
the growth. (Chao, Cox Washington Bureau). Art includes a 4-column

need for envelopes won't be going away entirely, manufacturers say
they will have to adapt _ i.e., make the envolpes they produce more

proponents say, can drastically reduce or even eliminate mid-air

together and takeoff and land at shorter intervals. UPS will begin
equipping its own planes with ADS-B this year, and others including
FedEx, Airborne and DHL are likely to follow by the end of 2002 88

   FAT-SOUTHERNERS _We know that America overall has a weight
problem - by some measures, 50 percent of the population is at
least somewhat overweight. But what's the Southern piece of that
pie? According to a new AJC poll, Southerners are more likely than
people elsewhere in the US to admit to being ``moderately or
seriously'' overweight - even though they set the bar for what
constitutes ``overweight'' higher than residents of other states
do, and given even more latitude to men than they do to women. At
the same time, though, Southerners are more willing to blame their
own bad habits for their weight problems. Includes interviews with
poll respondents and Southern sociologists. With charts, possible

hard to describe exactly what the unit is doing, it actually does

Luxuries usually strewn about the family room are becoming popular
gadgets in cars and in roomy SUVs. Ever since Oldsmobile introduced
a videocassette player for its minivans in 1998, car-stereo
enthusiasts have been adding more dazzle to audio systems with the
addition of video. And the automotive world is jumping the
bandwagon; every major manufacturer now offers video in the car.

THE RETURN OF FORMER BANK OF AMERICA CHIEF COULTER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ David A. Coulter, who emerged this week with a
top job at Chase Manhattan Bank nearly two years after being ousted
as chairman and chief executive of San Francisco-based Bank of
America, isn't interested in looking back.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter, 52, made that clear Thursday in his first interview
with The Examiner since BofA was purchased by Charlotte, N.C.-based
NationsBank in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview one day after he was named the new head
of Chase's consumer and international banking divisions, Coulter
declined to say much about the circumstances of his departure from
BofA in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   What had been billed as a merger of equals turned into a power
grab by then-NationsBank CEO Hugh L. McColl Jr., who now runs the
combined institution with his top lieutenants from North Carolina,
where BofA became headquartered after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to look forward as opposed to looking backward,''
Coulter said when asked how he views the NationsBank-BankAmerica
combination, and whether, in hindsight, he still would have pursued
the $64 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always tried to make the right decision from the
shareholder standpoint. You never have perfect information when you
make those decisions. It's hard to look back with better
information and say, `How would you change things?'''
</P>
<P>
   The merger has not been a boon for shareholders, with the bank's
stock now trading at $48.38, from a high of $61 in early June.
Shares of the former Bank of America traded at a high of $86.33
after the merger was announced in April 1998, but before the merger
was completed on Sept 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Merging the two banks resulted in 19,000 job cuts through the
end of 1999, including an estimated 3,300 positions in California,
1,800 of them in the San Francisco area. Coulter received a
severance compensation package valued at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt his new senior position at Chase was a
vindication after being forced out of BofA, Coulter said that he
doesn't look at it that way, and that he is pleased that Chase
values his experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to have someone say, `We want you.'''
</P>
<P>
   McColl initially said Coulter would succeed him as CEO of the
merged bank after McColl retired. But Coulter was ousted within two
weeks of the merger, after a quarterly report showed $372 million
in trading losses racked up by a New York investment company that,
using a $1.4 billion loan from Bank of America and other money, had
used a computer-based trading system to buy high-risk securities.
</P>
<P>
   The old NationsBank has since established its dominance over
BofA, holding 13 of 20 board seats as of the end of last year, and
four of five executive committee seats.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter is expected to be settled in New York by September after
shuttling between jobs as a board member of Chase H&AMP;Q and a partner
in the Los Angeles office of Beacon Group, where he manages private
equity investment and advises companies on mergers and
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Thursday that Coulter was a good choice for Chase,
given his experience and reputation for keeping an eye on
shareholder returns.
</P>
<P>
   As for Coulter himself, he said he is in a listening mode to see
how he can best make his presence felt at Chase. The bank's
consumer banking division, which he will oversee, reported a 1
percent increase in operating revenue this week.

THE JOY OF DAY BEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS   
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the forerunner to the sofa and the chaise lounge, the day bed
served as a place for quiet relaxation and contemplative
meditation.
</P>
<P>
   The day bed is a long seat with a stationary or adjustable end
that can be lowered to form a bed. Also called a reading seat, the
day bed became popular during the Restoration period (1660-1685),
and those with double ends were rare.
</P>
<P>
   They were quite fashionable in court circles, where they were
elaborately carved and covered in rich imported silks, damasks and
velvets.
</P>
<P>
   Day beds continued to be popular in large houses of the wealthy,
through the 1900s, where they were often accompanied with a
matching set of chairs and stools.
</P>
<P>
   Being relatively lightweight, the day bed was well suited for
impromptu gatherings and was often arranged with other furnishings
on a terrace or in the garden. Tented day beds also provided a
comfortable place to sleep during the hot summer nights.
</P>
<P>
   Open-frame day beds were popularized in China during the Ming
dynasty (1368-1644). Traditional styles included cabriole legs or
horsefeet.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, day beds were made from walnut or beech wood that
was painted black, with caned seats and backrests and spiral-shaped
stretchers and legs. Day beds made from oak, which was plainer,
were occasionally upholstered with a lightly padded leather.
</P>
<P>
   A long squab cushion or mattress and various cushions made the
day bed a most comfortable resting-place.
</P>
<P>
   New day beds in wood or metal can be found in furniture stores
for approximately $99 to $1,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is either closed on one or both ends and open on both
sides, the day bed is often placed lengthwise along a wall, topped
with an attractive coverlet and lots of fancy and comfy pillows.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the 19th century day beds, there are often tiny
wheels on the feet or legs, providing greater mobility.

   EPA-GRACE-ASBESTOS (Undated) _ The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency is investigating why for 18 years it ignored evidence that a
major U.S. company produced ore for its consumer products that was
laden with asbestos. An agency study in 1982 found alarming levels
in material that W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. has said was virtually free of

people in high-tech; his own wife works for Advanced Micro Devices.
</P>
<P>
   But he's bothered by the adulation of the young high-tech
millionaires, whose sudden fortune has become the talk of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're drawing a lot of attention, sucking up a lot of
resources and building a lot of ugly buildings,'' said Cordle, 45.
``Why does being rich make you interesting or meaningful?''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Serpico, who worked in the insurance industry for nearly
25 years, said she doesn't begrudge these young millionaires their
good luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that we worked for a long time to get what little we
got, and we still don't have what they have, and we never will have
what they have,'' said Serpico, who quit her underwriting job 12
years ago. ``It gets to be a little much sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Society has always had its haves and have nots, its high-living
tycoons and its struggling working class.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet economy has changed the rules and created an
unsually young generation of very wealthy people, seemingly
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The number of millionaires in Central Texas has doubled over the
last five years to 31,000, many of them thanks to the tech boom.
It's a national phenomenon: A Fortune magazine package on what it
called ``the young and the loaded'' included a listing of the 40
richest people under 40. The youngest was 26; the poorest was worth
$243 million.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have missed out on the new economy, it can be hard
to resist some envy or resentment. It's a theme of lunchtime
conversations and letters to the editor, morning talk shows and
beauty parlor prattle. No one wants to appear petty or
materialistic; few of the people interviewed for this story wanted
to share their views publicly. But the sentiments are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both adulate and attack'' the new rich, said Paul
Schervish, director of the Boston College Welfare Research
Institute, which studies how affluence is changing the culture.
``They're our saints and our sinners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American dream is supposed to have the right combination
of effort, intelligence and luck,'' he said. ``When it appears to
be too much, too young, we are bothered by it. It makes us feel
diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   And the in-your-face displays of this wealth can be hard to take
_ the massive mansions, with media rooms and auto barns and master
bedrooms larger than most houses, rising all around Austin; the
shiny midnight blue Corvette with its ``IPO-Vet'' license plate
whizzing by on Mopac; the $36 T-bone steaks and $1,000 bottles of
wine at Austin's growing number of posh restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these new millionaires got there by grueling 80-hour
weeks and sacrificing their personal lives. But then there are the
people who bought Dell at $4 a share or went to work at a startup
weeks before its successful IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Borowitz, New York author of the satirical ``The
Trillionaire Next Door: The Greedy Investor's Guide to Day
Trading,'' a said he never felt envious of the Yankees
centerfielder or the glamorous movie star who pulled in millions of
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could say to myself, I can't catch a fly ball, I can't do
the things they can do,''' Borowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   But this is different, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always been envious of those who have made tons of
money,'' Borowitz said. ``In the current climate, that envy is
coupled with the stinging sense that but for that one good tip or
trade, we could be right where they are. The more unspectacular the
wealthy are, the more it bothers us. We think, 'It could be us. It
should be us.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, wealth was predicated on one's ability to turn
natural resources _ land, cattle, oil _ into riches, said Lodis
Rhodes, a professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs who
specializes in technology and community development.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the 19th Century _the Gilded Age _ was a tremendous
period of innovation, with the advent of the telephone, the
automobile and electricity. These were the days of the Morgans and
Rockefellers and Carnegies, who made their fortunes off steel,
coal, oil and the railroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were the entrepreneurs who helped build industries and
became wealthy in the process _ wealth like society had never
seen,'' said Marcia Cantarella, an assistant dean at Princeton
University who teaches a course called ``The Big Money: America's
Ambivalence Toward Wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been other periods of explosive wealth -- the 1920s,
with its stock market boom and land speculation, and the ``greed is
good'' '80s, Cantarella said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge has been a traditional path to wealth. People spent
years in law school or medical school, going on to build successful
practices. They paid their dues.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in this new information economy, people are turning ideas
into gold with astonishing speed. Neither age nor experience seem
to matter, and the concept of dues paying has all but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can come up with an idea that seems to be new, and you
can market it as a new idea, you can quickly turn that into paper
wealth,'' Rhodes said. ``That accounts for why you can have
twenty-somethings with a great deal of paper wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony, said Borowitz, is that even those with money feel
envious in this new economy. Doctors and lawyers look longingly at
the large fortunes of young techies. Those with millions, he said,
long for billions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Wall Street types who are infuriated that their huge
bonuses are dwarfed by the incredible paper millions of the
dot-comers,'' Borowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If life is defined by how much money you make, then there was
a whole generation that was sold a bill of goods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In some new economy capitals, the backlash has been hostile.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco Bay area, where an estimated 64 new
millionaires are created every day, and real estate prices have
become insanely high, these sentiments have become increasingly
visible.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, a group called the Yuppie Eradication
Project has emerged in response to the gentrification of the city's
Mission District.
</P>
<P>
   One flier urged that ``Cigar bar clowns be chased back to the
suburbs'' and that ``Lexus, Porsches and Jaguars be vandalized.''
The project has encouraged the bombing of yuppie bars and
restaurants . Some have awakened to find their homes or cars
spray-painted with such phrases like ``Get Out Yuppie Scum.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement's leader, Kevin Keating, was arrested last summer
for making terrorist threats after police picked him up with a
knapsack stuffed with anti-yuppie fliers. The charges were later
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some street guerilla reaction building,'' said Gary
Chapman, an expert on the new economy at the LBJ School of Public
Affairs at the University of Texas, although he says it's a hard
thing to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, the signs have been milder. In Hyde Park, one of
several Central Austin neighborhoods where charming old bungalows
are being snatched up by young families with money, fliers have
been taped up with the warning: ``This neighborhood is being
gentrified.''
</P>
<P>
   A billboard on West Fifth Street for Buffalo Billiards says:
``Pretend this ball is your friend who can't stop talking about how
much he made on his IPO. It's your shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest people feel too envious of this new generation of
millionaires, there is a downside, according to some experts. It's
not all champagne and caviar.
</P>
<P>
   In a culture where almost anybody can be turned into a victim,
psychologists have coined a names include a deep identity crisis,
anxiety, guilt and dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, two psychologists in the Bay Area recently established
a clinic for depressed millionaires called The Money, Meaning and
Choices Institute. Although headquartered in the San Francisco Bay
Area, the institute deals has clients from coast to coast, said
psychologist Stephen Goldbart, one of the founders of the
institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a society that says that if you have money, you
should be happy,'' Goldbart said. ``What we discovered is that a
lot of people who come into money are shocked at how it affects
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course those with ``No Wealth Syndrome'' _ most everybody
else _ may find it hard to sympathize with their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the big bank account is the panacea, then everyone else
will feel left out,'' Goldbart said.

 &HT;    BMW 323i wagon fast, versatile
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although available in other parts of the world for some time,
it's only now that BMW's compact 323i sport wagon, read station
wagon, is available in the United States. It can only enhance sales
of the 3-Series line, which includes the Z3 and ``M''
high-performance roadsters and coupes built at Greer, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, here's a wagon that enables consumers and critics to
say, ``Hey, this drives and rides like a sedan.''
</P>
<P>
   Pricing begins at $29,200 with the 323i debuting as a vehicle
strong on safety that offers seating for five with enough engine _
a 170-horsepower inline six-cylinder _ to move briskly. It's
difficult to believe traditional wagon drivers are going to really
be swayed by the 323i's 155 mph speedometer and BMW's claim that
it's computer-limited to 128 mph and has a zero-to-60 mph time of
8.8 seconds. Those are not real-world numbers, but come from
professional drivers on test tracks.
</P>
<P>
   No, what's best about the 323i is its sheer utility. So it won't
take the 4-by-8 sheet of plywood that's the traditional test of
van, wagon and pickup cargo capacity. What it will do is take five
passengers, two really comfortable and three a bit crowded in the
second seat, and 25.7 cubic feet of cargo.
</P>
<P>
   It does this while, well, driving like a sedan and
parking/maneuvering like a compact. An unloaded weight of 3,351
pounds gives a solid feel, and the 323i has an overall length of
14-plus feet, about the same as a Ford Escort or Mitsubishi
Eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is typical BMW, meaning it provides good
white-on-black instrumentation with orange lighting at night,
comfortable six-way adjustable front seats and simple controls. The
test 323i, which totaled $34,620, added optional steering-wheel
controls for the upscale stereo and traction/stability control
systems that enhance drivability and safety. Power anti-lock disc
brakes are a standard feature on all 3-Series vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its test-track figures and 170-hp engine, the five-speed
automatic can be draggy in coming up to speed and isn't really
eager to downshift. Fortunately, there's a manual-shift feature
and, for purists, a five-speed manual transmission is standard.
</P>
<P>
   Limit the number of passengers to four, and all will ride in
style. The outboard rear seats are about as cushy as those up
front. The 323i has a sizable rear center console that folds and
pops out drink holders every bit as functional as the two up front.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of three rear head restraints hampers rear
visibility a bit; otherwise, it's good all around. The cargo area
comes with a restraining net and a window-blind type cover to hide
whatever's being hauled.
</P>
<P>
   But the 323i is best viewed as a people mover, one that should
fare well in the metro area in view of the popularity of upscale
vehicles. It's also a good alternative to gas-guzzling
sport-utilities and vans that don't drive like sedans.

OLD FLAMES FLICKER BRIGHTLY, ELECTRONICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By LINDA LEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, I have had seductive e-mail relationships with men. But I
never got in over my head until I started e-mailing old boyfriends.
Suddenly I had Internet relationships with two men simultaneously,
both of them former lovers I found on the Web. With one, I was like
a frisky Doris Day. With the other, I was Catherine Deneuve. With
both of them, I was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   One lives in San Francisco and is tender, handsome and caring.
He is also poor and practically mute. (Actual quote: ``I'm a
nonverbal guy, that's just the way I am.'')
</P>
<P>
   The other lives abroad and is rich, articulate and loving. He is
also married. (Actual quote: ``I'm a married guy, and I'm not going
to have my wife whacked. She's too much fun. You just have to
accept that.'')
</P>
<P>
   Let's rewind here. Pay attention. According to USA Today, 61
percent of American singles will look for a date on the Internet
this year. Most will go to sites like match.com or 2ofaKind.com.
There are no figures on how many will look up old boyfriends, and
probably for good reason: War casualties don't tend to respond to
USA Today surveys.
</P>
<P>
   One woman warned me: ``Don't do it! You'll see. Men never
change.'' What she didn't mention was that some women never change,
either.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has made it easy _ too easy _ to locate old
friends, classmates and flames, what with the proliferation of
nationwide telephone directories and powerful search engines. The
Internet reaches everywhere and is at once intimate and false,
seductive and unreal.
</P>
<P>
   But an e-mail relationship also means being alone on Saturday
night. Guests leave, children grow up, dogs die, and the e-mail
addict is still there, pounding the keys, and it's always Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to go back through a mental Rolodex and type in
the names of all your boyfriends, starting with the one in fourth
grade who kicked you in the shin. That isn't what I did, however. I
looked for one old lover intentionally, and the other one pretty
much fell into my lap. I swear I don't do this as a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Case Study A.: the one who got away. It is 1977, and a handsome,
well-educated inventor named A. has been squeezed out of my life by
a more successful man. Let's face it, I mistreated him, because I
had met someone more glamorous. By the time the relationship with
Mr. Glamour Puss ended badly (if you call his death ``ending
badly''), my old boyfriend, A. (not his real first initial), had
moved from New York to San Francisco. I tried looking him up in the
phone book. I tried electronic databases. No luck.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps A. was dead. Why else would someone drop from sight? Yet
I never gave up. Two years ago, I idly typed A.'s name into a
search engine, and there he was. With his own Web site, no less,
promoting a new invention. I wrote and he wrote back, tersely, that
he was married and had a 4-year-old daughter. We e-mailed another
time or two, but the letter I remember came two Christmases ago.
``My wife threw me out,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   This created an unpromising image (``loser'' came to mind), but
I was glad for the news. There were more e-mail messages: long ones
from me, short ones from him, the e-mail equivalent of grunts.
Somehow through that raggedy correspondence, and without ever
actually talking on the phone or exchanging pictures, we made
arrangements many months later to meet at my country house. I
looked up from my desk and there he was, this good-looking, 6-foot,
gray-haired man, standing in my driveway, holding his daughter's
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his erratic e-mails and inability to express himself,
he had arrived four hours early. He caught me with dirty hair, no
makeup and in sweat pants _ not my most fetching look, and at my
age I need a lot of fetching.
</P>
<P>
   I considered ducking under my desk. But he was already staring
at me through the window and smiling. I went outside. I was not
slim. I was over 50. And I hadn't combed my hair. But he thought I
was beautiful. He didn't say it, of course. But he looked it.
</P>
<P>
   Our first kiss? He and I were walking toward the house when I
reached up to touch his shoulder, to tell him that I was sorry, all
those years ago, that I had gone for that other guy.
</P>
<P>
   He turned and, before I could say a word, closed in. It was a
tender kiss, full of promise. There were two other kisses, each
more elaborate than the last, and then lunch, and then he and his
daughter drove off.
</P>
<P>
   More e-mails. He wrote sparingly. ``What's with this guy?'' I
asked my friends. ``He's not a writer,'' they said. ``Pick up the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   But the phone wasn't a great success, either. Finally I e-mailed
him to ask when we were going to see each other again. (It is true
that I may have thrown in some erotic language, perhaps a
description of my feelings about those kisses to move things
along.) Finally, he e-mailed back to say he was coming to New York.
But (more miscommunication) a week before his arrival, I still
didn't know if he was coming to woo me or to make a courtesy call.
</P>
<P>
   I called him. ``Do you want me to pick you up at the airport?''
I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he said. ``Pick me up at the airport, and we'll go
straight to your place _ and then to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   A younger woman might have been insulted. I was thrilled at this
show of confidence in a 56-year-old man and immediately went into a
paroxysm of self-improvement. This time when A. saw me, he was not
going to catch me unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   We met again in Utah, at a film festival, and again in San
Francisco. There were romantic, amusing encounters, one after
another, including a trip to the Napa Valley. We lolled around in
his skid-row apartment. What could be better?
</P>
<P>
   A. was the polite kind of man who opened doors for me. What he
wouldn't open was himself. He would hold my hand while we drove in
the car, but he wouldn't reach out for me emotionally. Still, I
thought all was perfect _ except three things. We lived on separate
coasts. A. was terrible with e-mail, with any kind of
communication. And then there was Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   He had called and asked a question that any woman would find
romantic: ``What's your ZIP code?'' Then Valentine's Day arrived,
and this is what he sent: a postcard. Let's consider this for a
minute _ a postcard. With a handwritten inscription that violated
the basic rule of Valentine's sentiment. It did not contain the
words ``I'' and ``you.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he now had a rival for my affections, a man who had sent
four dozen long-stemmed red roses, and to the right place, my
office.

 &HT;    Golden Bear, southpawsget their due
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. Andrews, Scotland _ This was a day that could grab and jerk
you about in a dozen different directions. You know how the Scots
are about tradition. Their halls hang heavy with it. They say grace
over their battlefields. There's a marker or some symbol for
anything of any consequence that ever took place here, from
Bannockburn to Leuchers. So it fell to reason that Jack Nicklaus'
last British Open would not be allowed to pass without due
ceremony, especially being here at St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   That is, should it be his last, which I doubt. But the Scots
made the most of it, posing him and having him wave from the stone
bridge at 18, doing the traditional ``farewell'' news conference,
during which he let it slip that chairman Hugh Campbell, of the
Championship Committee, already had invited him back to St. Andrews
when the Open returns in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be 65 then, and I'll have to see how it goes. I don't say
that this is my very last. I don't ever, ever say never,'' Nicklaus
said, speaking to an interview room packed with a panting press
herd.
</P>
<P>
   So choke back the tears. Spare the grief. Save yourself until
the Golden Bear etches it in stone.
</P>
<P>
   On another sentimental side, the most refreshing event of the
day centered on the tragicomic figure of the Open at Carnoustie
last year. Jean Van de Velde, the Frenchman, came off more popular
in defeat than he would have been in victory. Far more widely known
and acclaimed than Paul Lawrie, who won, and who joined a brigade
of former champions who were missing the cut here.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring his ambitions to America, Van de Velde has done
more in the name of sportsmanship than even the Boy Scouts. He has
played well, earned well and borne up under burden of his
bunglesome finish at Carnoustie in good spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it get tiring? Not really,'' he said to answer a
question. ``I said last year that I would probably have to talk
about it for 10 years. I played 71 holes pretty well. That's what
I'm looking at. No one beat me even in 72 holes.''
</P>
<P>
   He lost the four-hole playoff to Lawrie, and not to be forgotten
is Justin Leonard, third party to the extended championship.
</P>
<P>
   So while Lawrie, the Scot, was checking in with rounds of 78-75,
and out of town, Van de Velde finished with a birdie at 18 and a
round of 68, 36 holes in 139. The bunker at the Road Hole cost him
a stroke. The lead is not unachievable. And the audiences of the
Old Course are cheering along with him. ``My reception has been
fantastic,'' he said, ``but it has been like that everywhere I go
all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The first 36-hole leader who made an appearance on the board
brought into focus another side of the game, the left side. Steve
Flesch, the Kentuckian who dodged basketball _ ``I went to
Kentucky, where basketball is life, but fortunately I found golf''
_ checked in at 137 and played an encore visit to the media center.
It was then established that with four left-handed players in the
field, this a record for the sinister side at a British Open:
</P>
<P>
   Flesch, Phil Mickelson, Mike Weir and the curtain-call champion
of 1963, Bob Charles.
</P>
<P>
   This championship has a peculiar attachment to the southpaw
side. It is the only major ever won by a left-hander. Now it
appears that three of the four would make the cut, Flesch leading
the parade. He is not the first left-hander out of the University
of Kentucky. Russ Cochran, who is not here, preceded him, and at
times they have found themselves sort of lone rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny thing, `` Flesch said, ``Kentucky is a school with two
professionals on the tour and both are left-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the limestone in the water, which, they say, lends to
the breeding of great thoroughbreds. Flesch comes from Union, Ky.,
a burg just south of Cincinnati. He started playing golf
right-handed, ``because my father was right-handed. Then I hit some
balls with one of my uncle's clubs. He's left-handed. It felt so
good I changed. I'm naturally left-handed, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be scoring changes, and Flesch would be passed by
David Toms, another Southeastern Conference alum, from LSU. But
hovering above the field, like the Goodyear blimp, a shadowing
menace, was Tiger Woods, and it appeared the 2000 Open was sitting
there for his taking.
</P>
<P>
   But for the day, here's to the guys who swing from the other
side.

 UNDATED: my office.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Case Study B.: the cad.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, a New York society figure introduced me to B. We spent
two wild days together, and then he left for another woman, an old
girlfriend, before returning to his wife (again, this was the
1970s). B. behaved badly then, just as I had behaved badly with A.
And yet B. was the perfect man, witty, charming, handsome,
egotistical _ all the bad things. A completely dangerous man. Just
my type.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years later, B. was in the news. Someone suggested I
get in touch with him for a project I was working on and provided
an e-mail address. I wrote, ``Do you remember me, I used to work
with ....'' He replied, ``Of course I remember you.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, he was sending roses to my office on
Valentine's Day. Everyone assumed they were from A. (``He must have
really liked the stilettos,'' a co-worker said.) But the flowers
were from a man I hadn't touched in 24 years and whose voice I had
forgotten. They were from a man who wrote me e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But what e-mail! He dallied with me. He teased. He charmed. He
quoted Yeats. He praised my (as yet unseen) beauty. He told me he
couldn't live without me. He said, on the card that came with the
roses, ``What we are doing now is far more erotic than anything we
have ever done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible to fall in love with someone who writes you love
letters but whom you haven't seen? A man you do not remember having
sex with, although he insists you did and provides long
remembrances to prove it? Well, duh.
</P>
<P>
   With B. I learned that it is possible to read between every line
of a letter, perhaps between every letter of a word. To analyze the
position of x's and o's at the end of a message (and invent some
new ones).
</P>
<P>
   I learned that it is possible to fight, cry, make up, all in
e-mail. I also learned that the ``forward'' function provided an
easy way to share e-mail messages with friends. Their opinions
could then be sent back to him for further commentary.
</P>
<P>
   His letters said things like ``I'm full of heartache and longing
for you. I've been pursuing you and I want you. And even more
wonderful, I've had you, and we were spectacular.'' He could spell,
too.
</P>
<P>
   It was like any relationship. We both had our insecurities,
mostly about looks and the ravages of time. Worse, the possibility
that we would actually find each other boring if we met. And there
was jealousy. When I went out one evening, he complained. ``I was
very blue not hearing from you for hours,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The first time he picked up the phone to call me was late at
night, after we had had an e-mail argument. Pity for me his voice
was like Pierce Brosnan's (B. is an American ex-pat). Then he began
picking up the phone and calling me if he believed we had had a
misunderstanding involving so much as a word, perhaps even a comma.
But we still e-mailed.
</P>
<P>
   He professed to love me, no matter what I looked like. ```Women
north of 50, not slim, not young ... and tired' happen to be my
special fancy,'' he wrote. ``The only important change in you that
I can fathom has nothing to do with lines or pounds or years. I've
already added those trifles on. You're exactly as I expected,
though even more intense.''
</P>
<P>
   How does he know what I look like now? The Internet had taken
care of that too. I had scanned a photograph of myself and sent it
to him as an e-mail attachment. In response, I got this: ``How
exciting to have a magnetic blob of pixels waiting for me to kiss
open! How maddening that I can't manage it. The file extension is
.max, which Windows doesn't recognize nor do my other image-making
programs. Now if it was .jpg, or .gif, or .tiff.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that kind of talk seems seductive, especially when followed
with ``Pity I can't tear it open with my teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   What about A., you ask? I continued to e-mail A., and to call
him. I even tried to hint to A. that there might be a B.
</P>
<P>
   But A. seemed resolute in his uncommunicativeness. A. used the
word ``darling'' once in an e-mail, but what he wrote was
``Darling, as they say in the movies.'' (Wake up, A., some people
say it in real life.) B. threw ``darlings'' around like Tic Tacs.
</P>
<P>
   A. was a man you could grab, a single man who might change a
tire for you. B. was a married fantasy, passionate but
noncorporeal. And he had a history of being a bounder. Perhaps he
was just working in a new medium.
</P>
<P>
   B. told me he had changed. ``I gave up trying to be fascinating
to women a long time ago, except with you,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Seduction? The man could write a textbook. An unmarried man has
to be careful how he uses the word ``love.'' A married man can use
the word with abandon. ``I don't have to tell you that I love you,
but I will,'' B. wrote, ``because I do. If that admission blows up
your life or mine rather than improves it, we're greater fools than
I believe we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when the women's chorus around me was turning against him,
he did something they all admired. Admired even more than the
roses. He set up a stock trading account in my name, put cash into
it, and began managing it for me.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the women's chorus was singing a different tune.
``Ooooh,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course he was distracting me from A. Should I pick the
romantic, impossible, passionate and assertive (married) suitor
from abroad? Or the down-to-earth, preverbal, hurt and flat broke
(available) candidate in San Francisco?
</P>
<P>
   I asked a well-known psychiatrist, Dr. Edward Hallowell,
``Doctor, what should I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Here was his response (by e-mail, of course): ``I am always a
sucker for the Jimmy Stewart character who can't say his lines but
has good character and a heart full of love. On the other hand,
maybe Mr. Rich and Effusive is not just a superficial
high-intensity-seeker, sure to dump you as soon as he lands you.
Maybe he has depth as well as passion and roses. Maybe he is Mr.
Right! Who knows? Keep them both. Enjoy the attention. Let them
both exert themselves. It is good for them to do this. It is good
for you, too.'' Yes, doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is advice that works only in a cyberworld. In a
cyberworld you can keep both men, without fear of complications. In
a cyberworld B. doesn't have to leave his wife.
</P>
<P>
   And it turned out that only one wanted to exert himself: the
married one. A. dropped out of the race when I began insisting on
some pronouns. B. and I met four months after we began writing. It
turns out that in person he is just as romantic, charming and
persuasive as he is in e-mail. And more fun to have a drink with in
person. He says he is leaving his wife. Of course, he hasn't put
that into an e-mail, so I can't be sure he means it.
</P>
<P>
   But I have one last resort. If B. betrays me, if it turns out
we've been on a joy ride and not headed for a happy ending, I have
the ultimate threat: I delete thee, I delete thee, I delete thee.

GORE, IN SPEECH TO LABOR, ATTACKS BUSH SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to shore up his support among organized
labor, Vice President Al Gore Friday told a transportation trades
convention that Texas Governor George W. Bush's plan to partially
privatize Social Security would put the system into ``virtual
bankrupty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would turn Social Security into a program of social
insecurity, burdened not only by debt but also by doubt,'' Gore
said at the AFL-CIO's Transportation Trades Department Convention.
``He would take the `trust' out of the trust fund and turn it into
a borrow-and-spend approach.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending the week attacking Bush's record in Texas, Gore
used the appearance before the transportation trades workers, who
make up a quarter of the AFL-CIO's membership, to turn his focus to
Bush's policies as president, including Social Security and the
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   He also took the opportunity to try to generate more enthusiasm
among organized labor, some of which has withheld its support for
Gore because of differences with him over free trade and
permanently normalized trade status for China.
</P>
<P>
   Gore urged the union members to ``fight off any cynics'' who say
he and Bush are the same and it wouldn't make a difference which
one is elected president. ``It does make a difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation workers gave Gore a standing ovation and
prolonged applause before he began speaking, prompting Gore to
quip, ``I feel a little spark of enthusiasm in this group.''
</P>
<P>
   While the vice president restated his support for raising the
minimum wage by $1 an hour, he said Bush proposes making the
minimum wage increase ``optional state by state . . . so states
could just opt out of a minimum wage increase.'' He then asked,
``Well, what is that all about?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan said Bush would support a $1
increase in the minimum wage as long as there is flexbility for
states to consider the impact of the wage increase on their work
force and communities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he realized ``it's summertime and not everyone is
following this election all that closely right now.'' But he
suggested that this week ``will be looked back upon as a turning
point for a number of reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those reasons, he said, was an article about Social
Security written by Martin Feldstein, an adviser to Bush and an
economics professor at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein, who favors the governor's plan to revise Social
Security by allowing people to invest a portion of their payroll
taxes in the stock market, argued that ``no other policy can do as
much'' as a Bush-type plan to help low- and middle-income people
save for retirement. But Gore and his campaign seized on a line in
the column, which appeared in Monday's Washington Post, that said
benefits would not need to be cut if the trust fund runs dry
because the trust fund could borrow ``temporarily to bridge its
funding gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Feldstein had revealed ``the key fact'' about Bush's
Social Security plan: ``That it would put it into virtual
bankruptcy and then borrow so heavily that its future would be at
dire risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 65 years of its existence, the Social Security Trust Fund
has never been allowed to run dry, has never gone into deficit, has
never been forced to borrow from general revenues. This is a brand
new departure,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan later retorted, ``This is was another stop on Al Gore's
trample the truth tour _ this time with a recycled attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said the Clinton-Gore administration had done nothing
in nearly eight years to extend the life of Social Security. He
said the Bush plan would preserve existing benefits for senior
citizens and those nearing retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore joked that he was ``thinking about putting out a list of
top 10 reasons why'' he was looking forward to debating Bush.
Social Security, he said, would be reason number one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the side of the people. He's on the side of the
powerful,'' Gore said. ``I'm on the side of the men and women who
work hard physical jobs all their lives and repair those buses and
lay down train tracks and carry bags at airports for others, and
they need something more than an IOU when they retire.''

ECONOMIC VIEW: DEATH, TAXES AND LETTING THE HEIRS FOOT THE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By TOM REDBURN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Americans should not be taxed when they die,'' declared Rep.
Bill Archer, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, just before the House voted last month to end what
opponents of the estate tax call the ``death tax.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ancient Egyptians built elaborate fortresses and tunnels
and even posted guards at tombs to stop grave robbers,'' he added.
``In today's America, we call that estate planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad line, but what about the living? Should someone be
able to inherit, say, $10 million without paying any tax on it? If
you cash in $10 million in stock options from starting a new
company, you face a federal tax bill of as much as $2 million on
the capital gains. And someone who gets a $10 million paycheck for
starring in a movie or pitching for the Yankees probably pays a tax
of nearly $4 million. Where's the logic in treating these people
differently?
</P>
<P>
   There isn't any, argues William Gale, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution in Washington, who recommends that the United
States replace the estate tax with a true inheritance tax, or what
he calls a ``transfer'' tax. This distinction is not just
semantics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The estate tax raises all kinds of emotional arguments about
the tax collector reaching into the grave,'' Gale said. ``But if
you think broadly about the tax system, it makes sense to tax all
sources of income consistently. Ideally, a transfer of wealth,
whenever it occurs, should be treated the same as any other source
of income,'' with taxes on it payable by the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way the estate tax works. Today, when a wealthy
person dies, his estate pays a tax on the value in excess of
$675,000, an amount that is scheduled to rise gradually to $1
million by 2006. Family-owned businesses and farms are exempt up to
$1.3 million. Above those limits, estates are subject to a
graduated tax, with a top rate of 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a politically popular move, both houses of Congress have
voted to eliminate the estate tax within 10 years. Lawmakers
rejected a White House proposal simply to raise the exemption for
family businesses and farms. For the moment, nothing is likely to
change, since President Clinton has said he will veto the repeal
bill.
</P>
<P>
   But many economists contend that a true inheritance tax _
introduced as part of a broader overhaul aimed at simplifying the
whole income tax system, closing loopholes and reducing rates as
much as possible _ looks like a better approach than either of the
alternatives currently on the table. Large transfers of wealth
would be treated like other sources of income, with all the
recipients paying taxes on their bequests at rates similar to those
imposed on wages, interest and dividends. By broadening the tax
base, rates could be lower, too. In the case of ongoing businesses,
Gale recommends a method to make the payments more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the United States is one of only three major countries
_ Britain and New Zealand are the others _ that rely solely on the
estate tax to tax transfers of wealth. Most others use inheritance
taxes or some combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting as well that some of the most thoughtful
supply-siders _ those who worry that high marginal tax rates
discourage work and savings _ are not necessarily opposed to
inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The estate tax is a very inefficient tax,'' says Alan
Reynolds, director of economic research at the Hudson Institute in
Washington. ``It's a major source of complexity, and the truth is
that it is fairly easy to avoid. An inheritance tax, at a low rate
and allowing for income averaging, avoids many of its problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the existing estate tax argue that repeal would
simply be a gift to those who deserve it least. And in a political
system where there are many competing claims by far needier people,
it would be.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, keeping the estate tax provides a powerful extra
incentive for wealthy people to give to charity or set up
foundations, helping to soften the harsher edges of a capitalist
system that has rewarded them so handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   But its critics have a point, too. At the top rates, a dollar of
earned income left in a taxable estate yields only about 27 cents
for heirs. That may encourage some high-income professionals and
executives, argues Martin Feldstein, a conservative economist at
Harvard, ``to retire early or simply to work less, save less and
take less investment risk,'' creating less wealth for society as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   So why not impose a more reasonable tax _ on the heirs? Then
they might decide to go out and pull their weight, too.

2001 CHRYSLER PT CRUISER: THE SEXIEST VAN ALIVE?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Good and proper fenders, those curvaceous swells of metal
flanking the bodies of vintage cars, began to fade away with
Chrysler's Airflow of 1934. By the mid-1950s, fenders were pretty
thoroughly smoothed into cars' overall shape. Now, with the
Chrysler PT Cruiser, fenders are back. Can't the company make up
its mind? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fenders are but one of many nostalgic notes played by the
2001 PT Cruiser, DaimlerChrysler's category-defying
minivan-cum-sedan. Its overall shape owes much to the 1937 Plymouth
PT50 commercial sedan as well as to the Ford Fordor sedan of the
late 1930s _ with a 1950 Chevy Panel Van and a little Willys
Overland in there somewhere _ though with the PT Cruiser these
contours are drawn with a mighty small pen. Visually, the
diminutive car comes close to being silly _ you rather expect
clowns to tumble out, or Shriners _ but the aggressively posed
front end, reminiscent of the hangdog look of classic street rods,
saves the car from terminal cuteness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the Cruiser is no longer hot news _ they've been in
rental fleets for months _ it is indisputably the hot ride of the
summer. Curious car lovers are still swarming around the car like
pesky mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   But novelty wears off and nostalgia is a shallow sentiment. The
glow went off the New Beetle when, in the sober light of the
showroom, shoppers began to see that it was limited by its
flower-powered design, that the roofline offered wasted headroom up
front but a neck-bending lack of it in back. In contrast, the PT
Cruiser's charismatic retro design merely camouflages what is
actually a supremely efficient box on wheels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lift the yawning rear hatch lid and you see that the floor is
flat, thanks to a low-profile beam-axle rear suspension. No
shock-absorber towers intrude into the space.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Government can't decide what to make of the PT Cruiser.
With its cargo-carrying versatility, it is a truck in the eyes of
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which enforces
fuel-economy standards and safety rules; the Environmental
Protection Agency sees a car in there, and holds it to automobile
pollution standards. The Cruiser _ PT stands for personal
transportation _ demonstrates how out of date the government's
taxonomies are in a market where some of the most popular new
vehicles are neither car nor truck.
</P>
<P>
   The split rear bench seat, with three sets of belts, folds flat
or can be pivoted upright and secured with straps to the middle
window pillar. The seats can be unlatched from the floor and
removed. (Since these units are heavy and awkward, a back brace
should be among the options.) With the rear seats out and the front
passenger seat folded down, the interior is cavernous, big enough
to hold two or three mountain bikes, an eight-foot ladder or a
downtown DJs rave-ready turntable and loudspeakers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even with the seats in place, but folded down, this van-in-drag
offers loads of usable cargo space. The package shelf in back _ it
can be used in several positions, and also doubles as a fold-out
table for tailgate parties _ can be positioned to form a level
surface from rear hatch to dashboard. If you run a catering service
or flower shop, your next delivery van has arrived. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the driver, gaining access to the PT Cruiser is as easy as
pulling up a chair at the dining-room table; the low step-in height
(about mid-shin on me) and high lintels mean one doesn't lean or
duck to get in _ as one must with, say, a Dodge Neon. The driver's
seat is mounted high, rather like a lifeguard's chair, affording
excellent legroom as well as the commanding seating position that
would-be SUV owners crave.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rear seat is some 8 inches higher than the one in front, so
passengers back there can see ahead (a car-sickness-prevention
measure that parents will appreciate along the Taconic Parkway).
Still, the rear headroom is more than ample for the most ambitious
beehive hairdos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The PT is only 168.8 inches long, nearly a foot shorter than the
Ford Focus wagon, but offers 64 cubic feet of cargo space, beating
the Ford by 8 cubic feet. The secret to this space efficiency _ and
the headroom, the great visibility, the easy access _ is the
elevated roof. At 63 inches high, the PT is a half-foot taller than
the Focus, which is itself fairly upright.
</P>
<P>
   In another company's hands, such a tall, stubby package would
look _ well, the word ``dorky'' comes to mind, along with the image
of the Toyota Echo. But DaimlerChrysler has wisely concealed the
PT's proportions with heart-grabbing retro touches.
</P>
<P>
   The fat fenders, the low and prominent bumpers, the lower-body
contours that suggest running boards, all give the Cruiser a firm
visual foundation that keeps it from looking tipsy, although the
center of gravity is quite high by car standards. The government
has conducted crash tests, but has not yet released the results. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That foundation is more than skin deep. The PT Cruiser feels
overbuilt, really sturdy for what could be considered, by some
measures, a subcompact. The middle roof pillars are thick and the
doors are wide and hefty.
</P>
<P>
   Under power, the PT's big-boned structure provides rattle-free
composure and excellent isolation from even the shabbiest secondary
roads. Contrary to popular belief, the Cruiser shares few
mechanical parts with the Neon. Indeed, the Cruiser, which is built
in Toluca, Mexico, has a surprising number of exclusive parts,
along with a smattering of minivan bits.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of substance is underscored in the heavy steel door
handles on the outside _ how many women will lose a nail on these
old-fashioned push-button mechanisms? _ as well as the polished
chrome door levers on the inside. The door gussets in the Limited
Edition test car were rich suede over dense, sound-deadening
panels. The sturdy rubber door pulls were textured to match the
wrap on the four-spoke steering wheel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All this comfort and convenience comes with considerable mass.
Tipping the scales at more than 3,200 pounds, the test car worked
up a lather accelerating to interstate speeds. Under hard throttle,
all the hard-won interior quiet melted in the face of engine howl.
Powered by an in-line four cylinder of 2.4 liters (with 150
horsepower and peak torque of 162 foot-pounds at 4,000 rpm), the PT
won't tempt hot-rodders to feats of derring-don't. The test car was
equipped with an automatic transmission, however, and the
performance equation improves with the standard five-speed manual.
Besides, the manual has a cue-ball shift knob; will that be enough
to tempt Americans back to the pleasures of shifting gears? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The car's handling suffers in the name of excellent ride
quality. On the optional 16-inch Goodyear Eagle radials, the test
car practically glided over the road, absorbing hits that would
send other small cars skittering. But the handling, even with the
``touring'' suspension, seemed a little shifty. In the
back-and-forth of spirited driving I found myself correcting the
steering more than I'd like, to keep the PT in line. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The driver's environment is functional and understated. The
gauges are set in a shiny body-colored panel that mirrors the
passenger's air bag cover. The audio and climate switches are off
the DaimlerChrysler shelf. But why are front-window toggles high on
the dash while the rear-window switches are toe-high in the back? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On balance, complaints are few and compliments abound. This is a
superb automobile at a terrific price ($16,000 before options). The
glossy black test car had luxury features like leather seat trim
and side air bags, power driver's seat, 16-inch polished chrome
wheels, smoked rear glass and heated outside mirrors _ plus the
expected air-conditioning, power windows, remote locking, traction
control and anti-lock disc brakes _ in short, everything you can
reasonably squeeze into a small car. It weighed in at $20,835.
</P>
<P>
   The charmed life of the PT Cruiser is coming to an end. There is
wide discontent across the land over long delivery delays _ a
neighbor ordered hers in May and won't receive it until September _
and dealers who demand thousands of dollars over sticker price.
That will end when the supply moves closer to the demand.
</P>
<P>
   But the essential goodness of the PT is likely to survive all
assaults. Above all, it is efficient. There is no wasted sheet
metal, no four-wheel-drive systems whirring away unnecessarily
underneath. The retro look is a stopper, but the useful design is a
keeper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OTHER VIEWS
</P>
<P>
   Not since the 1998 New Beetle, or possibly the '65 Mustang, has
a car captivated the public like the PT Cruiser. Here are three
other views of the car and the phenomenon:
</P>
<P>
   HOT RIDE AT HIGH SCHOOl  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By AUSTIN LAVIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Will the PT Cruiser, like the Mustang and
Corvette before it, become the car of a generation? If my friends
and I have our say, it will. Lance Kramer, one of my junior-class
mates here at Whitman High School, has made his parents take three
test drives. I persuaded my dad to rent one for a week when our
minivan was in the shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``This car is amazing,'' Lance said. ``I just love the way it
looks.'' The PT Cruiser is different; it stands out. When I drive
it, people stare, and whenever I park they come up and tell me how
cool it is. Porsches and Ferraris are so expensive I can only dream
about them. But with a base price of $16,500, the PT Cruiser is
agonizingly close. It is definitely the best car for that money. If
I could only convince my parents, I'd be so happy.
</P>
<P>
   GANGSTER CHIC, AND MORE
</P>
<P>
   By PETER PASSELL
</P>
<P>
   OJAI, Calif. _ Like many people, I fell in love with the PT
Cruiser's gangster-retro sheet metal. This, after all, is the car
Eliot Ness would want to be seen in, if he were still chasing
bootleggers through the mean streets of Chicago. But the PT Cruiser
is not just another marketing ploy from the folks who brought you
the sensuous (utterly impractical) Prowler and the fierce (utterly
impractical) Viper. It is a new category of people mover that
sacrifices nothing in style while delivering the versatility of a
minivan and the economy of a compact car.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it would be nice if the Cruiser had more pep, took rough
roads with a bit more composure and breezed through curves as
nimbly as, say, the Neon R/T. But where else are you going to find
a quiet, comfortable, roomy, inexpensive car that's so much fun to
drive?
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER BLAST FROM THE PAST
</P>
<P>
   By JAMES G. COBB &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK, N.Y. _ Bad times produce good design. After
Chrysler's near-death experience in the 1980s, its collective brain
turned out the useful minivan, the cab-forward sedan, the
mucho-macho Ram truck. The creative juices of a design team headed
by Tom Gale and John Herlitz jelled into jaw-dropping shapes like
the Atlantic show car, the Viper supercar, the Prowler street rod
and the PT Cruiser (attributed to Bryan Nesbitt, 31).
</P>
<P>
   But fine design cannot exist in a vacuum, and one secret of
Chrysler's success was a management that encouraged risk-taking. In
particular, Robert A. Lutz, who rose to vice chairman, went to bat
for proposals he liked, staving off the committee-think that often
dulls sharp ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed. Lutz retired. Daimler-Benz acquired Chrysler.
Many talented people defected. A new top designer, Freeman Thomas,
hasn't yet made his mark, but one wonders if corporate conservatism
has set in; DaimlerChrysler's other '01 models _ new midsize cars,
redone minivans _ don't set off the same sparks. Will the PT
Cruiser be the last testament to a remarkable confluence of the
right people in the right company at the right time? &QL;

 &HT;    Kramer no more _ but still a kook
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Michael Richards, a guaranteed belly laugh for
almost a decade as wild-haired Kramer on ``Seinfeld,'' returns to
TV this fall as a bumbling, Inspector Clouseau-style detective.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the plan. The project has had some trouble
getting off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Richards now has calmer hair but will never
exactly blend in with a crowd. For one thing, he's tall _ about 6
feet, 5 inches. And he has high-octane fashion taste. He loped into
an interview in an ivy-green suit, purple and white polka-dot shirt
and multicolored striped socks.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot for NBC's ``The Michael Richards Show'' was scrapped,
leading to speculation that the sitcom is doomed. But Richards is
confident his show will be on track well before its October debut,
and he's eager to convince people he's not the captain of a sinking
ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first pilot hinged on my character, and we recognized the
necessity of pulling together an ensemble of supporting
characters,'' he said in a conversation that was more earnest than
anyone expected. ``I have a driving style, so some of the
characters will circle around me, but it's going to be an ensemble
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Too much of a good thing, in other words. Within the past week,
Richards added William Devane and Tim Meadows to the cast. Devane
will play the owner of the detective agency, and Meadows, who has
quit ``Saturday Night Live,'' will play a fellow detective
struggling to overcome a voyeurism fetish.
</P>
<P>
   Richards counts among his comedic heroes Ernie Kovacs and Peter
Sellers, and his new character, Los Angeles sleuth Vic Nardozza,
will reflect those influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he's going to be deeply eccentric,'' Richards said
with a crooked half-smile. ``That's my interest when I'm building
characters. He'll do undercover work, so there'll be disguises.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there will be physical shtick. Kramer's
door-crashing, barely controlled sliding into Seinfeld's apartment
is legendary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most comedy on TV today is talking-head comedy,'' Richards
said. ``I like to do comedy, so there'll be a lot of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Kavet, one of three former ``Seinfeld'' producers working
on Richards' show, is well aware that it will be hard for the actor
to shake Kramer. As far as we can tell, Vic Nardozza hasn't fallen
too far from the Kramer family tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough balancing act,'' Kavet said. ``Everyone's
expecting to see the Kramer character but reluctant to see it
again. We'll exploit Michael's strength, which is quirky physical
comedy, but Vic will be much more human than Kramer.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards says he was never approached to do a Kramer spinoff
when ``Seinfeld'' ended but wouldn't have done one anyway. He
always felt Kramer needed to be in a mix. After ``Seinfeld'' went
off the air, Richards dropped out for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the classics, traveled, did a little interior
decorating,'' he said. ``I really had no incentive to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he does, it will be up to Kramer fans to decide if Vic
will stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``WEST WING''_ Aaron Sorkin, who writes all of the
dialogue-heavy scripts for ``The West Wing,'' is notoriously
troubled by deadlines, which often leaves the cast wondering what
they'll be doing in the next day's scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Fridays, before we have run-throughs on Mondays, we see him
staggering around the set in his pajamas, asking if anybody has any
ideas,'' laughed Brad Whitfordwho plays Josh Lyman on the show.
``He looks like a plasma donor. But then by Monday, it's all done,
and we have this brilliant stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield would not say who, if anyone, is killed in the
cliffhanger assassination attempt on the president. But it has been
reported in Variety that Moira Kelly will not return, so maybe
that's a clue.

 INVESTING WITH: Roland P. Whitcomb, First American Technology
Fund

<TEXT>
<P>
   Plenty of mutual fund managers call themselves growth or value
investors, but Roland P. Whitcomb rejects those labels in favor of
another: technology investor, pure and simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is an independent style of investing,'' said
Whitcomb, 42, the lead manager of the $799.1 million First American
Technology fund. ``You get one-time innovations that sweep through
the economy like automobiles in the '20s, television in the '50s or
personal computers in the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   The movements of these technological waves work against
proponents of the two investing schools, Whitcomb contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you enter a technology cycle, value investors get
confused by the apparent high valuation of the stocks, because they
underestimate the wave of innovation that's coming,'' he said.
``Growth investors often have trouble exiting the technology cycle,
because they take the growth rate that has occurred and extrapolate
it forward in a linear way.'' He added that ``the endgame of a
technology stock is that it becomes a capital goods or a consumer
durables stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitcomb gives each new technology cycle time to run. Investing
too early, he said, is akin to reckless speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Insights like that have helped the fund catch the technology
tide. The fund returned 66.6 percent a year, on average, for the
three years ended July 14, compared with 53.8 percent for its
technology peers, according to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Whitcomb gets started by identifying new technologies in growing
markets, and then works with his six industry analysts to pick the
80 to 110 stocks in the fun. The key issue, he said, is valuation.
</P>
<P>
   One way that Whitcomb avoids overpaying for a stock is by
gauging the maturity of a technology company's market; a company in
a growing market, of course, is likely to warrant a higher
valuation than one in a mature market. He estimates a market's
potential size, looking at the volume of products or services sold
and forecasting the percentage of current customers who will need
to upgrade their products or services. In particular, he looks for
the ``inflection point'' _ where a market becomes more than 50
percent saturated and is due for slower growth.
</P>
<P>
   To value profitable companies that make actual products, he uses
a conventional dividend discount model, projecting the company's
future earnings and then discounting them back by using long-term
bond rates. He then adjusts that discount to reflect a company's
risk level.
</P>
<P>
   For unprofitable companies that nonetheless generate product
revenue, he forecasts when they will turn profitable and then
discounts the profit figure, taking into account net operating
margins and any interim capital deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most difficult to value are companies with recurring revenues,
typically service companies. Here, he forecasts the revenue
generated per customer, adjusting the figure for marketing and
other start-up expenses, capital costs and ``churn'' created by
customer turnover, and then discounts that figure back, too.
</P>
<P>
   Whitcomb sells shares if a company's market turns out to be
smaller than he had anticipated or if a company's fundamentals
deteriorate. He also trims shares as a company approaches full
valuation. The fund's annual turnover rate of 184 percent is high,
he said, because the market has been volatile.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks that technology shares in general are pricey these
days, after their rebound of the past two months, though he is
still is optimistic about their long-term prospects. ``Everything
is pretty expensive right now because we had a nice bounce,'' he
said. ``But we're on the verge of a new personal computer cycle
with Windows 2000, along with accelerating growth in
telecommunications, capacity constraints among semiconductor and
other component vendors and strong demand in the Asian markets.''
</P>
<P>
   One favorite profitable ``product'' company is Compaq Computer.
``It's a valuation play, because people have been ignoring the
sector lately,'' he said. ``But we expect companies to buy a lot of
Windows 2000-based servers.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's recent management changes and its cheap stock price, he
said, make it a bargain. He expects revenue to grow 11 percent a
year, on average, over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   He bought shares this month at $25; they now trade at $28.0625,
or 18.7 times consensus earnings estimate of $1.49 a share for
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Broadvision, which makes software to help
e-tailers track Internet customers. The stock hit a high of $90.67
on March 6 and now trades at $41.25, or 375 times Wall Street's
earnings estimate of 11 cents a share for this year. The fund
bought shares this month at $37.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think putting mainstream companies on the Web is a really
big market.'' he said. ``Broadvision is the biggest company in the
group and may lose some market share, but the stock price is down a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitcomb also likes America Online, which the fund bought this
month at $57, even as investors have begun to fret about the
prospects for online advertising. ``No one's sure what will happen
short term, and they're worried that ad revenues on the Internet
will slow down,'' he said. ``They might, but winners like AOL will
take enough market share that it won't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger deal with Time Warner will make AOL more powerful,
but there are risks in integrating two big companies, Whitcomb
said.
</P>
<P>
   AOL now trades at $57.625, just over 100 times analysts'
pre-merger earnings forecast of 56 cents a share for the year
ending in June 2001.

REFERENDUM MAY BRING MORE POLITICAL TUMULT TO IVORY COAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ This onetime redoubt of political
stability and steady growth in West Africa has been through a lot
in the last year: the fall of an unpopular president, the first
coup in its history and military misrule that twice in the last
month raised the possibility of another army uprising.
</P>
<P>
   During all this tumult the spotlight has stayed on one man, a
former prime minister and mild-mannered international banker,
Alassane Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ouattara returned here a year ago from Washington, where
he served as the International Monetary Fund's deputy managing
director, his political fortunes have been on a roller coaster. He
is down again _ and, along with him, maybe the chances of Ivory
Coast's smooth transition back to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Ivoirians are to vote on a constitutional referendum
whose key parts were intended specifically to exclude Ouattara from
running in the presidential election scheduled for September.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with a bitterness and a weariness that people say are
new to him, Ouattara, 58, vowed in an interview last week to win in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this group of mediocre people,'' Ouattara said of his
main political opponents and the military government. ``They know
that they could not stand competition. They have their toys they
want to keep to themselves. They know that if we open up, they are
so mediocre they would lose everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The country's military ruler, Gen. Robert Guei, declared a
four-day state of emergency Friday , which members of his junta
said was intended to ensure that the referendum take place
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the former president, Henri Konan Bedie, who was
ousted in the coup, had tried to eliminate Ouattara as a rival by
arguing he was less of an Ivoirian than others because his father
was from neighboring Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie's strategy was part of an overall concept of Ivoirite,
which he argued were values shared by pure Ivoirians, but which was
essentially tribalism that sought to draw a line between Christian
southerners and Muslim northerners like Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   The cleavage was strange in a country that had long been known
for its ethnic tolerance. But even though Ouattara always
maintained that both of his parents were Ivoirian and he himself
was as Ivoirian as anyone else, ethnic divisions have widened in
the Ivory Coast in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   For a few months after the fall of Bedie, Guei, preached ethnic
reconciliation, and the two men appeared to be on friendly terms.
</P>
<P>
   But as Guei's intentions to hold on to power have become
clearer, the two men have stopped cooperating. The general, a
member of a minority ethnic group from the southwest, has adopted
the same ethnic strategy against Ouattara. A commission set up to
prepare the referendum recommended that a presidential candidate
must be Ivoirian-born of a father or mother born in the Ivory
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, just six days before the referendum, Guei
issued a decree saying that a presidential candidate must be
Ivoirian-born of a father and mother born in the Ivory Coast. In a
news conference, the general claimed that 15 of the country's 18
administrative regions had pressed him to change the ``or'' to
``and.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have expressed their wish,'' said the general, who
came to power after young soldiers mutinied throughout the Ivory
Coast in late December. ``We are here to respond to their wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the change was widely interpreted as another effort to
dislodge Ouattara. Another clause _ that a candidate should never
have availed himself of another nationality _ also seemed targeted
at Ouattara, who represented Burkina Faso for a regional financial
institution earlier in his career, a relatively common practice at
the time.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the December coup, Ouattara described it as a
``popular revolution.'' He said he had hoped that the new military
ruler would not try to cling to power, the way others have
typically done in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general was in retirement,'' Ouattara said. ``So we
thought he was really coming to help the process of restoring
democracy as he said he would. But obviously once in power he
wanted to confiscate and grab power. And this is quite a
disappointment for all of us who consider ourselves democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that none of these clauses affected his eligibility,
Ouattara has told his followers to endorse the referendum, as have
the country's two other major parties. So while the outcome may not
be in doubt, it will yield hints as to how September's election
might unfold.
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional court that will rule on the eligibility of
presidential candidates recently got a new head: one of Guei's
legal advisers. If Ouattara is prevented legally from running, it
is likely that the battle will spill onto the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'll get popular support,'' Ouattara said. ``But I
hope it will not get to that point. I hope that the international
community, the regional partners and domestic pressure will put
sense into the head of the general.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, in a news conference a day after meeting
Guei, the U.S. ambassador, George Mu, said Washington was worried
about Ivory Coast's stability. The ambassador restated the State
Department's position that Guei, having seized power by force,
should not stand as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mu's comments came after two days of rioting by soldiers in
downtown Abidjan. Displeased that they had not received money they
claimed had been promised them, the soldiers shut down businesses
and the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Guei took refuge in the police headquarters and was able to
defuse the situation only after agreeing to give soldiers about
$1,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   Guei accused Ouattara's party of fomenting the riots, a charge
he denied. The U.S. ambassador said they appeared to be strictly
over money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mutiny reduced the popularity of the general, who now
looks weakened,'' said a Western diplomat here.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was a reminder that even the general has never had
full control over the country's 14,000-member military since the
December coup. A military emboldened even further and ensuing
instability would make it harder to reverse the Ivory Coast's slide
and would turn it into a source of problems for the region, many
Ivoirians and foreigners here believe.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Second to Nigeria, the Ivory Coast is the economic leader in
West Africa. It stands as the world's largest cocoa-producer and at
the top of French-speaking Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But Abidjan, an African bright spot famous for its smooth roads
and solid infrastructure, is beginning to show the signs of being
led by a government that has little money left. Gaping potholes and
collapsed highway ramps have been left unrepaired for months.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he will run and win in September, Ouattara promised an
IMF-style cleanup of the Ivory Coast's economy that would include a
sweeping anti-corruption campaign and an overhaul of an inefficient
bureaucracy.

   Having left the IMF only a year ago, Ouattara said he was
pessimistic about Africa. He has seen too many African countries
ground down by men whose only concern was to capture or keep power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, if you have a system where the people can vote you
out, the situation will be different,'' Ouattara said. ``But many
people that get in are rigging elections or doing it by coup
d'etat, because they are mediocre. They know they cannot stand
competition. They confiscate power and continue to rule the
country.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sunday, July 23, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-JERUSALEM-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Jerusalem is at the heart
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an issue so complex that peace
negotiators simply put it off until now. Common sense seems to
dictate that the easiest basis for a settlement would be to share
the heritage and guarantee all groups access to the holy sites. But
for decades, achieving that kind of formula has only become harder,
as new layers of grievance, resentment and reason for distrust have
been added on both sides, only reinforcing in many Israeli and
Palestinian minds that their one best guarantee of access to the
shrines is sole political control or all or part of the city. By
John Kifner. (Moving in `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   ECON-EDUCATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ For all the curative powers of
a booming economy, the overflowing prosperity of the last four
years has failed to change the second-class incomes of the
one-third of Americans over age 24 who have not gone beyond high
school. Through good times and bad, that proportion has barely
fluctuated for more than 30 years, despite all the recent
encouragement to go on to college. In the computerized modern
economy, business and government count on college to raise a
person's income and close the gap between the haves _ the college
graduates _ and the have nots. But nearly 60 million adults have
failed to make the leap into higher education. By Louis Uchitelle.
(Moving in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   DESIGN-ANTICRIME-REVIEW (Detroit) _ Some holsters for a cellular
phone look just like those for pistols. New houses often have their
porches not in the front yard but in the back, shielded and hidden.
Sport utility vehicles are often designed to intimidate would-be
criminals as well as other motorists. America seems to be winning
the war against crime, but don't tell that to product designers.
Companies are tapping into customers' deepest fears of crime with
products subtly or ostentatiously designed to protect and reassure
the owner and, sometimes, intimidate potential attackers. By Keith
Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   EMAIL-SURVEILLANCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ New computer technology
enables law-enforcement authorities to troll through millions of
e-mails, honing in on the correspondences of suspects. But unlike
traditional telephone wiretaps, the technology also can capture
communications of others not suspected of a crime, raising concerns
that it could be employed to monitor people and groups far beyond
the suspected mobsters and drug kingpins who have been the
traditional targets of telephone wiretaps. By Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   BIRTHCONTROL-INCENTIVES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the use of
cash incentives for preventing unwanted pregnancies and population
control in general. One organization that pays drug-addicted women
to be sterilized uses the slogan `Don't Let A Pregnancy Interfere
With Your Drug Habit.' By Jeff Stryker.
</P>
<P>
   EXECUTION-TOY-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Death Row Marv'' is a novelty
toy in which a figure sitting in a simulated electric chair can be
``fried.''
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE-RATINGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the relative
commercial successes of films rated PG-13 and those rated R. By
Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   SUMO-SINGER-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The former sumo wrestler
Konishiki has crossed over into the recording arts. His debut
rap/reggae/R&AMP;B CD, `Konishiki KMS' _ short for `Konishiki Master
Sumo' _ has just been released. Some lyrics are excerpted.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   URBAN-POVERTY-REVIEW (Manila, Philippines) _ Hundreds died here
two weeks ago when a mountain, loosened by monsoon rains, collapsed
on their shantytown. They lived amid the filth and flies and
degradation because, by their standards, the living was good. They
were part of the changing face of poverty _ a vast population shift
occurring throughout much of the world from the joblessness and
hunger of the countryside to the comparative wealth of the cities.
By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-GIRLS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The most relentless struggle over
the social restrictions of the Islamic Revolution has concerned
what women wear. Last week it was announced that prepubescent
schoolgirls would be allowed to wear colors to school. One concern
has been that porosis has increased among women, even young women,
because sunlight, which helps the body form Vitamin D, does not
penetrate their dark clothing. And dermatologists have complained
that the rubbing of the chador head covering against the skin
contributes to acne and rashes. By Elaine Sciolino.

   ECON-EDUCATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ For all the curative powers of
a booming economy, the overflowing prosperity of the last four
years has failed to change the second-class incomes of the
one-third of Americans over age 24 who have not gone beyond high
school. Through good times and bad, that proportion has barely
fluctuated for more than 30 years, despite all the recent
encouragement to go on to college. In the computerized modern
economy, business and government count on college to raise a
person's income and close the gap between the haves _ the college
graduates _ and the have nots. But nearly 60 million adults have
failed to make the leap into higher education. By Louis Uchitelle.

   ``If you don't like the way I am, just keep on steppin'.'' Those
are fighting words, she knows, and Donna Marie Williams, 41, levels
them equally at men who grouse about her weight (she's a plus-size
and proud) and those who try to rush her into bed.
</P>
<P>
   Celibate by choice for the last half-dozen years, Williams
hopped off the sex-and-relationship hamster wheel after her second
child born outside  &UR; of  &LR; marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I came to my senses,'' said Williams, a single
mother and author of self-help books, recalling how she put the
brakes on sex to regain a sense of independence and self-reliance.
``Before, I kind of depended on men to sustain me. Now I can do
that for myself.'' The greatest benefit of living single and
sex-free, she added, is ``knowing who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sexual teetotaler, identified in a Web chat room only as
204.240.2.73, took to celibacy after a series of bad love affairs,
the last of which left her picking dourly at her wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took stock then and realized that at 36 years old, I had
nothing to show for my life,'' she wrote. ``I saw other couples and
wondered what was wrong with me.'' Her discovery, after 10 months
of sexual abstinence, she said, is ``a self-esteem that I have
never experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   In a culture saturated with sexual messages, where consenting
adults seem to hop into bed at the bat of a feathery eyelash, a
small minority are willfully dropping out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Calling themselves ``born-again virgins,'' they embrace
abstinence not so much on moral or religious grounds, but to
cleanse themselves and reassert self-control.
</P>
<P>
   As old as ``Lysistrata,'' the notion of celibacy has taken on
new and particular urgency for these converts, many of whom, though
not all, have been singed by affairs gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a recent outpouring of books, manuals and screeds
advocating celibacy, including Williams' ``Sensual Celibacy''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1999), in which she argues that saying no to sex
recharges the spirit. She urges women to pamper themselves with
luxuries they might once have lavished on men: soft pillows,
scented candles, decadent underwear.
</P>
<P>
   The most scholarly offeing is ``A History of Celibacy''
(Scribner, 2000) by Elizabeth Abbott, the dean of women at Trinity
College at the University of Toronto. ``Thanks in part to AIDS,''
she writes, ``and much more to a stultifying surfeit of mindless
sex, celibacy has emerged from clandestineness and has crossed back
into the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   That would tickle Bridget Jones, Helen Fielding's best-selling
heroine, who is back in a sequel, ``Bridget Jones: The Edge of
Reason'' (Viking). In it she flirts briefly with abstinence after a
breakup. ``Celibacy!'' she exclaims, relieved to be able to put a
name to her condition. ``I mean, if it's happening to me, chances
are it's happening to lots of other people as well. Isn't that the
whole point about zeitgeist?''
</P>
<P>
   Miramax has commissioned an original screenplay from Wendy
Keller, author of ``The Cult of the Born-Again Virgin'' (Health
Communications, 2000), and Iris Martin, a psychotherapist, who is
one of many celibate women interviewed in the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a groundswell of women ready to curb their hormones
until and unless someone worthy comes along,'' Keller writes. She
and others predict that celibacy could become a ``movement'' with
millions of adherents, as unlikely as that sounds at a time when
sexually freewheeling women reign in television shows like ``Sex
and the City.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller, 36, a divorced mother in Malibu, Calif., is perhaps the
most vociferous cheerleader of the new celibacy. She was inspired,
she said, by the women she interviewed, as well as by ``A Return to
Modesty,'' Wendy Shalit's 1999 polemic against feminism, which
argues that the sexual freedoms of the 1960s and  &UR; ' &LR; 70s ultimately
betrayed women.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   No figures are available for how many born-again virgins there
are. The newly chaste (who include a tiny number of men) range from
purists, who refrain from all sexual activity, to those who tailor
their celibacy to suit their tastes, permitting a degree of kissing
and fondling but drawing the line at penetration.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 survey by the University of Chicago for the National
Science Foundation found that 17.4 percent of adults over 18 had
had no sex partner within 12 months. Many were elderly or had not
yet married. It is unclear how many in the most sexually active
years were celibate by choice.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Spencer, a senior editor at Glamour magazine, whose latest
cover promises ``65 Intimacy Secrets Men Need You to Know by
Tonight,'' scoffs at the notion of celibacy. ``It's not the sex
that's bad, but the emotional baggage these women have
accumulated,'' she said. ``The idea of cutting off sex is denial.
It's like taking cold medicine when you have the West Nile virus.
It stops the runny nose, but it doesn't change the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller acknowledged that many of the newly celibate have been
wounded in love. ``I think a lot of women come to celibacy from a
position of anger _ maybe 50 percent of the women I talk to,'' she
said. `` `You're damn right, men are pigs' _ they come to me from
that perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book she advises them to stop blaming men and take
responsibility for their own behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, the college dean and celibacy scholar, is twice divorced
and the mother of a grown son. She had not embraced celibacy
personally when she began her research, but eventually her view
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It occurred to me that at this stage of my life I had been
celibate by happenstance,'' she said. ``I felt very tentative about
my life. I saw it as incomplete, and yet I had no control over
that. Maybe I would meet someone and maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I realized I've had children, I've been married and I've
had lots and lots of sex. I decided being celibate would focus me.
I would feel more in control of my life. I would try to become a
more complete person. Once you know that you're celibate, you
relate differently to people, you have more intensity in your
relationships with men. They are deeper and more intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the new celibacy takes place in the context of a
sexual revolution which went too far,'' she added. ``At its extreme
it put pressure on young people to have sex because it's cool.
Celibacy as an option for young people should always be out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison Saget, 40, an Internet executive from San Francisco,
decided to take a timeout from sex three years ago, after a
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   It helped her remain clear-eyed enough to sift potential lovers
in her life from the losers and cads, she said. Currently in a
relationship that has come to include sex, she found her
self-imposed dry spell rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer I abstained from sex the more confident I got,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Giannini, Saget's partner, found her self-assurance so
attractive that he agreed to put his own libido on hold. ``Allison
was intriguing,'' he recalled. ``Here was an outgoing, adventurous,
very contemporary woman with values that sort of buck the trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Carroll, 40, is that rarity, a man who is celibate by
choice (and not a member of a religious order). A features writer
for The Arizona Republic newspaper in Phoenix, Carroll, the
divorced father of an 11-year-old son, recounted his experiences in
a column last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to control my sexuality myself, instead of turning it
over to pop culture,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He also came to share the wisdom of his sex-free female
counterparts. ``Just because you're close physically,'' he told his
readers, ``doesn't mean you're in the same area code emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Expecting to be labeled a hapless geek, Carroll was astonished
to receive 3,000 letters and phone calls within days of writing his
piece, most cheering him on, many from men. Today he is engaged to
marry, but said he and his fiancee do not intend to have sex before
the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll views celibacy as part of a journey to self-acceptance.
``At midlife,'' he wrote, ``I'm through apologizing for who I am.''

 &HT;    Coke seeks lawsuit dismissal
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANAT _ Coca-Cola Friday denied the allegations in a $1.5
billion employment discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In its formal response, the company advanced 22 defenses,
including that its workplace practices have been based on
``legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   It asked that the suit be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in June on behalf of four black women by
attorneys Willie Gary and Johnnie Cochran, alleges that the company
created a hostile and discriminatory work environment.
</P>
<P>
   The former employees also make several other claims, including
that the company engaged in intentional infliction of emotional
harm and negligent hiring and supervision.
</P>
<P>
   This suit is a separate action from the federal class-action
lawsuit filed against Coke more than a year ago on behalf of 2,000
African-American current and former employees.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement in principle has been reached to settle the
class-action suit, which is being handled by a different group of
plaintiffs' attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   While the second suit was filed in state court, Coca-Cola
recently moved it to federal court, where it filed its response
Friday.

PENTAGON RELEASES ANTI-HARASSMENT PLAN TO HELP PROTECT GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Announcing a new ``anti-harassment action plan,''
the Pentagon said Friday that military commanders will be held
responsible for failing to act against subordinates who intimidate
homosexuals or who ignore anti-gay behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military must function with honor and discipline at all
times, and that includes treatment of homosexuals,'' said Carol
DiBattiste, undersecretary of the Air Force and head of a panel of
civilian and military leaders that created the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was developed after a survey in March by the Defense
Department's inspector general found harassment of homosexuals was
commonplace in the military, especially among enlisted troops.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon leaders hope the plan will help solve the difficult
problem of enforcing the department's policy that allows gays and
lesbians to serve as long as they don't reveal their sexual
orientation. The policy, adopted in 1993, is called ``don't ask,
don't tell, don't pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the measures the panel recommended to reduce the
harassment:
</P>
<P>
   _ Issuing a department-wide directive making it clear that
mistreatment and harassment of gays and inappropriate comments or
gestures toward them are not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Holding commanders and officers accountable for any failure to
enforce the directive.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reviewing all anti-harassment training programs to ensure that
they convey the department's attitude condemning harassment of
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making sure training programs let troops in each rank know
what their responsibility is in making the policy work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encouraging reports of harassment by telling members of the
military the various ways they can inform their superiors.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Benecke, an executive director of the Servicemembers
Legal Defense Fund, a group that advocates gay rights in the
military, called the panel's report ``thoughtful and considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Benecke, a frequent critic of the Pentagon's policy toward gays,
said, ``Today's recommendations, if implemented, would be a very
good start.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBattiste presented the panel's recommendations at a joint news
conference with Gen. Eric Shinseki, Army chief of staff, who also
released an Army inspector general's report on the circumstances
surrounding the murder July 5, 1999, of a gay private at Fort
Campbell, Ky., by another soldier.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report absolved the base's officers of
responsibility, saying there was no ``climate'' of homophobia on
base. Instead, the report blamed a sergeant first class for failing
to stop a four-month campaign of anti-gay harassment against Pfc.
Barry Winchell, 21, who was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat
as he slept in his barracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Army report said that while some members of Winchell's Delta
Company held anti-gay attitudes, a pervasive homophobic atmosphere
did not exist on the base, home to the elite 101st Airborne
Division. It blamed Sgt. 1st Class Roger Seacrest, Delta's top
sergeant, for failing to stop the harassers.
</P>
<P>
   Two soldiers were court-martialed for the attack. Pvt. Calvin
Glover was sentenced to life in prison and Spec. Justin Fisher
received 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   The report exonerated Seacrest's superior, Capt. Daniel Rouse,
and all higher officers including the post commander, Maj. Gen.
Robert Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., questioned a number of the
inspector general's conclusions. ``Giving Fort Campbell a
relatively clean bill of health doesn't square with recent reports
of prevalent anti-gay harassment throughout the services,'' Meehan
said..
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, Shinseki said that harassment
threatened the ``stability'' of the military. ``Harassment of any
kind violates individual dignity and tears at the fabric ... and
the cohesion of our Army,'' he said. ``It will not be tolerated for
any reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Outrage over the Winchell killing renewed a national debate over
the Clinton administration's policy on homosexuals, which gay
rights advocates say does not work because it has failed to protect
perceived homosexuals from harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department inspector general's survey found a
widespread belief among troops that the policy is not working. Vice
President Al Gore has said he would eliminate it if he were elected
president, but which Texas Gov. George W. Bush has supported it.
President Clinton said last year that the policy is ``out of
whack.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday Undersecretary of Defense Bernard Rostker took
issue with Clinton. ``I don't agree with that characterization. I
think the policy is working reasonably well to provide a degree of
safety'' for gays in uniform, Rostker said. ``The days of witch
hunts, the days of stakeouts, are really gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rostker said more needs to be done to ensure that everyone
in the military understands the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Last August the Pentagon announced a new requirement that
commanders must seek approval from senior civilians at the Pentagon
before opening investigations of troops suspected of being gay.

`WANDERLUST': JOURNEYS WHERE THE MEANS IS THE END 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are as many walks as there are walkers. One explorer
trekked 1,700 miles across the Australian outback accompanied by
three camels. A woman known as Peace Pilgrim set out in 1953 on a
pilgrimage for world peace, beginning at the Rose Bowl Parade in
Pasadena, Calif., and logging perhaps 80,000 miles before, in 1981,
she was killed in a car whose driver had offered her a lift.
</P>
<P>
   In another era, Charles Dickens desperately paced London's
streets; ``If I couldn't walk fast and far,'' he said, ``I should
explode and perish.'' Walkers abound. There are climbers seeking
glory, urbanites seeking respite, believers seeking salvation,
protesters seeking change, flaneurs seeking amusements, joggers
seeking slimness.
</P>
<P>
   So what can possibly be made of all this strolling, hiking and
pacing? Writing about walking, it turns out, is almost as plentiful
as writing about writing, yet much of it, as Rebecca Solnit points
out in ``Wanderlust: A History of Walking,'' is ``episodic,'' with
``no overarching plot.''
</P>
<P>
   Solnit, who is herself an avid walker and elegant essayist,
calls one such book ``a sort of trail mix made up of bite-size
epiphanies, moral lessons, blisters, social encounters and
recounted practical details.''
</P>
<P>
   This subtle and suggestive study, though, is something else.
``Wanderlust'' is, as Solnit admits, an ``amateur history,'' but
amateur in the best sense. The trail mix is always ready at hand,
providing unexpected nuggets (Hobbes, we are told, had a walking
stick with a built-in inkwell) and piquant sensations (the desert,
Solnit writes, is ``a place where loneliness has a luxurious
flavor, like the blues'').
</P>
<P>
   Its real pleasures, however, resemble the pleasures of walking.
It doesn't systematically press on toward a goal, but savors detail
and varied perspectives, stopping to consider the nature of
mountaineering, the life of the London streetwalker, the conflict
between public right of way and private property in 19th-century
England and 20th-century Las Vegas. Solnit joyfully trespasses
across disciplines and genres, tracing a path through philosophy,
paleontology, politics, religion and literary criticism.
</P>
<P>
   But a path, as Solnit points out, ``is a prior interpretation of
the best way to traverse a landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To follow a route,'' she says, ``is to accept an
interpretation.'' And while Solnit's path may seem rambling, it
does indeed have a shape. ``Walking is usually about something
else,'' Solnit proposes, and the something else is usually an
attempt to explore ``the unpredictable and the incalculable.''
Walking dwells in a strange in-between state: half-public,
half-private; half-here, half-there; half-active, half-passive.
</P>
<P>
   For Solnit, though, walking is endangered, ``under assault'' by
the forces of the modern era: the phony colonnades of Las Vegas,
the growth of suburbia, the sterility of the treadmill. Modernity
is eclipsing nature.
</P>
<P>
   This is a familiar romance _ perhaps too familiar _ one that has
been part of the Western heritage since romanticism and is linked
to the countercultural sensibility that Solnit celebrates. But it
is also unavoidable; walking does indeed seem to have its rise and
fall. As Solnit points out, it has long been associated with the
philosophic mind: Aristotle paced while lecturing; Kierkegaard
rambled around Copenhagen while thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent paleontological theories cited by Solnit argue that
the development of walking is associated with the development of
intelligence. But it was only with romanticism that walking really
came into its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only meditate when I am walking,'' Rousseau proclaimed.
``My mind only works with my legs.'' The vision of the solitary
walker that Rousseau pioneered came to define a culture. William
Wordsworth _ ``one of the first to employ his legs as an instrument
of philosophy,'' Christopher Morley wrote _ composed poems aloud as
he hiked through England's Lake District. Solnit suggests that
Coleridge stopped writing blank verse when he ceased taking walks.
</P>
<P>
   Solnit has less sympathy for 19th-century prescriptions for
health and happiness that developed around the culture of walking
and is more skeptical still about how walking's philosophic ramble
is harnessed to power and status in the cult of mountaineering.
</P>
<P>
   But she is fascinated with how urban life caused the walk to
mutate into soliciting, cruising, shopping, rioting, skulking,
loitering. Each city defines its walkers. With her casual San
Fransciscan ways, Solnit explains, she feels like an alien whenever
she is in New York, disrupting the fast pedestrian flow, ``as
though I were a butterfly strayed into the beehive, a snag in the
stream.''
</P>
<P>
   As a guide, though, Solnit knows the path well; she is tireless
and sure-footed. The only time she seems to stumble is when she
enthusiastically recalls the ``populist communion'' of the street
protests against the 1991 Gulf war; she suggests that because of
government censorship ``most Americans weren't much better off''
than Israelis in Tel Aviv who had to seal themselves in rooms,
wearing gas masks. Surely a veteran walker would have a larger
perspective on where particular paths come from and where they
might lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Solnit's greatest worry about contemporary life is what is
happening to the art of walking itself. The treadmill is the
emblematic villain. One writer noted, ``It is its monotonous
steadiness and not its severity which constitutes its terror and
frequently breaks down the obstinate spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was a writer in 1823, who was talking about the
treadmill's use in English prisons. Now, Solnit proposes, the
treadmill's severity makes it ``a corollary to the suburb'': ``a
device with which to go nowhere in places where there is nowhere to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the walk uneasily comes to an end. Are perceptions of
time and space distorted now that the body is not the instrument of
motion but its recipient? Are the unpredictable and incalculable
doomed to be displaced by false certainties and familiar comforts?
Perhaps, but a mental stroll still has its compensations, and
Solnit makes thinking seem a lot like walking.

   Beware! A hungry, flesh-eating robot called Chew could have
designs on you. Not that you won't hear the beast coming: Chew is a
12-wheeled monster that looks more like a train. But he's also the
first robot to be completely powered by food. He's called a
gastrobot _ and he is set to make his public debut in August, at a
robotics conference in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Chew Chew's stomach is a microbial fuel cell (MFC), a device
that enslaves a population of bacteria, in this case E. coli, to
break down food and convert chemical energy into electricity. The
ideal fuel, in terms of energy gain, is meat, says inventor Stuart
Wilkinson of the University of South Florida in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vegetation is not nearly as nutritious,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   But eating meat requires you to catch it first and that, in
turn, requires a lot of extra energy and complex behaviors, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Early applications for gastrobots are likely to include mowing
lawns _ and grazing on grass clippings for fuel. The long-term idea
is to develop autonomous robots that can feed themselves, Wilkinson
says.
</P>
<P>
   The robot consists of three wheeled wagons, each about a meter
long. For convenience, says Wilkinson, Chew only eats sugar cubes
at the moment because these are almost entirely broken down by the
microbes, producing virtually no waste.
</P>
<P>
   The microbes produce enzymes that break down carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you break a large molecule like glucose into
smaller molecules you release electrons,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   These electrons are harnessed to charge a battery by a reduction
and oxidation (redox) reaction. Wilkinson says this is analogous to
blood supply and respiration in a mammal _ but delivering electrons
instead of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chew doesn't produce much in the way of waste-just
carbon dioxide and water _ it would produce more if it ate
vegetation or meat, Wilkinson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment,'' says Wilkinson, ``we have to feed it like a
baby because it doesn't have any arms or legs.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as robots go, Chew is a bit of an underachiever. The
MFC does not produce enough power to move it, so instead the
electricity is used to charge its batteries. Only when the
batteries are fully charged does the robot have enough power to
move forward. When the batteries are drained, the cycle repeats
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turning food into electricity isn't unique,'' he says. ``What
I've done is make it small enough to fit into a robot.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson says the gastrobot also differs from other projects,
such as the slug-eating robot being developed at the University of
the West of England in Bristol, because it does its digestion
on-board. This makes a lot more sense in terms of energy efficiency
than shuttling back and forth between your quarry and the MFC.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Melhuish of the slugbot team says that the potential is
there to use this sort of technology for vehicles, but it's a long
way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The energy demands would be huge to run a train or even a
small car,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it would be more practical to build an underwater robot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a robot fish could be built then it would make more sense
to build a robot which ate fish and monitored beaches for sharks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wilkinson doesn't think it's good to give gastrobots a taste
for meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise they'll notice there's an awful lot of humans
running around and try to eat them,'' he warns. &QL;

MARKET WATCH: AGAIN FEELING BULLISH, BUT NO LONGER BULLETPROOF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miami)   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Too much, too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had reason to smile last week. As expected, neither
rising energy costs nor high short-term interest rates stopped a
stream of strong second-quarter earnings news. And the Federal
Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, added to the cheer on Thursday,
when traders interpreted his comments as a signal that the economy
was slowing and that the Fed might be done raising rates, at least
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   That news sent the Nasdaq composite up more than 3 percent,
putting it back into positive territory for the year, and the Dow
industrials and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 also rallied. So for at least
one weekend, Wall Street's biggest concern is likely to be nothing
more than the weather in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the picture is pretty, said Abby Joseph Cohen, chief
market strategist at Goldman Sachs. With the economy slowing a bit
but earnings still strong, she thinks the S&AMP;P 500 could hit 1,575
by the end of the year, a 5 percent gain. ``Second-quarter numbers
have been quite good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Agreed. But that is not the whole story. After all, the
fundamentals were just as good three months ago, when the Nasdaq
plunged into a sickening tailspin that pushed it from 5,000 to
3,300 in a matter of weeks, leaving many investors bruised and some
broke.
</P>
<P>
   But during 1999 and early this year, the market, especially the
Nasdaq, increasingly became a kind of casino, a speculative frenzy
in which the performance of many stocks seemed almost entirely
divorced from the reality of the companies behind them. That
cognitive dissonance was most obvious in the market for initial
public offerings, as technology companies with no earnings and in
many cases no revenue found investors desperate to buy their
shares, which then rocketed higher on their first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   So when the plunge came, nearly every professional money manager
agreed that it was a necessary corrective. Necessary to remind
investors that most stocks do not double or triple in a year.
Necessary to prove that, as every investment textbook explains,
high returns do not come without high risks. Necessary, most of
all, because the capital markets are supposed to be a place where
deserving companies get the money they need to grow, not a casino.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now the froth is beginning to rise again on Nasdaq stocks,
which are up almost 30 percent from their lows of late May.
Double-digit dollar swings are again becoming common. On Thursday,
JDS Uniphase, the fast-growing fiber optics maker, soared $21, an
increase of 20 percent, on the not particularly surprising news
that the company would be added to the S&AMP;P 500 index. On Friday,
JDS gained an additional $6.875.
</P>
<P>
   The new-issue market, which slowed sharply in May and June, is
heating up, too. New companies are coming to market again, and 100
percent gains on the first day are again not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   All this worries even some longtime bulls. ``As painful as the
bear market was, it was absolutely necessary,'' said Bill Keithler,
who manages the $9.3 billion Invesco Technology fund. ``We needed
to shake out that kind of goofy speculation, and maybe it's not
done.'' Like other pros, Keithler is not anxious for a return to
the frenzy of last winter. ``I would like a more measured advance
as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not surprising. It took a drop of 30 percent to convince
speculators accustomed to a decade-long bull market that they are
not bulletproof. If the Nasdaq reaches new highs and they are able
to regain their losses in only a few months, they will have little
incentive to think of the markets as anything but a casino.
</P>
<P>
   And then the next crash will really hurt.

CIVIL AUCTION SUITS FACE POSSIBLE CURB 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prosecutors investigating allegations of collusion
and price fixing by the world's largest auction houses, Sotheby's
and Christie's, have gone to U.S. District Court in Manhattan to
prevent lawyers for hundreds of angry buyers and sellers from
formally interviewing people who may figure in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Judge Lewis A. Kaplan dated July 17, federal
prosecutors asked permission to file a motion to forbid lawyers in
the civil case against the two auction houses to take depositions
from Christopher M. Davidge, Christie's former chief executive, who
resigned last Dec. 24. Further, they will move to stop the lawyers
from deposing anyone else who may be connected to their
investigation until a criminal grand jury finishes its work.
</P>
<P>
   If the motion is approved, the prospect for a quick settlement
in the multimillion-dollar civil cases will greatly diminish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a stay is necessary to prevent prejudice to the ongoing
investigation and any subsequent prosecution,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither John L. Greene, the government's chief antitrust
prosecutor, nor Kaplan returned repeated phone calls seeking
comment about the letter.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the day after the letter was sent, documents that
Christie's turned over to the government in December in exchange
for government leniency were delivered to Boise, Schiller &AMP;
Flexner, the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs in the class-action
lawsuit, and lawyers for A. Alfred Taubman, Sotheby's former
chairman, and for Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's former chief
executive. Kaplan had ordered the government to hand over the
documents. Both Taubman and Brooks resigned on Feb. 21 as the
investigation heated up. The documents, which are said to number
153 pages, were given to top Christie's officials by Davidge before
his departure. They are said to support allegations of collusion
and price-fixing by the two auction giants.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were given to the lawyers on condition that they
remain confidential, and none of the lawyers would comment on them.
They are said to include memos from Davidge to Anthony Tennant,
Christie's former chairman, regarding secret meetings he had with
Brooks to discuss setting commissions. The documents are also said
to include notes from Tennant to Davidge about meetings he had with
Taubman and records of discussions about new forms of financing
offered to sellers by the two companies starting in about 1993.

BILL T. JONES: UNIONS OF THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS AND WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill T. Jones frequently talked as he danced in ``The
Breathing Show,'' his impressive solo on Thursday night at La
Guardia High School. But even when his voice fell silent, he still
spoke through the eloquence of his moving body.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized unions of thoughts and actions and words and deeds
throughout the 90-minute piece, which was staged in its New York
premiere under the auspices of his Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance
Company as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000. The solo,
commissioned by the Hancher Auditorium of the University of Iowa
and the National Endowment for the Arts, was presented in February
at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Jones made no attempt to disguise his audible breathing in ``The
Breathing Show,'' which became a hymn to life. Much of the time he
moved to recordings by composers as various as Schubert, Mozart and
Thelonious Monk. There was also original music by Daniel Bernard
Roumain, who wandered across the stage playing plaintive phrases on
a violin. Jones' actions fit the moods of the scores.
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally he interrupted even emotionally fraught moments
to speak to the audience. He reminisced about teaching dance to
schoolchildren. He paid tribute to Isadora Duncan and confessed
that repeated listening to Schubert made him realize that ``I've
come out as a Romantic.'' He invited spectators to join him in a
meditative Zen breathing exercise. Most seemed willing to accept
that invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jones was usually serious, he also introduced
pleasantly silly jokes into the proceedings. Thus he had Bjorn G.
Amelan, who designed the production, which included an attractive
mobile, make repeated appearances in which he inflated and
punctured balloons. Come to think of it, those sight gags were not
totally frivolous: after all, inflating balloons does require
breath, and breath was a theme of ``The Breathing Show.''
</P>
<P>
   What helped bind the miscellaneous events together was a long
phrase filled with swinging movements that Jones introduced at the
start of the work. Then, like a composer devising variations on a
musical theme, he later offered different versions of it. In one he
gave a kinesiological analysis of every step as he did it. In
another he spoke aloud the random thoughts that were supposedly
running through his mind as he danced, among them reflections on
love, fear, Harlem, India, the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival and
Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   One might wonder if these were really his thoughts at the time
or if they were statements prepared in advance to create certain
theatrical effects. No matter. Art involves craft, and these
observations seemed typical of the free associations a dancer's
mind might conjure up.
</P>
<P>
   Dance sequences were separated by two films. Abraham Ravett's
``Garden'' depicted a garden dominated by large stones. And in his
commentaries, Jones echoed Voltaire in ``Candide'' by urging all to
``cultivate our gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more striking was ``Ghostcatching,'' in which Paul Kaiser
and Shelley Eshkar used computer-generated images to create
illusions of apparitions floating through space and drawing chalk
lines and patterns on otherwise empty air. Whereas the dance
onstage celebrated the flesh, this film celebrated the spirit. The
production as a whole celebrated both.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you call life, it will come,'' Jones assured his audience.
``The Breathing Show'' was proof of that.

FURNITURE.COM FACES DELIVERY COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Furniture.com's chief executive, Andrew Brooks, wants to
revolutionize the furniture industry. But first, according to a
leading consumer watchdog group, the Internet retailer needs to
deliver those sofas, chairs and tables.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 Furniture.com shoppers have complained to the Better
Business Bureau in Worcester, Mass. about late deliveries, damaged
goods and other problems. The bulk of the complaints were dated
over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinary number of complaints,'' said Barbara
Sinnott, president of the local BBB. ``It makes me alarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives with the Framingham, Mass. retailer acknowledged that
a surge in orders this year caused ``a few stresses in the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second quarter, there was dramatic growth in our
business,'' Brooks said. ``It was far greater than we expected. It
was far greater than our carriers and manufacturers were able to
handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com lost $43.7 million on sales of $10.9 million last
year, according to the company's IPO filing. So far this year,
Furniture.com's orders have ballooned to $20 million, Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company's call center has been unable to
handle the volume of incoming customer calls. Brooks said shoppers
nervous about Furniture.com's layoffs and the ongoing dot-com
shakeout also may have called the company to check on their orders,
causing even longer hold times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message would say, `Your wait time is more than 20
minutes. Please call back at a later date,''' said Angela Woods, a
Detroit advertising executive who has not yet received an order
placed in March. ``That scared a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say they have been addressing customer
complaints. Woods, for example, said she has been promised that her
glass table with mahogany legs will be delivered. In addition, she
said, the company has thrown in four free chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Executives say Furniture.com also has taken steps to solve the
internal problems that contributed to the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the retailer began working with a telemarketing
center handling many of its customer service calls. It also
abandoned a national carrier and has begun working with several
regional shippers with extensive experience in delivering
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   During the switch, however, the company believes several orders
were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com officials downplayed the customer complaints,
saying they represented a small percentage of the company's total
orders. ``Our overall complaint rate is low _ and it's low in an
industry that typically has a high complaint rate,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sinnott said she had never seen as many complaints in such a
short time frame. Even giant retail chains like Framingham-based
Staples Inc., which had $8.9 billion sales last year compared to
Furniture.com's $10.9 million, have not racked up as many
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com is among many online retailers that are slashing
costs and laying off employees, hoping that the capital markets
will exhibit renewed interest in dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the furniture seller announced plans to raise up to
$50 million in an initial public offering. But by spring, it was
clear that Wall Street investors had developed a distaste for
unprofitable dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   The company delayed its offering, which has been formally
withdrawn, and laid off 29 employees. Last month, the company laid
off another 80 workers.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Furniture.com's troubles, investors have stood by
the Web's largest seller of home furnishings even as they have
withdrawn support from other e-tailers. Last month, an investor
group led by (at)Ventures, the venture capital arm of Andover-based
CMGI, gave the company a $27 million lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   But industry observers have long predicted that furniture
sellers will have a tough time on the Web due to high costs
associated with shipping and returns, as well as limited experience
dealing with manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furniture is a very difficult commodity,'' said Barry
Tatelbaum, an executive with Jordan's Furniture, one of Greater
Boston's best-known furniture sellers. ``You need to be so
systemized. You need to have your back-end (distribution system) so
well thought out _ and many stores don't.''

CROSSING THE OCEAN STILL A CRUCIAL TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think of the great American companies from the old
economy _ Gillette, Coke, McDonald's _ they all had one thing in
common: They made the leap from national leaders to world leaders.
By becoming dominant international players they were able to keep
growing long after their domestic markets were saturated, and they
were able to achieve a scale and a stock market value that
otherwise would have been impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But what about in the new economy? Which companies will be
global giants, and which will run into trouble when they try to
cross the ocean?
</P>
<P>
   The question comes to mind because a least a few of the hottest
American firms are getting a somewhat cool reception overseas.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is one. AOL has more Internet subscribers than
anyone else in this country, but according to a recent account in
The Wall Street Journal, AOL's track record around the globe is not
as impressive. AOL trails local competitors in Brazil, Canada,
France, and Germany, and ranks 10th among Internet service
providers in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every port overseas, AOL has run into home-grown
competitors backed by well-financed phone companies or media groups
with strong local content,'' wrote the Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm also has had trouble exporting its success. The San
Diego company has a cell-phone technology that it hoped would
become a world standard, much the way Windows has become the global
operating system for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past two months, South Korea said it might abandon
the Qualcomm system in favor of a competing European one. And
China, which already uses the European technology, said it was
sticking with that system for now. Qualcomm stock has dropped 60
percent since the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast those stories with the experience of EMC. The Hopkinton
data storage company reported terrific earnings this week, paced by
huge sales gains all over the world. EMC is the top storage company
here, in Europe, and in Asia, except for Japan. ``In Japan, the
local companies always have a hometown advantage,'' said Mark
Fredrickson, an EMC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   What's the lesson here? Money managers and analysts say there is
no one simple way to predict who will win abroad. But as a general
rule, the purer technology companies, those selling software or
hardware, should have an easier time than those selling content,
they say. And companies selling to corporate customers should have
an easier time than those selling to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are selling equipment, the differences among countries
aren't as pronounced,'' said Rob Joseph, an analyst with State
Street Research. Put another way, there is no such thing as a
French router or a German computer server.
</P>
<P>
   In many categories _ EMC in storage, Sun Microsystems in
servers, Cisco Systems in routers _ American companies already
dominate the international arena.
</P>
<P>
   On the content side, where companies like AOL, Yahoo, Amazon and
eBay play, the challenges are steeper. ``These are businesses that
can more easily be duplicated,'' said Mark Klee, co-manager of the
John Hancock Technology Fund. ``They are also businesses that have
some local character.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL has already encountered plenty of local competitors who got
there first with a comparable service. Internet retailers like
Amazon can easily be cloned. On the auction side, eBay has to deal
with language differences, plus different rules and regulations for
auctions in each country.
</P>
<P>
   The barriers can be overcome. Analysts point to Yahoo, the
popular portal, as an example of a content company that has
prospered overseas. According to Media Metrix, Yahoo ranks first in
Internet traffic in Japan and England and second in both France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo got out there before the others,'' said Barry Parr, an
analyst with Interational Data Corp., a research firm. ``They also
decided from the beginning that international was going to be a big
part of their strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors looking for historical parallels might think of MTV,
an American business that has succeeded overseas by creating a
customized, localized product in markets all over the world. It can
be done. It just isn't easy to do.
</P>
<P>
   We don't pretend to know who is going to make it and who isn't
in the competition for the world. But we do know one thing: The
answer matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are looking at valuation,'' said Klee, ``you need to
know how big the available market is. By asking who is going to be
a player just in this country and who is going to be a player
worlwide you are barking up the right tree.''

WOODS' 6-UNDER GIVES HIM LEAD IN BRITISH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ The wind comes in off the North Sea, the
brogues are thick, the days are longer, and the heralded golf
course of choice is devoid of plush green fairways. Yet in a
haunting way, everything about this ancient town is starting to
feel and look like Pebble Beach, thanks to the continued dominance
of Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   His record-setting performance in last month's US Open, a
15-shot triumph that worked like a shot of Novocaine to the golf
world, is threatening to play itself out again at the 129th British
Open. Woods shot 6-under 66 Friday to assume a three-shot lead
through two rounds. Brushing off an afternoon tee time that could
have spelled trouble, Woods drove to 11-under 133 and hurdled David
Toms (67-136), an earlier finisher.
</P>
<P>
   Lefthander Steve Flesch (70), Sergio Garcia (69), and Loren
Roberts (68) are tied for third at 7-under, and thanks to another
day of ideal scoring conditions, Phil Mickelson (66) and Fred
Couples (68) were among 27 who broke 70 and moved into the picture
at 6-under, tied with Erie Els (72), Thomas Bjorn (69), and Tom
Lehman (70).
</P>
<P>
   But unless they can figure out how to re-wire this machine
called Woods, those gentleman are playing for second place because
the leader has no intention of changing his game plan. It does not
take a genius to understand that plan; it simply takes one to carry
it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you try to do in any tournament is not make
mistakes and don't make bogeys,'' said Woods, who would become just
the fifth player in golf history to complete a career grand slam if
he won here. ``Bogeys aren't good for a scorecard.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore his point, Woods made his second straight
bogey-free trip around this historic layout. Going back to the
third round of the US Open, he has now played 62 consecutive holes
without a bogey in major championship competition.
</P>
<P>
   That streak stayed alive with a brilliant up-and-down at the
par-4 17th, though protecting his three-shot lead was his primary
motivation, said Woods. His approach to the Road Hole ran through
the green and down a short embankment, and it came to rest on a
thin stretch of grass before the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I might end up there, and there I am,'' said Woods.
He took out a club that isn't used much around this rock-hard
course _ a 60-degree sand wedge _ and played a finesse chip up over
the embankment, across the green to a slope, which he hoped would
turn the ball back toward the pin. It did, and Woods completed the
masterful sequence by draining an 8-foot par-save that had two
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been practicing that shot,'' he said, as if you
couldn't tell.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, another way to avoid bogeys is to make birdies, and
Woods is adept at that, too. He had watched the early action on
television from his hotel room and vowed to join in the fun that
the morning starters were having.
</P>
<P>
   Toms, for instance. Toms said his first goal ``was to play on
the weekend'' in this, his first British Open, and he assured
himself Saturday's last starting time thanks to five birdies in his
bogey-free effort. The three-time winner on the PGA Tour took over
the lead at 8-under by avoiding the incoming problems that roughed
up Couples, Flesch, and Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Couples, a six-time Top-10 finisher in this event, rekindled a
little of his laid-back magic by going out in 32, then adding
birdies at the 14th and 15th to get to 8-under. Alas, he violated a
golden rule on this course and slammed his approach into a
greenside bunker at the 16th, had to hit out sideways, and then
three-putted from 50 feet to give back two shots.
</P>
<P>
   Flesch, tied with Woods one shot behind first-round leader Els,
went out quietly _ one birdie, one bogey _ but birdied the par-4
12th and drilled a 3-wood from 280 yards to set up an 8-foot eagle
putt at the par-5 14th. He was at 8-under, alone in first, until a
bogey at the par-4 15th pushed him back.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was next to get to 8-under, thanks to birdies at 10 and
12, but a sloppy three-putt from 45 feet at the Road Hole slapped
him back.
</P>
<P>
   Woods avoided such problems throughout his stroll over land once
guarded by Old Tom Morris. A few shots behind when he started,
thanks to what the morning starters had achieved, Woods promptly
knocked a sand wedge to 8 feet and made birdie at the first hole,
then added two more birdies to get to 8-under through just five
holes. Yes, the thought occurred that we had seen this before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am playing very similar to how I played at Pebble,'' said
Woods, who started 65-69 there to build a six-shot lead through 36
holes. His pursuers can gain a slice of hope, however, because the
last two days have not been as good as the first 36 at the Open, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can mis-hit a shot here and kinda get away with it,''
Woods said. ``I've done that a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd need a team of detectives to uncover those mis-hits, but
it's beside the point the way things are shaping up. Woods drove to
the front of the 314-yard 12th, chipped to 12 feet, and drained
that putt, then he made a 10-footer set up by a wedge into the
par-5 14th.
</P>
<P>
   His lead was three, but as the sun went down and the Scottish
air chilled the senses, it felt like 30. It also felt like Pebble
Beach.

ARMSTRONG WINS A STAGE, SETS RECORD IN TIME TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MULHOUSE, France _ For the past three weeks, Lance Armstrong has
had to endure the question on everyone's mind: Yes, the leader's
yellow jersey is nice, but when the heck are you going to win a
day's race?
</P>
<P>
   Neither Armstrong nor his team seemed concerned _ ``our
objective is the yellow jersey,'' was their mantra _ but only four
racers since World War II have captured the yellow jersey without
winning a stage. The last one to do so was American Greg LeMond in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong silenced the critics Friday with a resounding
victory in the individual time trial with just two days left in the
Tour. His time was half a minute faster than Germany's Jan Ullrich,
and set a record for the fastest pace in a Tour time trial or a
race against the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The race was almost a repeat of last year, as Tyler Hamilton of
Marblehead, Mass., finished fourth. The day before last year's Tour
finish, Hamilton was third behind Armstrong. Hamilton moved up to
26th in the overall standings Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the race, each rider sets out in descending order of the
rankings two minutes apart, or three for the top 25. Their only
competition is the course and the clock. Tenths of seconds, and
even 100ths of seconds, become critical, so the racers use
different bikes, often with a spokeless rear wheel, and wear
plastic helmets whose sleekness makes them aerodynamic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the race of truth, and I think it's important that the
yellow jersey takes it,'' said Armstrong, who has the overall lead
by more than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't certain if Armstrong was bluffing Thursday when he
said he feared Ullrich would win the race. But the American's
rationale sounded logical _ Ullrich is the time-trial world
champion, and he'd be cheered by the throngs of Germans as the race
headed out from Freiburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jan is a big engine, and it was in his back yard, so that's
hard,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look hard, though, as he set out from the starting
gate wearing his yellow Spandex cycling suit, hunched over the
handlebars, gritting his teeth, and pedaling furiously for the next
41 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a time trial involves nonstop exertion, Armstrong
said he tried to pace himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, I start too fast, so today, perhaps, it was good
that there were tailwinds, but I started very conservative,'' said
Armstrong, who watched his heart monitor on his bike's computer and
listened to his time splits the team manager radioed through his
earpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard at the first time check that I was on the same
time as Ullrich, I knew I could have a good ride,'' he said,
finishing in 1:05.01.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's pace of 33.48 miles per hour set a record for long
time trials in the Tour. LeMond had a slighty faster pace in '89,
but it was over a course half the length.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not the biggest win of his career. Armstrong said
that would be the stage he won in the Tour of 1995 at Limoges. It
was three days after his teammate Fabio Casartelli had crashed in
the mountains and died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This win was not even close,'' Armstrong said. ``Limoges is
still my most memorable stage win and the most important victory of
my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he couldn't deny the satisfaction of wearing the yellow
jersey and topping it off with a stage victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was nice to win, though,'' he said. ``I had an empty
feeling up until now, and now it's complete.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton may not have the fastest time in the Tour, but he has
the lightest bike. Last week, a group of German technicians weighed
the bicycles used during the mountain climbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a special mountain one for Lance, Kevin (Livingston),
and Tyler, and Tyler's was the lightest bike in the (pack),'' said
Geoff Brown, the head mechanic for the US Postal Service team.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's bike weighed 7.3 kilos, Brown said, ``or a tad under
16 pounds.''

 A FEDERAL TAX WITH ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you believe the rhetoric coming off Capitol Hill, ending the
federal tax on inheritances would either: (a) help the rich get
richer, or (b) stamp out an unfair system that reaches into the
grave to tax the same money twice.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the gravitational pull of election-year politics, the
issue isn't so simple _ or polarized.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, quashing the estate tax would lower tax bills
for many but raise them for a few, simplify tax planning while
threatening the livelihood of tax planners, and give the wealthiest
Americans a boost, at the expense of charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public discussion to this point has been largely driven by
politics,'' said Neil Harl, an agricultural law professor at Iowa
State University and the author of three books on the estate tax.
``The spin hasn't had much to do with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the so-called death tax, adopted early in the 20th
century, may not survive long in the 21st.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Senate voted 59 to 39 to phase out the estate tax
between now and 2010. The House of Representatives approved the
same legislation by a 279 to 136 margin in June.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has promised to veto the measure when it
reaches his desk, which congressional leaders say should happen in
September. In its place, Clinton has proposed a partial rollback
aimed specifically at farms and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, we are on the verge of eliminating this tax, no
matter what the president does,'' said Jim Hirni, chief tax
lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business, which
supports the bill. ``The anti-death-tax push has gained so much
momentum that it's only a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's true remains to be seen, but there is little
question the public would like to see the tax scrapped. A Gallup
poll taken in late June found 60 percent of those surveyed favored
its elimination.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy, especially in regions such as New England,
is at least partially responsible. As stock prices and home values
rose in recent years, millions of middle-class families faced the
possibility of dying with a big enough estate to trigger the tax.
</P>
<P>
   One out of six questioned in the Gallup poll said they were
likely to ``personally benefit'' from repeal of the tax, which
experts say is probably too rosy, even in the strongest of
economies. In 1998, the latest year for which the Internal Revenue
Service has released estimates, only 2.1 percent _ or one out of 48
_ of those who died were hit with the levy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a pretty big disconnect between the perception and
reality of who is affected,'' said Steven Riley, a Florida
estate-planning lawyer and author of ``Generations: Planning Your
Legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, individual estates up to $675,000 pass
tax-free to heirs. Couples are allowed twice that amount, or $1.35
million, before the tax kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   By 2006, the exempt amounts rise to $1 million and $2 million,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers and owners of family businesses are allowed even more
before the tax takes effect. The basic exemption, for example, is
$1.3 million per individual or $2.6 million per couple.
</P>
<P>
   (The White House proposal would increase those amounts to $2
million and $4 million, respectively.)
</P>
<P>
   The IRS also lets farms subtract as much as $750,000 from an
estate's value to account for the fact that farmland is worth less
than land used for, say, apartments or shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is rare for a farm to be impacted at all,'' said Harl, the
Iowa State professor. ``I have been involved in this area for
almost 36 years, and I've never seen an instance where a farm had
to be sold as a result of the federal estate tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling the family business, though, is precisely what Cliff
Sjoberg's accountant suggested recently. Sjoberg, who owns a metals
fabrication company in Cranston, R.I., rejected that idea but is
still working with a lawyer and accountant to pass the firm to his
sons.
</P>
<P>
   When he took over the operation in the late 1960s, Sjoberg said,
his father simply gave him shares of closely held stock over a
couple of years. That way, they stayed within guidelines that limit
the size of tax-free gifts in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   But the current gift limit, $10,000 per person per year, is too
low for the 69-year-old Sjoberg to transfer the company in his
lifetime. And with the business valued at more than the estate-tax
exclusion, his family faces a whopping bill if he simply leaves it
to his sons when he dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see my kids take and work the business,'' he said.
``This idea of selling it because we can't afford to take and
handle the transfer is repugnant to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, many people with sizable estates avoid paying the
tax through complex planning, often involving trusts and charitable
donations. But when the numbers get too big, they typically have no
choice but to give up some of the assets _ or pay the piper, at
estate-tax rates that top out at 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hirni, of the NFIB, said that Sjoberg and other business owners
should not be forced into that decision, or forced to spend
thousands of dollars on lawyers, accountants, and financial
planners to deal with the tax. The NFIB prefers Congress's all-out
repeal to President Clinton's modifications, Hirni said, because it
would simplify business owners' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Killing the tax wouldn't eliminate the need for all estate
planning, of course. Individuals and business owners would still
have to decide how assets should be divvied up at their deaths, and
have legal documents drawn up to make their wishes known.
</P>
<P>
   It would, though, end much of the complex planning done
specifically to avoid the estate tax. That's especially true for
the handful of Americans with estates valued at $5 million or more,
who paid more than half of the tax in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   An unintended consequence of the change would be an estimated
decrease of $5 billion to $6 billion annually in charitable
donations from high-net-worth estates, which have traditionally
chosen philanthropy over taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Not every millionaire would save equally, though, if the death
tax is deep-sixed.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the current system allows a ``step-up in basis''
on stocks and houses when a person dies. The assets are counted for
tax purposes at their value on the day of death, rather than on the
day they were purchased. Heirs, therefore, are never taxed on the
often substantial gains in between.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system Congress has proposed, step-ups in basis are
limited to $1.3 million for individuals and $3 million for couples.
Heirs who inherit sizable investment portfolios or expensive homes
might face more in capital-gains taxes, which are hard to avoid,
than they would have in estate taxes, which can largely be
sidestepped with careful planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proponents of the (congressional) plan have sort of finessed
that issue,'' Harl said. ``For farmers in Iowa and homeowners in
Boston, who have a lot of wealth wrapped up in land values, it's a
pretty big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepped-up basis also plays a role in countering the belief that
the estate tax amounts to double taxation _ the government tapping
money it has already nicked once. Stocks and homes, which now
account for more than half of the typical estate, according to the
IRS, almost always include tax-free gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start putting these things together, and you realize it's
not a simple case of the world being better or worse without this
tax,'' said Riley, who teaches seminars for the National Network of
Estate Planning Attorneys.

FOX HOPES TO LIGHTEN UP ITS DARK, DISMAL SEASON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ If television ratings success eludes you, there's
always honesty. At least that seemed to be the theory of Fox
executives discussing the network's upcoming fall season for
assembled journalists on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Grushow, chairman of Fox Television Entertainment Group,
who was brought in to help the foundering network last November,
was frank in his assessment of the network's performance last
season: Fox ``failed to capture an audience for any of its new
series. And I don't mean they launched and failed. I mean they
never launched.''
</P>
<P>
   Grushow even offered criticism of the network's upcoming season:
``Taken as a whole, I'd prefer to see a more balanced Fox schedule,
one that relies less on dark sci-fi and more on shows that speak to
a young adult female audience.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Fox flagship ``The X-Files,`` the network has
four hourlong dramas _ ``Dark Angel,'' ``Night Visions,''
``Freakylinks'' and ``X-Files'' spinoff ``Lone Gunmen'' _ to air in
the coming season.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gail Berman, who became the network's president of
entertainment three weeks ago _ replacing Doug Herzog, the brunt of
most of the blame for last season's debacle _ mildly chided one of
the network's most successful series, David E. Kelley's ``Ally
McBeal.``
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that some of you have raised concerns that the show
took too many flights of fancy, sacrificing its emotional center. I
did agree with some of the observations that it might have taken
off into some flights of fancy _ that perhaps, it took too many of
them.'' (Winner of the Outstanding Comedy Series in 1999, the show
was virtually shut out in this year's Emmys.)
</P>
<P>
   In a startling contrast to NBC, which seemed to be champing at
the bit to wallow in the reality series trend, Fox _ notorious for
its ``shockumentary'' ratings stunts in the past, culminating in
the embarrassing ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' fiasco
_ seems to be employing uncharacteristic restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we obviously stepped back and took a look at was the fact
that there's a danger attendant to doing these things, and there's
got to be real risk assessment every time you say `yes,''' Grushow
said. ``We've even brought in an outside risk management firm
(PriceWaterhouse) to help us assess every single one of these
specials that are in development. It's a very challenging area.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fox's only announced new venture into reality is an
upcoming summer series, ``American High,'' from R.J. Cutler, an
Oscar-nominated filmmaker of political films (``The War Room,'' ``A
Perfect Candidate''). The series examines teens and their lives in
and out of school _ the students themselves were given video
cameras to document their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think 'American High' at all deals in going over the
line,`` Grushow said. ``It's very instructive to see what's going
on in American high schools, and with American youth today.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's problems extend to a troubling trend _ in each of the past
three seasons, the network has announced a series on its fall
lineup that eventually ended up never airing. The odds-on favorite
to continue that trend this year is ``Schimmel,'' a family sitcom
starring comic Robert Schimmel that was yanked from the fall
schedule the day after its announcement received an unenthusiastic
reception.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow explained that the show was always planned as a
midseason replacement. Executive producer Mike Scully's work on
``The Simpsons'' ostensibly prohibits him from getting ``Schimmel''
into shape any earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than explain to the whole advertising community how
we're going to run four episodes of `Malcolm in the Middle' and
repeat episodes of other shows at 8 p.m. on Wednesday night, our ad
sales president basically suggested to announce (`Schimmel' in the
time slot),'' Grushow explained.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the comic has been diagnosed with cancer. ``His
prognosis is good, positive,'' Berman reported. ``He is in a good
frame of mind. And we are anxious to get going as soon as he is up
and ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in trouble is John Goodman's new sitcom, previously titled
``Don't Ask,'' in which he plays a gay father. The pilot was
scrapped and will be reshot, with very few original cast members
surviving the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Production company) Carsey-Werner and (executive producers)
Bonnie and Terry Turner had some serious concerns about the
long-term viability of the premise that was presented in the
pilot,'' Berman said. ``They decided they wanted to go back in and
take a hard look at the premise _ and came back with what we
thought was a terrific reworking of the idea. It's a much more
family-oriented show than the original pilot was.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox announced the premiere dates for its fall season, a
particularly tricky schedule this year, given that the networks
don't want to compete with NBC's Summer Olympics in September. Fox
has the baseball playoffs and World Series in October, and
presidential debates and election coverage will also figure in
there somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Angel,'' James Cameron's post-apocalyptic drama, debuts
Oct. 3. Thrillers ``Freakylinks'' and ``Night Visions'' will be
unveiled Oct. 6. ``Boston Common,'' a classroom drama from David E.
Kelley, premieres Oct. 23. The Goodman sitcom and ``The $treet,'' a
Wall Street-based soap from Darren Star, premieres Nov. 1. ``Lone
Gunman'' won't be seen until midseason. &QL;

LUCENT-CISCO SUIT HEATS UP WITH EX-WORKER ALLEGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A heated rivalry between two communications equipment
giants, Lucent Technologies Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc., got a few
degrees hotter.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement filed in US District Court, 10 former Lucent
employees who left earlier this year to work for Cisco alleged
``abusive and oppressive management tactics'' at Lucent's
manufacturing plant in North Andover. The statement also alleges
``discriminatory treatment of female employees'' but did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was filed as part of a lawsuit Lucent brought in
June against the former employees. Lucent contends the former
workers violated its employment agreement by going to work for
Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although the statement was filed by the workers, Lucent
considered it an attack from Cisco, which is picking up the legal
tabs for the employees' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing that Cisco would respond to Lucent's
reasonable efforts to protect its proprietary secrets by making
false allegations about Lucent's integrity,'' said Lucent
spokeswoman Mary Lou Ambrus.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Lucent's lawsuit against its former employees, Ambrus
said, ``We've simply taken steps to ensure that certain former
Lucent employees who now work for Cisco not be permitted to
disclose Lucent's trade secrets to their new employer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's lawsuit also seeks to prevent the employees from
working on optical networking technology for a nine-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the employees argued that they had never signed any such
agreement with Lucent. Further, they started seeking jobs when
Lucent managers in January said up to half the workers at the North
Andover plant could be laid off as part of a ``reconfiguration,''
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the dispute is a fierce battle between Cisco and
Lucent for ascendancy in the burgeoning market for sophisticated
fiberoptic technology used to ferry vasts amounts of information at
high speeds. That market is expected to explode from $6 billion a
year in 1999 to $23 billion in 2003, according to estimates by RHK,
a market research firm in South San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent makes fiber optic equipment at its North Andover site,
while Cisco plans to significantly ramp up its offerings by
building an optical networking plant in Salem, N.H. Cisco's plant,
where the 10 former Lucent employees will work, is expected to be
ready by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, meanwhile, has been unable to keep up with a voracious
demand for optical networking equipment, a fact analysts believe is
contributing to the Murray Hill, N.J., company's faltering
finances. On Thursday, Lucent reported a third-quarter loss and
downplayed its profit outlook for the remainder of the year,
triggering a 15.5 percent drop in the company's stock. Lucent's
stock fell another 5.4 percent Friday, slipping $3.0625 to $51.125
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a situation (Lucent) can turn around overnight,''
said Steve Levy, analyst with Lehman Bros.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's stock began its tumble in January, when the company
reported a 23 percent drop in first-quarter profits. That marked
the first time the company fell short of Wall Street expectations
since it was spun off from AT&AMP;T Corp. in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent has more than 9,000 employees in Massachusetts, most of
whom work in North Andover. Last year, Lucent spent $24 billion
buying Massachusetts-based telecommunications start-ups, including
Nexabit Communications in Marlborough.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., also has a substantial
presence in Massachusetts, with about 2,200 employees in the state.
Cisco has spent $10 billion buying 11 companies in New England in
the past several years.

<P>
   Teen-pop princess Britney Spears and her pals in the ultra-hot
bubblegum genre drive the record industry.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Spears tell it, however, the 18-year-old small-town girl
and ex-Mouseketeer hasn't realized just how much power she actually
wields.
</P>
<P>
   Just after returning home from taping her Fox-TV special in
Hawaii recently, Spears was thrilled ``they let me bring my friends
out'' on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Got that? They let me bring my friends on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   What Spears doesn't seem to understand is she has the sort of
clout Garth Brooks had a few years ago when he demanded a change in
his label's executive suite _ and got it.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't have to ask nicely if it's OK if some pals come
along to Hawaii. She can demand a private plane and top-flight
service for her friends.
</P>
<P>
   Britney Spears isn't merely a here today, gone tomorrow kid-pop
phenom. In the past two years, the bubbly diva has sold more than
20 million albums to become the reigning queen of all
bellybutton-baring female singers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did she just celebrate the milestone of 10 million
worldwide sales of her debut album, ``... Baby One More Time,'' but
she's the youngest female in pop history to have a simultaneous No.
1 single and album on the charts _ in the album's first week in
stores.
</P>
<P>
   And that was before the release of her follow-up album, ``Oops!
... I Did It Again,'' which has sold more than 4 million copies in
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Spears' popularity shows no signs of waning. All remaining seats
for her concerts at the Forum on July 30 and 31 (plus Saturday at
the Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre in Irvine and Aug. 5 at the Glen
Helen Blockbuster Pavilion in Devore) are expected to be gone by
the time you read this. Not that there were many left unsold to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   And with a memoir (``Britney Spears' Heart to Heart'') selling
like hotcakes and a new single burning up the charts, Spears' star
power is shining brighter than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent phone interview, we asked if the real Britney has
been lost amid all the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure there are some misconceptions,'' she says. ``A lot of
people think it happened overnight (for me), and that bothers me
because I worked really hard to get where I am. But people see that
I'm a real person like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears says her current tour, which was choreographed by the guy
who did the Ricky Martin extravaganza, includes pyrotechnics, set
changes and plenty of flashy costumes. In fact, the technical
aspects and size of the show forced her to change venues in Los
Angeles and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are sweet parts and strong, hard parts that are edgy,''
she says. ``There's lots more pyro and gadgets. It's just a fun
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears has joined the short list of one-named stars _ Madonna,
Sting, Whitney, Shania, err, Eminem.
</P>
<P>
   Oops! Did we really mention Eminem, the gleefully crude
chart-topping rapper who skewers our Britney in unprintable terms
(along with Christina Aguilera and 'N Sync) on his hit single and
video, ``The Real Slim Shady''?
</P>
<P>
   Spears takes the high road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take it as a dis at all,'' she responded. ``I think
it's cool. It's flattering when someone's gonna write about you in
their song. I think Eminem is brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   She also dismisses any rumored rivalry with Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a friendly competition,'' she admits. ``A lot of
people compare us because we're kind of the same age, but I think
our music and personalities are very different.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in rural Kentwood, La., Spears was singing and
dancing to the Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston hits she heard on
the radio.
</P>
<P>
   After spending much of her early childhood performing in talent
shows, church choirs and gymnastics competitions, she studied at
New York's Professional Performing Arts School, acted in TV
commercials and the off-Broadway play ``Ruthless'' (inspired by the
movie ``The Bad Seed''), and competed on TV's ``Star Search.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11, Spears began a two-season stint on TV's ``New Mickey
Mouse Club,'' alongside future ``Felicity'' star Keri Russell, 'N
Sync members-to-be Justin Timberlake and J.C. Chasez, and current
teen-diva Aguilera. Spears and Timberlake are now rumored to be a
couple, though they've denied they are secretly married.
</P>
<P>
   When ``The New Mickey Mouse Club'' was canceled in 1994, Spears
started planning a recording career. Jive Records signed her at age
15, mostly on the strength of an informal demo tape of her singing
karaoke-style over a prerecorded instrumental track.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive marketing to set up the release of the single ``...
Baby One More Time'' a few months before Spears' debut album came
out in January 1999 made sure the teen queen was already a pop
star.
</P>
<P>
   But will a couple of multimillion-selling albums and
chart-topping singles lead to a long-term career?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Britney has a lengthier career ahead of her, like 'N
Sync does,'' says Anita Bond, general manager at Tower in Sherman
Oaks. ``She appeals to young adults as well as teens and the very
young, and her music has a bit more content than the usual
teenybopper stuff. I think she might stick around a little longer
than others in the genre because she probably has a few more good
albums to come. Will she be Celine Dion? I don't think so. But
she'll be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Spears albums have been produced by the unabashedly
commercial hit-making machine of Max Martin and his team at
Sweden's Cheiron studios. Martin and crew are also the brains
behind 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys and are brilliant at
creating deceptively simple pop melodies that sound great on radio.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Spears' current tour is doing a blockbuster business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a preteen, there's a lot of excitement,'' says Gary
Bongiovanni, editor of the concert industry weekly Pollstar. ``The
tour is doing very well _ the grosses are huge and attendance is
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Bongiovanni says Spears' numbers for the first six months of the
year place her ``Oops! ... I Did It Again'' tour in the No. 12 spot
with grosses of $14.7 million based on 29 shows in 28 cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will she be around for a long while?'' he adds. ``That's the
$64,000 question on just about every teen act.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio, too, has joined the Spears bandwagon. For example, Radio
Disney, which broadcasts to preteens in 46 cities, recently saw its
number of calls rise to 90,000 daily with kids trying to register
for a Spears contest that offers a front-row concert seat and a
chance to meet the teen queen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think Britney's come into her own with this new
album,'' says Robin Jones, Radio Disney's senior director of
operations. ``We don't know if she's a Barbra Streisand, but we
don't think she's anywhere near ready to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her music success, Spears wants to branch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to do a movie next year,'' Spears says. ``But
nothing's set in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   She admits both her image and sound have grown up a bit. She's
cranked up the vixen appeal slightly, trading her polite skirts for
tight leather pants, and altered her message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did change things up,'' she says. ``The first album was
talking about heartbreak and how lonely I was, and the message in
the new one is, 'You're stronger' and 'What you see is what you
get.' It's a similar sound, but that is my sound. I'm marking my
territory, and this is the kind of music I sing. I definitely think
this album (represents) major growth from the first one.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears is ready for a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are gonna have opinions, and I can't worry about what
everybody thinks,'' she says. ``I can just try and be me. I think
you're the sexiest when you're being yourself. And if they think
that's sexy, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Spears says she doesn't view herself as a role model, she
has been called the ``voice of a generation,'' the same tag given
to Nirvana's late frontman Kurt Cobain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it as a weight on my shoulders, to be
honest with you,'' Spears says. ``It's flattering they say that.''

out in January 1999 made sure the teen queen was already a pop
star.
</P>
<P>
   But will a couple of multimillion-selling albums and
chart-topping singles lead to a long-term career?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Britney has a lengthier career ahead of her, like 'N
Sync does,'' says Anita Bond, general manager at Tower in Sherman
Oaks. ``She appeals to young adults as well as teens and the very
young, and her music has a bit more content than the usual
teenybopper stuff. I think she might stick around a little longer
than others in the genre because she probably has a few more good
albums to come. Will she be Celine Dion? I don't think so. But
she'll be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Spears albums have been produced by the unabashedly
commercial hit-making machine of Max Martin and his team at
Sweden's Cheiron studios. Martin and crew are also the brains
behind 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys and are brilliant at
creating deceptively simple pop melodies that sound great on radio.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Spears' current tour is doing a blockbuster business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a preteen, there's a lot of excitement,'' says Gary
Bongiovanni, editor of the concert industry weekly Pollstar. ``The
tour is doing very well _ the grosses are huge and attendance is
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Bongiovanni says Spears' numbers for the first six months of the
year place her ``Oops! ... I Did It Again'' tour in the No. 12 spot
with grosses of $14.7 million based on 29 shows in 28 cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will she be around for a long while?'' he adds. ``That's the
$64,000 question on just about every teen act.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio, too, has joined the Spears bandwagon. For example, Radio
Disney, which broadcasts to preteens in 46 cities, recently saw its
number of calls rise to 90,000 daily with kids trying to register
for a Spears contest that offers a front-row concert seat and a
chance to meet the teen queen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think Britney's come into her own with this new
album,'' says Robin Jones, Radio Disney's senior director of
operations. ``We don't know if she's a Barbra Streisand, but we
don't think she's anywhere near ready to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her music success, Spears wants to branch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to do a movie next year,'' Spears says. ``But
nothing's set in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   She admits both her image and sound have grown up a bit. She's
cranked up the vixen appeal slightly, trading her polite skirts for
tight leather pants, and altered her message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did change things up,'' she says. ``The first album was
talking about heartbreak and how lonely I was, and the message in
the new one is, 'You're stronger' and 'What you see is what you
get.' It's a similar sound, but that is my sound. I'm marking my
territory, and this is the kind of music I sing. I definitely think
this album (represents) major growth from the first one.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears is ready for a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are gonna have opinions, and I can't worry about what
everybody thinks,'' she says. ``I can just try and be me. I think
you're the sexiest when you're being yourself. And if they think
that's sexy, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Spears says she doesn't view herself as a role model, she
has been called the ``voice of a generation,'' the same tag given
to Nirvana's late frontman Kurt Cobain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it as a weight on my shoulders, to be
honest with you,'' Spears says. ``It's flattering they say that.''

FASCINATING EXHIBIT TAKES A LOOK AT ORIENTALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIMOTHY CAHILL  
 c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ The key to the exhibit ``Noble Dreams,
Wicked Pleasures'' here at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art
Institute is the small John Sloan painting ``Movies.''
</P>
<P>
   On a dark Manhattan sidewalk, the bright light of a cinema
marquee advertises ``A Romance of the Harem,'' and a crowd of men,
women and children gathers in the glow. Exotic and erotic, the
artificial light of the Orient has been attracting Americans this
way for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark's big summer show is an ambitious history of
Orientalism in America, from 1870, when it gained popular currency,
to just before World War II. Orientalism, the notion of an
``Orient'' replete with sultans and dancing girls, camel drivers
and bazaars, is a concoction of myth and cliche that has served a
range of nationalist, capitalist and chauvinist purposes through
the years. The term describes something in ourselves that remains
largely unexamined to this day.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibit is a masterful bit of art history _ no museum has
ever attempted what the Clark, led by Williams College Islamic art
scholar Holly Edwards, has accomplished here _ but it's more. The
exhibit is a mirror of attitudes and assumptions we've inherited
from the past.
</P>
<P>
   The work on view is splendid, from paintings by 19th-century
stars like Frederic Church, Jean-Leon Gerome and John Singer
Sargent to 20th-century goodies by Maxfield Parrish, Irving Berlin
and Douglas Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit calls on the viewer to do what Sloan did in his
painting, see through the surface reality to what it represents.
The Clark has mapped a legacy of prejudice and willful foolishness
with its show, and found as well a strain of longing for some
missing ingredient in American culture.
</P>
<P>
   American attitudes toward the Orient were forged in France,
which in the mid-19th century was this country's paragon of
culture. Beaux-arts painters like Gerome, with their extreme
technical skills and vivid imaginations, invented the ``Orient,'' a
place extending roughly from Moorish Spain to Palestine to Turkey,
Iran and Iraq. It was, to be sure, predominantly a region of the
mind, populated by turbaned kings, bare-chested henchmen and veiled
women, and erotically charged. Gerome's 1870 ``The Snake Charmer,''
which depicts a naked slave boy presenting a coiled python to his
master, makes the none-too-subtle point that the Orient was a land
of depravity and sexual adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, one of the exhibit's handful of masterpieces, also
features drop-dead technique. Gerome's draftmanship was impeccable,
his illusionism superb and his mastery of paint consummate _ the
blue-tile walls, the stone floor, the carpet, the snake's basket,
all are utterly lifelike, as is the creamy smoothness of the boy's
skin. Gerome fused the exoticism of the Orient to an academic
Classicism that in the European mind was all-virtuous.
</P>
<P>
   France, busy colonizing Arab North Africa and the Middle East,
took comfort in its cultural superiority and lurid images of
peoples so unlike itself.
</P>
<P>
   America, meanwhile, was rising from the ashes of the Civil War
to a burgeoning era of growth and power. It craved international
respectability, and appropriating French attitudes was an easy
shortcut to class.
</P>
<P>
   But French Orientalism was too heady for the Protestant
sensibilities of the American Renaissance. Pleasures of the flesh
were taboo; the Orient became instead a land of religious heritage,
the cradle of American Christianity. Church painted it like this in
his grand ``Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives,'' a depiction of
the Holy Land as Arcadia not all that different in feel from his
views of the Hudson River and South America.
</P>
<P>
   If Church and Gerome represent the two poles of 19th-century
Orientalism, most of the artistic thinking in this country took
place in the middle. Painters like Sargent and Frederick Arthur
Bridgman depicted the Orient as a land of indolent splendor, a
getaway, vicarious or actual, for empire-builders worn out by
relentless capitalism and global profiteering. Here was a place
filled with magnificent stuff _ carpets, ceramics, weapons,
textiles, architecture _ and all of it just waiting to be possessed
by us of the civilized nations, who could truly appreciate its
worth.
</P>
<P>
   And chief among the Orient's fine possessions was its women,
made mysterious by their clothes and manners, and all the more
alluring for that mystery. Their languor and intrigue fired the
American male's imagination without assaulting his public
rectitude.
</P>
<P>
   Images like Bridgman's ``Siesta,'' painted in 1878 and depicting
an Arab girl napping amid fine furnishings and an opium pipe,
defined how we were to conceive of the region for much of the next
century. A place created for American delectation, where our
appetites, be they for art or romance or crude oil, could easily
and cheaply be met.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show's scope extends only to 1930, it's hard to
walk through the galleries and not reflect on the forms Orientalism
takes even today. From Disney's ``Aladdin'' to ``The English
Patient'' to the recent ``Three Kings,'' Hollywood continues to
exploit familiar motifs that have their roots in the last century.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Three Kings,'' in which Gulf War soldiers
plunder Saddam Hussein's gold, these cliches consciously undermine
themselves. But isn't that also what's happening in reality, in
this region full of rogue zealots ready to declare war on the U.S.?
It becomes a little easier to comprehend Iranian and Libyan
extremism when viewed in the context of the Western exploitation on
display at the Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Survey this shameful history on the museum's walls and something
poignant also presents itself in our ancestors' behavior. Church
and other artists, including William Merritt Chase, appropriated
Middle Eastern objects and designs into their own lives (the show
includes a number of objects and photographs borrowed from Olana,
Church's Orientalist manse just outside Hudson). Seen from the
vantage point of today, what they did has an almost desperate edge
to it, as if they were grasping for authenticity their own lives
lacked.
</P>
<P>
   America may have been the juggernaut of the world, but its
material culture paled in comparison to places like Baghdad and
Istanbul. These artists must, at least in part, have intimated in
this rich culture an underlying richness of spirit, one that was
genuine and could not be manufactured for the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Not that American ingenuity didn't try. The exhibit's energy is
divided roughly in half, the first part tracing the history of
Orientalism up to the 1890s, and the second recording how that
early history was transmuted by modern culture. If the early
chapters feature oil painters inventing a domestic image of the
Orient, the later ones give us ad men, fashion designers and movie
stars making the image into product.
</P>
<P>
   The show picks up momentum here, probably because it feels so
familiar. By the 1890s, retailers from Sears, Roebuck to Tiffany &AMP;
Co. were selling decorative vases, tea sets and other furnishings
based on Middle Eastern designs. The exhibit includes some of the
more ornate examples of the trend _ a Moorish desk by Tiffany, for
example, or a pair of enameled and gilt bottles by Crown Derby.

`LOSER' AIN'T WORTH IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Appropriating another defeatist term of endearment from the
mouths of America's young, ``Clueless'' writer-director Amy
Heckerling returns with ``Loser.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a non-event, though. The knowing bite is gone. She seems
merely bitter now, casting about for unmitigated warmth and hating
herself for it, and punishing us in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Fashioned as a teen comedy with wrinkles and a depressive
streak, ``Loser'' is an arthritic failure, genuine only when the
two outcast lovers' eyes dart toward each other, then retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Heckerling just pollutes the marketplace with a new
``in'' address in an overpopulated teenage wasteland. You don't
simply wish for Dora (Mena Suvari) to realize that she wants Paul
(Jason Biggs), you want him to scoop her under his arm and carry
her into a better Amy Heckerling movie. (Will she ever revisit the
acute raunch of ``Ridgemont High''?)
</P>
<P>
   With its limp ``complaint rock'' soundtrack, ``Loser'' feels
dated and distressingly conventional as it flickers before you.
</P>
<P>
   Paul jets from cheery Midwest locale to cruel New York City.
Back home the whole family babysat the mailbox, waiting for his
college-acceptance letter. Once there, Paul is more or less jailed
with three glam-pothead roommates so full of prankster hate that
the film loses instant credibility for not making them Jerky Boys
fans. Instead, they sit around playing the heretofore unseen
``Rhoda'' drinking game, razzing financial-aid Paul for his
boorishness.
</P>
<P>
   Paul's problem is not that he's hopelessly nice, it's that his
pop reservoir doesn't run deep enough to know that when the guys
you're living with dress as if Urban Outfitters had its way with
the Delia's catalog, you've been handed your hint to leave.
Eventually, he does move out of the dorm and into the
basement-level digs of a veterinary clinic, where the film embarks
on a PSA for PETA.
</P>
<P>
   Biggs is saddled with the somewhat unfortunate task of being the
Anthony Michael Hall in this '80s Brat Pack renaissance - the
nerdy, gangly victim, forever doomed to perform a variation on the
Web-cam dance from ``American Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Heckerling is making a genre flick so Biggs has to play by the
rules, even suffering through the requisite makeover that turns him
from a dork in a hunter's cap into a dork wearing the clothes of a
British pop fan circa 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The change in attire comes at the behest of Suvari's Dora, a
Goth chick with a silver lining. They meet in English Lit class.
She's introduced sucking on packet of honey, and it's a tease for a
zanier movie (a barely post-pubescent ``Something Wild,'' perhaps)
that never arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows, ``Loser'' glides over its own dark themes _ Dora's
emotionally abusive affair with her lit prof (Greg Kinnear, as
svelte and smug as he gets), who pronounces Betty Friedan dead;
Paul's roomies' attempts to drug girls for sex. Heckerling seems to
despise the world she's built around these two but plumbs for
cuteness anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Putting Paul in that hunter's cap and Suvari in the role of
work-study misfit, it seemed like Heckerling was introducing Holden
Caulfield to a Jane Austen heroine. Even better, Dora's the cynic
and Paul's the eternally put-upon naif like Catherine in
``Northanger Abbey.''
</P>
<P>
   But Heckerling's wily, agile adaptation days seem behind her.
``Clueless'' used a love-struck Austen satire to make a soapy
satire of all things 90210. It was a Binaca blast of teen steam
that bopped like a mash note hooked up to an amplifier. ``Loser,''
by comparison, trudges around like it's taking its cues from
whatever Freddie Prinze Jr. was in last month.

<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ You could tell the meeting had something to do with
a presidential race. There was a Secret Service agent posted for
about every 20 square feet of floor space, and invited guests were
frisked at the door.
</P>
<P>
   The seating in the small conference room was rearranged when a
tall man in the middle of the front row blocked a camera shot. And
George W. Bush was there, preaching the virtues of fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Fatherhood?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, fatherhood. Not missile defense systems, foreign relations,
taxes or even education.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't discussing the virtues _ or advantages _ of having
a former president as father and a politically potent family name
to help open doors.
</P>
<P>
   He was promoting the everyday, family unit-type fatherhood of
mentor and role model. The kind of father who plays checkers (or
Nintendo) with his kids, wipes their noses, helps them with their
homework, comes home at night and is otherwise there for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most important job any of us will ever have if we're
blessed to be a dad,'' Bush said during an appearance last week at
Faith Works, a faith-based social services agency in Milwaukee's
inner city.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, fatherhood is a more important job than being
president. But since Bush is running for president, not father of
the year, why is he trying to sound like a social worker or a
minister?
</P>
<P>
   Bush would argue that he is being a ``compassionate
conservative,'' focusing attention on major social problems that
government alone cannot effectively tackle. He seems to be trying
to walk a middle ground between those who believe government hasn't
done enough and those who believe government has tried to do too
much and made things worse.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his strategy is to increase the role of church-related
or faith-based organizations in the effort to make America a better
place. According to this approach, it is compassionate to be
charitable and conservative to save tax dollars and government red
tape.
</P>
<P>
   Faith Works is a long-term, nondenominational, residential
program aimed at getting fathers who are addicted to alcohol or
other drugs back with their families and back on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sat around a table with the agency's director, a counselor,
a minister, a father who had participated in the program and the
head of a charitable foundation that contributes money to it. The
small audience included several other ministers and several men
(accompanied by their children) who were in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The event was obviously staged. Bush wasn't asked any questions,
and he got to deliver his ``compassionate conservative'' spiel. But
it was, nevertheless, informative.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Fatherhood Initiative, whose director,
Wade F. Horn, also joined in the discussion, almost 40 percent of
American children (about 25 million) don't live with their dads.
And their fathers' absence has produced some sobering statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 75 percent of children in single-family homes will
experience poverty before they are 11. And most violent criminals
are males who grew up without fathers, including as many as 60
percent of men who committed rape, 75 percent of teens charged with
murder and 70 percent of long-term prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
   One presidential candidate is not going to solve those problems
with a pitch for responsible fatherhood or any other positive
quality. Neither is all the compassionate conservatism _ or
compassionate liberalism, for that matter _ in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is correct to focus attention on some of the causes of
society's problems and to support the work that churches and other
faith-based organizations play in trying to improve lives and
prevent some of those problems, provided the line separating church
and state isn't crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also recognizes that government has a role. In Milwaukee,
for example, he proposed that the federal government provide $185
million over five years for grants to community- and faith-based
organizations that provide job training and other services to
low-income fathers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   That amount would seem to be only a drop in the bucket compared
to the need. But Bush is conservative, as well as compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of faith-based efforts will relieve the government of
its responsibility to fund crucial services for which all taxpayers
should share the tab, including services made necessary by absent
fathers. That part of the debate, as always, will revolve around
priorities.

TATTOO THE EARTH TOUR: OUTSIDERS VENTING THEIR INNER DARKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Tattoo the Earth Tour, which arrived at Giants
Stadium on Thursday, was organized to illustrate a longstanding
concept in rock: the steadfast commitment of serious devotees to
life beyond the norm. Heavy rock is an outsider's pleasure, and
tattoos are permanent emblems of the soul's insurrection. Seriously
tattooed people, with ink on the neck or down both arms, can
alienate employers, family and people in line at the supermarket.
They incorporate confrontationalism into their very membranes.
</P>
<P>
   Tattoo the Earth is intended to honor this ultimate commitment
to strangeness alongside the music that, to many ears, shares its
stance. Elsewhere on the national tour's 18 stops, this idea is
being realized by having famous tattoo artists practice their art
on willing customers. But New Jersey officials decided to ban the
tattoo artists, fearing they would not be properly regulated. So
the bands had to promulgate outsiderness on their own.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't a stretch, since estrangement is the wellspring for
heavy rock. Its intense amplification, frantic speed and brutal
repetition is purgative. It strips away politeness to reveal darker
emotions: fear, craving, rage. Heavy rockers locate these feelings
within disquieting scenarios: Countless songs played Thursday were
about death, war, crime or self-directed violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My spirit's so cold,'' sang Rey Oropeza of Downset, a socially
conscious hardcore band that played the show's first half, which
unfolded on a temporary stage outside the stadium. Whether
expressing defiance of social authorities or focusing on inner
turmoil, heavy rock draws listeners into that chilliness, that
refusal of comfort and serenity, as a way of freeing the mind. Each
band at Tattoo the Earth worked a variation on this approach. The
artists that played the daytime outer stage, aside from the
virtuous Downset, switched off between the blend of hip-hop and
hardcore guitar bashing that has worked for Limp Bizkit and the
more glam-inflected variation on that theme practiced by Korn.
</P>
<P>
   The hardcore screamers in Hatebreed got the biggest response
from the crowd. But the melodiously gloomy Full Devil Jacket may
have shown the biggest commercial potential. On the mainstage,
heavy rock's nuanced alienation played out in more masterly hands.
Metallica's claim on the headlining spot turned the night into
friendly combat. The band that has defined monster metal since the
1980s is dealing with a serious image problem because of its battle
with Napster, the online service that allows fans to connect and
download music free. Lars Ulrich, Metallica's drummer, has
alienated many Internet-loving fans with his vehement protest
against what he (and many artists) considers Napster's abetment of
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this trauma a back injury that forced the singer James
Hetfield to sit out several dates of the group's Summer Sanitarium
tour, and the death of a fan who fell from a balcony at a July 5
concert in Baltimore, and Metallica had to be feeling some
pressure. The evening also put the band up against Slipknot, heavy
rock's newest pretender to the throne, as well as old rivals Slayer
and Sepultura and rising contenders Sevendust. Each artist raised
the event's stakes a little higher. The Brazilian band Sepultura
played old-fashioned thrash with unusually complex rhythms,
courtesy of the fine drummer, Igor Cavelera. Next came Sevendust,
an Atlanta-based outfit featuring the singer Lajon Witherspoon, who
slipped a little James Brown into his gruff and sweet delivery.
</P>
<P>
   These bands suggested how black music is turning metal on its
ear, and unlike many currently popular bands, their members were as
multicultural as their styles. These good bands still had nothing
on the mighty Slayers' purist thrash. These California-based
veterans are idolized by heavy rock specialists, having wielded
rapid-fire riffs and hellish visions for decades. ``How many people
can I kill?'' howled Tom Araya, the band's singer of legendary
manliness, in ``Holy War,'' and the band answered his question
symbolically with an unrelentingly focused set. This was a pure and
totally effective sonic attack.
</P>
<P>
   Slipknot took the exact opposite approach, with a similar
effect. The Iowa-based band is the flavor of choice among teen-age
rockers. Its highly theatrical set demonstrated why. In jump suits
and hideous masks, banging on garbage-can style drums or
manhandling their guitars, Slipknot's members were not just
unfocused. They were anti-focused, making music closer to a
Nintendo game than conventional rock. As his eight bandmates,
including a D.J., pounded away, the vocalist Corey Taylor rapped,
crooned, grunted and growled. The jumble was hard to trace, but it
obviously engaged the fans, who followed it like a round on their
Game Boys. Slipknot disregarded virtuosity, lyricism and narrative
suspense. It simply hit from all sides; the fun came in trying to
absorb the assault.
</P>
<P>
   If such disorganized multiplicity is the new paradigm, Metallica
may really be in trouble, because its artfulness is based on total
control. It shapes heavy rock's dry-ice soundscape into grand,
well-ordered tableaus. When the quartet appeared onstage to the
strains of a Western movie soundtrack, its cool was as palpable as
Clint Eastwood's. And in a two-hour set, Metallica won the
shootout. The triumph had its cost. Metallica focused on older
material, apparently heeding the fans who protested its recent
experiments with softer-edged music. Unadulterated versions of
crowd favorites like ``Fade to Black'' and ``One'' made this an
official proclamation of dominance. Kirk Hammett, the band's High
Romantic guitarist, flashed his filigree, but Metallica wanted to
present itself as a virile powerhouse, and it did, without
flinching.
</P>
<P>
   On the other leg of its tour, Metallica has been jamming with
the members of Kid Rock's band. Those loose sessions probably
aren't as satisfying as the band's herculean triumph at Tattoo the
Earth. But they might show more about Metallica's future, if it
dares mess with its invincible formula again and offer a new design
for beautiful alienation.

   LA TURBALLE, France _ Under the white tent, set high up on the
beach, six little boys held out their limbs with horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get it off! Please, quick,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it cause cancer?'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never going swimming in there again,'' said a third.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Nicol, wearing a bright green T-shirt and equipped with
paper towels and a bottle of olive oil, did her best to calm them.
``Look, it comes right off,'' she said, rubbing, oiling and rubbing
some more to take off the black stains that dotted their arms and
legs.
</P>
<P>
   Amputation, she assured them, was not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The boys did not crack a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The teams of ``green T-shirts'' at La Turballe are new this
year, one of the measures that the town has taken to help tourists
feel better about going on the beaches. The teams have sand pails,
soccer balls and rackets to distribute. They organize games for the
children. But tucked in with the other gear are the olive oil and
paper towels used to take No. 2 crude oil off when it washes up on
the sand or when swimmers run into the strands of seaweed that it
often clings to.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, over 200 miles of the Brittany coast was drenched
with thick crude oil when the tanker Erika, registered in Malta,
broke up in stormy seas 65 miles off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   A huge effort was made to clean the beaches in time for the
tourist season. But in some of the villages like La Turballe the
tarlike fuel keeps washing up. Only last week a new slick oozed
over the shoreline that stretches north from the harbor, leaving
the rocks glistening with black streaks and the sand contaminated
with gooey globs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the town's people say it almost doesn't matter, because
there are no tourists anyway. There is plenty of room to lay down a
towel at the other beaches in La Turballe. The sun shines and the
sea glistens, but only those who have houses here or prepaid
vacations have returned this year. Some of the merchants say their
business is off by as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse and Florence Gisalson say they believe they will go
bankrupt in the fall. The restaurants right on the port in La
Turballe say they are doing all right, and the fast-food
restaurants that have catered to the soldiers sent in to clean up
the beaches are having a better season than usual. But the
Gisalsons' restaurant, in an old stone house tucked behind the
port, hardly sees anyone these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually these streets are like a rock concert _ they are so
crowded,'' Gisalson said. ``Look at them now; it's noon and there
is no one here.''
</P>
<P>
   The little towns along the coast have for months been caught in
a sort of moral quandary: to speak or not to speak about their
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some have railed at the government for not moving fast enough,
for not offering the merchants tax breaks and other aid. Promises
have been made, they say, but the cash is not in hand. Others do
not want to have their towns associated with the pollution and have
chosen to keep a lower profile.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of La Turballe, Rene Leroux, has been among the most
outspoken, willingly showing journalists the damage that the Erika
has done. ``If we lied to our friends the tourists, then they would
never come back,'' he said. ``This way at least we can hold onto
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Leroux put out a pamphlet this year, marking out beaches that
would be cleaned immediately and monitored daily. He hired 50 extra
employees to act as a quick-response team under the town's own
control, and he set up the teams of green T-shirts. But halfway
through the season, he has the air of a beaten man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so tired here,'' he said. ``The season came in and we
hardly noticed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the breakup of the Erika, French officials have said they
want to strengthen international shipping regulations to make sure
that such an accident does not occur again. The Erika was an old
boat showing signs of rust and poor maintenance when it split
during a storm on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the spill, estimated at 10,000 to 12,000 tons, came from
the forward half of the boat. The stern half, which sank about five
miles from the front half and is almost 400 feet under the surface,
contains another 12,000 to 15,000 more tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of experts have begun trying to pump out the rest of the
oil in the holds, but the project is several months behind
schedule. Touring the area this month, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
promised that those who were financially hit by the spill would be
compensated.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in La Turballe believes him. Jean-Luc Fardoit,
the president of the local chamber of commerce, says many of the
merchants are ``barely sleeping these days.'' Fardoit, who owns two
shops that sell souvenirs and beach toys, cut his staff from 11 to
9 and then reduced everyone's hours by 25 percent. Still, he says,
he has plenty of time to go for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Bretons and we will not let go,'' Fardoit said. ``But
we are waiting to see how much help we get. It would have been nice
to get a few more specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil spill has not affected all the seaside towns in the same
way. Some resorts, like La Baule, just a 20-minute drive from La
Turballe, have hardly been affected. La Baule's beaches face south
rather than west, and that has made all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   But along the rockier shore lines, the picture is bleak.
</P>
<P>
   In La Turballe this week, the closed beach was something of a
tourist attraction. Visitors drove up to see what the pollution
looked like and watched soldiers in white plastic suits, red gloves
and green boots scraping the oil from the rocks with trowels. Some
of the workers complained that their suits were hot and the trowels
were hardly efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Guerin, who drives his camper here every summer from
Rennes, said he did it again this year out of loyalty. ``This is
where we come, and it wasn't a good time to abandon this town,'' he
said. ``It will be all right in a couple of years. Nature will take
over again. But it is hard to wait.''

 &HT;    EDITORIAL _ Partners in disaster
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Special Counsel John Danforth believes he has answered ``four
dark questions.'' That leaves dozens that forever may beg for
light.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, even with a staggering $10 million price tag, the
Danforth probe into the 1993 events at Mount Carmel was way too
limited to put to rest so many concerns and suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's report bolsters much of what a federal jury ruled
last week _ that the principal causes of death and destruction were
David Koresh and his well-armed, recalcitrant followers.
</P>
<P>
   They had a right and an opportunity to test the government's
charges before a jury when a warrant came to their door Feb. 28.
They chose trial by fire. They have not been exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has demonstrated that federal agents caused the inferno
that killed so many people April 19, while much evidence shows the
Davidians set one fire or several. Incendiary grenades among the
evidence made Page 1 across the country. Did they cause the fire?
No, says Danforth. They were used hours before the fire and not
where they could have caused it.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, nothing has demonstrated that FBI agents fired guns
into the compound during the April 19 tear gas siege. Danforth's
inquiry rebuts that unequivocally. U.S. District Judge Walter Smith
has yet to rule on this evidence. It appears more and more clear
that any bullets fired April 19, 1993, were vessels of suicide and
fratricide.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is a disservice to take the Danforth report and the
jury's advisory as exonerating the government. Danford shades it as
``bad acts'' vs. ``bad judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that if it takes 153 pages to exonerate the
government of bad or illegal acts, it surely might have taken a
James Michener-style epic to explain all the government missteps,
not just at the federal level but at the local level.
</P>
<P>
   To the eye of the nation and world, those sorry judgments
started with a bone-headed decision by the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms to go ahead with a raid the ATF knew was
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Those bad judgments included the FBI's forcing the issue with
tear gas and armored vehicles after a 51-day wait, as if 51 more
days, and 51 more, wouldn't have been worth every minute to end a
hostage stand-off without loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   Bad judgment: not preparing adequately for the possibility that
the compound might burn. Bad judgment: armored vehicles disturbing
the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department helped no one, certainly not itself, with
a critique of these decisions that was pure whitewash.
</P>
<P>
   The local angle
</P>
<P>
   Before this became a national story, however, bad judgments were
manifold. At the tragedy's root were local officials who took less
than seriously the claims _ later confirmed by DNA _ of sexual
abuse, little girls who would bear children for Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   He could have been arrested on these suspicions away from his
commune when he was gallivanting around Waco. The other suspicions
about the Branch Davidians _ illegal weapons, scam marriages,
welfare fraud _ could have been dealt with separately in solemn
court. Without Koresh to pump up the volume back home, this all
might have been settled peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Koresh and his cohorts had been to court once before
over a gun incident in the 1980s, and had been treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't give the system a chance to work this time.
Tragically, the system stumbled all over itself in trying to do its
work in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Bad acts, bad judgments _ and dark questions still unanswered
seven years and millions of dollars later.

   A Safe Player in the Market Embraces Risk to Save a Life  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James Stack, a leading market analyst and financial adviser
based in Whitefish, Mont., is known for taking a conservative
approach when confronted with risks. But last April 11, he threw
caution aside and risked his life to save a drowning man.
</P>
<P>
   That night, a motorboat capsized in Whitefish Lake, throwing
Randall Bruckner and Julia Cassidy into 39-degree water. Stack, who
has a home on the lake and heard their cries, jumped into his
kayak, paddled out and pulled Bruckner ashore. Others helped
Cassidy, who later died of hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission, established by
Andrew Carnegie in 1904 to recognize acts of bravery, selected
Stack, 47, as one of its Carnegie Heroes. He was among 22 Americans
and Canadians honored this year who risked their lives trying to
save others. The awards include bronze medals and $3,000 grants.
</P>
<P>
   Stack's company, Investech, emphasizes safety. His professional
caution, he said, stemmed from the rough markets of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Though he may seem less cautious once his workday is done, he
still calculates risks and returns. ``My market philosophy doesn't
interfere with everyday life,'' he said. ``When I heard their cries
I knew it was a life-and-death situation. I knew I could control my
own odds.''
</P>
<P>
   His family would like him to emphasize odds control a little
more in the future: if solo kayak rescues on frigid lakes in the
dark became a habit, he said, ``they'd shoot me.''

   Switching Careers, and Continents
</P>
<P>
   So what do you do if you're 53 and have already had a
been-there-done-that academic career? If you're George
Stephanopoulos _ no, not that George Stephanopoulos; this one,
unrelated, is a professor of chemical engineering at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology _ you switch careers and
hemispheres. He is taking a stab at turning Japan's largest
petrochemical company, Mitsubishi Chemical, into a force in the
risky but profitable world of nanochemistry, microreplication and
the like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a member of the National Academy of Engineering, I have
received the top awards that the chemical engineering profession
can give, I've written 10 books, close to 200 scientific papers,
graduated 45 Ph.D.'s,'' Stephanopoulos said earlier this month,
just before Mitsubishi Chemical officially named him its chief
technology officer. ``I had to rejuvenate myself intellectually and
professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife and two children will stay in Boston, and the
separation looms painfully. ``But they saw the gleam in my eye, and
they all said, `You've got to do this.''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, another task: a crash course in Japanese.
</P>

<P>
   So What About Mount McKinley?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Staehelin squared off against Ronald McDonald and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Staehlin says that in naming McWellness, her three-year-old
company that offers health assistance over the Web to executives on
the road, she meant no allusion to McDonald's. ``We used the name
because we had been working at McKinsey,'' she said, referring to
the consulting firm where she met her co-founder, Catharina
Maulbecker. Her own company, based in Basel, Switzerland, has won a
national prize for business innovation.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's, however, saw the name as trademark infringement and
challenged the company's effort to register it in the United
States. ``The Mc prefix is well established to be McDonald's,'' a
company spokesman said. ``We do business in 119 countries where the
trademark is known. It is directly connected with medical programs
and hospitals'' through Ronald McDonald House charities for the
families of gravely ill children.
</P>
<P>
   So, as of this month, McWellness is now GetWellness.

<P>
   Keeping Their Eyes On High-Tech Fortunes
</P>
<P>
   Americans who have grown rich in high-technology industries are
highly likely to have made plans to preserve their wealth and to
pass it along to their heirs, United States Trust Co. found in an
annual survey.
</P>
<P>
   This year's survey was limited to people who work in high-tech,
have an annual household income of at least $300,000 and a net
worth of at least $3 million _ levels that put them in the top 1
percent of all Americans in both categories.
</P>
<P>
   Just 54 of the 150 participants were 55 or older. But 89 percent
of the total said they had a will, while 75 percent had a complete
estate plan, which may include trusts; 72 percent had set aside
money for the education of their children or grandchildren; and 70
percent had a written financial and tax plan. The participants had
worked an average of 22 years in high-tech; their average age was
48.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the group was quite generous to charities, donating an
average of 6 percent of income. Americans in general give about 2
percent of their income to charity each year, with nearly half of
that going to religious organizations, according to research by the
National Center for Charitable Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Among the high-tech wealthy, the most common recipients of gifts
were human services charities; 69 percent of the respondents
reported such donations. Close behind were educational and
religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed that some people paid a fairly high price
in amassing their fortunes. All 134 respondents who had children
said that building wealth had come at some expense in their
relationship with them; 29 percent said the toll was substantial.
Of the married respondents, 27 percent said their work took a
significant toll on their relationship with their spouses. And 22
percent of all those surveyed said there was a significant adverse
effect on their health.

SPAIN PUTS U.S. IN DEEP HOLE IN THE RED CLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTANDER, Spain _ There was no positive spin to put on the day,
only the monotonous reality of the penetrating topspin strokes that
ground the United States' Davis Cup chances to near miracle odds,
if not red clay dust.
</P>
<P>
   John McEnroe could not help Todd Martin or Jan-Michael Gambill,
and it is quite possible that Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi would
not have saved McEnroe from the bad luck of the semifinal draw.
Playing at Spain, on clay, in the heat of summer, was never going
to be a day at the beach, even if the beach was only a long
forehand away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not playing chopped liver here,'' McEnroe said after his
team dropped both singles matches and fell into an 0-2 hole, with
Saturday's doubles looming as the Americans' last gasp. ``We're
playing the real deal, and these guys want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hot, as promised, but not oppressively humid. The
temporary stadium erected above the coastline of the Peninsula de
Magdelana was jammed with a crowd of an estimated 13,000, but one
not excessively raucous. Opportunities were abundant for Martin and
Gambill, but consistency is the name of the game on clay. In the
end, Albert Costa was the Road Runner who eluded Martin's grasp in
a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory before Alex Corretja played rope-a-dope and
let the aggressive Gambill punch himself out, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Spaniards, who have never won the Davis Cup, need to win
only one of the three remaining matches to reach their first world
group final in 33 years. Should they finish the job they began so
impressively Friday, they will play host to Australia next December
in Barcelona, meaning they will have played an entire Cup year
without leaving home soil, red clay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tailor-made for them,'' McEnroe said. ``If they can't
win this, they'll be winning the Davis Cup in the year 3000.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was any encouraging news for the Americans, it was that
Gambill, the 23-year-old with the two-fisted ground strokes on
either side, showed enough fire and rained enough winners to
suggest he might help them contend for their 32nd Cup title long
before the next millennium. Gambill, a quarterfinal loser to
Sampras at Wimbledon, wasn't supposed to have enough clay-court
game for a specialist of Corretja's quality. Yet after Martin lost
to Costa routinely, Gambill set upon Corretja like a cyclone,
winning the first set in 31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was playing just unbelievable tennis, just wonderful,''
said Corretja, the world's seventh-ranked player. ``He was serving
big and his returns were every time in the corner. He didn't drop
his level until maybe the middle of the second set. I can tell you
that I don't know if Sampras or Agassi would play better than
Gambill.''
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a compliment, but Gambill strikes the ball and
speaks his mind as if he intends to be a lot higher than No. 37 in
the rankings sometime soon. He firmly believed he could have won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ticked, at the world, at myself,'' he said after failing
to take advantage of several openings Corretja presented him, even
after the first set.
</P>
<P>
   Most frustrating for Gambill was an opportunity to perhaps
demoralize Corretja by getting back on serve after trailing by 1-5
in the second set. Gambill broke for 2-5, then saved two set points
for 3-5.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth game, Gambill had three break points to get back on
serve but missed, in the following order: a running backhand down
the line that was two inches long, a forehand into the net off a
very ordinary second serve and a backhand wide off a second serve
that kicked effectively wide of the ad court.
</P>
<P>
   As McEnroe said, ``The break points were there, but you give
these guys an out and you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambill would earn more chances in the third set, but Corretja
was controlling the play by then, running and sliding and whipping
his forehands cross-court like a maestro conducting a symphony. By
the fourth set, Gambill's backhand broke down and his unforced
errors, numbering 51 to Corretja's 27, piled up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his performance was enough to make McEnroe, given the
dire straits his team was in, reconsider the doubles team he will
send out Saturday against Corretja and Juan Balcells. Having
originally tabbed Chris Woodruff and Vince Spadea, McEnroe said he
would most likely switch to Gambill or Martin with Woodruff, though
it seemed unlikely that Martin could play three days in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fast starts in the first and second sets, Martin turned
in a wooden performance against Costa, putting in only 53 percent
of his first serves and committing 31 unforced errors to 13 for the
Spaniard. Martin, having had limited match play this year because
of a viral infection and a sprained ankle, looked 30 going on 50 as
he vainly tried to apply pressure to Costa.
</P>
<P>
   He did his best, McEnroe said. Both players did. But the draw
was what is was, and Sampras and Agassi stayed home and as Gambill
said when asked if the Americans needed more practice time on clay:
``We could have maybe been here a month and still had these results
because these guys are so tough on this surface.''
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   John McEnroe again expressed his frustration at the way the
Davis Cup year appears to be playing out, but said he had no plans
to quit. A U.S. Tennis Association official said earlier this week
that McEnroe was working on a year-to-year basis, but McEnroe said
Friday that he had a three-year contract. ``The one thing I'm not
going to do is say, `That's it, I quit if we lose,' what I would
have done when I was younger,'' he said. ``You know, I signed a
three-year deal and I'd like to think I could do something
positive. I'm not sure it's bad luck or I haven't made a
difference. It's hard to say right now.''

THE ID THAT HAD POLYPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George W. was getting into full stride and pulling
some pretty decent laughs. Bill Clinton was making some comic
headway explaining the cosmic unfairness of the whole Monica thing.
(``A little reward. Just a little reward. A piece of angel food
cake to recharge my batteries.'') Monica told all, once again, to
Linda Tripp. And Joe Eszterhas, sitting front row center at the
Douglas Fairbanks Theater on Monday night, listening to the words
of his ``American Rhapsody'' wash over him, expertly delivered by
seven actors, looked like a happy man.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not. Eszterhas' normal facial expression is clenched.
Even in repose, if that's the word, it looks furious. His attire _
baggy black pants and a short-sleeved black shirt open almost to
the navel _ seemed designed to dissipate the heat of a temperament
permanently on the boil.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Brown, the editor of Talk magazine, tried to take the
measure of her star guest in her opening remarks to the audience
she had summoned. She settled on the notion that to understand
Eszterhas _ one-time Rolling Stone reporter and the author of
screenplays like ``Flashdance,'' ``Basic Instinct'' and, always and
forever, ``Showgirls'' _ one must understand that he is an
idealist. ``He is not a jaded ex-hippie or a tired celebrity,'' she
said, as Eszterhas sat there, looking like a jaded ex-hippie and
tired celebrity. ``You can think of him as the id of American
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The id had drawn a fun crowd. Talk, the magazine famous for
still believing that something called synergy exists, excels at
putting together events at which e-commerce tycoons talk earnestly
with hip-hop producers. ``American Rhapsody,'' Eszterhas' personal
channeling of the Clinton years, a blend of reporting, transcribing
and fantasizing, seems tailor-made for Talk. It's Hollywood and
Washington, politics and celebrities, and this night, it was New
York, too.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking post-performance Champagne, the crowd milled in front
of the theater. There was Carolyne Roehm, gliding past Pete
Peterson, who bumped up against George Stephanopoulos, who did not
seem to be rushing over to chitchat with Peggy Noonan.
Stephanopoulos surely would have something fascinating to say about
``American Rhapsody,'' in which the presidential penis becomes a
character named Willard. But whatever Stephanopoulos was thinking,
he was not about to share it with a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Mehta, the editor in chief of Knopf, which published
``American Rhapsody,'' talked earnestly with Ed Victor, the agent
for the book. Victor, aglow in a tan linen suit and shocking black
and white spectator shoes, described the manuscript vividly. It
poured forth from Eszterhas like lava from Mount St. Helen's. ``It
blew me away,'' Victor said. Erica Jong, George Plimpton, James
Atlas, Joni Evans and Harry Evans were there, giving a literary
gloss to the affair. Suddenly the doors to the theater opened, and
Eszterhas emerged, puffing madly on a cigarette and hugging his
very pregnant wife, Naomi.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking free from photographers and scribbling scribes,
Eszterhas retreated to a corner of the theater lobby and reviewed
the evening. ``George Bush just exploded on stage,'' he said
admiringly. His own performance, limited to a brief reading, he
dismissed with a wave of his cigarette. ``I've done very few
readings,'' he said. ``It's a problem for me, because I have bad
polyps on my sinuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas wrote the book, he said, during a period of seclusion
brought on by disgust at living a too-public life. Now, the book
was starting the cycle all over again. And on top of that, polyps.
``Faulkner once referred to the writer's puny and inexhaustible
voice,'' he said. ``It's getting puny already. Now we'll see how
inexhaustible it is.''

FUNDS WATCH: A GLOSSY FUND SETS ITS DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wired and Fortune magazines are used to competing for
advertisers, circulation, staff members and attention. So why not
mutual fund dollars?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Fortune Group, a unit of Time Warner, announced a
plan to open two exchange-traded funds later this year, including
one, the Fortune e-50 Index Tracking Stock, that will mirror
Fortune's new ``e-50'' Internet index.
</P>
<P>
   The product, which trades like a stock, is similar to a mutual
fund in that it is a basket of stocks. (It is not a true tracking
stock, which reflects the performance of part of one company.)
</P>
<P>
   The fund is making a late entry into the ever-expanding universe
of technology funds, going up up against the 19-month-old, $195
million Guinness Flight Wired Index fund, which is based on a
40-stock index compiled by Wired.
</P>
<P>
   Neither publication has been what one might call modest in
describing its own stock-picking prowess. Fortune billed its e-50
as ``the ultimate Internet index'' on its cover last December and
proclaimed inside that it had ``the potential to upstage the Dow.''
That recalled the June 1998 cover of Wired, heralding the birth of
its index with ``Forget the Dow. Here comes the new economy!''
emblazoned over a picture of Godzilla on the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Vivek Shah, director of new business ventures for Fortune Group,
said the e-50 was different, because Wired includes stocks like
DaimlerChrysler in a new-economy index that Wired says should
include technologically savvy companies in all business sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The e-50 is an Internet company index,'' Shah said. `` It's
not a new-economy index.'' The Fortune product, which will trade
like a stock, will charge investors lower fees than traditional
mutual funds like Wired's, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Which fund will prove mightiest? The warm-up round goes to
Wired. Its index rose 12.4 percent this year through Thursday,
versus 1 percent for the e-50.
</P>
<P>
   But Wired will not be Fortune's only media competitor.
Exchange-traded funds like Fortune's already track technology and
Internet indexes compiled by Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall
Street Journal. And Fortune's other new offering, based on its
45-year-old Fortune 500 annual ranking of large companies, will no
doubt be measured against the tens of billions of investment fund
dollars pegged to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, maintained
by McGraw Hill, publisher of Business Week. The good news here for
Fortune is that its 500 have outperformed S&AMP;P's, not to mention the
Dow industrials, by a fair margin so far this year.  &QL;

   INVESTING-GREENBERG-BUFFETT (Undated) _ One plays the hayseed,
the other the New York tough guy, but Warren E. Buffett of Omaha
and Maurice R. Greenberg of Manhattan _ have a lot in common. Each
has built an empire that has delivered tremendous value to
shareholders. Greenberg, 75, and Buffett, nearly 70, are giants in
the same game. Though both Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway and
Greenberg's American International Group have other operations,
each is mainly in the insurance business. ``We think alike,''
Buffett said recently. ``If you showed us 10 deals, we would
probably come to pretty similar conclusions on most of them.'' That
makes all the more extraordinary this fact: For 10 years,
Greenberg's company has been the better bet for investors. By
Joseph B. Treaster.

   PESYSTEMS-HUNKAPILLER-GENOME (Foster City, Calif.) _ PE
Biosystems has emerged as the leading supplier of equipment to the
exploding genomics industry. The company controls at least 70
percent of the market for gene sequencers. It is the leading
supplier of equipment used for one of the fundamental processes in
biotechnology, the amplification and detection of DNA by polymerase
chain reaction. It is in the early lead for machines used to
analyze proteins. Competitors often refer to PE as the Microsoft of
genomics equipment, for its commanding position and its aggressive
tactics. If PE is the Microsoft, then Dr. Michael J. Hunkapiller is
the Bill Gates, a nerd at heart, who has transformed himself into a
respected, shrewd and tough businessman. By Andrew Pollack.

<P>
   INVEST-CHARTING (Undated) _ For years finance professors have
held chartists in contempt. The problem has been one of translating
chartists' visual pattern recognition into the mathematics on which
academics rely, according to a new study, in which the authors, all
academics, gauge which charting techniques work. After defining the
chart patterns mathematically, the researchers back-tested the
patterns' predictive prowess for 750 stocks over 35 years ending in
1996. One of their findings is that the patterns predict the future
direction of Nasdaq stocks better than they do exchange-listed
issues. By Mark Hurlbert.

   INVEST-REITS (Undated) _ It might not be realistic to expect a
Real Estate Investment Trust to be the next Cisco Systems, but a
significant new law is leading some money managers to suggest that
investors look to REITs as technology plays. They point to REITs
that are either actively investing in technology to improve
businesses, or that cater to the real estate needs of e-commerce
companies. These companies are poised to benefit from the federal
REIT Modernization Act of 1999, which, in January, will allow
REIT's to offer services like landscaping, parcel delivery, and
telecommunications _ to tenants and other parties. The new law is
``probably the biggest development in the REIT industry since 1986,
when REITs were permitted to both own and manage real estate,''
says Anthony R. Davis, an analyst at UBS Warburg Dillon Read. By
Sana Siwolop.

<P>
   INVEST-WHITCOMB (Undated) _ Roland P. Whitcomb, the lead manager
of the $799.1 million First American Technology &UR;  &LR; fund, says that in
a technology cycle, value investors get confused by the high
valuation of the stocks, because they underestimate the coming
innovation. Growth investors often have trouble selling, because
they take the growth rate and project it forward, he says. Whitcomb
gives each new technology cycle time to run, an inisght that has
helped the fund return 66.6 percent a year for the three years that
ended July 14, compared with 53.8 percent for its technology peers.

   CELLPHONE-NUISANCES (Undated) _ Stories abound about annoying

finally said, ``Goodbye.'' The New Jersey man also said,
``Goodbye.'' This was followed by a chorus of ``goodbyes'' from

   WENDY-MCCAW-PROFILE (Santa Barbara, Calif.) _ The recent
announcement that the local newspaper, the 145-year-old Santa

acquired by a local philanthropist was received in some circles as
a victory of community spirit over the homogenizing influence of a
distant corporate overseer. ``It has to be quality before the
bottom line,'' said Wendy P. McCaw, the buyer, who paid $100

opened a $30 million refrigerator factory in Camden, S.C. Why make
fridges in South Carolina when China is so much cheaper? Zhang
Ruimin, Haier's chief executive, said he wants to learn to compete

overseeing the Postal Service's cycling-team sponsorship in 1997
just as Lance Armstrong emerged from his bout with cancer to join
the squad. Last year, the team with its uniforms emblazoned with
the Postal Service logo was the first American squad to win the
Tour de France, a morale raiser at the post office. It also brought
the post office $10 million in revenues from other sponsors, she
said, and the association with Armstrong brings glamour to an

INSURANCE ANALYST LEAVES PAINEWEBBER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alice D. Schroeder, an insurance analyst who managed
to charm Warren Buffett and Maurice Greenberg, has left PaineWebber
to join Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who has done perhaps the most detailed and exhaustive
research of any analyst on Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway,
and Greenberg's, American International Group, left PaineWebber on
June 28. She began work at Morgan Stanley the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Schroeder nor PaineWebber would discuss her reasons for
leaving. There was no indication that it was related to the
purchase of PaineWebber by UBS, which was announced on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, no large Wall Street firm had covered Berkshire
Hathaway, which eschews the advice of investment bankers and in
whose stock there is little trading.
</P>
<P>
   But, seeking a better public understanding of Berkshire after it
had become an insurance giant with the purchase of General Re, one
of the biggest reinsurers, Buffett called Schroeder to invite her
to delve into his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear to me that she was a superior analyst, both in
her knowledge of the insurance business and in her willingness to
do the legwork to garner facts,'' Buffett said then.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who has an M.B.A. from the University of Texas, met
Buffett in New York, then flew with him to Berkshire's headquarters
in Omaha, Neb., and visited several of the company's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, she issued a report on AIG that ran to nearly
300 pages and was based on research in New York, China and several
other countries and ranged over five months.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Schroeder was named the No. 2 analyst on the
Institutional Investor magazine's All-America Research Team in
property casualty insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Before working at PaineWebber, she had been an analyst at CIBC
Oppenheimer and Dowling Partners. Schroeder, who is qualified as a
certified public accountant, also had worked at the Financial
Accounting Standards Board and at Ernst &AMP; Young, the consulting
firm. &QL;

shareholders. Though both Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway and
Greenberg's American International Group have other operations,
each is mainly in the insurance business. ``We think alike,''
Buffett said recently. ``If you showed us 10 deals, we would
probably come to pretty similar conclusions on most of them.'' That

   MIDEAST-JERUSALEM-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Jerusalem is at the heart
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an issue so complex that peace
negotiators simply put it off until now. Common sense seems to
dictate that the easiest basis for a settlement would be to share
the heritage and guarantee all groups access to the holy sites. But
for decades, achieving that kind of formula has only become harder,

   FILM-LECONTE (Paris) _ Patrice Leconte has averaged one feature

   FILM-BRITISH-DIRECTORS (Undated) _ The kitchen sink is no longer
a handy symbol for the social inequities and domestic pressures of
British life, and the ``kitchen sink'' filmmakers of the '60s have

   MUSIC-JARRE-FILM (Undated) _ Michael Beckerman says he is
rooting for Maurice Jarre to win an Oscar for his brilliant score
of ``Sunshine.'' Then, Beckerman says, he hopes Jarre gives it to
Schubert. To create the main musical theme, Jarre has played the
first phrase of the Schubert Fantasy in F Minor without notes 6-15,
then added a new expansive phrase. The Schubert fantasy is a
particularly compelling choice for ``Sunshine'' because the opening
suggests a Hungarian Gypsy origin, appropriate for the film set
over three generations of one family in Hungary.

seven existing treatments of the subject by Jacopo Robusti
Tintoretto, one of the great painters of the late Italian

   TV-COPS-RUSSIA (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ In the last two years,
St. Petersburg has become the hottest location for the hottest

The boom began in early 1998 with ``The Street of Broken

share rooms with teen-agers because vacation for them means not

SPORTS COLUMN: THE BEAR ASSESSES TIGER
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Like ships that pass in the night, Jack
Nicklaus was coming up the 18th fairway on the Old Course in the
sunshine of applause from thousands of Scots Friday as Tiger Woods
strolled out of the Royal and Ancient clubhouse shortly before
shooting 66 for a three-stroke lead halfway through the British
Open.
</P>
<P>
   More golden than bearish now at 60, Nicklaus missed his birdie
putt, tapped in and waved to the applause. With a 1-over 73 after
Thursday's 77 for 150, he missed the 36-hole cut in what will
probably be his last ``favorite event,'' golf's oldest tournament
that he had won three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking over the Swilken Bridge is very nice,'' he was saying
now, referring to when he stood and waved with his son Steve, his
caddie. ``But not on Friday afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for the golfer who won a record 18 major titles. Not with
the championship still to be decided Saturday and Sunday when
Woods, at 24, will have the opportunity to dethrone Nicklaus as the
youngest to complete the career Grand Slam. Nicklaus was 26 when he
won the 1966 British Open to go with his U.S. Open, Masters and PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the fact that Tiger is coming along doesn't bother me in
the least,'' Nicklaus said. ``I'm kind of rooting for somebody to
come along and if it's Tiger, that's fine. Or if it's somebody else
to challenge that record of 18 majors or break it, or whatever. I
think it would be good for the game of golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game of golf needs a shot in the arm constantly. It always
needs a shot in the arm. Some of the golf I've seen from this young
man has been pretty phenomenal and I think that he should get even
better. And if he does, I'm going to be the first one there to tell
him, `Well done.'''
</P>
<P>
   For all his power in his prime, Nicklaus seldom played golf as
aggressively as Woods does now. Nicklaus believed in ``playing the
way I thought it should be played _ for me.'' Meaning in keeping
with his conservative and managed manner, waiting for somebody else
to lose a tournament rather than gambling to win it on what could
be a disastrous shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not really watched Tiger play that much,'' he said,
``but every time I turn on the television set, he holes a putt. I
turned on the television set seven or eight times in the U.S. Open
and all I saw him doing was walking after a 30-footer and picking
it out of the hole. When you putt like that, the game becomes awful
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think mentally he is a very good player. But it's easy to
have a good head on your shoulders when you don't worry about
making anything from 15 feet in. You know you're going to make it,
why worry about the problems? It's like I never worried about
chipping because I never missed anything inside 10 feet anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus knows how Woods feels because at his best, he had the
same confidence, especially on pressure putts, that Woods has now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were periods of time when I was doing exactly what he
was doing,'' he said. ``Nothing matters because I'm going to knock
it in anyway. When you get that, the game becomes easy. When you're
struggling with the putter, it just goes right through the bag and
it makes every other shot difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Woods posses golf attributes that Nicklaus did not?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played enough golf with him to know what he has,''
Nicklaus said. ``I know he has a good mind. I know he drives a
ball. I think we're fairly comparable off the tee. He's longer than
I was because of equipment. He definitely has a better short game
than I had. But I think we grew up differently. I was a big kid and
he was not a big kid. A lot of kids who are slight in stature have
a very good short game because they need a very good short game,
and now he has a big game but he's not going to forget the short
game. I never had that opportunity. I'm the same size now I was at
13.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he think that some pros have mentally surrendered to Woods'
dominance?
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken that to when Arnold Palmer came along,'' he said.
``Arnold came along after Snead, Hogan and Nelson, all past their
prime, and there was a five, six, seven-year gap when not much
happened. Nobody dominated, then Arnold came along when the public
needed somebody to dominate it. Then Gary came along, then I came
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I don't think there's anybody contending. There are
a lot of very good players, don't get me wrong. I don't mean the
players today can't play golf. Vijay Singh has won two majors,
Ernie Els has won two. That would be the closest. I was playing
Arnold, who won seven; Gary nine, Lee Trevino six, Tom Watson
eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys had all learned to win major championships,'' he
continued. ``I always had somebody who knew how to win, like I knew
how to win, competing against me. Right now Tiger doesn't have
that, but he will. He's certainly not going to get off the next 15
years with a free run. There are just too many good players coming
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger is good for the game, but he has to have challengers for
the whole thing to be right. He has done some great things. He's
the new kid on the block and he's a great player and he's going to
get better. But he will have competition, too. You're finding that
a lot of good athletes gravitate to golf now, which is only going
to make it better.''

 UNDATED: mass appeal.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first stumbling block _ storage _ is being tackled on
several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Practically all portable players store music on solid state
memory chips, including Compact Flash, Smart Media cards and Sony's
Memory Sticks.
</P>
<P>
   While solid state memory chips are small, run noiselessly and
are reliable, they are also expensive and appear to be growing more
so as demand begins to outstrip supply, manufacturers say.
</P>
<P>
   One frustrated executive at an American consumer electronics
manufacturer said he had traveled to Asia in an unsuccessful search
for a company that could make and then sell the hardware components
for a digital audio player to his company for $1. The reason? Much
of the cost of a player, which is passed to consumers, is consumed
by the cost of memory.
</P>
<P>
   A digital player with adequate memory _ for at least a half-hour
of playback _ that costs less than $100 has eluded the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Most players are sold with 32 megabytes of embedded, often
called ``onboard,'' memory. A 32-megabyte memory card costs about
$100. And the rule of thumb is that a player, like Samsung's Yepp
player, requires about a megabyte of memory for every minute of
recorded MP3 music (at near-CD-quality sound).
</P>
<P>
   Adding more music requires more memory for storage, and the cost
starts to climb steeply, said Craig Rathbun, the worldwide director
of Clik technology for Iomega, maker of disk-based removable
storage devices like the popular Zip and Jaz cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-megabyte memory cards used in audio players are
``essentially $100 half-hour albums,'' Rathbun said. Iomega is
taking a different approach by adapting its Clik drives to digital
audio players so that they may use the 40-megabyte Clik disks to
store and play music.
</P>
<P>
   Clik disks are not solid state and introduce moving parts into
the players. But they are cheaper than solid state memory, Rathbun
said.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-megabyte Clik disk can cost as little as $10. They are also
rugged, Rathbun said, as he held a handful of the half-dollar-size
Clik disks, each containing a different genre of music.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the first digital player using Clik technology, the
Rave MP 2300 by Sensory Science, reached the market. Iomega
officials said seven players with built-in Clik drives by other
manufacturers _ including one by Iomega itself _ are expected to be
available before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Rio is exploring alternatives to expensive, solid-state flash
memory for storing music in its players.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Rio 600, which is the first player to seamlessly
play music encoded in the MP3 or Windows Media format, comes with
32 megabytes of memory. A more feature-laden Rio 800 is expected
later this summer, with 64 megabytes of included memory.
</P>
<P>
   Rio has also taken a novel approach to the question of expanding
the storage capabilities of its audio players. Earlier models like
the Rio 300 and Rio 500 use, as most players do, a slot in which an
expansion memory card can be inserted, boosting the player's
overall capacity to play more music. But such designs are limited,
making it difficult to add more than a 64-megabyte card to the 32
megabytes already built into the player.
</P>
<P>
   The new Rio players are designed with what its engineers call a
backpack. It is a slip-off and slip-on back that contains the
player's memory and power supply. The Rio 600, which costs $169,
comes with a backpack with 32 megabytes built in and a single AA
battery to power the unit.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 64-megabyte backpack comes with a rechargeable
battery. And Rio, in partnership with IBM, will soon release a
backpack that will house a 340-megabyte IBM Microdrive. Also in
development is a Rio backpack equipped with a new 500-megabyte
drive by DataPlay.
</P>
<P>
   While executives at S3's Rio division said they were not ready
to discuss the cost of the backpacks with the minidrives, they said
the emerging memory technology helps to make their new Rio players
``future-proof.''
</P>
<P>
   And because the disk-based storage devices spin only to retrieve
a song before playing it from small embedded memory, they do not
greatly tax battery life or make players more susceptible to
skipping when moved or bumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are turning the corner with the release of the Rio
600 and other products in the family,'' Reed said, and added that
Rio is looking beyond the youth market.
</P>
<P>
   S3's Rio division, as well as a number of other consumer
electronics companies, is also preparing to release a line of
home-based digital audio players that resemble conventional stereo
components. The newly released SongBank SL CD Memory System by
Lydstrom not only plays and records CDs, but can also convert their
content into a digital format and save iton the $800 machine's hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the ways that people listen to CD's today,''
Reed at Rio said, you can pretty much count on us to replace that
CD technology in the future with our technology.''

HONESTY WILL GET YOU NOWHERE
</HEADLINE>
  By PENELOPE GREEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The mores of the fashion industry were taken from
18th-century Versailles,'' Simon Doonan was saying. ``It's a
structure that's complicated by the fact that everyone in it is
terrified of losing advertising _ the sword of Damocles. So
fragility and fear are driving this need, these conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   We were discussing the pervasiveness of flattery in the fashion
business _ it is coin of the realm _ and its remarkable, necessary
plasticity. ``My favorite example is going backstage,'' Doonan, the
creative director of Barneys New York, said, ``and the designer
says, `Well, did you like it?' and you loathe whatever it was he or
she has done and so you say, `You've done it again!' which is a
phrase that hides a multitude of sins. Equally useful are phrases
like, `It was unbelievable!' or `It was beyond!' With those you've
enthused properly, and that makes everybody happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Richard Stengel, a Time magazine editor, published a
history of flattery, ``You're Too Kind'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster).
Citing, er, Hegel (it's that kind of book), he describes a kind of
``heroism of flattery'' in which, he writes, ``the individual had
come to understand the inherent falseness of society and that he
bravely understood that he must play to get along.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewed this way, the gassy insincerity and the unctuous
kiss-kiss that are at the heart of the fashion vernacular are like
Trojan horses of dialogue. Each ``enthuser'' is, in fact, heroic, a
wily Odysseus rather than just a shrill suck-up made tipsy with
hyperbole, like poor old Edie on ``Absolutely Fabulous.'' ``We're
not stupid,'' said Stefan Campbell, an American stylist who just
returned from his first haute couture season in Paris. ``We know
that our world is very tiny and that people move around very
quickly. So we tell these little white lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Real fashion people don't suck up. They declaim, from the height
of aesthetic authority: ``The shoe is everything!'' ``She's
genius!'' ``You're the bomb!'' Because to flatter someone means
that you get their look, that you're in on the signals being
telegraphed. In other words, flattery in fashion puffs up rather
than debases the flatterer. It confers status and legitimacy and
links the declaimer and the recipient in a kind of ``on the bus''
grooviness.
</P>
<P>
   ``An educated consumer is my best customer,'' said Jill
Kopelman, whose screenplay ``Intern,'' a roman a clef about being
an intern at a fashion magazine, is coming out this fall from Given
Films. ``That's someone who understands that `Forget Bianca and her
equine escort' means `You're looking fabulously 80's,' and that's a
compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   The flavor of these pronouncements is spiced by the times. While
the old continental accent has largely been subsumed by a younger,
more hip-hop affect _ ``Divine!'' having given way to ``That's
ill!'' _ it still pops up, thanks to the ironic place we find
ourselves in. This is why ``genius,'' ``legendary'' and
``perfection'' are once again in favor, as in, ``That bag is
genius!''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Sui, the designer, and Steven Meisel, the photographer,
whose works make frequent reference to fashion history, brought
``genius'' back into the fashion lexicon (it dates from the 1960s),
even though Sui herself now favors approbations like ``sweetums''
and ``cute-ums,'' said Paul Cavaco, who is the creative director of
Allure magazine and a fine proclaimer himself. ``I'm gagulating''
is a Cavaco-ism that translates into high praise.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion syntax favors abstractions, Dick Page, a British makeup
artist, said, citing how people in the business refer to someone,
or a part of someone, as a thing. ``We love the hair!'' ``The body
is amazing!''
</P>
<P>
   Cavaco will say fashion people aren't word people. ``I sound
like English is my third or fourth language,'' he said. But the
phrases fairly throb with detail. Kopelman cited this example:
``You see someone and you say, `Omigod, it's so 18th-century
bordello meets Tom Ford meets L.L. Bean by way of the Vault!'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, you might say that fashion folk have unique and
unparalleled linguistic skills and that their excitement for the
visual is matched only by their excitement for the verbal. These
people snack on language; they imbibe words as you would a pink
cosmopolitan, and to similar effect. They use words like Nerf
balls, catching them lightly and then batting them back off the top
of your head.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Miller, a creative consultant, whose work includes the
revamping of the Hush Puppies label, explained: ``Besides the hard
work and sheer luck, the real reason the brand became successful
again was the nonsensical sound of the name. Hush Puppies! Fashion
people could really roll those words off their tongue. They
couldn't say them fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Repetition still works, especially in print and when coupled
with huge type and lots of underlinings. ``When I was at Vogue, I
used to get these faxes from Andre,'' Cavaco said, referring to the
magazine's famously effusive editor at large, Andre Leon Talley,
``and they were always in a font that was 50 times larger than
normal, telling me about a `fabulous, fabulous, fabulous bag.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Flattery can be fuel. Nian Fish is the creative director of KCD,
the international fashion publicity and production company that
puts on shows for Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Versace. One of
Fish's jobs is to send the models out on the runway imbued with
energy and confidence. ``Models are notoriously insecure, of
course,'' she said. ``I flatter them according to their
personality. I say: `You are the hottest Brazilian girl this
season. Go!' `You are wearing the most expensive dress in the
collection. Sell it!' `You are Ralph's favorite model this season.
Believe it!' `Your eyes are brilliant. Show them!' ''
</P>
<P>
   With the women, it's all quite serious, Fish explained. ``The
guys are different,'' she said. ``You can use humor. You can say,
`Show that package!'''
</P>
<P>
   Fish is thankful the days of the supermodel are gone, for the
flattery required to run the machine took a lot out of her. ``The
diva treatment was extreme flattery, coaxing girls to get in the
lineup when they didn't want to,'' she explained. And they never
seemed to want to. ``I once had to chase a famous supermodel down
42nd Street,'' Fish recalled. ``I had to pull her out of a cab,
tell her she was the star of the show _ the No. 1 star of the show
_ and we needed her. I had to beg her. The whole thing about the
old supermodels is they got so much attention through flattery, and
it raised the bar. What they needed was so increased it turned them
into caricatures of divas.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, flattery is kind. Kennedy Fraser, who
wrote about fashion for The New Yorker in the 1970's and early
80's, saw poignancy instead of pragmatism. ``People know that their
businesses could just crash through the floor,'' she said the other
day, ``and so you get this sort of whistling in the dark. It's a
harsh business, and so people do whatever they can for each other
to somehow cushion themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why if you wander onto a fashion shoot where Dick Page
is working, you might hear him sum up the day's work as a ``pageant
of joy!''

<P>
   Call it bad luck, bad timing, bad judgment or all of the above:
Aetna, an old-line insurance company, transformed itself into a
hard-charging, tightly run health-care company four years ago, just
in time to become a main target of the backlash against managed
care, especially the kind Aetna was selling.
</P>
<P>
   This week the company was still struggling with the
consequences. Putting a brave face on it, William H. Donaldson,
chairman and chief executive since a management shake-up in
February, hailed ``a turnaround opportunity'' to put Aetna's
health-care business ``on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from investors annoyed at its stock price, Aetna
agreed on Thursday to sell its lucrative financial-services and
international business to ING Group of Amsterdam, the Netherlands,
for $5 billion in cash. Donaldson said the new, slimmed-down Aetna,
still the United States' biggest health insurer, would ``redefine
the company's business model.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the 19.5 million Americans covered by Aetna are in
strict health-maintenance organizations, which generally save money
by requiring patients to get permission from a primary-care doctor
before seeing a specialist or taking a test.
</P>
<P>
   But the market has changed. ``Our world is different than it was
10 years ago,'' said Dr. Michael A. Stocker, president and chief
executive of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. ``In a tight labor
market, employees are not happy about more cost-sharing. This is a
luxurious time for luxurious products.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-cost HMOs were a big success for U.S. Healthcare, Aetna's
core unit, into the early 1990s, when employers were shocked by
sharply rising health costs, and holding onto employees was not a
big concern.
</P>
<P>
   But as the economy roared and health-care inflation slowed in
the mid-1990s, insurers like Cigna, UnitedHealth Group and
Wellpoint Health Networks and other Blue Cross companies catered to
customers who demanded more choice of doctors and fewer
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Managing health care ``clearly is changing into a much more
complicated business that requires absolute focus on the
fundamentals,'' said H. Edward Hanway, president and chief
executive of Cigna. ``It is not any different for any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Slow to change, Aetna is now playing catch-up, trying to remake
itself as a kinder, gentler company that causes fewer hassles for
consumers, doctors and hospitals. Donaldson said it would soon
offer new types of health coverage to meet consumer demand for
``more flexibility and choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale to ING came on the heels of an embarrassing warning by
Aetna on Tuesday that it had fallen short of expected
second-quarter earnings. The cause, it said, was
higher-than-expected medical costs in its core HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the warning meant Aetna was not paying enough
attention to the most important and difficult task in managed care:
anticipating future costs and setting rates to cover bills that
often do not show up until months later.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are slow to forgive slip-ups that undermine earnings.
Aetna shares dropped 20 percent this week, closing at $57.25, even
though the ING deal included a payout of $35 for each Aetna share
plus one share of a new Aetna Inc. Analysts said other managed-care
companies did not share Aetna's special problems. But except for
Wellpoint, health-care stocks lost ground this week.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Aetna would have to raise its rates 13 percent to
14 percent next year, at a time when competitors may be raising
premiums by only 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson added that the new, more flexible coverage would be
priced accordingly, indicating that rates would be higher for the
new types of coverage than for the company's more restrictive HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with being kinder and gentler,'' said
Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health-care analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, ``but they must charge corporate America for that
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting up the problems Aetna faces now, Donaldson's predecessor
as chairman and chief executive, Richard L. Huber, spent $11
billion on a three-year buying spree. He scooped up three big
managed-care companies: U.S. Healthcare in 1996, Nylcare and
Prudential Health Care in 1998. Aetna is still working on having
them integrated into its information systems and culture.
</P>
<P>
   The latest and most problematical deal was the purchase of
Prudential Health, an enormous money-loser. Investors hope to learn
early next month, when Aetna reports on second-quarter earnings,
whether the Prudential unit is still on track to reach break-even
this winter, despite its recent rising medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out for a turnaround at Prudential, because
deal-sweetening postpurchase paybacks to Aetna from the seller,
Prudential Life Insurance Co. of America, will end next year.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it will have more to say about Prudential and
other murky questions, including its latest membership numbers,
when it formally reports on earnings on Aug. 4.

</P>
<P>
   With the mergers, Aetna became the biggest health insurer in New
York and New Jersey and among the top three in Pennsylvania,
Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio and Texas. When it
bought Nylcare for $1.1 billion, it had so many Texas members that
it was forced to sell health plans with 460,000 members to Texas
Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Blue Cross paid $420 million for the
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The health-care roster included 676,000 people in Medicare HMOs,
which will drop to 320,000 next year when it shuts Medicare health
plans in 11 states. Donaldson has said some of the plans are
``egregiously'' unprofitable. Suggesting further shrinkage in the
membership rolls, Donaldson also made it clear that Aetna plans to
discontinue other unprofitable lines in some markets.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of the company started in 1995, when Aetna
Life and Casualty, as it was then called, sold its property and
casualty business for $4.1 billion to Travelers and bought an HMO
company, U.S. Healthcare, for a price that, in hindsight, is widely
deemed excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street analysts say the price, $9 billion, was as much
as three times what the company was worth. ``They got taken,'' said
Todd Richter, an analyst at Banc of America Securities. Leonard
Abramson, the founder of U.S. Healthcare, ``got the best deal ever
done in the history of deals,'' Richter said.
</P>
<P>
   Abramson, now 67, resigned from the Aetna board last month.
Under the 1996 deal, he still gets $3 million a year as a
consultant and is due $10 million more when that contract ends next
summer. ``There were contracts for his relatives and employees, a
$25 million airplane and gas money for the plane,'' Richter added.
Abramson did not respond to requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna, said the price paid for
U.S. Healthcare was only ``a moderate premium'' above the HMO's
stock. But analysts recall that managed-care stocks soared after
Aetna maladroitly said it was planning to buy an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. Healthcare had what we were looking for,'' Oberdorf said,
``information-systems expertise, management of the stronger forms
of managed care, a strong presence in several key markets, and a
model that could be replicated.''
</P>
<P>
   But replicating the tightly disciplined U.S. Healthcare model
infuriated many doctors who were used to the more relaxed ways of
the old Aetna. The U.S. Healthcare team insisted that doctors
accept low-paying HMO customers or give up all their Aetna
patients. Doctors were paid a flat monthly fee called capitation
for HMO members, which put them at risk when patients had expensive
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Huber minced no words in confronting critics, and soon Aetna was
fighting off lawsuits around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving away the store, Donaldson has tried to repair
relations with the public and physicians. He announced that
capitation would be dropped in several states for individual
doctors and small group practices, who would be paid with the
traditional fees for service.
</P>
<P>
   Most senior officials from U.S. Healthcare who took over Aetna
after the merger have since been pushed out. Aetna is seeking a new
health-care chief _ no easy task considering the challenges.
</P>
<P>
   James H. Dickerson, now president of Caremark Rx Inc., a
pharmacy managed-care company, amused analysts with an
all-too-realistic joke in 1997, when he moved from U.S. Healthcare
to Aetna as chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   As Dickerson told it, a new finance chief found three envelopes
in his desk ``to be opened in time of trouble.'' As trouble
arrived, he opened the first envelope and read, ``Blame your
predecessor.'' The second message was ``Blame industry
conditions.'' The third was ``Prepare three envelopes.''
</P>
<P>
   The tale was timely for Dickerson. He was shown the door a few
weeks later.

TURNING BROADBAND INTO A COMMODITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Enron, the Houston-based utility and energy giant, last week
announced a 20-year agreement with Blockbuster to deliver movies on
demand into homes, as a digitized video stream over fiber optic
lines, including the thousands of miles installed by Enron itself.
</P>
<P>
   Enron faces tough competition from the current pay-per-view
offerings by companies like AT&AMP;T and Time Warner. But Enron
executives say the pay-per-view market is limited by inflexible
show times and the inability to pause, stop or rewind.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this fall, Enron and Blockbuster, a unit of Viacom,
expect to offer about 500 movies to homes with high-speed digital
subscriber lines, or DSLs, and there are plans to expand to 7,000
movies and other entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Enron's president and chief operating officer, Jeffrey Skilling,
has helped guide the company as it has applied skills learned in
marketing natural gas to the sale of electricity and, more
recently, Internet bandwidth. He was interviewed by phone from
Enron's headquarters in Houston. Following are excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   _ By JULIE DUNN
</P>
<P>
   Q. What areas will receive movies first and what will be the
price?
</P>
<P>
   A. We're going to look at where there are already good DSL
connections in place, look at Blockbuster's systems, and try to
find a match. We expect to focus first on major metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   They'll probably cost around $5. Blockbuster is going to be
doing the work to figure out exact prices. It's essentially going
to be an online VCR:; you can control playback, rewind. You'll view
the movies the same way as the videotape that you rented from a
Blockbuster store.
</P>
<P>
   And once the mechanics are in place to stream video, any video
signal can be streamed across the equipment: concerts, video games,
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What if consumers would rather receive their movies over
cable?
</P>
<P>
   A. We're the long-haul component of the network; we're really
agnostic about the last-mile solution. We're the Interstate; once
you get off, there are all sorts of local routes, like cable, that
you can take.
</P>
<P>
   I see a very yin-and-yang relationship between cable and DSL
It's a nice fit.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there enough miles of fiber optic lines in place, with
broad enough coverage, to make your plans practical?
</P>
<P>
   A. 14,000 miles. All of North America. Europe will be completed
within the next month. The Pacific Rim early next year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, we're also installing very sophisticated switching
stations into other fiber networks. We will be able to distribute
across any fiber to anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   We've invested $600 million to date, but we're just starting a
very aggressive program. Enron will be investing at least $600
million a year to build this network.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will sales and trading of Internet bandwidth ever become as
smooth as for other commodities?
</P>
<P>
   A. We're working with a number of players to develop standards.
Once you have standards, you can start to define a commodity.
You'll have set qualities, specs, a standard unit.
</P>
<P>
   We expect to see a market for bandwidth much like electricity
and gas. We're already transacting in it; we've made 75
standardized bandwidth transactions.
</P>
<P>
   This market is really starting to take off.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It's estimated that 4 percent of American households
currently have DSL capabilities. Most of your market so far has
been corporate. How profitable has that been, and where do you see
the market for household service heading?
</P>
<P>
   A. We're really just in the process of installing, and it's
mostly geared toward entertainment, video streaming. Once you have
entertainment products coming over broadband, I would expect
explosive growth of DSL interconnections in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Up to this point, profits have been modest. But you can imagine
all the applications that are coming down the pipeline right now _
with the click of your mouse, having a person on your screen and
actually interacting with them. Virtually no Web sites have this
right now. I think one day all existing Web sites will have video.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the current Internet infrastructure is that
it's a rocky road. You really need to have this fiber network
installed. That's what we're trying to do.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ George W. Bush left Yale University in the spring of
1968 with a diploma in hand, but no plans on what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   So for five years, not unlike many young men his age, he
drifted.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in three states, had at least seven apartments and at
least that many girlfriends, held three full-time jobs _ one in
business, one in politics and one in public service _ and learned
to fly fighter jets with the Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who, the minute they get out of college,
know exactly what they want to do,'' Bush said in a recent
interview about what he calls his nomadic years. ``I did not. And
it didn't bother me. That's just the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   These youthful years, in which the candidate concedes he was
trying to find himself, also contain the gray areas of his
biography: periods of unemployment and a hiatus of at least six
months in his National Guard obligations while he worked on a
political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This was also a period in which Bush has seemed to acknowledge
having tried drugs. Although he has steadfastly refused to answer
directly whether he used marijuana, cocaine or other illegal drugs,
he said last August that he could have passed a 15-year FBI
background check when his father became president, apparently
ruling out drug use since 1974, but not before then.
</P>
<P>
   Of those preceding years, he stood on an earlier answer: ``When
I was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   But in dozens of interviews conducted over several months,
friends, former girlfriends, neighbors and roommates said they did
not recall seeing any signs of drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the interviews and an examination of National Guard
records create a complicated and sometimes contradictory portrait
of Bush at that time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sometimes seemed to inhabit two distinctly different social
worlds, joining poolside parties on some nights and attending
formal country club dances on others.
</P>
<P>
   He spent more than a year learning to fly supersonic military
jets, becoming, by most accounts, among the best in his squadron.
Yet he gave up flying _ and failed to show up for alternative
military duty as he had promised _ for months on end to work on the
hopeless campaign of a political neophyte running against one of
the most powerful men on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   He counted among his friends people who today say they smoked
marijuana back then, and acquaintances say they saw him at a
popular night club where pot was sometimes smoked on the premises.
(Bush says he does not recall going there.) Yet dozens of people
who knew him well described him as a conservative young man who
preferred to party with beer. These friends professed to be utterly
baffled by the questions of drug use that have cropped up during
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He went for months without a steady job, and the jobs he held
all came from associates of his father. And he seemed to inhabit a
series of cheaper, less desirable apartments in Houston, a city
that was beginning to boom on oil money. Yet friends and
acquaintances recalled Bush as a stable, outgoing, hard-working,
unpretentious, idealistic young man who cherished his family and
was simply trying to figure out how to make his own way in the
world, something he would do a few years later as he started his
own business and ran for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Just before leaving Yale, Bush was accepted into the Texas Air
National Guard, thanks largely to the prominence of his family.
After a summer of basic training, he spent two years on active duty
learning to fly, first in Georgia and later at Ellington Air Force
Base, near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Munson, who met him at a poolside rice-and-beans party she
held in 1970 and dated him off and on for several years, recalled
that he was very good at arguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was conservative, and he hung around with people who were
more liberal,'' Munson said. ``Most of George's friends were the
type who would sit on the floor with torn jeans and T-shirts. They
were people who were well educated and interested in making the
world better.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman who dated Bush at the time remembered him as
``very nice, very straight. There was a little tension between the
two of us. I was `little miss liberal.' He was more conventional
than people I knew.'' The woman, a former beauty queen who is now a
lawyer living outside Texas, asked that her name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of counterculture stuff going on,'' she said,
but ``I've been mystified by the rumors about drugs. He wasn't
using drugs. I thought he was about the straightest person I knew.
He was straight in a refreshing way. He had a very good sense of
humor. He had an edge, an energy, charisma. He could be wild and go
to a party and drink a lot, but he was a very conventional college
guy. He could have been a college guy from the early '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Gow, a colleague of Bush's father, who hired young
George W. in early 1971 to work at his agricultural and
horticultural conglomerate, Stratford of Houston, remembered him as
``a presentable, attractive young college student.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard all this about a wild youth, but I never saw it,''
he said. ``He was wearing a Brooks Brothers suit. He showed up on
time and worked well past five, as we all did.'' Bush was assigned
to research small nurseries that Gow hoped to acquire, a job that
occasionally took him to Central America. His new boss had been an
executive at the elder Bush's Zapata Oil Co. and a guest at the
Bush home over the years. He gave his young employee a friendly
ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``George liked to talk,'' Gow said. ``He was searching for what
to do. He was constantly wanting to talk about what to do with his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston itself was poised for a boom. The 1970s would bring 200
corporations and a flood of newcomers that reached 6,000 a month.
As Houston expanded to cover 450 square miles, anything but zoning
and mass transit seemed possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big change from what I knew in New England,'' Gow
recalled. ``One time, possibly at the Bushes', I went to a dinner
party where one man was talking about walking on the moon. Another
transplanted hearts. Another was digging for gold in Guyana. George
and I were talking about drilling for oil at the bottom of the
ocean. My father thought everybody in Texas must be mad.''
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam continued to rage. But to the affluent of
Houston, it could seem far away. ``There was only one country they
were concerned about,'' observed Bob Roy, who supplied fine wines
to Houston's country clubs. ``That country was France.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the raw southwestern edge of Houston in the early 1970s, just
after the glittering Galleria shopping complex opened, the Chateau
Dijon apartments were the place to live if you were young,
ambitious and well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   The complex on Beverly Hill street included a mock French
chateau and a web of 300 semitropical garden apartments connected
by walkways and set among oak trees and swimming pools. One tenant
rented an extra apartment for his wine collection. Another, an
inventor, used his apartment as a lab.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush called it home.
</P>
<P>
   The developer built the Chateau Dijon to be beautiful and
comfortable and hired Mildred Alexander, a formidable widow with
high-society credentials, as the manager who could keep it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew everybody's family,'' recalled Robert Sakowitz, the
department store heir. ``If you made too much noise, she'd let you
know. It was a bit like a dormitory; it had that kind of feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   John W. Link, who lived in the apartments after law school,
said, ``You could literally have a whole social life without going
outside the Chateau Dijon. You would date different people, and
there were groups inside of groups. The guys would have contests:
This week, we'll date from only this side of the street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston was on the edge of the sexual revolution,'' Link
recalled. ``It got here, but it didn't quite get here. We were not
L.A., not New York. We were all young, trying to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Former neighbors at the Chateau remembered the youthful Bush as
a ``regular guy'' who did not try to capitalize on his family name.
But the Bush name was hard to miss. In the fall of 1970, his father
ran for the Senate against the father of another Chateau resident,
Lloyd M. Bentsen III, a member of a powerful and wealthy Texas
family. Bush worked in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Bush banners stretched across the street,'' remembered
Louis Atlas, a neighbor. ``We had banners on our cars. The girls
wore Bush scarves.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bush smiled as he recalled his days at the
Chateau Dijon. ``I'm a person who makes friends easily,'' he said.
``It didn't matter whether I'd grown up there and gone to the
University of Texas. There were University of Texas people there
and a lot of other people. My wife-to-be was living in the
apartments, although I didn't know her. She was at the other end _I
was at the sedate end, of course. But we had fun. We had a lot of
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us had jobs,'' he added. ``It wasn't a bunch of people
hanging around.'' He didn't remember attending the banana daiquiri
parties for which two of his friends were famous. ``That was a
little sophisticated for me,'' he said. ``I might have been more
willing to drink beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the residents of the Chateau, including Bush, belonged
to a social club that was a far cry from beer parties in someone's
apartment. It was the Master's Club, an elite group of about 100
bachelors that held formal dances at local country clubs, allowing
its members to keep a toehold in the comfortable, exclusive world
in which most of them were raised.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Woodson, the club's organizer and now a Houston real estate
executive, got the idea for the name from the golf tournament. The
club's parties, he said, offered ``a controlled atmosphere. You
knew who was dancing next to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Munson remembers the less formal side of the future
presidential candidate, the side that cared little about his
appearance, for example. ``George would wear his father's suit
coats when he'd throw them away,'' Munson said. ``They were
obviously his father's suit coats. George wasn't as tall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``George was interested in people,'' Munson said. ``He seemed to
like to sit around and talk about serious things in a fun way. You
didn't get that with most of the guys there. He knew he wanted to
own a baseball team, and he wanted to do politics,'' she said. ``He
wasn't sure how he was going to get to those goals.'
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After a year of work at Stratford, Bush quit his job in the fall
of 1971 and was unemployed for the next five or six months. In an
interview, he said he spent the time flying with the Air National
Guard. He was 25. His father had given up his seat in Congress and
was living with his mother in New York, serving the Nixon
administration as its U.N. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   But according to his parents, there was never any concern about
what young George was doing with his life.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, former President Bush and his wife,
Barbara, were both asked whether they had worried about their son's
nomadic period. Both dismissed the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't aimless,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``I don't know why they
say that.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``We never worried about it. That's sort of a
fiction-ary thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush echoed the thought. ``I think they must have had
pretty good confidence in their ability to raise children,'' he
said, ``plus they had other children to worry about, too. A
teenager is a heck of a lot harder to raise than a guy who has just
gotten out of college.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he did not ask them for financial support. ``I was
supporting myself,'' he said. ``I wasn't calling them saying, `Hey,
I'm out of money again,' or `Help!' I was making a living.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that hard to get along financially if you don't have
a lot of desires,'' he added, ``and I wasn't spending a lot of
money. I think my friends will tell you I'm a frugal person. I was
not living it up big time.''
</P>
<P>
   By September 1971, Bush had moved from the Chateau Dijon to an
unfurnished one-bedroom garage apartment at 2039{ South Blvd., an
elegant neighborhood near Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Thornton, whose widowed mother, Georgia Corbett, rented
the main house at 2039 South Blvd., said her mother, who was 75
then, liked to sit out on her patio and would banter with Bush, who
``had to walk down her driveway to get to his place.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton also recalled her mother's saying: ``He doesn't seem
lonesome, but you never see him with groups or other people. He's
always alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though his parents profess to have had little concern at
the time, one of his father's friends came forward in May 1972 to
offer him a job. Jimmy Allison, a former newspaper publisher in
Midland, Texas, who had served as the elder Bush's political
adviser, recruited Bush to go to Alabama to join the Senate
campaign of Winton M. Blount, a Republican novice running against a
powerful Democratic incumbent, John J. Sparkman.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Bush described Allison, now dead, as ``an
older figure who served as a mentor in a way, a wonderful friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount, a millionaire contractor known throughout Alabama as
Red, had served three years as President Nixon's postmaster general
but had never run for elective office. After he announced his
intention to run, a newspaper columnist remarked that Blount must
have decided ``it's as good a time as any to go over Niagara in a
barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   Nee Bear, who dated Bush at the time, said she was struck by how
hard Bush worked for Blount.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be a hands-on guy,'' remembered Bear, who first
met Bush while working on the campaign. ``He put bumper stickers on
in the parking lot, and believe me, that is the pits. At that time
in Alabama, people would spit on you if you were a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay Blount Miles, who worked in the office for her father's
campaign, remembered Bush as ``funny and fun to be around. He was
good at keeping the office up. He worked as part of the team. I
never felt he was somebody from the outside coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was an uphill battle. George C. Wallace heaped scorn on
Blount for living in a Montgomery mansion with, as Wallace
exaggerated it, 26 bathrooms. Even Nixon, a fellow Republican, did
not help for fear of angering the powerful Sparkman, even though he
was a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Nixon did not support me,'' Blount recalled.
``Sparkman was a leading senator, and the president needed his
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who monitored the polls, kept the bad news to himself. Not
until Election Day did he warn Devere Mclennan, who worked for him
and shared an apartment with him, what to expect. ``George
explained to me we weren't going to win,'' said Mclennan, who was
expecting a victory.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview 28 years later, Bush remembered the numbers.
``We all teamed together and helped Red get about 36 percent of the
vote,'' he said with a short laugh, ''in spite of the fact that
Nixon had gotten 72 percent of the vote. The ticket-splitting was
phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Bush went to work on the campaign he was still
obligated to serve in the National Guard, and accordingly he sought
a transfer to Alabama. His original request, to serve with the
9921st Air Reserve Squadron in Montgomery, was rejected because the
unit would not meet his military obligation. He requested another
assignment in July, and the Texas Air National Guard recommended
letting him serve with another Montgomery group, the 187th Tactical
Recon Group, during September, October and November 1972.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 15, 1972, the head of personnel for that unit wrote:
``Lieutenant Bush should report to Lt. Col. William Turnipseed,
DCO, to perform equivalent training.''
</P>
<P>
   Controvery over Bush's military service arose in May when The
Boston Globe quoted Turnipseed, who retired as a general, as saying
Bush never appeared for duty.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, the general took a tiny step back,
saying, ``I don't think he did _ but I wouldn't stake my life on
it. I think I would have remembered him. The chances are 99 percent
he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bush disagreed. ``I was there. I know this guy
was quoted as saying I wasn't, but I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily Marks, who worked in the Blount campaign and dated Bush,
said she recalls that he returned to Montgomery after the election
to serve with the Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   National Guard records provided by the Guard and by the Bush
campaign indicate he did serve on Nov. 29, 1972, after the
election. These records also show a gap in service from that time
to the previous May. Bush says he made up for the lost time in
subsequent months, and guard records show he received credit for
having performed all the required service.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Back in Houston, Bush went to live in a four-unit apartment at
2910 Westheimer, a busy east-west artery. His downstairs neighbor,
a florist, had a dog and refused to let the landlord spray
pesticides, Munson recalled, and ``the roaches were just
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nee Bear agreed: ``It was little and dumpy, and there were a lot
of bugs. It wasn't a nice place. He drove a white Cutlass, dirty
laundry, tennis shoes, and everything else in the back of his car _
just like a guy. No Gucci loafers or things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about other women in Bush's life at the time, Bear said:
``Not that summer _ well, I don't know. I spent a good deal of time
with him. Mr. Lothario I never got the idea that he was. Do you get
the impression he's a big romantic? I don't. He never was wolfish.
He was a decent guy. He would never be a kiss-and-tell guy,
never.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1973, Bush went to work for a Houston inner-city
youth program, Professionals United for Leadership for Youth, set
up by the late John L. White, a former pro football player, and
another friend of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``John had a vision of matching off-season athletes with city
kids in the Third Ward, and he wanted me to come work with him,''
Bush said. ``It was 27 years ago, so I don't remember the exact
incident where John and I met each other, but I went down, and it
was a great experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming from the west side of town, and this was in the
inner city. I saw a lot of tragedy, and I saw a lot of goodness. I
saw people who really cared about kids. There are some success
stories out of that program, and there are some horrible failures,
including this one little boy whom he and I had a very close
attachment to, named Jimmy Dean, who's dead, shot on the streets of
Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Bear recalled that Bush ``was trying to get a lot of the
baseball players from the Astros and professional athletes to come
there and show kids there was a way out. He spent time and energy
on those children. He wasn't a dilettante who comes in and says,
`This will look good on my resume.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bear said she never went to a nightclub with Bush. ``We went to
the VFW dance hall in Navasota, Texas, where you saw little old
ladies dancing with each other in their housedresses and listened
to Bob Wills and the Texas Troubadours. He loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during this time that Bush applied to Harvard Business
School, a move for which he now thanks White. ``A friend of mine
sent me the application, and I really didn't seem to be that
interested,'' Bush said. ``And his attitude was: `Well, it's a
great challenge, and you ought to try it.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I filled out the application. I don't remember all of it,
but I got in, and I wasn't really that excited about going. I think
if you look at my full life, I have never been a person _ I haven't
had a game plan. I could put it in the perspective of this race:
I've never said, `Gosh, I'll do this in high school, and then this
will lead to that, and I'll end up being president.' Or, `I will go
to Harvard Business School so I can be president.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is, I don't know what I'm going to do
next, and it doesn't bother me. I do know I'm going to be the
president, at least I think I am. We're about to find out in about
four months. But I don't know what's after that. I truly don't.''

of the presidential candidates. The next installment will look at
George W. Bush's entry into politics.) (ART ADV: Photo NYT19 is

 By JO THOMAS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ George W. Bush left Yale University in the spring of
1968 with a diploma in hand, but no plans on what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   So for five years, not unlike many young men his age, he
drifted.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in three states, had at least seven apartments and at
least that many girlfriends, held three full-time jobs _ one in
business, one in politics and one in public service _ and learned
to fly fighter jets with the Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who, the minute they get out of college,
know exactly what they want to do,'' Bush said in a recent
interview about what he calls his nomadic years. ``I did not. And
it didn't bother me. That's just the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   These youthful years, in which the candidate concedes he was
trying to find himself, also contain the gray areas of his
biography: periods of unemployment and a hiatus of at least six
months in his National Guard obligations while he worked on a
political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This was also a period in which Bush has seemed to acknowledge
having tried drugs. Although he has steadfastly refused to answer
directly whether he used marijuana, cocaine or other illegal drugs,
he said last August that he could have passed a 15-year FBI
background check when his father became president, apparently
ruling out drug use since 1974, but not before then.
</P>
<P>
   Of those preceding years, he stood on an earlier answer: ``When
I was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   But in dozens of interviews conducted over several months,
friends, former girlfriends, neighbors and roommates said they did
not recall seeing any signs of drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sometimes seemed to inhabit two distinctly different social
worlds, joining poolside parties on some nights and attending
formal country club dances on others.
</P>
<P>
   He spent more than a year learning to fly supersonic military
jets, becoming, by most accounts, among the best in his squadron.
Yet he gave up flying _ and failed to show up for alternative
military duty as he had promised _ for months on end to work on a
hopeless political campaign in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   He counted among his friends people who today say they smoked
marijuana back then, and acquaintances say they saw him at a
popular night club where pot was sometimes smoked on the premises.
(Bush says he does not recall going there.) Yet dozens of people
who knew him well described him as a conservative young man who
preferred to party with beer. These friends professed to be utterly
baffled by the questions of drug use that have cropped up during
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He went for months without a steady job, and the jobs he held
all came from associates of his father. And he seemed to inhabit a
series of cheaper, less desirable apartments in Houston. Yet
friends and acquaintances recalled Bush as a stable, outgoing,
hard-working, unpretentious, idealistic young man who cherished his
family and was simply trying to figure out how to make his own way
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Just before leaving Yale, Bush was accepted into the Texas Air
National Guard, thanks largely to the prominence of his family.
After a summer of basic training, he spent two years on active duty
learning to fly, first in Georgia and later at Ellington Air Force
Base, near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Munson, who met him at a poolside rice-and-beans party she
held in 1970 and dated him off and on for several years, recalled
that he was very good at arguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was conservative, and he hung around with people who were
more liberal,'' Munson said. ``Most of George's friends were the
type who would sit on the floor with torn jeans and T-shirts. They
were people who were well educated and interested in making the
world better.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman who dated Bush at the time remembered him as
``very nice, very straight. There was a little tension between the
two of us. I was `little miss liberal.' He was more conventional
than people I knew.'' The woman, a former beauty queen who is now a
lawyer living outside Texas, asked that her name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of counterculture stuff going on,'' she said,
but ``I've been mystified by the rumors about drugs. He wasn't
using drugs. I thought he was about the straightest person I knew.
He was straight in a refreshing way. He had a very good sense of
humor. He had an edge, an energy, charisma. He could be wild and go
to a party and drink a lot, but he was a very conventional college
guy. He could have been a college guy from the early '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Gow, a colleague of Bush's father, who hired young
George W. in early 1971 to work at his agricultural and
horticultural conglomerate, Stratford of Houston, remembered him as
``a presentable, attractive young college student.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard all this about a wild youth, but I never saw it,''
he said. ``He was wearing a Brooks Brothers suit. He showed up on
time and worked well past five, as we all did.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Munson remembers the less formal side of the future
presidential candidate, the side that cared little about his
appearance, for example. ``George would wear his father's suit
coats when he'd throw them away,'' Munson said. ``They were
obviously his father's suit coats. George wasn't as tall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``George was interested in people,'' Munson said. ``He seemed to
like to sit around and talk about serious things in a fun way. You
didn't get that with most of the guys there. He knew he wanted to
own a baseball team, and he wanted to do politics,'' she said. ``He
wasn't sure how he was going to get to those goals.'
</P>
<P>
   According to his parents, there was never any concern about what
young George was doing with his life.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, former President Bush and his wife,
Barbara, were both asked whether they had worried about their son's
nomadic period. Both dismissed the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't aimless,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``I don't know why they
say that.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``We never worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush said that he never asked his parents for financial
support. ``I was supporting myself,'' he said. ``I wasn't calling
them saying, `Hey, I'm out of money again,' or `Help!' I was making
a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about other women in Bush's life at the time, Nee Bear,
who dated Bush during those years, said: ``Mr. Lothario I never got
the idea that he was. Do you get the impression he's a big
romantic? I don't. He never was wolfish. He was a decent guy. He
would never be a kiss-and-tell guy, never.''
</P>
<P>
   Bear said she never went to a nightclub with Bush. ``We went to
the VFW dance hall in Navasota, Texas, where you saw little old
ladies dancing with each other in their housedresses and listened
to Bob Wills and the Texas Troubadours. He loved it.''
</P>
<P>

School, a move for which he now thanks White. ``A friend of mine
sent me the application, and I really didn't seem to be that

(For release on Sunday, July 23) 
 By DOUGLAS CENTURY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a hot July night, the Bowery Ballroom on the Lower
East Side was packed with lager-sipping hipsters waiting for the
arrival of rock's next big thing. She was an hour late, but when
she bounded onto the stage in a floor-length red suede skirt, a
white tank top and gold hoop earrings, the crowd chanted her name:
``Ki-na! Ki-na!''
</P>
<P>
   It was still a full week before the release of Kina's debut
album, but many already had learned the words to her songs. They
waved hands overhead and mouthed along as she belted the lyrics to
``Girl From the Gutter,'' an ``I told you I was gonna be a star''
anthem that sounds like Alanis Morisette as sung by Tina Turner.
``I hope your hell is filled with magazines,'' Kina sings to
doubting former friends. ``And on every page you see a big picture
of me.''
</P>
<P>
   She has the boundless, often angry energy of a young Turner, and
the same never-ending legs, planted wide in a prizefighter's
stance. All right, she doesn't do the wigs. She wears her hair in a
blond-dyed Afro. But Kina does like skintight red leather pants and
stiletto heels.
</P>
<P>
   A gut-bucket soul singer with the attitude and style of a rock
star, she is the latest of a recent wave of African-American women
to break from the rigid formula of contemporary R&AMP;B. They're losing
the glitzy hair and the nail extensions, the minks and the diamond
baguettes, the silky smooth vocals and the often vapid lyrics that
have been the hallmarks of R&AMP;B acts like Toni Braxton and Destiny's
Child, and branching into rough-edged terrain traditionally
associated with white rock divas like Morisette and Sheryl Crow.
</P>
<P>
   Often dubbed alternative soul, this eclectic group includes Macy
Gray, Kelis, Angie Stone and Dionne Farris, singers whose style and
musical sensibility vary widely, but all have defied
categorization. From Gray's space woman coveralls to the David
Bowie T-shirt worn by Dawn Robinson of the band Lucy Pearl, their
crossover appeal comes from the raw looks and sounds and an
antifabulous style.
</P>
<P>
   With the promotional muscle of Dreamworks Records and a
high-powered manager, Benny Medina, Kina is poised to break out.
MTV has deemed her ``buzzworthy,'' a new artist to watch for.
``Girl From the Gutter'' is being played heavily on Top 40 radio,
though it is largely ignored by black stations. And next week, she
begins a 30-city tour with the Australian pop-rock band Savage
Garden. She has developed a network of celebrity fans, including
the designer John Bartlett and the actor Matthew McConaughey, who
has memorized her lyrics and calls her to gush over her record.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard that one of her major influences was Led
Zeppelin, I thought it was killer,'' McConaughey said from his home
in Los Angeles. ``I mean, just on straight appearance, you wouldn't
expect someone who looks like her to be influenced by Led Zeppelin,
but after you meet her, you get it, because Kina's really a rocking
chick.''
</P>
<P>
   She's also captured the respect of veteran black singers like
Darlene Love and Nona Hendryx. After the Bowery Ballroom show,
Love, the '60s soul powerhouse, came backstage to hug and
congratulate her. ``I told her that she reminds me of myself,''
said Love, known for her no-holds-barred belting. ``She sings from
the, heart, she sings without tricks, without doing all those
flashy runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kina and her crew went by limo to an after-party at Lotus on
West 14th Street, where the singer accepted congratulations from
Serena Altschul and David Lee Roth. She danced with Medina, the
diminutive, powerfully built music manager best known for
shepherding the careers of Will Smith, Puff Daddy and Jennifer
Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   But Medina's latest star was fading. Kina smiled at her road
manager, Brett Goetsch, a rock-and-roll veteran with the immense
layered blond hair of a heavy metal star of the '80s. Goetsch, who
has done stints on the road with people like Joan Jett and Guns 'n'
Roses, nodded back. Time to go.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, over coffee at Asia de Cuba in midtown, she
acknowledged that the rhythm-and-blues scene needed shaking up.
``R&AMP;B is very stale, unfortunately,'' she said. ``I appreciate R&AMP;B,
but I appreciate the old R&AMP;B. It had more substance, even in terms
of the lyrical content. Today it's about hits, and it's very
producer-driven, very copycat. It's not even real R&AMP;B. It has the
rhythm, but where's the blues?''
</P>
<P>
   With her sweaty T-shirts and Stratocaster power chords, it comes
as a surprise to hear that she got her start in the soft-core R&AMP;B
tradition. Born Kina Cosper in Detroit, the home of Motown, she
began her career in an En Vogue-knockoff group, a forgotten
foursome called Brownstone, which had a few hits in the mid-'90s.
Her look in Brownstone was all flash and flowing tresses. (``That
hair wasn't mine _ it was a weave, child.'') Now, she sports plain
white undershirts and close-cropped hair, and at her concert last
week she kicked off her stiletto heels and pranced barefoot,
leading her guitar-driven band through a tight set that included
Sly Stone's ``I Want to Take You Higher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brownstone, I replaced a member who had left,'' she said.
``The thing is, Brownstone had established a sound before I got
there. I was in the group for about two and half years, but it
wasn't really what I'm about musically.''
</P>
<P>
   Kina is a case study in the traps of today's narrowly segmented
music business. She felt that the way to break into the industry
was with a highly pasteurized ``urban'' sound, even though her real
roots were in more free-spirited rock.
</P>
<P>
   With a roll of her eyes she recalled how an uncle used to blast
his eclectic record collection in Detroit. ``I didn't love Jean-Luc
Ponty or Hiroshima or the Rolling Stones back then,'' she said. ``I
do now, but as a kid I was embarrassed by it. Everybody else's mom
was listening to Barry White, but in my house Hiroshima and Led
Zeppelin were always playing.''
</P>
<P>
   After Brownstone broke up, Kina tried a solo career. She began
writing her own songs while honing a style of dress and grooming
that, like her music, cuts against the grain. The look of current
R&AMP;B, like that of its cousin hip-hop, is high-priced designer
labels and garishly chunky diamond jewelry. ``I like more of the
thrift-store look,'' Kina said. ``I'm not into the whole designer
thing _ you see everybody doing it. I'd rather take a cheap
second-hand skirt, a cheap shirt and accessorize it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Her striking looks help her make such antistyle statements
glamorous and have also earned her a modeling contract. ``Yeah, I'm
a Wilhelmina model _ that sounds so weird,'' she said, laughing.
``I can't see myself doing runway, but it would be cool to do some
ads.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Kina's brand of genre-hopping is not without risk. For every
Macy Gray, whose quirky voice and work-boots-and-overcoat look
managed to cross over to a mainstream audience, there is a Dionne
Farris, formerly of Arrested Development, who released a critically
acclaimed solo album only to be dropped by her record label when
sales were slow. Black rockers like Living Color and Lenny Kravitz
had to fight hard to find a niche within the racially pigeonholed
music industry. Vernon Reid, the lead guitarist of Living Color,
often bemoaned how rock, created by black artists in the '50s, has
come to be seen as music that's odd for African-Americans to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few companies heard my demo and loved it,'' Kina said. ``But
they were from the urban department and didn't know what to do with
it. They couldn't hear it being played on black radio. I got signed
by the pop department at Dreamworks.''
</P>
<P>
   At most of her concerts, the crowds are racially mixed,
mirroring the makeup of her band: black drummer and bass player and
two white guitarists. ``It's really interesting, because I go to
places like Atlanta, where most of my audience is black, but I get
no love from black radio,'' Kina said. ``I've been picked up mostly
by Top 40. I would like to be played on black radio.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, most radio formats are tightly segregated,
and there is often a tacit color line behind the programming
decisions. A rock station like WXRK in New York will play hip-hop
records by white artists like Eminem and the Beastie Boys, but
never by black rappers like Busta Rhymes or Jay-Z. And
black-oriented stations like WBLS rarely play the rock songs of
African-American artists like Kravitz.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of artists like Kina and Macy Gray is evidence
that musical divisions can be broken down, but not without
prodding, and a few awkward moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our show in Philly the other night,'' Kina said, ``the
crowd was split about 50-50, black and white, and it was quite
interesting to see how separate it was. The black people all rushed
to the front of the stage; the white people stayed more to the back
dancing. If I could've found a way to bring everybody in, I would
have, but I couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she added, smiling, ``But I honestly think the more people
start getting exposed to different sounds, the more those barriers
are going to break down.''

<P>
   True confessions from a hardened critic: I screamed AHHHHH! 14
times at ``What Lies Beneath.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of them might have been OOOOOH's. And OH, NOOOOOO's. Not
to mention ACK's, ARRRRH's, OY's, EERRRGH's and YIIIEEEEAHHHH's. I
think I might have even yelled EEEEEEK at some point, although I'd
be most grateful if word of this didn't get out. I have a
reputation to protect.
</P>
<P>
   See, movie critics are supposed to be skeptical creatures. Which
I am. I was skeptical enough to know going in that ``What Lies
Beneath'' would be hell-bent on eliciting screams from anyone who
watched. I knew this from the preview, which I had seen eight or
nine times (I do not exaggerate) and which promised a film about an
unreasonably gorgeous yuppie couple haunted by the ghost of a
green-eyed babe who had had an affair with the husband and then
died (suicide? murder? bad hair day?), only to possess the guy's
wife and rip off his shirt in the throes of foreplay.
</P>
<P>
   I knew all this. I knew what I was in for. I knew that ``What
Lies Beneath'' would be a shameless and manipulative horror film.
And still, I shrieked. I might add in my defense that the unwitting
stranger who sat to my left also shrieked, as did the unwitting
stranger directly behind me, although the unwitting stranger to my
right didn't shriek once and in fact turned to glare at me every
time I let one rip.
</P>
<P>
   To her and everyone else with the self-control (OK, poise; OK,
OK, intelligence) not to caterwaul at ``What Lies Beneath'': I
apologize. There is no excuse for my behavior. No excuse, that is,
beyond the unavoidable fact that this hackneyed, ridiculous, tautly
schlocky ghost story, sprung from the forehead of director Robert
Zemeckis (``Forrest Gump,'' ``Contact''), packs one mean scare
after another. They're preprogrammed scares, of course. You've seen
them before, you know they're coming, and please, could there not
put another ghostly face in the bathtub? But all the same, they
work.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a film that plays on two levels: the first is
horror; the second, camp. Though there's nothing inherently jokey
about it (knockoffs of ``The Shining'' are serious business), the
film takes its gothic chain-rattling to such goofy extremes that
every shock-point feels like a punchline. The joke's on us: We fall
for it, every time. We know we're being had. We convulse in terror,
then laugh at ourselves for being such a bunch of gullible wusses.
</P>
<P>
   Ha-ha! What a dumb cluck I am! I can't believe I screamed at
that cliched eye-in-the-fence-hole bit, but I'll be smarter next
time! I'll be such a cool customer, I won't yell or get suckered in
or behave like a ninny or AHHHHHHH!!!
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes, and so it goes, for two straight hours of
effective, pre-canned chills. There isn't much to say about the
plot that wasn't covered in the previews (see above), though the
last half an hour does wind down some new and twisty paths.
Harrison Ford plays the yuppie husband (a geneticist), Michelle
Pfeiffer plays the yuppie wife (an ex-cellist), and both of them
play-act quite believably at being (A.) rich, (B.) beautiful and
(C.) the rich, beautiful owners of a sprawling lakeside home in
mountainous Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   This sprawling home turns out to be ground zero for the
green-eyed spook, who makes her presence known by mucking around
with electrical appliances and knocking framed pictures onto the
floor. The yuppie wife responds by freaking out, gradually at
first, and by inviting her plucky best friend (Diana Scarwid) to
join her for a seance in the bathroom. She also sees a shrink (Joe
Morton), who plies her with candy and fails to burst out laughing
when informed that his newest client has a paranormal home life.
</P>
<P>
   As the tale unfolds, two things become ever more limpidly clear.
One is that Michelle Pfeiffer can lend depth, class and sympathy to
any role, no matter ho patently absurd. The other is that Robert
Zemeckis, discounting his fondness (here avoided) for squishy
sentimentality, is among the most skillful storytellers in
mainstream filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   While nothing in his bag of tricks will strike anyone as
anything new, there's a narrative competence to the whole thing.
The pacing, the atmosphere, the rhythmic regularity of the scares
that punches up several exhausted cliches and ensnares the viewer
in a well-mounted, suspenseful climax. I would call it nail-biting,
except I didn't actually bite my nails. I'm above such things; I
had notes to take, flaws to discern, a stern, cynical brow to
furrow. I'm a critic, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I was too busy screaming.
</P>

 &HT;    Armstrong starting to sense victory
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MULHOUSE, France _ The question gnawed at Lance Armstrong, so
much so that he thought about it all throughout his 34.7-mile time
trial Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, a French journalist had asked the defending Tour
de France champion if he thought his lead of 5 minutes, 37 seconds
was safe coming into Friday's time trial. The question hinted that
Jan Ullrich, the 1997 Tour champion and ace time trialist, would be
able to make up that much ground in one stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won all three time trials last year,'' Armstrong snapped.
``Next question.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong believed that question showed a collective lack of
respect for his achievements. He let it bother him throughout
Thursday evening and all Friday, as he and the other riders left
Freiburg, Germany, and crossed the border into the Alsace region of
France.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday afternoon, after Armstrong not only won the time
trial, but posted the second fastest average speed ever in such a
Tour event, the Austinite went looking for the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is the guy?'' he asked, a broad smile on his sunburned
face.
</P>
<P>
   After giving away stage 12 on the summit of Mont Ventoux to
Marco Pantani, Armstrong finally was able to celebrate his first
stage win of this Tour. And he also allowed himself to think about
his imminent victory stroll along the Champs Elysees on Sunday
afternoon in Paris. Barring some catastrophic event, Armstrong will
be wearing yellow on Sunday's final podium. With 231.88 miles to go
until Paris, the next two stages are flat and will be dominated by
sprinters far back in the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, dressed from his shoulders to knees in bright yellow
for the first time this Tour, traveled the course at an average
speed of 33.47 miles an hour. The only rider to ride faster in a
Tour time trial was American Greg LeMond, who posted an average
speed of 33.82 on the final day of the 1989 Tour to clinch the
yellow jersey by a meager eight seconds over France's Laurent
Fignon.
</P>
<P>
   However, Armstrong's accomplishment seemed more monumental,
given that LeMond maintained that speed over a course of only 15.1
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich, like he was in the overall standings, was second Friday
to Armstrong, finishing 25 seconds back. Armstrong's overall
cushion over Ullrich was 6:02, with Spain's Joseba Beloki in third,
10:04 back and France's Christophe Moreau in fourth, 10:34 behind.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich was the next-to-last rider on the course. A malfunction
in his two-way radio prevented him from communicating with his
coach, which made it impossible to keep up with Armstrong's
whereabouts on the course. Ullrich told the German media contingent
that he was not using his communication problem as an excuse for
finishing second.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Johan Bruyneel, Armstrong's coach with U.S. Postal,
was able to listen to Tour radio and tell the cyclist where he
stood in relation to Ullrich and the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Armstrong had no idea that he had neared a Tour record
until he appeared at his press conference. Tyler Hamilton,
Armstrong's teammate, was fourth Friday, 3:01 out of first place.
Hamilton was the course leader until the final four riders took the
course.
</P>
<P>
   The 129 cyclists still in the Tour started three minutes apart
on Friday, riding the short distance from Germany back into France.
Ullrich had a huge crowd advantage. His hometown of Merdingen,
Germany, was about 10 miles from the course, and most of the large
throng that crowded the route was sporting pink and white Deutsch
Telekom hats or jerseys in support of Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, it was Armstrong whom they applauded. Friday was his
final realistic chance at claiming a stage victory. If he failed to
do so, he likely would have become the first Tour champion not to
have won a stage since LeMond did so in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an empty feeling until now,'' Armstrong said. ``I really
wanted to win a stage. There's been a lot of stress on me here. I
did not want to finish in yellow and not win a stage. I achieved
today what I wanted. This has been very positive.''

STOCKS FALL AS INVESTORS CONSIDER QUARTERLY REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after pleasant surprises from the chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board, investors turned their focus back to
corporate earnings Friday and stocks sagged, with the Nasdaq
composite index falling 2.2 percent and the Dow Jones industrial
average down 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But bond prices rallied a little as hopes persisted that new
signs of slowing consumer spending and economic growth would
persuade Fed policy-makers to leave interest rates alone when they
next meet, on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   In the oil market, the price of crude oil plunged 4.1 percent,
to less than $30 a barrel, as it appeared more likely that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would go along with
Saudi Arabia's call to increase daily production by 500,000
barrels.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, both stocks and bonds rallied sharply after Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, was more positive than expected about
the economic outlook. Although he clearly did not rule out future
interest-rate increases, he seemed to surprise investors with his
detailed presentation of reasons for believing that the economy
could be slowing to a manageable, noninflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
   But there were some disappointments on the earnings front
Friday. Eastman Kodak reported a 4.5 percent rise in second-quarter
earnings but said that its market share in the United States had
slipped this year. Its stock was down 1 7/8, to 58. BorgWarner,
which makes engine turbochargers, fell 15/16, to 36, after its
second-quarter earnings per share of $1.51 missed Wall Street
estimates by 5 cents. Lexmark International, a maker of computer
printers, said that its third-quarter profit would come in below
expectations. Its shares plunged 14\, or 22.3 percent, to 49}.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor stocks also declined on concerns about chip sales
for the rest of the year, with Intel falling 4{, to 138 3/16, and
Motorola sliding 1\, to 36 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq index fell 90.11 points, or 2.2 percent, to 4,094.45,
while the Dow dropped 110.31, or 1 percent, to 10,733.56. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index slumped 15.38, or 1 percent, to
1,480.19.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the Nasdaq was down 3.6 percent, the Dow 0.7
percent and the S&AMP;P 500 2 percent. For the year, the S&AMP;P 500 and
the Nasdaq are up less than a percentage point while the Dow is
still off 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, prices were higher as yields, which move in
the opposite direction, fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury
note fell to 5.98 percent from 6.00 percent on Thursday, while the
price rose 4/32, to 103 23/32. The yield on the 10-year note has
been fighting to get back below 6 percent for the last five weeks.
The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.79 percent from 5.81
percent as its price rose 11/32, to 106 19/32.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The seesaw battle in the oil market over where the price is
heading has been going on since July 3, when Saudi Arabia
unexpectedly announced that it was ready to pump 500,000 more
barrels a day if the price did not drop.
</P>
<P>
   But other members of OPEC immediately opposed the Saudi plan,
and reports about negotiations were inconsistent, indicating more
oil to come one day and no more oil the next. Then after an OPEC
official said earlier this week that there was no need to pump more
oil, Saudi Arabia quietly made clear that it was shipping more oil
by contacting oil brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market finally believes Saudi Arabia,'' said Irene King,
senior oil-markets analyst at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. ``Why it took so
long, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday in New York, the price of oil for September delivery
fell $1.21, or 4.1 percent, to $28.56 a barrel, the lowest price
since mid-May.

NEW MOONLET OF JUPITER SEEN, ASTRONOMERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers reported Friday that they have discovered another
tiny moon of the giant planet Jupiter. The new moonlet, if
confirmed, would be the smallest in the solar system and the first
new moon of Jupiter discovered in more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The new moon, which does not yet have a name but is designated
S/1999 J 1, is about 3 miles across, roughly the size of Block
Island, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery involved a collaboration between astronomers in
Arizona, who made the observations last fall, and in Cambridge,
Mass., where the object was initially classified as an asteroid and
just this week was unmasked as an unusual moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a beautiful collaboration,'' said Brian Marsden,
director of the Minor Planet Center at the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, who made the initial
calculations this week that showed the object was really in orbit
around Jupiter, not around the sun. ``They take the images, and we
interpret them,'' he said, referring to a team of astronomers in
Arizona who search the skies in a project called Spacewatch,
designed to detect asteroids that might be on a collision course
with Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Spacewatch astronomer James Scotti and other Spacewatch
observers took the pictures as part of an effort to search for
possible unknown Jovian moons, taking advantage of the closest
approach to Earth in Jupiter's 12-year orbit around the sun. But
initially, it appeared that all they had found was several new,
rather ordinary asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   Then, earlier this week, Tim Spahr of the Minor Planet Center
was reanalyzing some data in the Center's files, and noticed that
several observations of this object, which had been designated as
asteroid 1999 UX18, did not quite fit on an expected asteroidal
orbit. He showed the data to Marsden, who quickly calculated a new
orbit showing that the object was probably a moon of Jupiter.
Gareth Williams of the planet center then made a more detailed
observation that seemed to clinch it.
</P>
<P>
   Which, among other things, illustrates just how difficult it is
to pin down the orbits of celestial objects, even with the power of
modern computers. ``It's still an art,'' Marsden said.
</P>
<P>
   Absolute confirmation will require follow-up observations, which
should be possible in coming weeks now that the view of Jupiter is
no longer blocked by the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a moon of Jupiter was discovered from a telescope
on Earth was in 1974, when a moon called Leda, believed to be about
5 to 10 miles across, was found. Until now, it was the smallest
confirmed moon of any of the solar system's planets. Three other
Jovian moons were discovered by the Voyager spacecraft in 1979.
Along with the new find, that brings Jupiter's family to a total of
17 moons. The object, which orbits the planet in the opposite
direction from most of the others, is probably an asteroid or a
burned-out comet that was captured by Jupiter's gravitational
field, Marsden said.
</P>
<P>
   If this moon is confirmed, it would then be up to a panel of the
International Astronomical Union, chaired by Marsden, to decide on
a name. The accepted convention is that moons of Jupiter are all
given names of lovers associated with the Roman god Jupiter.
Fortunately for the astronomers, Jupiter was a rather promiscuous
god, so there are still plenty of names to choose from.

`POKMON' IS GOOD, COMMERICIAL FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Will children abandon their dog-eared copies of
``Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire'' for ``Pokmon the Movie
2000?''
</P>
<P>
   Wait until kids get a load of ``P2K,'' with its jacked-up
self-consciousness and attempt to give kids the summer-movie fix
they may have missed with ``Chicken Run'' (though I don't see how).
</P>
<P>
   Aping the same exasperating format of the first film (20-minute
short as prelude to 90-minute feature), the second Pokmon movie in
less than a year is aglow with shameless commercialism. But it
knows that you know it's simply after your last dollar, and has
trumped cynics by opening a can of player-hate on itself.
</P>
<P>
   Our villain this time is none other than a crazed Pokmaniac,
scouring the earth for the most obscure creatures to add to his
collection. And at some point he's chastised for giving people the
impression that all collectors are crazed materialist fanatics.
It's a moment of freakish self-awareness aimed at aligning the
Japan-born series with the other WB cartoon staples ``Tiny Toons,''
``Pinky and the Brain'' and ``Animaniacs,'' each marked by
muscle-bound, adult-targeted savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``P2K's'' own pleas for pop props don't go unnoticed. But the
film is littered with such snide indictments of the entire
consumer-merchant Pokmon relationship that you'll never ``catch 'em
all'' with your youngster in quite the same way again.
</P>
<P>
   The crazed fan is called Lawrence III; he speaks in the haughty
mumbles and sighs of Frasier Crane and gets around in a massive
airborne contraption that looks like Alexander Calder's Hindenburg.
And if he gets his hands on Zapdos, Moltres and Articuno, the
powerful Pokmon birds of lightning, fire and ice, respectively,
Lawrence III would become the most powerful Pokmon trainer on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of these three creatures with their different
elemental functions will also unleash the sea monster Lugia _
better known to you and me as the Perfect Storm. (All this is laid
out for us in a pageant of helixes and a board of color codes that
suggest a Pokmon equivalent of the human genome project.)
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Takeshi Shudo's Japanese script, ``P2K'' has a far
more involving story than the first film's cloning parable. This is
a Warner Bros. joint, looking to give the tykes in attendance a
taste of what their folks are getting in that studio's other
seafaring epic, ``The Perfect Storm.'' Only ``P2K'' has less
schmaltz, more brine and a pronounced affection for the antics of
``Gilligan's Island.'' Ash Ketchum, Misty and the gang are out at
sea when a gale whips up and threatens to shipwreck them. We get a
shot of Ash's prize Pokmon, Pikachu, clinging to a rail, staring
off into the oncoming chaos with a look of pure Clooney etched on
his face. He knows, in the same way ``Storm's'' Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio knew: They're headed right for the (pocket) monster!
</P>
<P>
   They are shipwrecked on the tropical island of Shimouti (didn't
I go to school with her?) just in time for the annual legend
festival - or the second season of ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   This little celebration happens to reenact the story of Zapdos,
Moltres and Articuno, who lord over their own islands while
maintaining earth's natural balance, which is disrupted by Lawrence
III, No. 1 fan. The legend foretells of such an event and says that
only the Chosen One can restore the balance, and because Harry
Potter is signed on for a seven-book series, the job of using the
supernatural to save the world falls to Ash Ketchum.
</P>
<P>
   Nice try, but all the action-movie tension ``P2K'' generates is
in the bizarre _ like the triangle between Ash, Misty and jaded
islander Melody, who can work wonders with her homemade woodwind.
Ash and Misty spend their time on the show locked in Mulder-Scully
flirtations (bland, bland, bland). The tension rises with the
innocuous pluck of a toddler blowing bubbles in his milk.
</P>
<P>
   Randy and armed with a crush, Melody is essentially on hand to
make things rough for poor, jealous Misty, whose tomboyishness
prohibits her from admitting she loves Ash. ``If you want someone
to do whatever you want, whenever you want, get yourself a
girlfriend,'' she warns. And here ``P2K'' offers its most novel
service: kiddie dating tool.
</P>
<P>
   The regular adversarial coed duo Team Rocket has discovered the
power of good, which here means offering tips on not getting
involved with the opposite sex. And the film's recurring themes of
fire, ice and lightning _ not to mention Pokmon-trading, with a
cockfighting subtext and that suggestive ``catch 'em all'' tag line
_ suddenly come full-circle as sandbox-love metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's little else of interest about Pokmon beyond
the consumption factor. And the franchise keeps things between its
trainers platonic, refocusing millions of collectors on the task at
hand: Buy more.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush thought he had defeated John McCain
with a pair of primary victories in early March, but the Arizona
senator is popping back into the presidential spotlight just as the
Texas governor plans take center stage at the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush poised to announce his running mate as early as
Monday, he finds himself confronted with fresh reports his
vanquished primary rival is willing to join him on the ticket. At
the same time, 60 House Republicans _ more than a quarter of the
GOP members _ signed a petition this week asking Bush to consider
McCain as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said the only thing Bush's current rival, Democrat Al
Gore, has to fear ``is George W. Bush calling John McCain,''
according to a Republican official who had the wording read to him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain already has plans to resurrect his ``Straight Talk
Express'' campaign bus and drive it from Washington to the
convention hall, arriving next Saturday. He will be trailed by
three media buses.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Philadelphia, the senator will deliver the kickoff
address July 30 at a ``shadow'' convention organized by columnist
Arianna Huffington and others who feel the major-party events are
too scripted.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, McCain will deliver a prime-time speech during the
GOP gathering.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the Bush team is taking the latest bout of
McCain mania in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand there are all kinds of speculation,'' Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer said Friday. ``This is one of five vice
presidential boomlets I have counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night there were new reports that former Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney, who is heading Bush's search for a running
mate, had positioned himself for the job. He reportedly switched
his voter registration from Texas, where he has been living, to
Wyoming, where he once served as a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Switching registration would avoid conflict with the 12th
Amendment of the Constitution, which prohibits the Electoral
College from voting for a president and vice president who are
``inhabitants'' of the same state.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Cheney and McCain, current speculation centers on
Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel,
Senators Fred Thompson and Bill Frist of Tennessee, Representative
John Kasich of Ohio, Governors George Pataki of New York and Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania, as well as former Cabinet secretary
Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed talk about McCain is somewhat troublesome for Bush,
though, because he thought he had long ago doused the speculation.
He also is about to embark on a carefully choreographed run-up to
his party convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Bush point of view, this is a real kick in the
butt,'' said Washington political analyst Stuart Rothenberg. ``He's
trying to make a decision that would be greeted on its own, that
people would reflect on positively, and instead this elevates
McCain and might force people to say, `Why not, all things being
equal, select McCain?' It's bound to create comparisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush worked carefully in the spring to get McCain, who won seven
primaries, to publicly rule out an interest in the vice presidency.
The governor has said repeatedly that he wants a running mate who
is loyal to his cause. Bush feared that openly rejecting McCain,
with whom he clashed over campaign finance and Social Security
reform during the primary campaign, would leave the senator's
legion of reform-minded supporters angry.
</P>
<P>
   Following a May summit meeting with Bush in Pittsburgh, McCain
said he had asked not to be considered. Bush declared he would
respect his wishes.
</P>
<P>
   But during a conversation earlier this week with Ridge, the
Pennsylvania governor, McCain reportedly said he didn't want to be
vice president, yet if asked, ``I would serve.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Arizona senator never ruled out such a possibility in
May, leaks about the conversation reignited speculation about
McCain and Bush teaming up.
</P>
<P>
   The talk about McCain comes as Bush is about to execute a plan
aimed at maximizing his ability to keep attention off Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend has been blocked out for the final decision-making
about a running mate. Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan said Friday,
``The process is still working. The governor has not made up his
mind but may be prepared to make an announcement next week as early
as Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Before heading off to a huddle with advisers at his Texas ranch,
Bush was asked specifically about McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be a loyal soldier for my campaign,'' the governor said.
``He is a man of duty and he loves his country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush only smiled when asked what rank McCain might hold.
</P>
<P>
   When the announcement comes, it will trigger a run of
high-profile campaigning by the Republican presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is planning to take his running mate on a five-day trip
from Texas to Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia
and, finally, Pennsylvania _ arriving in Philadelphia on Aug. 2
amid the convention frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the renewed attention on McCain, his spokesman says the
Bush team has nothing to fear from the senator's presence at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain is going to Philadelphia to reiterate his
strong support of Governor Bush, and any time the spotlight is
shining on Senator McCain, it will only serve to heighten the
public's awareness of the senator's strong support for Governor
Bush,'' said McCain spokesman Todd Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush team does have precedent for concern about McCain
sticking the the script.
</P>
<P>
   During a working vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine, in early
June, Bush and his staff met to flesh out a convention plan and a
tentative list of speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Card, the former Massachusetts state representative and
onetime US Transportation secretary who is heading up Bush's
convention planning, returned to Washington the next morning, where
he received a call from McCain's staff asking for an immediate
meeting. Card had been planning to meet with the senator the
following week.
</P>
<P>
   Card cleared the impromptu visit with Bush headquarters, yet no
sooner had he walked out of McCain's Capitol Hill office than the
news wires began reporting McCain was slotted for a prime-time
speaking role, along with former Joint Chiefs Chairman Colin
Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's communications chief, was befuddled when
reporters traveling with the governor in Maine confronted her with
the McCain news.
</P>
<P>
   An array of speakers, including Powell and Bush's wife, Laura,
had yet to be told, Hughes said with exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Wire service material was used to prepare this report.

FTC SAYS TOYSMART DATABASE ON CHILDREN CREATED ILLEGALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toysmart.com gained international notoriety by trying to auction
off customer data after promising shoppers it would never do so.
</P>
<P>
   Now the bankrupt retailer from Waltham, Mass. will also be
remembered as the first company accused of breaking a new law
protecting children's privacy online.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest twist to Toysmart.com's woes, the Federal Trade
Commission said Friday the toy seller collected names, e-mail
addresses and ages of children in violation of the Children's
Online Privacy Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC plans to file an amended complaint in US District Court
in Boston demanding that Toysmart.com ``immediately delete or
destroy all information'' gathered in violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency also announced Friday that it has agreed to
settle a suit filed last week over Toysmart.com's plans to sell
customer data. That means the retailer can auction off information
about its adult customers under certain conditions and approval
from a US Bankruptcy judge.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial settlement squeaked by the federal agency's
commissioners Thursday night by a 3-2 vote. Commissioners Sheila F.
Anthony and Orson Swindle rejected the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``To accept the bankruptcy settlement would place business
concerns ahead of consumer privacy,'' Anthony said in a statement.
``In my view, consumer privacy would be better protected by
requiring that consumers themselves be given notice and choice
before their detailed personal information is shared with or used
by another corporate entity.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also faces opposition from state officials. On
Thursday, attorneys general from 38 states filed an objection to
Toysmart.com's plans to sell customer information. New York and
Texas filed separate objections.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn said in a statement Friday
night that the proposed FTC settlement does not sufficiently
protect consumers' privacy. ``This settlement is the first of its
kind in the important area of Internet privacy,'' Cornyn said. ``It
is important that it is done in the right way and clear guidelines
are established.''
</P>
<P>
   The office of the Massachusetts attorney general declined to
comment on the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com closed its Web site in May after Walt Disney Co.,
which owns a majority stake in the online retailer, yanked its
support. A month later, the Internet store filed for bankrupcty
protection from its creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed by the attention, Disney has offered to buy and then
``retire'' the online retailer's customer database. Another
company, Digital Research Inc. of Kennebunk, Maine, said it would
bid on the customer list and agree to keep the names private.
</P>
<P>
   Digital may have a tough time winning over the court, however.
Under the FTC's restrictions, Toysmart.com can sell customer data
only to a family-oriented company that agrees to abide by the
retailer's privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also calls for a package deal that forces the
buyer to purchase Toysmart.com's name and Web site. If a sale or
reorganization of Toysmart.com is not approved by July 31, 2001,
the online retailer must delete or destroy all customer data,
according to a copy of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that the settlement resolves the concerns of the
various attorneys general,'' said Harry Murphy, a Boston attorney
representing Toysmart.com.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed deal immediately came under fire from customers
and consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's sleazy,'' said Fred Boak, a computer programmer
from Harwich who often shops online. `'Given their promise, I find
it interesting that the FTC can work out a deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Shen, a policy analyst with the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, said the settlement sends a message to
consumers that online retailer's privacy policies are not to be
trusted.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site, Toysmart.com encouraged shoppers to provide
tidbits about themselves and their children. That information, the
company said, ``is never shared with a third party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the settlement seems to be saying, `Don't take
privacy policies seriously,'' Shen said. ``If I was a consumer, I'd
be hesitant to shop online.''
</P>
<P>
   Shen also criticized TRUSTe, an online privacy program that
offers an Internet version of the Good Housekeeping seal of
approval.
</P>
<P>
   TRUSTe officials contacted the FTC after Toysmart.com, one of
its members, advertised its intention to sell customer information.
But Friday, a TRUSTe spokesman indicated Friday that the
organization was amenable to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have kept going after this company,'' Shen said.
``I think this is going to reflect badly on the TRUSTe as well as
the FTC.''

NO WACO ATROCITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Waco is a word that took on heightened meaning in the past
decade. To those at one edge of American culture it symbolizes the
unfeeling and even brutal authoritarian use of power by the federal
government. It was no accident that bombers destroyed the federal
building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995 _ the second
anniversary of the deadly fire at the Branch Davidian compound in
Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Horrible as that fire was, however, two credible forums have now
concluded that the Justice Department and agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms were not the satanic evildoers
described by some paranoid right-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senator John Danforth, a Republican appointed by Attorney
General Janet Reno last fall to answer what he described as ``the
dark questions'' in the case, concluded in a preliminary report
Friday that government agents did not start the fatal fire or shoot
at those in the compound. There was no inappropriate use of the
military and no major coverup, Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   His report came just a week after five jurors who heard
extensive testimony in a civil case in Waco advised a judge that
there was no federal negligence in the deaths of nearly 80
Davidians, including 20 children.
</P>
<P>
   While that judge's ruling and Danforth's final report are still
to come, it is clear that wild charges against government agents
were based in evidence that was thin to nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government has been at least preliminarily
exonerated of criminal or civil liability, its actions have not
been applauded and do not deserve to be.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Danforth found that, while they had nothing to do
with the fatal fire, several pyrotechnic rounds had been fired _
and their use covered up _ by the FBI and other officials. This is
inexcusable and deserves harsh sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   More fundamentally, Reno's judgment in ordering agents to storm
the compound is likely to remain in doubt. Patience is usually the
prime strategy in such standoffs. We will never know if David
Koresh would have killed his followers anyway. We do know that the
federal assault was tragically ineffective.

   It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the
age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of
belief, it was the epoch of incredulity. &QL; 
A Tale of Two Cities &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Had Charles Dickens been writing about this new century of
American politics instead of the times of the French Revolution,
he'd have been half right.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, maybe a little more than half. Of foolishness and
incredulity, there can be no question. But, though it most surely
is incredibly difficult to find, there is some of the best mixed in
with some of the worst. And, what the hey, maybe there's even a
hint of wisdom and a trace of belief, but that probably is
stretching it.
</P>
<P>
   Moving along, from pure fiction to recalled reality, let it be
noted that the politics of 2000 are every bit as _ actually even
more _ strange as can be remembered well back into the last
century. Such hardly should come as a surprise to anyone, at least
anyone who's even remotely inclined to the ranks of political
junkies.
</P>
<P>
   For not even the most dedicated of political addicts have been
able to produce much ardor of any kind this year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, this old ragtag Texas political writer recently
rather mildly exhorted Vice President Al Gore, the soon-to-be
Democratic presidential nominee, and any and all other Democrats
not to mess with Texas in their attacks on the for-sure Republican
presidential nominee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. As it happened,
this column ran in The Tennessean, the Nashville newspaper where
Gore once worked.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, this column inspired a fair number of Tennesseans
to e-mail their reactions to it. For some it was one thing, for
others, another and for many, all.
</P>
<P>
   But, none, not one, gave any indication the correspondent much
liked Gore. A whole bunch indicated they had little regard for me.
A lot more were especially clear they are not admirers of Bush.
And, most, by far, sure don't like Republicans. Period.
</P>
<P>
   But, none wrote of liking Gore, or of admiring him, or even of
supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   There's this, none pushed him for the No. 2 spot on his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Gore and Bush about the only politicians of note who
haven't been cited by someone as being on a list of possible
running mates for either party.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it seems the closer we get to the two candidates'
announcements of their choices of vice presidential candidates, the
longer _ certainly weirder _ these so-called lists get.
</P>
<P>
   Daily, sometimes hourly, we get speculation about who's likely
to be tapped as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking that generates this speculation truly is wondrous.
As has been the case with Bush in every aspect of late, the
wondering about his choice is not only more publicly aired, it's
about 10 times more convoluted than the process the pundits go
through to suggest running mates Gore is likely to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's pondering, of course, is pretty consistently reported as
being dominated by whether a running mate who's pro-choice or one
strongly opposed to abortion will be of more help to his own
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a pro-choice
Catholic, has had miles of print and hours of air time devoted to
his prospects with Bush. None of that, however, comes close to the
serious _ yes, really, honestly serious _ speculation Bush
ultimately will reject Ridge because he's physically bigger than
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It's stuff like this that explains why already a forest's worth
of paper has been used for all the alleged ``short lists'' making
the media rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Gore and Texas. As demonstrated in his late week San
Antonio visit, the veep seems to have gotten the message he will
fare far better if he can manage to beat up on Bush without totally
dissing Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That done, Texans _ especially those who live in the 18th
Congressional District _ were reminded, no matter what, some things
just never will change.
</P>
<P>
   This came in a report about the House Black Caucus joining with
President Clinton in carping about what they call the Senate's bias
in refusing to confirm some of Clinton's judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saddened to make these accusations, but I will make
them,'' Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee reportedly said. ``The
United States Senate has acted racistly and with sexism.''
</P>
<P>
   Racistly?
</P>
<P>
   It may be the best of times. It, for sure, is the worst. &QL;

FISK'S ROAD TO HALL BEGAN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTOWN, N.H. _ There is a Fisk Field here.
</P>
<P>
   There is no neon or granite sign marking the way. In fact, there
is little around making note that this is the hometown of a
baseball Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a Fisk Field. There is a big ``F'' in the cement
walkway leading to the white house next door. But there is no
scoreboard. There are no Fisk Franks for sale. There is no
commemorative plaque noting this is the place where Carlton first
hit them out.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, it's not only Carlton Fisk's Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was just as much Calvin's and Conrad's and Cedric's and
Janet's and June's field as it ever was the field of Carlton, who
goes mostly by Pudge in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fine and attractive small field, but it's not much of a
ball field these days. The grass was scraggly and orange day lilies
brightened the backside of it on a gorgeous midsummer day a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sign of the backstop Cecil Fisk made for his kids
and half the kids in town. There are no worn-out basepaths.
</P>
<P>
   Long gone are the days that the neighborhood kids _ the six
Fisks and the Hogancamps and the Kinsons and the rest, ``33 of
them,'' said Leona Fisk, den mother and coach and a heck of a
softball player and football thrower herself _ gathered here for
games galore to be followed by fresh milk from the Fisk's cow and
cinnamon buns.
</P>
<P>
   Long before there were memorable high school basketball nights
in tiny gyms around the state. Long before there were big pitching
and slugging performances and then catching duties in high school
and Legion ball and finally Fenway Park and Comiskey Park and
throughout the major leagues. And long before there was that most
famous home run of all, there were games, games, and more games at
Fisk Field and Gates Field and Highter's Field and other play spots
all around Charlestown, a workingman's town hard by the Connecticut
River and only several long homers from Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton Fisk is to be honored with other inductees in Baseball's
Hall of Fame Class of 2000 Sunday. He will be the first player from
New Hampshire in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The road to Cooperstown started in Charlestown.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was a good athlete, but we never thought he'd be a
professional,'' said Cecil Fisk, the father, who at 87 has the same
sturdy build and rugged forearms as the son. ``It's a small town.
We never had any connection with professional sports.''
</P>
<P>
   And then one day when Cecil was in Mexico City on business _ he
put in 39 years across the river in Springfield, Vt., at Jones &AMP;
Lamson Machine Co. _ they called from home looking for his input
because the Red Sox wanted to sign Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they had looked at him, but we had no idea,'' Cecil
said. ``If he had the opportunity, I said he probably should sign.
That's what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin before him and Conrad and Cedric after him were better
known for their baseball. What Carlton Fisk really wanted was to
play professional basketball. To line up with the Celtics and make
his fame in Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball, after all, was his sport. It was the sport in a
small, New England town _ Charlestown's population is pushing 5,000
now and was about 3,000 then. Basketball drew the crowds to tiny
gyms all winter, and basketball was what stirred the fire of folks
in Charlestown and Walpole and Alstead in their heated rivalries
before they joined up in regional school districts. Baseball was a
short-season game played in front of family _ and often not even
they could make it to an afternoon game in a working town.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton Fisk had springs for legs and had the big hands and
those broad shoulders and _ no surprise here _ he really got after
the ball. He was a fierce rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it is attitude,'' said Leona. ``A lot of it
is his upbringing. He had to do things around here. I think with
both of us it was play as well as you can and give 100 percent. Or
more. It all worked out for him. That's where the drive came from.
That was just him. The way he played. He played his heart out. And
he wasn't afraid to tell someone else they should be working a
little harder, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Others saw it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudge, I don't think, knew the word stop,'' said Jim
Hogancamp, one of the neighborhood kids and a teammate in high
school. ``He had a tremendous competitive drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime basketball watchers in the state still talk about the
game Fisk played as a senior against Hopkinton in the state high
school basketball tournament in 1965. His 40 points. His
30-something rebounds against a front line that went 6-9 and 6-5 to
his 6-2 and change. Finally, Fisk fouled out. His team lost by a
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most incredible game I ever saw,'' said Ralph Silva, who
came out of Gloucester, Mass., and Springfield College just in time
to coach all the Fisk boys in soccer, basketball, and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk went to the University of New Hampshire on a basketball
scholarship and played center on the freshmen team and played well.
He ran up against guys who also had springs in their legs and
pounded the boards. And were 6 inches taller than he was.
</P>
<P>
   He settled on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever this kid set his mind to do, he was going to do it,''
Silva said. ``He had a tough time in the minor leagues in baseball.
He didn't hit for crap. I've still got some letters he sent. He was
pretty discouraged. `I don't know if this is the right thing for
me.' He definitely didn't think it was the right thing. He almost
walked out.''

<P>
   Fortunately for the Red Sox and the White Sox, he did not.

<P>
   Fisk signed with the Red Sox in 1967 and in 1969 played two
games with the big team. He came up for good late in the 1971
season and in 1972 was the first unanimous American League Rookie
of the Year after hitting .293 with 22 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   He saw his chance. And grabbed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of good ballplayers have the ability and don't get the
opportunities,'' Cecil Fisk said. ``He had the chances. And he had
the ability. He's been in the right spot at the right time, many
times.''

</P>
<P>
   Right place. Right time.
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 of the World Series, Red Sox vs. Cincinnati Reds. Bernie
Carbo ties it in the eighth with a three-run pinch-hit home run.
Fisk comes up in the 12th inning.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've heard what happened next.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk took a pitch from Pat Darcy and knocked it off the foul
pole in left for a game-winning homer _ but not without the help of
his body English and that of tens of thousands in Fenway Park and
countless others around New England watching on television and
listening on radio and every one of them willing the ball fair.
</P>
<P>
   Leona and Cecil Fisk and much of their family were in Fenway,
Section 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a noise,'' Leona said. ``Wow. Everyone was standing up
and screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe you've seen the camera shot of Carlton Fisk jumping
and pushing the ball fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us later that picture of him probably would never
have happened,'' Cecil Fisk said. ``They said there was a big rat
in center field where the cameraman was. I guess he should have
followed the ball or had the camera going someplace else, but the
rat scared him and he left the camera and left it on. It was just
an accident that the camera stayed on him that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Charlestown, Dave Conant watched the home run on
television. He had to do something. He went down the street to St.
Luke's Episcopal Church and quietly slipped inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rang the bell violently for about four or five minutes,''
Conant recalled a decade ago. ``And about the time I decided I had
had enough, the bell had had enough, and the town had had enough,
there were blue flashing lights in the yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Police told him they would have joined in the
celebration if they had realized what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Just another landmark on the road from Charlestown to
Cooperstown.

PUTIN'S GRAND TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin, while preparing for his debut
at this weekend's summit meeting of the wealthy nations that call
themselves the Group of 8, stopped off for state visits with
President Jiang Zemin of China and North Korea's ``Dear Leader''
Kim Jong Il. In Beijing and in Pyongyang, Putin placed public
emphasis upon the one crucial security interest that is common to
China and North Korea _ ardent opposition to America's plans for a
national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing in particular stands to pay a high price should American
leaders plunge ahead with deployment of the contemplated missile
defense system despite its technological inadequacies.
</P>
<P>
   The mere specter of a defense against China's deterrent force of
about 20 ICBMs could oblige Chinese leaders to squander enormous
sums on increasing and modernizing their missile force.
</P>
<P>
   So Putin and Jiang indulged in elaborate rhetorical exercises to
intimate that they may be forced to form an improbable alliance
against the American hegemon in the event that US taxpayers are
bilked of $60 billion or more for a porous missile shield that will
leave Americans less secure, not more.
</P>
<P>
   In Pyongyang, Putin raised the antimissile folly to new heights.
After a two-hour chat with Kim Jong Il, the novice Russian leader
said: ``North Korea is even prepared to use exclusively the missile
technology of other countries, if it is offered rocket boosters for
peaceful space research.''
</P>
<P>
   To give Putin his due, it must be acknowledged that his
underlying brief is sound. The notion that the United States, with
its thousands of nuclear missiles, may have something to fear from
the failed state of North Korea is hardly credible.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is ludicrous to pretend that the North Korean
communists, whose starving subjects have been eating grass, have
some rational reason to spend billions of dollars on space
research. North Korean space research is as irrational as the
deployment of an American missile defense that cannot distinguish
warheads from the decoy balloons that are sure to accompany those
missiles.

 &HT;    Sunshine and a pole for Stewart
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long Pond, Pa. _ The rain gods smiled on Tony Stewart again
Friday and apparently helped him to his first pole position of the
Winston Cup season.
</P>
<P>
   He'll start on the pole in Sunday's Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono
Raceway after his late-afternoon qualifying run, delayed by a brief
episode of rain sprinkles, produced a track record 172.391 mph.
</P>
<P>
   He breezed around Pocono's 2.5-mile tri-oval in 52.207 seconds
to grab the pole from Rusty Wallace, who earlier had broken his own
track record with a lap of 172.157 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It began sprinkling just prior to Stewart's lap, stopping
qualifying for 10 minutes. The brief rain apparently cooled the
track and made it a tad faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get moisture in the air it creates a lot of drag,''
Stewart said. ``We learned that from the Indy car days. But the
nice thing is that the sun came back out. But with the sun, the
track temperature starts climbing again. So as soon as the
raindrops quit, I wanted to get in the car as fast as I could and
get going before the surface temperature started rising again,
which would start making the car slide around a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Stewart benefited from a New Hampshire rainstorm.
He was leading with 27 laps remaining in the 300-lap Jiffy Lube 300
when the skies opened up a second time and he was declared the
winner.
</P>
<P>
   But he's no fan of the wet stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate rain,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rain got us in the position we were in (at New Hampshire,
out of sequence on pit stops). If the first rain didn't come, we
were on the same playing field as everybody else. But with that
first rain, a bunch of guys gambled and didn't have anything to
lose by pitting. We had everything to lose by pitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand to see it rain. It drives me nuts. I'm usually
losing years off my life every time it rains somewhere now.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the rain played with Stewart's mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard when you prepare mentally to go out and make your
lap, and then to have the rain start just about the time that
you're getting ready to go out, and have to go through that cycle
again, it created a little more anxiety than I wanted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a ride with driver Buster Auton in the pace car calmed
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `When you're comfortable with the race track, we'll
go,''' Stewart said. ``He gave me the confidence that I knew what
the track conditions were like when I went out there, and having
the confidence to go out and do what I needed to do.''

ROTH ADVANCES THE BALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 23, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A stalemate over drug benefits for Medicare recipients has been
loosened by Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware with his
embrace of direct payments rather than the cumbersome and probably
unworkable House-passed measure for channeling funds through
private insurers. The principle Roth has adopted deserves support
from the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, as head of the Senate Finance Committee, has broken with
many of his Republican colleagues in both houses of Congress. They
favor a plan that would subsidize private insurers to encourage
them to offer drug insurance to Medicare beneficiaries. It makes
little sense to dissociate drugs from the administration of other
forms of medical care, and it introduces an element of uncertainty
for private insurers, who would be required to absorb the risks of
such insurance rather than having that risk carried by the federal
program, as it is for other forms of care.
</P>
<P>
   The Roth proposal has a downside. Medicare recipients would have
to choose between drug coverage and a reduction in support for home
care _ a proposal that could be modified in the course of Senate
debate on the matter. That debate assumes that Senate Republican
leadership would allow it to take place, an uncertain proposition.
</P>
<P>
   The coverage would also be only partial, covering only half of
the first $4,000 in drug costs and 80 percent above that figure.
The effects of that structure would weigh more heavily on
lower-income elderly, but those figures, too, could be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will do well, before and after this fall's election,
to consider the political implications of Roth's move. He is
running for his sixth term in the Senate against a strong challenge
from Delaware Governor Thomas R. Carper. Medicare, and especially
coverage for medications, is a major national issue on which
Democrats, a minority in both House and Senate, have more
aggressively supported expanded coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the political considerations for Roth, he has
changed the atmosphere in which the issue of drug coverage will be
fought out in Congress. That is a significant contribution.

GORE ATTACKS BUSH ON HANDLING OF TEXAS BUDGET

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cramming several weeks of attacks on Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas into one speech, Vice President Al Gore asserted
Friday that the governor's handling of the state's budget proves he
would be an incompetent steward of the national economy, inclined
to squandering the surplus on tax cuts for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Brimming with confidence in a speech before the leaders of 30
transportation unions, almost all of which have endorsed him, Gore
knitted together themes he had spun out separately in recent weeks,
creating a tapestry of harsh questions about his Republican rival's
fitness to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the vice president said, had frittered away a $6.4 billion
surplus in Texas on tax cuts favoring the wealthy, leaving the
state with a $610 million budget shortfall because of cost overruns
in some programs. The governor, Gore said, could be expected to do
the same in Washington, leaving no money for government programs
that are particularly important to working people, like Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year ago, Texas had the biggest budget surplus in that
state's history,'' Gore said. ``Governor Bush's top priority was a
big tax break for the powerful interests. And now, in the midst of
the strongest national economy ever in history, Texas has virtually
eliminated that surplus and has a budget shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Governor Bush wants to bring those same budget-busting
tax policies to the nation as a whole,'' Gore continued. ``Which do
you think is more important, his rhetoric or his record?''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president sarcastically accused Bush of having
misplaced his priorities by using the surplus for tax cuts instead
of improving services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were governor of a state that had the worst record of
any state in giving health care to the families of your state, and
then all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest budget
surplus in the history of your state, don't you think you would
consider using some of that surplus to maybe move your state from
number 50 to, say, 45 or maybe even higher?'' Gore said, eliciting
titters from his audience. ``I would, of course, and shoot higher
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said the Texas budget was firmly balanced and would
actually finish the coming fiscal year with a $1.4 billion surplus.
The $610 million shortfall, caused by unexpectedly high
expenditures on Medicaid and prison programs, is a common problem
that will be quickly resolved with supplemental appropriations,
they said. And the aides said much of Bush's tax cut was devoted to
reducing sales and property taxes for middle-income Texans, not
just the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this election comes down to Governor Bush's fiscal
leadership versus Al Gore's credibility, we're going to win in a
landslide,'' said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, wearing a conventional red tie with white shirt and black
suit instead of his trademark khakis and polo shirt, seemed
especially relaxed and confident Friday as he addressed his
enthusiastic audience, which repeatedly interrupted him with
standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the view of his aides that he has had a good few days on
the stump, after many bad ones, the vice president said, ``I think
that this week will be looked back upon as a turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   Working to pump the labor leaders, whose help will be vital in
getting out the Democratic vote this November, Gore ticked off a
series of pro-union pledges: raising the minimum wage, enacting
legislation to remove obstacles to organizing unions, making health
insurance more accessible, ensuring that women receive equal pay
for equal work.
</P>
<P>
   And in a subtle response to the criticisms of Ralph Nader, the
Green Party candidate for president who contends that Gore is
virtually a carbon copy of Bush, the vice president urged the crowd
to ``fight off any cynics who say that they're all the same and it
doesn't make any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make a difference,'' Gore continued. ``It makes a
difference whether or not we're going to fight to keep Social
Security or not. It makes a difference whether or not working
families are going to get health care and their kids are going to
get good public schools.''

TOO CLEAN? &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   To warn us about the dangers of disease-causing bacteria that
don't succumb to antibiotics, scientists have started referring to
a future ``post-antibiotic'' era that will have some of the horrors
of the pre-antibiotic era. This may sound like scaremongering, but
the problem is serious enough that the World Health Organization
earlier this year sounded an international alarm, and in Atlanta
July 17 a Tufts microbiologist criticized the increasing use of
antibacterial cleaning agents that could foster
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   This is the paradox behind all the antibacterial hand soaps,
dish detergents, cutting boards, and toothbrush handles being sold:
While buyers assume they are protecting themselves and their
children from infections, they may just be encouraging development
of super-germs that brush off the most dependable antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   The antibacterial cleansers have that effect, at least, in
laboratory studies by Stuart Levy of Tufts. The American Medical
Association is so concerned that it has asked the US Food and Drug
Administration to speed up its rule-making process for the
antibacterial soaps. The FDA has yet to determine either whether
they have a real health benefit or whether they encourage resistant
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Levy sees another downside to the antibacterials. Studies in
Europe have shown that children growing up in overly antiseptic
environments are more likely to suffer from allergies and asthma _
their immune systems fail to develop properly.
</P>
<P>
   Levy advises using such traditional cleansers as alcohol,
bleach, and hydrogen peroxide, which leave no antibacterial
residue, the great selling point of the new soaps. Except for those
with compromised immune systems, antibacterials are not needed.
</P>
<P>
   No one claims that antibacterials are the major factor in the
growing phenomenon of resistant bacteria. Scientists place more
blame on doctors' overuse of antibiotics and, to a lesser extent,
the use of antibiotics in livestock feed. But consumers are being
sweet-talked into buying antibacterial products that may do more
harm than good. Levy's message of restraint _ ``Go back to Coke
Classic'' _ is sound.

<P>
   When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrives in Thailand
for this week's ministerial meeting of ASEAN, the Association of
South East Asian Nations, she will demonstrate American support for
a regional grouping that can boast of many successes and one
flagrant failure _ the military dictatorship ruining Burma. It is
becoming harder and harder for ASEAN members to ignore the
depredations of the Burmese junta.
</P>
<P>
   No country in ASEAN suffers more directly from the junta's
crimes than host Thailand. For much of the past decade, the Thais
have been democratizing a polity long dominated by corrupt military
officers. At the recent AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa,
the US ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, rightly
praised the Thai government for its success in implementing
policies to reduce the spread of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   But the uniformed thugs who rule Burma are undermining those
hard-won triumphs. Whereas Bangkok has achieved exemplary progress
in substituting legal cash crops for the poppies used to make
heroin, Burma under the junta continues to be a principal source
for the heroin that destroys lives from Bangkok to Boston. And
where there is heroin addiction there is an inevitable increase in
the rate of HIV infections and cases of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a new evil has come cascading into Thailand from
Burma: millions of easily smuggled tablets of the stimulant
methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Although noninterference in the internal affairs of member
states is a founding principle of ASEAN, the cross-border flow of
narcotics, HIV, and refugees into Thailand demonstrates the folly
of pretending that Burma's ASEAN neighbors are not affected by the
junta's misrule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of good governance is at the root of our country's
troubles,'' the leader of Burma's democracy movement, Aung San Suu
Kyi, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed article. ASEAN members ought
to heed her temperate yet resolute counsel. They should pressure
Burma's military junta to enter a political dialogue with Suu Kyi,
Burma's ethnic nationalities, and the National League for
Democracy, the party elected overwhelmingly in 1990 but immediately
denied its right to govern by the military.

 &HT;    Savannah lifters make presence felt
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Orleans _ Here, today, are the U.S. Olympic weightlifting
trials. They could have saved some travel expenses by hijacking the
event to another funky southern tourist hangout.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 37 muscled men and women (following three injury
withdrawals), nine do their grunt work for Team Savannah. Six years
after the city pledged tax dollars to a gym devoted to lifting and
hired Michael Cohen to ride herd over it, Savannah has become the
sport's blazing hot-spot.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the nine are home-grown. Top female seed? From
Savannah. Top male seed? Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think one city has had that many going to the
trials,'' said Cohen, the U.S. women's Olympic coach.
</P>
<P>
   Put an asterisk by his claim, because all previous trials have
been testosterone festivals. The women have their coming-out party
in Sydney as the latest sport to eliminate its gender-specific tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finally going to the Olympics,'' said Cheryl Haworth.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Haworth has been waiting forever. The 17-year-old
heavyweight barely had hoisted her first barbell at Cohen's gym
when the last Games rolled around. Haworth so dominated in lead-up
competition this year that the qualifying-points total she carries
into today's meet makes her place on the U.S. roster as guaranteed
as a wild time on Bourbon Street. Yet Haworth does not plan toease
off. She wants an American record.
</P>
<P>
   That's okay with Cohen. At the same time, he will watch her
closely _ and nervously. ``If she shows the littlest twinge,''
Cohen said, she's done. The U.S. women secured the maximum four
slots in Sydney by taking sixth at last year's World Championships.
(One place lower, and they would have sent only three.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet another Georgian, Robin Goad of Newnan, begins today's heavy
lifting in third, just above a Savannah move-in, Cara Heads-Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Only two U.S. men are headed Down Under, a consequence of their
dreadful 29th place at the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Chaplin III of Savannah sits atop the men's standings.
</P>
<P>
   No contestant is more dogged than Wes Barnett, an Olympian twice
over. A cancerous tumor two years ago damaged the optic nerve of
his right eye, leaving him with 20-800 vision. But, entering today
in third place, he is close enough to envision another Olympic
experience for himself.

   Danish police recommend that no criminal charges be pressed
against Pearl Jam for the nine deaths during the Seattle band's
June 30 performance at the Roskilde Festival.
</P>
<P>

that Pearl Jam is ``morally responsible'' and that the band incited
``violent behavior'' among audience members.
</P>
<P>
   British music magazine NME posted a story saying Pearl Jam is
being ``slammed'' for ``whipping the crowd into a frenzy.'' Similar
reports have been posted on the www.dotmusic.com and Netscape
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Drachmann, a reporter for Politiken, a daily national
newspaper in Denmark, says that the report makes no such
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the report only refers to Pearl Jam twice, once to
place the band at the Orange stage at the time of the incident and
again to state that Pearl Jam typically gets its audience highly
excited. Drachmann says the term ``morally responsible'' does not
appear anywhere in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general conclusion is that you cannot find one single
explanation for what happened,'' says Drachmann. He further
translates Rungstrom as saying that ``It's my opinion that the
accident was caused by several unlucky circumstances occurring at
the same time, with the behavior of the audience as the most
important factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``unlucky circumstances'' listed in the report are weather,
the band's ability to excite a crowd, alcohol and drug use by the
audience and sound quality _ referring to the fact that at one
point, some of the speakers cut out, causing people to rush toward
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have some critical remarks but it wouldn't be fair to say
that they write that Pearl Jam is responsible. He says he doesn't
know if this behavior (moshing, crowd surfing, rushing the stage,
etc.) is characteristic (of these concerts) or if it is a new
development in youth culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The most critical comment directed toward Pearl Jam in the
report: ``The band Pearl Jam is according to explanation from
witnesses known for almost to be appealing the audience to behave
in a frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Drachmann says public response to the deaths as well
as the report in Denmark have been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a general discussion in Denmark that's very much like
what the police here said, that it was just bad luck. Others say
that that's too easy to say _ nine people are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   People are more concerned with preventing further incidents like
the one at the rather than finding a single party to blame, he
adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That festival has been going on for 30 years ... we've never
seen anything like this ... we have never seen anyone die at a rock
'n' roll concert in Denmark. That's why it's so shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam manager Kelly Curtis fired off an angry response to
stories that the band is being held ``morally responsible'' by
Danish police. His statement, which can be found at
www.sonymusic.com/artists/PearlJam/rumorpit/release7.html, reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pearl Jam are well known for their exciting live shows, but
they have never, in their ten-year history of performing, `appealed
for violent behavior.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Further, while `crowd surfing' is an audience `phenomenon'
closely connected with many rock bands who are currently
performing, it is not one that is encouraged by Pearl Jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the band's manager, I find it hard to believe that after
all that has transpired, the band's devastation over the tragedies
that occurred at the Roskilde Festival during their performance,
and their long history of attention to safety, that anyone would
assign `moral responsibility' to them. That, I find `appalling' and
ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam has always, and will continue to do everything
possible to ensure that their shows, and shows that they are part
of, are safe and enjoyable for those who attend.''
</P>
<P>
   The band is gearing up for the U.S leg of its tour, which kicks
off in the first week of August. Both band and management were
unavailable for further comment.

   Rising surpluses have prompted calls for increased programs and
tax cuts based on hope that optimistic forecasts will continue to
underestimate future windfalls. Political leaders should remain
wary of these forecasts, as Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve
chairman, again urged them on Thursday. They will do even more if
they broaden their perspectives to include persistent trade and
payments deficits that are tolerable now but could presage a
serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's announcement of the largest one-month trade deficit
ever, $31 billion, was particularly disappointing because it
included a drop in exports, probably reflecting the high value of
the dollar that makes American goods and services more expensive
for foreign customers. In the short run US consumers benefit from
lower prices. But the longer-term issue is complicated by the
return of those dollars spent on exports in the form of investment
in or loans to the US economy, generating interest and dividend
payments to foreign investors at the same time they provide
employment opportunities for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Economists Martin and Kathleen Feldstein have pointed out that
the net costs of these payments is now about $1 billion per day,
with no indication of any reversal.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the budget surpluses _ and the federal debt. About $3.7
trillion is owed to the public, which includes foreign holdings of
US Treasury bonds, notes, and bills. Using significant portions of
surpluses to pay down some of those obligations, as Greenspan
pressed for in his congressional testimony, would ease the effects
of any reversal in foreigners' willingness to invest in this
country. It would also reduce Treasury demand for credit in
competition with private sector needs. And it would provide more
leeway for Congress and future administrations to counter any
downturn through deficit financing of programs to restimulate the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Debt reduction is like putting money in the bank. It is worth
the commitment.

 &HT;    Challengers blink; Tiger plays through
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. Andrews, Scotland _ After the first day of the 129th British
Open at the Old Course, understudies Ernie Els and Steve Flesch
were allowed to step on the stage and deliver a few lines.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's play, the star was back in the spotlight.
Different major championship, different ocean, but same story. The
Tiger Woods Show is back.
</P>
<P>
   Leading a major championship for the sixth round in a row, the
24-year-old Woods on Friday moved halfway to achieving the final
leg of a career Grand Slam. With a 6-under-par 66, Woods assumed
the 36-hole lead in the 129th British Open by three strokes at
11-under 133.
</P>
<P>
   After Woods' 15-shot win in the U.S. Open last month, the
situation at the home of golf is starting to feel familiar. Woods,
who trailed South African Els by one stroke at the start of play
Friday, gradually pulled away from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Told that he's ``making it look easy,'' Woods said, ``That's a
nice compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When anybody is playing well, the game seems easier,'' he
said, ``but when you're playing out there under these conditions, I
guarantee you, it's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   If others might term the tournament over, Woods said, ``I don't
have the trophy sitting next to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the wind continues to be a nonfactor, another Open might
be nothing but a race for second. American David Toms, with a 67,
is Woods' closest challenger at 8-under 136.
</P>
<P>
   Els, after a 66 Thursday, slipped to a 72 and is at 6-under 138
along with Phil Mickelson (66), Fred Couples (68), Denmark's Thomas
Bjorn (69) and Tom Lehman (70).
</P>
<P>
   The cut came at even-par 144. A year ago at Carnoustie it was
12-over 154.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is on pace to both rout the field again and break the
British Open record of 18-under-par 270, set in 1990 by Nick Faldo.
He has not made a bogey since the 10th hole of his third round at
Pebble Beach, a stretch of 62 consecutive holes. Nor has he been in
one of the Old Course's 112 bunkers over two days.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, Jack Nicklaus finished what might have been his
last British Open round just as Woods was walking behind the first
hole after a few practice putts. The winner of 18 pro majors and
Woods' prime career target missed the cut with 77-73_150. While
Nicklaus roots for Woods to break his records, even he is starting
to wish for more suspense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good for the game, but he has to have challengers for the
whole thing to be right,'' Nicklaus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad story if there isn't any. . . . Right now he's the
dominant player. Everybody has thrown up a white flag and
surrendered.''

BARAK AND CLINTON HOPEFUL ABOUT SUCCESS OF TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG with WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ The Israeli peace delegation's mood shifted from
dire to hopeful Friday as officials outside the secluded Camp David
said that Prime Minister Ehud Barak believes the chances for the
peace summit meeting's success have improved.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Dalia Itzik, the environment minister, said that
Barak told her in a phone call Friday that the odds for securing a
peace agreement were now 60-40.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also sounded upbeat Friday as he told
reporters in Okinawa, where he is attending a meeting of leading
industrial nations, that he was ``hopeful,'' and aides said he
might scale back his schedule in Japan to return to Camp David
earlier on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Palestinian official, Abu Mazen, who left Camp
David earlier in the week to attend his son's wedding in the West
Bank, reported no lifted spirits among the Palestinians. Speaking
on Voice of Palestine radio, he offered a somewhat depressed
account of the large gaps that remain between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Given the complete news blackout on the negotiations, it is
impossible to know what altered the Israeli and U.S. leaders'
outlooks, or indeed how much they may have improved after the
summit meeting nearly crashed and burned on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials disclosed Friday that the two sides were
entertaining a U.S. proposal that involved a limited sharing of
sovereignty in East Jerusalem, and that Jerusalem had been the main
stumbling block that nearly derailed the talks for good.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. proposal was reportedly placed on the table before
Clinton left for Japan early Thursday morning. And even if the
details were reported accurately, it was not clear whether further
discussion on the proposal shifted the tenor of the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains very hard going,'' said Richard Boucher, the State
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the talk about Jerusalem caused a flurry of heated
commentary in Israel and the Palestinian territories. If Israel
accepted sharing sovereignty, even in a limited fashion, that would
represent a considerable concession from the previous Israeli
position _ that the Palestinians could control but not own some
Arab neighborhoods in the contested city.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials, while cautioning against debating shards
of leaked information, said the concession as represented did not
appear to be considerable enough. They have contended from the
start that they are demanding full sovereignty of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to officials, the Israeli and Palestinian delegations
were engaged Friday in more substantial conversations than they had
expected to undertake in Clinton's absence. They stopped talking
about catching up on their sleep or hovering in a holding pattern
until his return.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met for the first
time in five days on Thursday night. It was informal, but, given
the acrimony that had accompanied the near collapse of the talks,
it was a sign of progress that they took their places on either
side of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for a dinner. They
made ``dinner conversation,'' according to Boucher, and the mood
was neither jovial nor acrimonious.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare sign of attempted conviviality Friday night, U.S.,
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators played a pick-up basketball
game on mixed teams. The leaders were invited but did not join the
game.
</P>
<P>
   As part of what appeared to be a campaign to prepare the public,
Itzik, the minister who spoke with Barak, communicated his
sentiment that Israel would now have to choose between painful
concessions and a future of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The painful concession debated in Israel Friday involved a
reported plan for granting limited sovereignty in Jerusalem to the
Palestinians. Israeli newspapers, radio and television reported
Friday that Barak, who previously said he would never consider
dividing Jerusalem, was now contemplating joint sovereignty in some
areas of the holy city.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, said Barak had agreed to a full
transfer of some Palestinian neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Michael Melchior, a Cabinet minister who has been serving
as an Israeli spokesman in the United States during the talks, said
that Barak was considering ``administration-plus'' of Palestinian
neighborhoods in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about administration-plus, perhaps also with some symbols
of sovereignty, of joint sovereignty'' in Palestinian neighborhoods
outside the Old City, ``at the edge of Jerusalem,'' like Shuafat,
the refugee camp, Melchior said. ``This is something that I think
we can accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's Cabinet secretary, Yitzhak Herzog, said later that
Melchior was not speaking officially and not fully apprised of all
the details of the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Israeli journalists, based on background briefings from
officials here, reported two variations on a plan for Jerusalem.
Both involve shrinking and expanding Jerusalem in a kind of land
swap with the Palestinians, whereby Jewish settlements in the West
Bank that abut the city would be added to a reconfigured Jewish
Jerusalem while Palestinian neighborhoods would be given to the
Palestinians _ fully or partially, depending on the version.
</P>
<P>
   The Old City, home to Christians, Muslims and Jews, would be
frozen as is and the question of its status deferred.
</P>
<P>
   These could be trial balloons, meant to sensitize the Israeli
public to less far-reaching concessions. But they also could
reflect accurately a U.S. compromise proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Beilin, the leftist justice minister, hinted Friday that
Jerusalem might indeed be divided and said that Israelis would be
better off with a reconfigured, more Jewish capital city. The world
and the Palestinians would recognize an expanded West Jerusalem as
the capital of the Jewish homeland, ``an achievement we have not
reached to date,'' he said in a newspaper interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people truly believed that we would get more than
West Jerusalem?'' Beilin said. ``The warped myth that has been
built in regard to Jerusalem's borders, which the right wing also
knows is incorrect, must not bind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Beilin was referring to what many Jerusalemites acknowledge to
be the divided-ground reality of Jerusalem, which in some ways
defies the legal reality of Israel's annexation of eastern, Arab
neighborhoods after the 1967 war. But despite this reality, the
city is very segregated; 70 percent of Israelis surveyed said in a
poll released Friday said that they oppose any concessions on
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the polls, opposition leaders stepped up attacks
on Barak for even considering the handover of large Arab
neighborhoods as part of a comprehensive peace pact.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``With what Beilin and others are saying, Barak appears to be
preparing public opinion for this,'' Ehud Olmert, the mayor of
Jerusalem and a leader of the rightist Likud party, said in an
interview. ``You have to give him credit: He is the prime minister,
and when he is finished making his case the opposition will no
longer be 70 percent. But I don't see how he can win a referendum,
or an election.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian spokeswoman, suggested that the
Israelis were getting ahead of themselves and conducting an
internal debate. She said that Melchior was talking about conceding
outlying parts of Jerusalem, ``which are ours anyway,'' to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be something new on the face of it, but when you
look at the substance there is nothing new,'' she said.

BREAKAWAY IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 23, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news last week that the Greenland ice sheet is melting into
the ocean at the rate of 50 billion tons of water a year was a
sobering reminder that Alan Greenspan's ability to contrive yet
another soft landing is not the only thing we have to worry about
heading into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   There is global warming, too _ in this case nine inches added to
the water level over the last hundred years, according to an
article in Science magazine. And who knows at what rate in the
future?
</P>
<P>
   Happily, recent experience in the matter of controlling
atmospheric pollution is as reassuring as has been the long boom of
the past 20 years, nearly.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons to think that we possess the know-how
necessary to keep in check greenhouse gas emissions, or to
accommodate ourselves to those aspects of climate change that it
would be prohibitively expensive to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   This know-how consists, of course, of the technology of markets.
More than 30 years ago economist J. H. Dales wrote in ``Pollution,
Property and Prices'': ``If it is feasible to establish a market to
implement a policy, no policy-maker can afford to be without one.''
Today the consensus that government-maintained markets offer the
best hope of regulating many forms of pollution is becoming global
_ at least among the experts.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A here is Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, a ``cap and trade'' program that has made a good start at
reducing the sulfur dioxide emissions that are key contributors to
acid rain _ a prototype for a system to control the emission of
greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to fix an aggregate amount of pollution, assign and
distribute rights to firms, and let them trade permits among
themselves, thereby creating maximum flexibility in choosing how
and where to control emissions within industry as a whole. The
alternative is old-fashioned _ and far more expensive _
command-and-control regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The law came about in response to pressure from environmental
groups, Northeast states, and a Canadian government worried about
the effect of acid rain from coal-fired Midwest power plants on
down-wind forests and marine life.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush, who had campaigned on a promise to
be an ``environmental president,'' and his chief of staff, former
New Hampshire Governor John Sununu, teamed up with Democratic
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine to overcome the
opposition of Representative John Dingell (D-Mich.) and pass into
law a system of tradable sulfur dioxide emissions permits within a
stringent cap.
</P>
<P>
   It is working. Five years after going into effect, the statute
has cut acid rain in the Adirondacks by 26 percent from levels of
the previous decade. Sulfur dioxide levels per unit of output have
fallen 57 percent. (Nitrogen oxides, a big part of the acid rain
problem, were not addressed by the law.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the state of New York recently has engaged in a
silly and spiteful act that undermines the efficacy of the
cap-and-trade approach. Worried that progress against acid rain is
progressing too slowly in certain areas, environmental groups have
badgered the legislature into restricting participation in the
emissions market by New York firms.
</P>
<P>
   A new law levies fines on firms equal to their profits from the
sale of emission permits to power companies in 14 states: New
Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana,
Illinois, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia,
and North Carolina. The effect is indeed to cut sulfur dioxide
emissions somewhat overall, but at the cost of disproportionately
raising the price of power in New York.
</P>
<P>
   What is unsettling is the politics of the breakaway. Republican
New York Governor George E. Pataki signed the measure into law.
Meanwhile, a bill in the US Senate sponsored by Daniel Patrick
Moynihan and Charles Schumer would mandate a nationwide 70 percent
cut in sulfur dioxide emmissions, as opposed to the 50 percent
reduction required by the 1990 law. Such a sudden change would
effectively confiscate half the permits already issued for 2005 and
after.
</P>
<P>
   At the base of the New York law is a misapprehension: that
companies buy the permits instead of spending money on new plants
and equipment that would emit less pollutants. In fact they do
both. Upwind states invest $3.3 billion in scrubbers, lower-sulfer
fuel, and other changes, producing 5.1 million tons less of
atmospheric sulfur dioxide than the law allowed, according to a
critique of the New Yort statute by Paul Joskow and Danny Ellerman
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The two are
co-authors, with Richard Schmallensee, Juan-Pablo Montero, and
Elizabeth Bailey, of ``Markets for Clean Air: The US Acid Rain
Program,'' an authoritative account of developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to keep your eye on the ball in addressing
environmental problems,'' says Joskow. Maybe, he says, New York is
more worried about meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards
than about acid rain. In that case more cost-effective,
region-specific measures should be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Experts may understand cap-and-trade programs well enough, but
politicians have been slow to grasp the fact that, like any other
market, they won't work if the government constantly tampers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally found a program that works,'' says Joskow, who was
one of the architects of the 1990 law, ``and now we're gonna screw
it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Better not. Remember, the water is rising.

WAXING ELOQUENT ON CD BURNERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I bought a CD writer to make CDs from our 600
LPs. I am able to get the records to play through the computer
speakers.MDNM/ but still haven't been able to figure out how to get
LP tracks onto the CD. _ Stacks o' Wax
</P>
<P>
   Dear Stacks: When you hear how incredibly easy this is, you're
going to wonder why you just spent $18 for that new Backstreet Boys
CD, which cost maybe a quarter to manufacture. OK, make it 26 cents
if you feel obligated to pay the band what it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   And before all the editors and lawyers in the building have a
fit, let me remind you that making unauthorized copies of
copyrighted material is illegal, so whatever you do, don't
photocopy this column.
</P>
<P>
   Walk on any college campus, and you'll find hundreds of kids
churning out bootleg CDs on the computers their folks got them to
help them pass English 101. There's a whole network of Internet
sites devoted to storing tracks off popular albums.
</P>
<P>
   The band Metallica got so cheesed off by all of this that it
actually sued Napster, a music-lovers' Web site where _ entirely
coincidentally _ naughty boys and girls can find ways to download
music tracks from each others' computers. Metallica claimed
copyright infringement, but I still think it was the only way they
could make it back into ``Rolling Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Copying an entire CD is a no-brainer. Your CD-burner software
makes a disc image from the music CD, then it writes the image to a
blank CD-R, which costs a buck or less. If you want only certain
tracks, you have to do a little more work.
</P>

   Your burner software probably has the capability to take a
single CD track, remember what disc it came from, then prompt you
for it during the recording phase. If you don't want to shuffle all
those CDs, use CD ripper software, which takes individual tracks
and turns them into either uncompressed (.Wav) or compressed (MP3)
audio files on your hard drive. You then drag and drop them into
your burner software in the order you want. As your CD is being
recorded, the .Wavs or MP3s are converted into the standard CD
audio format.
</P>
<P>
   LPs are a little more work. You've already figured out that you
need to connect your stereo system's tape-out to the line-in jack
on the sound card. Tweak your sound-card software so that it
records with the highest quality, then use .Wav-recorder software
to capture the song as a file.
</P>
<P>
   You can use something as simple as the Windows Sound Recorder,
but there are shareware products that do a better job. I like CFB
Software's LPRecorder and LPRipper, both $20. The recorder makes a
single .Wav file from a side of the LP, and the ripper separates
the tracks into individual files. Check out the demos at

Metallica's lawyers.

WAXING ELOQUENT ON CD BURNERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I bought a CD writer to make CDs from our 600
LPs. I am able to get the records to play through the computer
speakers.MDNM/ but still haven't been able to figure out how to get
LP tracks onto the CD. _ Stacks o' Wax
</P>
<P>
   Dear Stacks: When you hear how incredibly easy this is, you're
going to wonder why you just spent $18 for that new Backstreet Boys
CD, which cost maybe a quarter to manufacture. OK, make it 26 cents
if you feel obligated to pay the band what it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   And before all the editors and lawyers in the building have a
fit, let me remind you that making unauthorized copies of
copyrighted material is illegal, so whatever you do, don't
photocopy this column.
</P>
<P>
   Walk on any college campus, and you'll find hundreds of kids
churning out bootleg CDs on the computers their folks got them to
help them pass English 101. There's a whole network of Internet
sites devoted to storing tracks off popular albums.
</P>
<P>
   The band Metallica got so cheesed off by all of this that it
actually sued Napster, a music-lovers' Web site where _ entirely
coincidentally _ naughty boys and girls can find ways to download
music tracks from each others' computers. Metallica claimed
copyright infringement, but I still think it was the only way they
could make it back into ``Rolling Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Copying an entire CD is a no-brainer. Your CD-burner software
makes a disc image from the music CD, then it writes the image to a
blank CD-R, which costs a buck or less. If you want only certain
tracks, you have to do a little more work.
</P>
<P>

DRUG PATENT SUIT RULING SEEN AS BOOST FOR AMGEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   US District Judge William Young Friday narrowed the patent
infringement trial between Amgen Inc. and Transkaryotic Therapies
Inc. by ruling TKT did not prove that the discoveries and prior
inventions found in Amgen's patents were widely known and were
therefore invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Hailed by some as a victory for Amgen, Young stopped short of
making any of the findings on patent infringement that Amgen
sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut tells me that if there's other evidence, I'd like to
hear it,'' said Young, who will reconvene the trial next Friday and
may recess the case until Sept. 5 when Amgen continues its rebuttal
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted to the judge's comments by boosting Amgen
shares, which hit a 52-week high closing at $78, up $3.9375, while
TKT shares fell $3.875 to $31.125 on heavy volume.
</P>
<P>
   The widely followed case has spotlighted the strength and
breadth of biotech patents.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether TKT is infringing on three key Amgen patents
for erythropoietin, the biggest-selling biotech drug _ $4 billion
in US sales last year _ that is universally used to stimulate red
blood cell production. Amgen markets the drug under the brand name
Epogen, primarily to treat anemia for kidney dialysis patients. The
drug is made by cloning a human gene and splicing it into chinese
hamster ovary cells.
</P>
<P>
   TKT claims it has developed EPO using ``gene activation''
technology, which turns on a ``switch'' inside human cells that
activates the dormant gene responsible for making EPO.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen maintains TKT is violating its patents, which TKT said are
overly broad, invalid and were obtained fraudulently.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Judge Young presented his views using a whiteboard
drawing with a big circle and two smaller nonoverlapping circles to
illustrate how he is grappling with whether a commonality exists
between Amgen's use of animal cells to make EPO and TKT's approach
using human cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is asking whether Amgen's EPO patents teach how to make EPO
using human cells and if they do there is infringement by TKT, but
for the moment he is not sure of this,'' said Kathy Williams,
cochairperson of the patent law practice of Palmer &AMP; Dodge, who has
been regularly attending the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Friday some courtroom observers and Wall Street analysts said
Young's ruling weakened TKT's case, but all agreed the small
company has plenty of other defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is still wide open, although the odds still favor
Amgen,'' said Elise Wang, PaineWebber's senior biotechnology
analyst. ``Based on the things the judge has said and the way he
has led the discussions with witnesses, there is a sense that he is
leaning more to Amgen's side of things. But until he makes a final
rulings, it is still tough to handicap.''
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Williams said Young's ruling did not impact TKT's
infringement and validity claims. She said Young has taken a
conservative approach, throwing out two of TKT's weakest issues _
prior inventions and anticipation that others in the scientific
field knew of the technology _ prior to Amgen receiving its
patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a big victory for Amgen,'' said Williams. ``He
(Young) wants to hear more evidence before he makes final decisions
on validity and infringement and that includes hearing witnessses
from the US Patent Office and from Amgen.''
</P>
<P>
   TKT claims Amgen committed fraud on the Patent Office and in an
unusual move, it plans to call Michael Boren, Amgen's inside patent
counsel, who in the 1980s drafted the company's patents. His
revisions of the early drafts of Amgen's patents, particularly on
the use of the term ``human EPO,'' and the role of the Patent
Office will be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``TKT has gotten the judge to think about the right issues,''
said Dr. Jonas Alsenas, a former ING Baring biotechnology analyst
who is now portfolio manager at ING Furman Selz Asset Management
Co. and who believes TKT ultimately will prevail in the trial.

 &HT;    Georgia-Pacific puts down new roots
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Can the prince of plywood go toe-to-toe with the likes
of Mr. Whipple?
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific thinks so. In a surprise move earlier this week,
Chairman and Chief Executive Pete Correll unleashed a major change
in direction for the Atlanta-based forest products giant. After 73
years of churning out lumber, pulp and other commodities,
Georgia-Pacific wants to flex its muscle in supermarkets and
Wal-Mart stores across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   In an $11 billion deal that would make it the world's largest
maker of paper towels and bathroom tissue, Georgia-Pacific plans to
buy rival Fort James. The merger would blow consumer products giant
Kimberly-Clark out of the top spot and team Brawny and Quilted
Northern brands with Georgia-Pacific's Sparkle and Angel Soft.
</P>
<P>
   Some tissue operations would be sold to help alleviate antitrust
concerns, but if the merger goes through as planned,
Georgia-Pacific would have nearly half the tissue market in North
America. And that would take the company right where Correll has
been steering it for several years _ in the faces of retail
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we're going is down the value chain. We've built
Georgia-Pacific as a raw-material-based commodity seller, and over
the past several years we've been moving toward a marketing-based
organization with brands,'' Correll said.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of the acquisition is that Georgia-Pacific would
be less prone to the ups and downs of prices in the pulp and lumber
businesses, Correll said. With Fort James' business, one-third of
Georgia-Pacific's profit would come from the steady market of
tissue and paper towels. (As one analyst pointed out, toilet
paper's not going out of style.)
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts didn't immediately warm to the
new-and-improved Georgia-Pacific. Some said the consumer focus is a
bit of a stretch for a company that built an empire on pine and
paneling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the thing we appreciated most about G-P was its
steadfast focus _ big, commodity businesses...,'' said analyst Mark
Connelly of Credit Suisse First Boston. ``...That made G-P stock
less risky than some of the big players, who diversified into all
sorts o square off in a marketing arena that has made a household
icon of grocer George Whipple and his ``Please, don't squeeze the
Charmin'' ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been somewhat embarrassed ...that people don't understand
how well we run our tissue business,'' Correll told analysts in New
York. The company has focused so much on outlining its financial
strategies of paying down debt, repurchasing stock and issuing
dividends that it has neglected to talk much about business
strategies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the company has bragging rights. Georgia-Pacific
has steadily taken market share from the top players since it got
into the branded tissue business in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is price. Angel Soft bathroom tissue and Sparkle
paper towels typically cost less than the top-selling brands.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's consistent growth couldn't have happened
without some marketing smarts, Correll noted. Georgia-Pacific hired
grocery store specialist Mike Burandt to launch its consumer tissue
sales. And marketing manager Rob Lorys has boosted the Sparkle
brand with the ``Healthsmart'' campaign, which gave it an
antibacterial spin. Beyond that, Georgia-Pacific's strength is its
relationship with retailers such as Wal-Mart, its biggest tissue
customer. About half its tissue business is driven by the
``big-box'' retailers, which like mass quantities of goods in
multiunit packages.
</P>
<P>
   Years of feeding Home Depot and Lowe's with big displays of
building materials has taught Georgia-Pacific how to catch the eye
of the consumer, Correll said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If tissue products were still being bought four rolls to a
bundle in your local grocery store, I would be scared to death to
compete with Procter &AMP; Gamble and Kimberly-Clark,'' Correll said.
``But you put them in a Target or a Wal-Mart or a Sam's (Club), you
bet we can compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't become the largest supplier to Home Depot...without
understanding retailing,'' Correll said.
</P>
<P>
   He'll continue taking that message on the road next week,
speaking to analysts and institutional investors, which make up
three-fourths of the company's shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The other part of the new strategy is getting rid of businesses
that don't fit the consumer focus.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific, founded in 1927 in a lumberyard in Augusta,
plans to sell 5 million acres of timberlands to Seattle-based Plum
Creek Timber Co.
</P>
<P>
   The company hasn't identified other operations it will sell, but
some analysts suspect the company's massive office paper business
will take a cut on the manufacturing end.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to let go of businesses that have been
their babies...if this is really going to work,'' said analyst
Linda Lieberman of Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific will certainly hang onto the distribution end of
the business, which it picked up through its acquisition of
Unisource Worldwide last year.
</P>
<P>
   Unisource's fleet of red trucks, branded with the
Georgia-Pacific name, has given the company an invaluable education
on consumer demand in delivering goods to Office Depot, Staples and
other big retailers, Correll said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how these moves will affect the company's large
building products business. Georgia-Pacific is the country's
largest maker of plywood and the second-largest lumber producer.
It's also a leading maker of gypsum products.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the company is going to keep its dominant place in
the aisles of Home Depot and Lowe's, where towering stacks of wood
products are emblazoned with the Georgia-Pacific logo.
</P>
<P>
   Correll said he will pursue products that can be branded with
the company's name on store shelves and likely weed out the no-name
raw materials that end up in other manufacturers' goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The middle American customer _ the guy who drives a pickup
truck and stays at Days Inn and shops at Wal-Mart and Home Depot...
is developing a unique relationship with (Georgia-Pacific),''
Correll said. ``And we're going to follow that customer through the
mass retail chain with a lot of value-added products.''

or 888-346-9867.)  
 (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television. Atomic energy. Biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   The mutual fund industry is 76 years old, but it still has a
teen-ager's crush on the latest fad. Some crushes stick. (Think
health care funds.) Some don't. (More later on the fate of the
nation's only golf fund.) Whatever the infatuation of the moment,
the industry remains on an eternal quest to subdivide new slivers
of the market in order to attract fresh money.
</P>
<P>
   The current buzzword is ``wireless.'' At least four funds that
focus on all things wireless have opened this year, and regulatory
paperwork has been filed for a fifth, from Fidelity Investments.
And the telecommunications fund sector, previously the best way to
play wireless stocks, has swelled from 10 funds at the end of 1998
to about 25 that are either open or in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the fund industry discovered the Internet. There are
now 20 to 30 Internet funds, up from just three in early 1998. But
now that the Internet reaches into every facet of technology, it
has become difficult to distinguish many Internet funds from
technology funds.
</P>
<P>
   The top holdings of the largest Internet fund, the $8.5 billion
Munder NetNet, include Cisco Systems, Verisign and JDS Uniphase;
they could be the top holdings of any technology fund, or of a
supposedly broad-based aggressive-growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   So will wireless funds simply be telecommunications funds in
flashier clothes?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the $4 billion Invesco Telecommunications fund, the
best-performing fund in its sector over the last five years. Its
manager, Brian B. Hayward, has almost 20 percent of his portfolio
in what he describes as wireless stocks, from companies that create
components for wireless devices to makers of finished products.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hayward has been cautious about wireless of late. It is
not because of the area's soaring valuations: Nokia, a leading
maker of cellular phone handsets and the consensus choice of money
managers looking for a must-have wireless play, trades at about 70
times earnings, about twice the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&AMP;P
500 stock index.
</P>
<P>
   But such valuations come with the territory, and Hayward sees
his favorite area, optical networking, as even more expensive _ and
more worth the price.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he hesitant on wireless? ``We started hearing of a
plateauing of growth in France,'' he said, speaking of his reading
of recent subscriber growth numbers in that country. ``Perhaps
handset growth won't have the upside potential we've seen over the
past 18 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Another concern, he added, is the skyrocketing prices being paid
by telecommunications companies for the right to use the radio-wave
spectrums to transmit more data to Internet-capable cell phones. In
a round of bidding in April, the British government extracted $36
billion for five spectrum licenses that will allow the transmission
of far more data than current technology does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs were five times greater than people expected,''
Hayward said. ``That was something hanging over wireless stocks the
past few months. The price has been extrapolated to other
countries, and that leaves companies with less money to build the
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is a wireless manager to buy? Seth Kirkham, 27,
co-manager of the $45 million Guinness Flight Wireless World fund,
pitches his fund as more than just a narrower version of a
telecommunications fund. ``We're going to play this theme right
across the economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That includes buying companies like Nordic Baltic Holdings, a
financial services company that lets customers use cell phones as
portable money machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last month, we've stayed away from the operators _ AT&AMP;T
Wireless, Sprint PCS, Vodafone Airtouch,'' Kirkham said. ``We still
think there's good value, but the market is becoming concerned with
licensing costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, whereas Hayward is building positions in companies
focused on the fiber optics end of the telecommunications sector,
like Corning and JDS Uniphase, Kirkham has instead focused on
wireless component builders like M Systems Flash Disk Pioneers,
which makes semiconductors used in wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   By design, then, wireless funds are likely to be more volatile
than telecommunications funds, just as many Internet funds have
proved to be more volatile than broad technology funds. Investors
might consider that 6 of the bottom 10 funds of the year have the
word Internet in their names.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, so good. The Wireless Fund from Value Trend Capital
Management is up 4.8 percent since its April inception. The Turner
Wireless and Communications fund is up 16 percent from its July 1
start, and the ProFunds Wireless Communications UltraSector fund is
up 8.5 percent during its one-month history. But Guinness Wireless
World is down 1.5 percent since it opened in February.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the real question for fund companies is whether the
public will buy. The jury is still out, but for Value Trend, a
money manager in El Cajon, Calif., wireless sure beats golf. After
more than a year, the company's Value Trend Links, the nation's
only golf-focused mutual fund, had gathered only $1.5 million in
assets. In four months, Value Trend's Wireless has gathered $30
million. Value Trend Links is being retrofitted as a growth fund _
there goes all that British Open cross-marketing potential.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola to test cold, smoothie-like coffee drink
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola may be getting into the coffee business in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to start test marketing a cold, smoothie-type
coffee beverage next month in four U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has repeatedly said that we're very actively
looking at developing a number of new, innovative beverage products
to drive our total beverage business,'' Coca-Cola spokeswoman Polly
Howes said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While Coke sells ready-to-drink coffee beverages in other
countries, it doesn't have such a product here.
</P>
<P>
   Beverage Digest reported Friday that the coffee drink will be
called ``Cafielle.'' Coke's current focus is to sell the drink
through fountains _ not in bottles or cans, Beverage Digest said.
There are likely to be two flavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a smart move,'' said John Sicher, Beverage Digest's
editor and publisher. ``The coffee beverage market in the U.S. is
still tiny and untapped, but could hold great potential.''

IN CHINA, A MANAGEMENT MAVERICK BUILDS A BRAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   QINGDAO, China _ At first, you notice the balloons. Thousands of
them, lining the sides of the road from the airport. Tethered at
the end of long strings, they bob and weave, the name Haier
emblazoned on each side. Then you notice the road signs, which say
Haier Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   You pass the Haier Industrial Park, with its sprawling factories
and a skyscraper with a sign on the roof that also says Haier. Once
in Qingdao, there are still more balloons and billboards. A giant
lighted Haier sign twinkles from the far side of the city's
crescent-shaped bay.
</P>
<P>
   To pay a call on the local Communist Party boss, you go to the
modern city hall, where the lobby has been transformed into a
showroom for Haier's refrigerators, dishwashers, personal
computers, mobile phones and flat-screen television sets.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Qingdao is a company town understates the degree to
which a single corporation, the Haier Group, has imprinted itself
on the landscape. Qingdao may be most famous as the home of
Tsingtao beer. But when you spy the brewery's red, green and blue
logo on a sign or storefront, it is a bit like finding an image of
Deng Xiaoping in a sea of Mao posters.
</P>
<P>
   Haier's exuberant self-promotion _ even more showy than usual
during a recent trade show here _ reflects the ambitions of its
chief executive, Zhang Ruimin. In an interview, Zhang said his
determination to put the Haier name everywhere was inspired less by
heroic images of Chinese leaders than by the brand marketing
practiced by Western corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese companies have a problem because the label `Made in
China' means low quality and low price,'' Zhang said. ``In 1996, we
started exporting products under our own brand name. We were told
it wouldn't work, but we insisted. Now we're successful with the
Haier name all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Haier Group, a sprawling enterprise ultimately
controlled by the city government here, has become China's largest
appliance maker, with sales of $3.2 billion last year. It is also
one of China's largest exporters, selling $1.4 billion of products
in 160 countries. This year, it opened a $30 million refrigerator
factory in Camden, S.C. _ becoming one of the few Chinese companies
to have an American beachhead.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's overseas focus might make sense, given the cutthroat
price war raging in China. On July 14, one of Haier's main rivals,
Guangdong Kelon Electrical Holdings, warned that its first-half
profit would be lower than expected because of the price pressure.
With deflation still ravaging the Chinese economy, stores are full
of unsold appliances.
</P>
<P>
   But why make fridges in South Carolina when China is much
cheaper? Zhang said he wants Americans to think of Haier as an
American company. Designing and making products in the United
States, he said, will allow Haier to be more responsive to American
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an era of globalization, you can't separate domestic and
international markets,'' Zhang explained. ``We've got to learn how
to compete with General Electric and Whirlpool on their home turf.
Otherwise, we'll lose the Chinese market.''
</P>
<P>
   Such confidence _ not to mention worldliness _ is rare in a
Chinese executive. It is even more remarkable from one who spent
his career in the parochial confines of the Qingdao municipal
government. At 51, Zhang has become a symbol of how Chinese
businessmen can remake themselves to meet the global economy's
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rank him as the Jack Welch of China,'' said Fred Hu,
chief Asian economist for Goldman, Sachs. ``In a country that has
been dominated by central planning and state control, he really
stands out.''
</P>
<P>
   T.L. Tsim, a consultant who studies Chinese state enterprises,
says marketing like Haier's is crucial to the country's
development. ``What China needs today are brand-name products,'' he
said. ``It takes years of work and millions of dollars of
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   By creating one of China's first genuine brands, Zhang himself
has become a marquee attraction. He is invited to speak at
conferences here and abroad. His views are sought by government
officials and journalists. And the story of how he built Haier from
the ruins of a state-owned factory has become a legend _ a
businessman's equivalent of the Long March.
</P>
<P>
   The short version: In 1984, Zhang was asked to run the Qingdao
General Refrigerator Factory, a lethargic, nearly bankrupt plant
where erratically paid, demoralized workers turned out shoddy
products.
</P>
<P>
   The Haier name, adopted in 1991, is a Chinese approximation of
Liebherr, a German appliance maker that supplied technology to the
factory in its early days.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang was not a likely candidate to produce a turnaround. A
bureaucrat who missed out on college because of the Cultural
Revolution, he worked his way up the Qingdao hierarchy in
anonymity. But he also devoured Western management books, which
taught him heretical ideas like the unfairness of paying every
worker the same wage, no matter his ability.
</P>
<P>
   Early in Zhang's tenure at the company, a customer complained
about a broken refrigerator, prompting the boss to stalk through
the factory pulling out 76 defective ones. He piled them up and
handed sledgehammers to the workers who had assembled them. At his
signal, they all set upon the fridges, reducing them to shards.
</P>
<P>
   That singular act of destruction impressed on employees that
poor quality would no longer be acceptable. Zhang has reinforced
the message with an aggressive Western-style quality-control
program. ``We cannot expect to smash refrigerators every day,'' he
said. ``But actually, I think about doing it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Zhang had improved the quality of Haier's products, he set
about exporting them to every corner of the world. Starting in
developing countries and then to developed markets, Haier now has
62 distributors and 30,000 sales outlets. Its small refrigerators
are especially popular in hotel minibars; it has a 25 percent share
of the small refrigerator market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Haier says its exports and a diversified line that runs to 9,000
goods in 42 categories have allowed it to avoid the downdraft in
domestic prices that has afflicted its rivals. Because Haier's
shares are listed in Shanghai _ where financial disclosure is not
as rigorous as in Hong Kong _ analysts say it is difficult for
outsiders to assess the impact falling prices have had on Haier's
performance. ``It's hard to imagine Haier has escaped it,'' said
Charles Cheung, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Haier would like to list its shares outside China. But it has
put off its plans because of volatile Asian markets and the need to
streamline its baffling amalgam of dozens of holding companies and
joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
   When Haier does make its pitch, analysts say, it will have to
answer some hard questions. First, why is it building factories
overseas? For all of Zhang's explanations, analysts say that it is
squandering its advantage as a low-cost producer.
</P>
<P>
   Second, why does Haier need a soup-to-nuts product line?
Guangdong Kelon makes refrigerators, air-conditioners and washing
machines. Zhang wants to supply every electrical appliance in the
household. Doing that while maintaining quality is tricky.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Haier branched into pharmaceuticals. Zhang did
so because he is convinced that biotechnology will be one of the
great industries of the 21st century. But he acknowledged that
Haier had struggled so far. ``We may fail in that field,'' he said
without a hint of defensiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Risking failure, after all, is the mark of a modern company.

PUTIN GIVES CLINTON AN EARFUL SEEKING TO KILL MISSILE SHIELD
</HEADLINE>
  By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAHA, Japan _ At the summit meeting here of eight world leaders,
where the focus was unremittingly on harmony, President Vladimir
Putin of Russia met with President Clinton Friday night to argue
against U.S. deployment of a national missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   The two met during a break in the meeting of seven leading
industrial nations and Russia that is under way here in Okinawa.
National missile defense was the most attention-getting issue,
because it exposed a rift in a well-scripted gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joined Putin in a casual setting, a private dining room
overlooking a hotel pool. Clinton wore a tan suit and an exhausted
look. Putin, in a dark blue suit, shook Clinton's hand vigorously
for the photographers but offered no Boris Yeltsin-style bear hug.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by aides, the two men spent 75 minutes discussing and
disagreeing on security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Of the national missile defense system, a senior administration
official said, ``President Clinton made clear, as he has publicly,
that he has not made a decision, but he intends to make a decision
during the course of this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who met recently with the leaders of China and North
Korea to solidify opposition to the building of such a system,
briefed Clinton on an offer by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong
Il, to scrap his missile program if other countries provide him
with rockets to explore space. U.S. officials have reacted with
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not entirely clear what is in Kim Jong Il's mind with
regard to this possible trade-off,'' one official said. ``A very
dangerous idea would be that the international community would
provide actual launch capability to North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin was not the only leader making the case against a U.S.
missile shield. President Jacques Chirac of France, speaking to
reporters, said the system might never work but nonetheless would
prompt an arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's of a nature to re-trigger a proliferation of weapons,
notably nuclear missiles,'' Chirac said. ``Everything that goes in
the direction of proliferation is a bad direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany sided with the critics
of the system, saying simply, ``I'm skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   But such disagreement was rare. Common ground was what this
annual meeting was all about. For instance, Clinton and Putin
issued a statement saying they would set up a center for the
exchange of data between systems that provide early warning in case
of a missile launching.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the eight nations discussed other topics ranging from
debt relief for developing nations and AIDS, to oil prices and
financial crime. ``We are deeply concerned about the growth of
armed conflict in the continent of Africa,'' said one unanimous
decree.
</P>
<P>
   Official events took place in a majestic seaside resort, the
Cape Busena. Journalists, protesters and even top aides were
stopped in their tracks at the front door. Few people with last
names other than Clinton or Blair or Amato or Chirac or Chretien or
Mori or Putin or Schroeder could stroll easily through the metal
detectors.
</P>
<P>
   All of the leaders seemed to be sweating, and plainly not
because of the intensity of the meeting. Chirac was wiping his
forehead as he stopped in the hotel lobby to admire Okinawan
schoolchildren in traditional dress who were beating drums and
singing.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning Clinton and Japan's Prime Minister, Yoshiro
Mori, sat down to discuss economic and foreign policy issues.
Later, they planted a tree together.
</P>
<P>
   In the giant media centers set up in hotel ballrooms across the
island to accommodate the thousands of reporters covering the
meeting, ``officials,'' ``senior administration officials'' and
some people actually willing to use their real names briefed them
on everything from the volatility of oil prices to the trade in
illicit diamonds in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the area of debt reduction, there was a very lengthy and
very good exchange,'' said Lael Brainard, Clinton's adviser on
international economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Middle East also came up repeatedly Friday, as leaders
congratulated Clinton on his peacemaking efforts. Clinton planned
to remain here on Saturday, but his spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said
the president might scale back his schedule on Sunday to hurry back
to Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa clearly was full of action, but Thomas Foley, the U.S.
ambassador to Japan, staged a summit-related event on a tinier
island off the coast. Reporters boarded a ferry to photograph Foley
unveiling a plaque honoring the memory of Ernie Pyle, the
celebrated war correspondent who died on Ie Shima during the Battle
of Okinawa in 1945.

 &HT;    Report clears government in 1993 siege
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The government was resolved of wrongdoing at Mount
Carmel in 1993 for the second week in a row Friday with the release
of Special Counsel John Danforth's interim report.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth was appointed by U.S. attorney general Janet Reno last
September to investigate the ``dark questions'' regarding the FBI's
actions on April 19, 1993, which saw a fire after a tear-gas
assault that led to the deaths of David Koresh and 75 followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind about the conclusions of this
report,'' Danforth stated in the report's preface. ``Government
agents did not start or spread the tragic fire... did not direct
gunfire at the Branch Davidians and did not unlawfully employ the
armed forces of the United States,'' he stated.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's report also concluded that the government did not
engage in a massive cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   However, it accused several people within the government of
trying to hide the fact that military tear gas canisters, which are
pyrotechnic, were shot at the covering over an underground tunnel
at Mount Carmel. Danforth called their actions ``puzzling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``... because the use of these pyrotechnics had nothing to do
with the fire,'' the report said. ``They were used four hours
before the fire began, 75 feet from the Branch Davidian residence,
and in a manner that would cause no harm. Yet the failure to
disclose this information, more than anything else, is responsible
for the loss of the public faith in the government's actions at
Waco, and it led directly to this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction was mixed to Danforth's report, split along which side
of the Waco's federal courthouse one sat on during the Davidians'
wrongful-death lawsuit. An advisory jury on July 14, like Danforth,
found the government was not guilty of wrongdoing at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh issued a statement praising Danforth's
report for being ``vigorous and thorough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of public recitation of the complete facts can only
serve to support the long-term best interests of the FBI and our
desire to be fully accountable to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   However, former U.S. attorney general Ramsey Clark, who
represented most of the longtime Davidians at the civil trial, said
that Danforth's focus on whether the FBI was guilty of atrocities
at Mount Carmel skewed his perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like judging a diver's performance off the high dive and
failing to mention there wasn't any water in the pool,'' Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth should have examined the appropriateness of the entire
government operation, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does it by looking at the dark side, but you have to look
at everything that happened,'' Clark said. ``We can't really want
law enforcement to do that again. I never in my life expected to
see ATF go out there like that. It was an invitation to disaster.
The same thing with the tanks. We shouldn't praise or glorify those
who did it just because they didn't go in there and slit throats.
The people are just as dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bradford, the government co-counsel at the civil trial,
disagreed with Clark's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it answers the important questions,'' said Bradford,
the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas. ``It gets to
the heart of whether the agencies acted in good faith and who was
responsible for the tragedy. Those were the questions most
troubling to people, and both were thoroughly addressed by Danforth
and by the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Danforth investigation was done by 17 private
lawyers and 38 postal investigators to ensure it was independent of
the Justice Department. About 900 witnesses were interviewed, and
2.3 million pages of documents were examined. Danforth said he
expects to spend $11 million to $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the St. Louis press conference where he released the report,
Danforth blamed Koresh for the tragedy at Mount Carmel,
</P>
<P>
   ``The blame rests squarely on the shoulders of David Koresh,''
Danforth said. He added, ``This is not a close call.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth wrote in his report that most of the Davidians did not
want to escape the fire. He noted that a Davidian who did escape
told FBI agents that he witnessed others in the group make no
effort to leave. Also, Ruth Ottman tried to go back into a burning
Mount Carmel and had to be pulled out by an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Danforth blamed the Davidians for starting the fire.
</P>
<P>
   His report relates fire-related comments by Davidians picked up
by surveillance bugs planted inside Mount Carmel, such as ``I want
a fire on the front... you two can go.'' ``Keep that fire going.''
``Do you think I could light this fire soon?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only plausible explanation for these comments is that some
of the Davidians were executing their plan to start a fire,''
Danforth wrote.

FOES SEEK TO DISQUALIFY BUCHANAN IN STUDY OF PETITION NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what both sides consider an all-out war for control of the
Reform Party, opponents of Pat Buchanan's efforts to win the party
presidential nomination say they have evidence of irregularities by
his campaign in the primary that could disqualify him from the
balloting.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of party officials has been appointed to audit the
400,000 petition signatures collected by Buchanan and by his
opponent, John Hagelin, a physicist who has twice run for president
under the Natural Law Party banner.
</P>
<P>
   Petition signers would otherwise be sent primary ballots for
voting, which began this month and concludes when the party
convention begins in three weeks. If the signatures cannot be
verified as party members or as people who have requested a ballot,
they would be invalidated, and the candidate who submitted the
names could be removed from the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The audit is expected to be completed next week. Several party
leaders who oppose Buchanan said they were certain that the results
would show that his campaign violated the rules by submitting the
names of people who were not qualified to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation is that the Buchanan campaign committed
widespread fraud in attempting to corrupt the process and steal the
nomination,'' said Jim Mangia, the national party secretary who is
leading the campaign against Buchanan along with Russell J. Verney,
an associate of Ross Perot, the party founder.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan campaign denied the accusations, saying the audit
would prove that they were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mangia is trying to invent any way he can to subvert the
process because he can't defeat us legitimately,'' said Brian
Doherty, a spokesman for the Buchanan campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the signatures submitted by Buchanan were first
raised by Hagelin and his supporters, who are waging a long-shot
campaign to win the nomination. But the cause was rapidly embraced
by Reform leaders who are concerned that Buchanan would change the
ideological direction of the party, infusing it with a social
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they became suspicious when the petitions
included thousands of names from states like New York, California
and South Carolina, where Reform candidates were not required to
gather signatures because the party was already on the November
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Mangia and the campaign managers for Hagelin, Kingsley Brooks
and Nadine Padower, said many of the names were those of Buchanan
supporters and contributors from his days in the Republican Party
who had no connection to the Reform Party, which Buchanan joined
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The audit panel, which has four members and includes a
representative from each campaign, will try to sort through the
names and determine if there are irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Kresky, an official with the Reform Party in New York and
a panel member, said the audit would probably start on Monday,
assuming the two campaigns had provided the material needed to
validate each signature.
</P>
<P>
   If improprieties are found, the panel would make a
recommendation to the presidential nominating committee for a final
disposition that could be appealed to the executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he were disqualified from the primary, Buchanan could
still become the nominee if two-thirds of the delegates attending
the convention next month in Long Beach, Calif., vote to invalidate
the primary and install Buchanan.

GUILTY PLEAS IN CAVIAR-SMUGGLING OPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Capping a case that exposed a large-scale caviar smuggling ring,
a Maryland company, two of its officials and a third person pleaded
guilty Friday to federal fraud, smuggling and wildlife endangerment
charges. The company agreed to pay a $10.4 million fine, which
prosecutors described as the largest ever in a wildlife smuggling
case.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty pleas, entered in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt,
Md., followed a prolonged investigation of a sophisticated
black-market operation. The inquiry ranged from the shores of the
Caspian Sea and the Mississippi River to the first-class cabins of
American Airlines jets and the shelves of gourmet stores in
Manhattan, Greenwich, Conn., and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The illicit operation was part of a continuing illegal trade in
the eggs of sturgeon, huge bottom-feeders that live a century or
more and reproduce slowly, whose high-priced roe have made them a
target of poachers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the scheme, Justice Department officials said, was the
illegal importing of roe from several Caspian Sea sturgeon species
protected by an international conservation treaty. Another part,
they said, entailed falsely representing roe from two American
species _ the shovelnose sturgeon and the paddlefish _ as legally
imported Sevruga caviar.
</P>
<P>
   The company that admitted guilt Friday was U.S. Caviar &AMP; Caviar,
one of the largest caviar importers in the country. From 1995 to
1999, according to court records, the company channeled tons of
illegally harvested fish eggs from the Caspian and other waters to
its offices in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the roe was smuggled into the country in large
containers and was repackaged in Rockville, where workers placed it
in caviar tins that bore counterfeit labels, some with fake Russian
health agency certification seals. In other cases, the labels,
printed in Rockville, were shipped to the Middle East, where
Kenfood Trading, another company involved in the operation,
packaged some of the roe in caviar tins and sent them on to
Rockville.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 alone, the operation funneled more than 18 tons of
sturgeon caviar from the Caspian. The quantity of roe smuggled from
Russia by U.S. Caviar &AMP; Caviar was so great that it exceeded the
total amount that could be legally exported from the country under
international treaties.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was aimed in part at meeting the high demand for
caviar in the months leading up to millennium celebrations around
the world, Justice Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The first hint of it came in December 1998, when an inspector
for the Fish and Wildlife Service at Baltimore-Washington
International Airport noticed something odd about the labels in a
shipment of caviar tins: The labels were of the peel-off variety,
said Thomas Healy, the senior inspector in the agency's Baltimore
office, whereas genuine labels on Russian caviar are glued on.
</P>
<P>
   The three men who entered guilty pleas Friday are Hossein
Lolavar, 46, president of U.S. Caviar &AMP; Caviar; Faye Briggs, 53,
the company's sales manager; and Ken Noroozi, 42, president of
Kenfood Trading, which handled some of the illegal trade through
the United Arab Emirates. All three men face at least a year's
imprisonment when they are sentenced in December, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Healy, the fish and wildlife inspector, said the prosecutions
had probably made a significant dent in the larger illicit trade in
the roe of protected fish, but added that no one really had a good
idea of the trade's size.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in the last two years, couriers carrying suitcases
jammed with caviar tins had been caught at airports in Boston, New
York, Miami, Los Angeles and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a national problem,'' he said.

AMERICAN SOLIDIFIES LEAD IN BICYCLE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MULHOUSE, France _ Lance Armstrong, who says he draws his
motivation from both positive and negative sources, had both of
them at his disposal Friday and blended them expertly to win a long
individual time trial in the Tour de France by 25 seconds and
solidify his overall lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a yellow suit that was furnished to him hours earlier by
the race's organizers as a symbol of his leadership, the star of
the U.S. Postal Service team rode with power and smooth authority
over the 58.5-kilometer course (about 36 miles) from Germany to
France in hot weather to finish first in 1 hour 5 minutes 1 second.
He averaged 53.9 kilometers an hour (33.5 mph), the fastest pace at
that distance in the Tour's 87 years.
</P>
<P>
   Second was Jan Ullrich, the German leader of the Telekom team,
the winner of the 1997 Tour and the favorite of many fans in this
individual race against the clock. Christophe Moreau, a Frenchman
with Festina, was third, 2:12 behind, with Tyler Hamilton, another
American with Postal Service and Armstrong's lieutenant in the
mountains, fourth, 3:01 behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big fight,'' Armstrong said. ``Jan is a big engine. I
went all out, as the yellow jersey is supposed to do. This was nice
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring illness or accident, the victory guaranteed Armstrong's
second successive victory in the Tour when it ends Sunday in Paris.
Ullrich remained in second place over all, going from 5:37 behind
at the start to 6:02 now, with Joseba Beloki, a Spaniard with
Festina, still in third place but now 10:04 behind.
</P>
<P>
   Enormous crowds lined the road in the 38 kilometers (23.6 miles)
the race traversed in Germany before passing into France for the
final 20.5. The German police estimated the crowd at 1.5 million
for the stage Thursday from Lausanne, Switzerland, to Freiburg, and
it seemed comparable Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan said earlier that he feared the size of the crowd,
both because it might make the few tight turns difficult by
overflowing the sidewalk and because there might be some fan of
Ullrich's who would try to prevent the American from beating the
Telekom leader.
</P>
<P>
   If, at the 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) time check, he had no chance
of victory, Armstrong continued, he would probably slow down to
prevent any possible aggression. But the American led Ullrich by
five seconds and the rest of the 129-man field by a minimum of 1:40
at that point and kept on pushing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he had plenty of motivation, both positive and
negative.
</P>
<P>
   The positive influence was his desire not to become the fifth
Tour winner since World War II and the first since 1990 not to have
won a daily stage when the three-week race is done. It ends in
Paris on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said 10 days ago that he did not care how many times
he finished second _ three in this 87th Tour _ as long as he was
first in Paris, he has changed his tune lately. ``I would be
disappointed not to win a stage,'' he admitted this week. Last
year, in his first Tour victory, he won four stages to go with two
in previous races.
</P>
<P>
   The negative influence was this question asked at a news
conference Thursday by an Italian journalist: ``Do you think
Ullrich can make up the 5:37 and win the Tour tomorrow?''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong called it one of the dumbest questions he had been
asked, and he refused to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise relaxed and friendly, bantering at 40 kilometers an
hour (24.8 mph) as he moved along on his bicycle with a team car
escorting him, he reported that he was feeling good and promised,
with a confident smile, to give his answer in the Tour's press room
after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the guy who asked that question yesterday?'' Armstrong
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich was heavily favored to win the stage because, as
Armstrong put it a few days ago, ``It's in his adopted hometown,
and that gives you a big push.''
</P>
<P>
   The German, a native of Rostock in the east, has lived for years
in the village of Merdigen, a sprint away from the start in
Freiburg. Many of the flat roads used in the time trial were the
same ones Ullrich used in training and he undoubtedly passed many
of the suppliers of the cream pies that the habitually overweight
rider puts away in quantity every winter.
</P>
<P>
   After riding himself into top condition in the first two weeks
of the Tour, Ullrich looked svelte Friday in the jersey of the
world time trial champion. He rode splendidly, but 26 seconds too
slowly.

ABC ABANDONS PLAN TO PUT ADS ON ANSWERING MACHINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC has backed away from a controversial plan to use sitcom
stars like Norm MacDonald to promote its fall lineup by leaving
taped messages on the home answering machines of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after the network, known for aggressively
seeking unusual new ways to promote its programming, outlined the
plan this week to reporters at an annual fall-season briefing in
Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The network's plan was to hire a company specializing in what is
known as voice-mail broadcasting technology to call viewers at home
in the 10 largest television markets and leave messages promoting a
new lineup of four sitcoms on Friday nights. The messages would
have been prerecorded by actors including MacDonald, for his
series, ``Norm,'' and Gabriel Byrne, for his sitcom, ``Madigan
Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Voice-mail broadcasting is just one novel method being used by
giant marketers to capture the attention of pitch-weary consumers.
Already, ABC, part of Walt Disney Co., affixes stickers to bananas,
prints ads on pizza boxes and festoons the wrappers of after-dinner
mints at restaurants with network logos.
</P>
<P>
   But the about-face by ABC's top marketing executives on the
voice-mail broadcasts, which met with widespread skepticism from
reporters at the briefing, is emblematic of the tug of war as
advertisers test the limits of what consumers will deem acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plans for the fall include a lot of unusual media forms to
get `buzz' for some of our shows,'' Alan Cohen, executive vice
president for marketing, advertising and promotion at ABC in Los
Angeles, said in a telephone interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had Norm MacDonald call you and remind you his show was
on, we thought it would be fun, the type of thing people usually
tell their friends about,'' said Cohen, who supervises a department
at ABC that develops ideas to promote the network's programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the reaction in that room caused us to think about the
possible down side,'' he added. ``Maybe people would think it's a
little bit intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation came despite procedures outlined by the company
ABC hired, Voice Mail Broadcasting Corp. in Irvine, Calif., to
minimize potential complaints from consumers about the telephoned
commercials, which were to run for 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company makes calls during the day, when most people
aren't around,'' Cohen said, to increase the odds that answering
machines would pick up the calls. And if a person answered the
phone, he added, ``they'd get a busy signal'' rather than hearing a
hangup or having to listen to the recording.
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe people would get alarmed,'' Cohen said, ``and we do
respect our viewers. So if there's any risk associated with these
alternative media forms, it's something we're not going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC is, however, sticking with a plan for the 2000-2001 season
to have restrooms in bars or restaurants fitted with digital audio
chips that deliver spots promoting ``Norm,'' also using recordings
of MacDonald, when they sense people moving around. Cohen said that
plan ``makes sense for `Norm'; it's such a `guy' show.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, car dealers and sports teams have long used the
telephone as an advertising medium, but most corporate users of
voice-mail broadcasting have been local marketers. ABC would have
been one of the first national advertisers to join their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-mail broadcasting uses a technology known as voice
recognition to leave the digitally prerecorded messages. In many
instances, the voices are familiar: actors like MacDonald and
Byrne, athletes like Grant Hill, business executives like Donald
Trump and even President Clinton, who record the messages so they
can be delivered to anywhere from 10,000 to 7 million homes at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-mail broadcasting turns topsy-turvy the notion of
traditional telemarketing, which strives to sell directly to a
potential customer. But now, after years of alienating people with
barrages of badgering calls read from scripts, advertisers believe
someone is generally more likely to listen to a brief commercial
than put up with a peddler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less intrusive than having a live telemarketer on the
line,'' said Jesse Crowe, president at Voice Mail Broadcasting, the
company ABC had hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always hit `delete,''' Crowe said of the answering
machine message. ``It's no different than when you have a
commercial on television.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics are denouncing voice-mail broadcasting as another
exploitation of technology, like installing video screens at
checkout counters to display ads or fitting restrooms with audio
chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly doesn't spare the sanctity of the home from those
who would intrude,'' said Gary Ruskin, director of Commercial Alert
in Washington, an advocacy organization founded by Ralph Nader.
``It's another example of how advertisers and marketers respect no
boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, voice-mail broadcasters take issue with that
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When companies first developed automatic dialing capabilities
in the '80s, marketers jumped on it and drove people crazy,'' said
Rob Tuttle, chief executive at Broadcast Team Inc. in Ormond Beach,
Fla., which offers voice-mail broadcasting services under the brand
name Real Call Message Delivery System.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread complaints led to the Telephone Consumer Protection
Act, passed by Congress in 1991, ``which stopped a lot of
unsolicited junk calling,'' he added, by clamping limits on
telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission has been scrutinizing
voice-mail broadcasting because some practices could run afoul of
the law. For example, the law stipulates that prerecorded pitches
cannot be used to complete sales over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-mail broadcasters respond that there is no sale being made
when, say, Dick Clark Productions has calls placed with a
prerecorded message by Clark urging people to watch the American
Music Awards, one of his annual TV specials.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can have their names and telephone numbers removed
from the calling lists used by telemarketers by contacting the
Telephone Preference Service of the Direct Marketing Association,
an industry trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3.3 million people have registered with the Telephone
Preference Service of the Direct Marketing Association to be
removed from calling lists used by telemarketers. That's almost as
many as the 3.8 million people who have registered with the Mail
Preference Service administered by the association to have their
names and addresses removed from mailing lists.
</P>
<P>
   To be taken off the lists used by telemarketers, send your name,
home address and telephone number to: Direct Marketing Association,
Telephone Preference Service, P.O. Box 9014, Farmingdale, NY
11735-9014.

</P>
<P>
   Voice-mail broadcasting, ``like any technological advance, has
its upside and its downside,'' said Bill Pascoe, press secretary at
the Republican National Committee in Washington, which along with
its Democratic counterpart has used the tactic to encourage voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can reach a lot of people a lot faster because you don't
have to wait to talk to a real live person,'' Pascoe said. He said
he believed complaints about voice-mail broadcasting were minimal:
``I defer to the experts. If they're using it, they've tested it.''
</P>
<P>
   One aspect that particularly irks consumer advocates is what
happens when a person picks up the call. The broadcast systems are
usually programmed to hang up when the call is not answered after
three or four rings. But errors can cause hangups on callers who
answer the phones before the machines do, something that the
consumer advocates say can be disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, we did do that,'' Crowe at Voice Mail
Broadcasting said, ``but we shifted over to a busy signal. When
people hear that, they don't think anything of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics remain unmoved by such explanations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respectable people will do to people they don't know what they
wouldn't do to their worst enemies,'' said Bob Bulmash, president
of Private Citizen Inc. in Naperville, Ill., a consumer privacy
advocacy organization. ``Voice-mail broadcasting is another example
of the clear disregard of our right to be left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if ABC would ever consider voice-mail broadcasting
again, Cohen said: ``It's something we're putting aside. Our
comfort level was just not there and I don't think that'll
change.''
</P>
<P>
   And when will the harnessing of technology for commercial
purposes end? Bulmash was as sanguine as someone whose dinner was
interrupted by a telemarketer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as capitalism is what drives the United States,''
Bulmash said, ``it will not end.''

 &HT;    Maurice vs. Michael: track's marquee matchup
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Michael Johnson vs. Maurice Greene. It's a
matchup bombastic boxing promoter Don King would love.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States Olympic Track and Field Trials heads into
its second weekend here, there's no doubt what the main attraction
of the meet will be. It's the heavyweight championship of sprinting
between Johnson, the world record holder in the 200 and 400 meters,
and Greene, the world record holder in the 100 meters. The
much-anticipated matchup on Sunday will be over quicker than one of
Mike Tyson's recent fights, and it comes complete with all the
smack talking that's used to hype fights.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week Johnson said, ``Rivalries are good for the
sport. I tune in when there are two guys boxing that don't like
each other. The people you don't like, you certainly don't want to
lose to. It intensifies the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ultimate `put up or shut up' in this sport,
especially the sprints,'' Greene said. ``You've got to believe
you're the best, and talking about it makes it a little more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Even sprinters who aren't running here have gotten into the act.
Ato Boldon, who'll be racing for Trinidad and Tobago, said,
``Sprinters talk, boxers talk. Michael Johnson says the rest of the
field is `company.' Well, I hope he's preparing for company.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprinters, like many boxers before the Muhammad Ali era, once
were a quiet lot. Jesse Owens didn't talk trash, he let his times
do his talking. The professionalization of track certainly helped
change the atmosphere. No longer are sprinters one and done in the
Olympics before moving on to real-world careers. Now, they're
around for two or three Olympics, and they're not only competing
for the fastest times, but also for the appearance and endorsement
money that they once could be banned for accepting.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Lewis wasn't merely a sprinter/long jumper, he became a
track celebrity. Lewis said what was on his mind, and Ben Johnson
was on his mind a lot. Lewis believed, and was eventually proved
correct, that Johnson's speed wasn't all natural, that it was
enhanced by a banned substance. Lewis vs. Johnson turned sprinting
into a bad-blood grudge match.
</P>
<P>
   Then, along came loquacious Donovan Bailey, a Canadian who
trains in Austin and doesn't mind ruffling anyone's feathers. He
likes it when he can make other sprinters edgy. With Bailey, the
100-meter gold medalist in Atlanta, the Canada-U.S. sprint team
duel often turned into a war of words.
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't enough, some sprinters started striking poses,
something Lewis didn't do. Some sprinters are now built like
bodybuilders and actually flex after winning.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is right at home in that kind of atmosphere. He points
and gestures and struts and jabbers after he wins a race. The
9.79-second 100 meters he clocked in Athens on June 16 last year
made him the world's fastest human. His vanity license plate reads
``Mo Gold.'' The Mo could stand for the 200 meters. Greene won
that, as well as the 100 meters, at the World Championships last
year, becoming the first man to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The 200, however, has been owned by Johnson. The Baylor graduate
blistered a 19.32 in that event at the Atlanta Olympics, setting a
world record that some experts believe could stand for decades. His
400-meter record of 43.18 seconds isn't shabby either. Most believe
Johnson to be the best ever at running the curves. When Lewis was
ending his reign, Johnson carefully positioned himself to be ``The
Man'' in track, going for and completing the much-publicized 200
and 400 meter double in Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while taking over Lewis' Superman role, Johnson hasn't
become the celebrity Lewis was. Although his charm is lost on some,
Lewis is an engaging athlete, bright and interested in more than
just his own career. Johnson is one of today's modern breed of
athletes who can throw up a wall when he's around people. He's
rarely funny, sometimes almost surly.
</P>
<P>
   Other athletes are jealous of his status. Some predictions he
made in USA Today weren't laughed off by other athletes. Some,
especially the female sprinters, were chagrined by what they
perceived as slights. Johnson didn't apologize; he told them to
grow up, the way he has Greene, labeling him ``immature.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson huffed, ``I don't like a lot of things Maurice has said.
What Maurice is trying to be, which is to become a great sprinter
and supplant me as the premier track athlete, can be done without
personal attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Greene have met only twice in the 200, with each
winning a race. Greene, seemingly taking a page from boxing
promotion, has claimed that Johnson has lately been ducking him.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson is at his best, it's a knockout. As Johnson put it,
``What motivation do I need to beat up on a 19.9 guy?'' But, in a
1997 made-for-TV sprint match it was Johnson who suffered a TKO
loss to Bailey, pulling up lame with Bailey winning in Toronto.
Greene plans to jump out ahead of Johnson and make him run faster
than he wants to go, so anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   After all it's boxing ... uh, track.

 &HT;    Aikman, Cowboys revamping offense
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ On the first day of training camp, dozens of
photographers crowded around Troy Aikman as he carried his clothes
and other personal belongings from his car to his room at the
dorms.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the same routine for a dozen years. The quarterback
of the Dallas Cowboys shakes his head, wondering what the fuss is
all about. He resembles a Hollywood star on his way to the Oscars.
If photographers want to waste their time taking pictures of a man
carrying a stack of jeans and T-shirts, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   This is the worst day of the year for Aikman, an old codger at
33.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the routine of training camp is nearing an end. Aikman is
not the fresh-faced phenom who was the No. 1 pick of the 1989
draft. The aches and pains that accompany each NFL season have
taken their toll on No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many years I have left,'' Aikman said after
completing his first camp workout in 106-degree sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   He pauses to reflect on his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going into my 12th year,'' he resumes. ``As I've said
before, I'm not going to play 12 more.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, players often speak about their ``window of
opportunity.'' The Cowboys have squeezed out three Super Bowl
championships under Aikman, but a five-year absence from Super
Sunday suggests Aikman's opportunities are about to shut.
</P>
<P>
   The window of opportunity is closing fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``How close is it to being shut? That's year to year.''
</P>
<P>
   Like bluebonnets in the spring, there is a freshness to every
season. The Cowboys haven't lost a game yet, and if you listen
closely, they see no reason they can't win every game. An influx of
new blood, from wide receiver Joey Galloway to cornerback Ryan
McNeil, gives them reason to be optimistic in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, who knows what will happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``It will all come out in the wash,'' Aikman said. ``We'll get a
chance to line up and play. I'd hate to just give you a sound bite
because you could go back to last year's (media) coverage and get
the same one.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism has spread like hay fever in Wichita Falls because
Aikman's offense has a new look. Or is it an old look? When Dave
Campo succeeded Chan Gailey as head coach of the Cowboys this
spring, he hired some familiar faces to revamp the team. The
new/old offense is designed to take advantage of Aikman's ability
to read pass coverages and throw to a certain spot.
</P>
<P>
   When the quarterback and his receivers are on the same page, the
system is hard to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Jerry Jones has overseen the offensive overhaul. It
was his decision to hire a coach ``from the family.'' He admits
that hiring Gailey, a former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive
coordinator, was one of his worst moves in the 12 years he has
owned the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious change during the first week of camp has been
the addition of speed. Receivers Rocket Ismail, James McKnight and
Galloway are as fast as any group of receivers in the league. If
nothing else, the Cowboys should add excitement in games by
throwing deep passes with reckless abandon.
</P>
<P>
   The early results have been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has had trouble connecting with Galloway, perhaps the
fastest Cowboys receiver since Bullet Bob Hayes. Aikman's passes
have been underthrown, overthrown or missed their mark completely.
It isn't easy throwing to a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey and I will get better even after we break camp,'' Aikman
said. ``I don't want to be naive and say we're going to be where we
want to be when we break camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Reilly knows it will take time. Campo's choice for
offensive coordinator worked with Aikman in 1997 and they have a
good relationship. The Cowboys needed to change an offense that
ranked 24th in the league in passing last year. They were boring
and predictable. And less exciting than a Michael Bolton concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have a real deep threat now,'' he said. ``People
have to respect that. It opens everything up. If they don't, we'll
have to throw it down the field.''
</P>
<P>
   With all this talk about passing deep, one major element of the
offense has been nearly forgotten: Emmitt Smith. One of the best
running backs in NFL history likely will get fewer carries because
the Cowboys plan to throw more than usual. But Campo stresses that
``offensive balance wins games'' and Smith accepted the change of
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I think we were a little high in the run end,''
Campo said. ``Every game is going to be different, though. It
depends on how the defense plays you. I think Emmitt's going to
have a chance to do what he does all the time, and that's to make
plays when the ball is in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, Smith and Aikman have more help.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway promises to be an extraordinary weapon, given his speed
and ability to make plays on punt returns. McKnight would be the
fastest player on many teams, but not with Galloway and Ismail
around. The addition of former Tennessee tight end Jackie Harris,
who has dropped from 260 to 247 pounds, is another passing target.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys stress that the majority of camp will be used to
implement the offense and get all the moving parts working
together. Aikman is eager to give it a try. After 12 years, he'll
try anything that isn't routine.

 &HT;    EDs: updates, recasts lede to focus on Putin-Clinton meeting
 &HT;    U.S. EXPRESSES INTEREST, CONFUSION IN DEAL TO END NORTH KOREAN
MISSILE TESTS
 &HT;    (800&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By JULIE CHAO 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Japan _ President Clinton emerged from a meeting here with
Russian President Vladimir Putin with more questions than answers
regarding North Korea's offer to abandon its ballistic missile
program if other countries gave Pyongyang help in exploring space.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, if genuine, could undercut the U.S. argument for
building a National Missile Defense (NMD) to protect the United
States against missile attacks. Russia fiercely opposes the plan,
saying it would spark a new, costly and dangerous arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not entirely clear what's in (North Korean leader) Kim
Jong Il's mind with regard to this possible trade-off,'' said a
senior White House official who attended the 75-minute
Clinton-Putin meeting, as the annual Group of Eight summit of world
leaders began on this heavily guarded island.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very dangerous idea would be the international community
would provide actual launch capability to North Korea,' the
official said, ``that is to say rockets launched from North Korean
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if Kim envisions launching North Korean satellites on
foreign soil, ``it's something we'd be prepared to pursue,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The official said U.S. and Russian officials would meet again
over the weekend to get a clearer understanding of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting with Putin, coming just six weeks after his
trip to Moscow in June, centered largely on security issues and
Putin's trip to North Korea this week, in which he announced that
Pyongyang had offered to give up its missile program if other
nations would provide it with rockets to launch satellites into
space.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's missile program is the prime motivation for a U.S.
national missile defense which is vigorously opposed by Russia and
China. France and Germany also have opposed the defense system.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told reporters,
``I'm skeptical about it.'' He stressed that America can do what it
sees in its national interest, but said it should discuss the issue
with NATO and Russia. Chirac said he feared creation of a missile
shield could start another arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will decide this summer whether to go ahead
with the missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate media briefing, Russian Foreign Minister Igor S.
Ivanov told reporters that North Korea is not interested in
receiving missiles or missile technology to independently launch
satellites but, rather, wants other nations to launch satellites
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If such assistance is offered, North Korea is ready to stop
ballistic missile tests,'' Ivanov declared. ``It's too early to
discuss specifics, such as whether such assistance would envisage
providing funds or carrying out launches.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the United States and Russia issued a joint
statement saying they are dedicated to finding new ways to
cooperate on controlling the spread of nuclear missiles by
implementing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty _ that the
U.S. Senate has rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding for a greater role in the Group of Eight, Putin also had
a lengthy discussion with Clinton on the Middle East peace talks
going on at Camp David. The president will resume these talks upon
returning to Washington, and now is entertaining leaving the summit
before Sunday's scheduled wrap-up, said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, amid criticisms that the leaders of the world's
seven richest nations have done little to meet their commitments to
reduce the debt of poor nations, the leaders pledged to work harder
to fulfill their goals.
</P>
<P>
   However, critics said the countries _ the United States, Canada,
France, Italy, Germany, Britain and Japan _ are still moving too
slowly in meeting their promise from last year's summit in Cologne
to cancel up to $100 billion of debt owed by 40 of the world's
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders at Cologne made a big political statement last
year saying they'd cancel $100 billion in debt,'' said Marlene
Barrett, a spokesperson for Jubilee 2000, an organization
campaigning for debt cancellation for poor countries. ``They simply
failed to get that through.''
</P>
<P>
   The G8 discussion of debt relief came one day after a meeting in
Tokyo in which leaders of several developing countries stated their
frustration with the slow pace of debt relief by the world's
richest nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of (the G8 leaders) referenced the meeting that had taken
place yesterday . . . and which gave greater impetus to the need to
get the Cologne debt commitments implemented,'' said Lael Brainard,
deputy national economic advisor.
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by G8 leaders Friday _ not including Russia
_ expressed concern that many of the poor nations are at war or
have military conflicts which prevent them from qualifying for debt
relief. They agreed to do more to help those countries qualify, but
Brainard said there was no discussion of relaxing the terms of debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Clinton is scheduled to meet with Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori, a session that was postponed from Thursday
because Clinton canceled his trip to Tokyo in order to stay an
extra day as host to the Camp David peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton landed in Okinawa Friday morning and headed straight to
a peace memorial in an effort to placate criticism from another
corner _ local Okinawans unhappy with the large U.S. military
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa hosts about 26,000 American military personnel, more
than half of the American forces in Japan, even though it comprises
less than 1 percent of Japan's land mass. An estimated 27,000
people turned out Thursday to form a human chain around Kadena
Airbase in a show of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged to continue efforts to ``reduce our footprint on
this island,'' but some Okinawans were disappointed that he neither
said anything specific about base reduction nor apologized for an
incident earlier this month in which a drunken U.S. marine
allegedly entered a local house and molested a sleeping 14-year-old
girl.
</P>
<P>
   A few small, scattered groups of anti-base protesters appeared
at various summit venues and along the main road.
</P>
<P>
   The Okinawa summit is Clinton's eighth and last G8 summit. He
joined the group as the new kid on the block and leaves as the
veteran.

 &HT;    Tiger still on top
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ The commotion started as soon as Tiger
Woods was walking off the 18th green. To his right, a topless
streaker came running across the fairway and onto the green before
a security guard stopped her and led her away.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, it seems, gets close to Woods these days.
</P>
<P>
   Not the world's greatest golfers. Not a streaker wearing only
panties and a smile. Not the exhaustive list of adjectives that no
longer do justice to his domination.
</P>
<P>
   So let's be brief: Woods shot a six-under-par 66 Friday on the
Old Course to take command of the 129th British Open at St.
Andrews. Woods is at 11-under 133 with a three-shot lead over David
Toms. He stands two rounds away from becoming the youngest player
(24 years) to complete the career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the rest of the world thinks that development is
just a formality, Woods has this response: ``The trophy's not
sitting next to me yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Give it time, Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of streaks, Woods extended his own of not having a
bogey in a major to a remarkable 62 holes, dating back to the 10th
hole in the third round of last month's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might go another 36, too,'' said Nick Price, who spent the
last two days playing with Woods. Price says Woods' pursuers better
hope for outside intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the wind doesn't blow hard, everyone's going to be playing
for second place,'' Price said. ``I honestly think that's the only
chance they're going to have. He's on cruise, man. He hasn't even
tried any shots yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that Woods is longer than a Scottish summer day,
which helps him reduce both of the Old Course's par-5s to par-4s,
and at least two of the par-4s to par-3s. Add a velvet-smooth short
game and it's no wonder he may soon own each of golf's four majors.
</P>
<P>
   This seems like a sequel to last month's blockbuster showing at
Pebble Beach, where he set U.S. Open records for margin of victory
(15 shots) and score in relation to par (-12). Friday's 66 tied
Phil Mickelson, Jose Coceres and Davis Love III for low score of
the day, and his 67 Thursday was bettered only by Ernie Els' 66.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing very similar to how I played at Pebble,'' Woods
said. ``I'm driving the ball well and hitting my irons pretty
solidly _ not great, but good enough. I'm putting well and that's
what you have to do on this golf course (because of the large
greens).''
</P>
<P>
   The only complaint Woods could make Friday didn't involve his
game, but the streaker who made her run at him. Last year, another
scantily clad woman got a brief hug from Woods when he was on the
final hole in the second round
</P>
<P>
   at Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not right to do that, especially here at the home of
golf,'' Woods said. ``This is where you should show the utmost
respect for the game of golf. I don't think running down the
fairway without your clothes on showed the proper respect. Luckily,
we had finished the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' shadow has grown so large over his peers that the player
who will be in the final pairing with him today (Toms) was actually
asked by a British writer if he belongs in that spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, obviously I do,'' Toms said. ``I finished top 10 on the
money list last year (No. 10) and I won twice. The only reason a
lot of people haven't heard of me is you guys (media). You make or
break people _ which is fine. If I continue to play well, everybody
will know who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case anyone's interested, tied for third at 137 are
Sergio Garcia (69), Steve Flesch (70) and Loren Roberts (68), who
won last week's Greater Milwaukee Open.
</P>
<P>
   It would be ironic for Garcia, who finished second to Woods in
last year's PGA Championship, to have a chance to win on Sunday. A
year ago, he left the British Open in tears after finishing last
with rounds of 89 and 83.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the big difference between this year's Open and last
year's, Garcia grinned. ``Thirty-five shots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The five players tied for sixth, five shots back, constitute a
formidable group: Els (72), Fred Couples (68), Mickelson (66), Tom
Lehman (70) and Thomas Bjorn (69). Among the four players at 139 is
Jean Van de Velde (68), who kicked away last year's Open with a
triple-bogey on the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   They all have a formidable challenge: To make a run at Woods.
With their clothes on, of course.

MISSILE TESTS

<P>
   NAGO, Japan _ President Clinton emerged from a meeting here with
Russian President Vladimir Putin with more questions than answers
regarding North Korea's offer to abandon its ballistic missile
program if other countries gave Pyongyang help in exploring space.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, if genuine, could undercut the U.S. argument for
building a National Missile Defense (NMD) to protect the United
States against missile attacks. Russia fiercely opposes the plan,
saying it would spark a new, costly and dangerous arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not entirely clear what's in (North Korean leader) Kim
Jong Il's mind with regard to this possible trade-off,'' said a
senior White House official who attended the 75-minute
Clinton-Putin meeting, as the annual Group of Eight summit of world
leaders began on this heavily guarded island.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very dangerous idea would be the international community
would provide actual launch capability to North Korea,' the
official said, ``that is to say rockets launched from North Korean
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if Kim envisions launching North Korean satellites on
foreign soil, ``it's something we'd be prepared to pursue,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The official said U.S. and Russian officials would meet again
over the weekend to get a clearer understanding of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting with Putin, coming just six weeks after his
trip to Moscow in June, centered largely on security issues and
Putin's trip to North Korea this week, in which he announced that
Pyongyang had offered to give up its missile program if other
nations would provide it with rockets to launch satellites into
space.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's missile program is the prime motivation for a U.S.
national missile defense which is vigorously opposed by Russia and
China. France and Germany also have opposed the defense system.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told reporters,
``I'm skeptical about it.'' He stressed that America can do what it
sees in its national interest, but said it should discuss the issue
with NATO and Russia. Chirac said he feared creation of a missile
shield could start another arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will decide this summer whether to go ahead
with the missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate media briefing, Russian Foreign Minister Igor S.
Ivanov told reporters that North Korea is not interested in
receiving missiles or missile technology to independently launch
satellites but, rather, wants other nations to launch satellites
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If such assistance is offered, North Korea is ready to stop
ballistic missile tests,'' Ivanov declared. ``It's too early to
discuss specifics, such as whether such assistance would envisage
providing funds or carrying out launches.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the United States and Russia issued a joint
statement saying they are dedicated to finding new ways to
cooperate on controlling the spread of nuclear missiles by
implementing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty _ that the
U.S. Senate has rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding for a greater role in the Group of Eight, Putin also had
a lengthy discussion with Clinton on the Middle East peace talks
going on at Camp David. The president will resume these talks upon
returning to Washington, and now is entertaining leaving the summit
before Sunday's scheduled wrap-up, said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, amid criticisms that the leaders of the world's
seven richest nations have done little to meet their commitments to
reduce the debt of poor nations, the leaders pledged to work harder
to fulfill their goals.
</P>
<P>
   However, critics said the countries _ the United States, Canada,
France, Italy, Germany, Britain and Japan _ are still moving too
slowly in meeting their promise from last year's summit in Cologne
to cancel up to $100 billion of debt owed by 40 of the world's
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders at Cologne made a big political statement last
year saying they'd cancel $100 billion in debt,'' said Marlene
Barrett, a spokesperson for Jubilee 2000, an organization
campaigning for debt cancellation for poor countries. ``They simply
failed to get that through.''
</P>
<P>
   The G8 discussion of debt relief came one day after a meeting in
Tokyo in which leaders of several developing countries stated their
frustration with the slow pace of debt relief by the world's
richest nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of (the G8 leaders) referenced the meeting that had taken
place yesterday . . . and which gave greater impetus to the need to
get the Cologne debt commitments implemented,'' said Lael Brainard,
deputy national economic advisor.
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by G8 leaders Friday _ not including Russia
_ expressed concern that many of the poor nations are at war or
have military conflicts which prevent them from qualifying for debt
relief. They agreed to do more to help those countries qualify, but
Brainard said there was no discussion of relaxing the terms of debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Clinton is scheduled to meet with Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori, a session that was postponed from Thursday
because Clinton canceled his trip to Tokyo in order to stay an
extra day as host to the Camp David peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton landed in Okinawa Friday morning and headed straight to
a peace memorial in an effort to placate criticism from another
corner _ local Okinawans unhappy with the large U.S. military
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa hosts about 26,000 American military personnel, more
than half of the American forces in Japan, even though it comprises
less than 1 percent of Japan's land mass. An estimated 27,000
people turned out Thursday to form a human chain around Kadena
Airbase in a show of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged to continue efforts to ``reduce our footprint on
this island,'' but some Okinawans were disappointed that he neither
said anything specific about base reduction nor apologized for an
incident earlier this month in which a drunken U.S. marine
allegedly entered a local house and molested a sleeping 14-year-old
girl.
</P>
<P>
   A few small, scattered groups of anti-base protesters appeared
at various summit venues and along the main road.
</P>
<P>
   The Okinawa summit is Clinton's eighth and last G8 summit. He
joined the group as the new kid on the block and leaves as the
veteran.

   Sydney tour: Opera, outdoors, Olympics
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Take a harbor cruise. The two-tone green and cream ferries of
the state transit system are as beloved in Sydney as cable cars are
in San Francisco. Morning, afternoon and evening excursions provide
an inexpensive introduction to the harbor.
www.sydneybuses.nsw.gov.au
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tour the Opera House. The roof gets all the raves, but the
interior _ housing a small city of theaters, concert halls and
restaurants _ isn't too shabby, either. Be sure to check the
performance schedules. www.soh.nsw.gov.au
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Climb the Harbour Bridge. If the Opera House represents modern
Sydney, this grand old arch built in 1932 evokes the past. For the
best views of the city and harbor, walk across the bridge or visit
the lookout in the south pylon. Or, if you have the guts and cash
($117 and up), take a guided hike to the top of the superstructure.
www.bridgeclimb.com
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  See the Olympic Park. Homebush Bay, home of the athletes
village and most of the venues, is a triumph of recycling. A few
years ago, it was a waste dump and the site of a huge
slaughterhouse. Come September, it will be the focus of global
attention as the Olympics begin at Stadium Australia. There are
tours daily. www.oca.nsw.gov.au
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hit the Rocks. The narrow streets between the bridge and the
Opera House were once crowded with brothels and sailor taverns. Now
the Rocks is lined with shops, restaurants and pubs, including two
of the city's most venerable: the Lord Nelson and the Hero of
Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be artful. The Art Gallery of New South Wales holds one of the
country's best collections of Australian painting. Starting Aug.
18, as part of the Olympic Arts Festival, the gallery will feature
a major show of Aboriginal dot paintings. www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Explore Australian history. Two places to start: the Hyde Park
Barracks and the National Maritime Museum. The barracks, a prison
dormitory converted into a museum, documents convict life in the
penal colony. The maritime museum tells the story of Australian
seafaring, from the arrival of the First Fleet to the coming of
Vietnamese boat people. www.anmm.gov.au
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Watch the waves. The South Pacific is less than 10 miles from
downtown Sydney. Bondi, the closest beach, is famous for its
beefcake surfers. For a more relaxed scene, ferry across the harbor
to Manly, a longer strand lined with Norfolk pines. The most
beautiful oceanside vistas come along the walking trails from South
Head to Bondi, where waves slamming into cliffs will remind you of
the northern California coast.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pet a kangaroo. Australia has some of the world's strangest
wildlife. You can find most of it _ from koalas to platypuses _ at
the Taronga Zoo, scenically situated on the hilly north shore of
the harbor. www.zoo.nsw.gov.au
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Take a last look. For a sea gull's view, visit the observation
deck atop the AMP Tower _ at 1,000 feet, the tallest building in
the Southern Hemisphere. www.centrepoint.com.au

 &HT;    Sydney, more than a pretty place
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 23.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ As you watch the Olympics this September and
admire the stunning views of Sydney Harbour, remember this: In a
roundabout way, we're responsible. Americans, that is. If we hadn't
rebelled in 1776, the British might never have spun the globe
looking for another place to dump their undesirables. The Crown had
shipped 40,000 of them to its American colonies, mostly petty
offenders like the debtors who settled Savannah with Oglethorpe.
Forced to find another place to relieve its overcrowded jails,
Britain discovered a continent so far away and so isolated that no
convict would be able to breech the endless arc of ocean that
formed its prison walls.
</P>
<P>
   In going from Georgia to Australia, then, the Olympics have gone
from one British penal experiment to another.
</P>
<P>
   This odd kinship of outcasts dawned on me as I was sitting at a
cafe beside Sydney Cove, the aquamarine inlet that sets off the
heart of the city like a jade pendant. Ferry boats were churning
through the whitecaps of crisscrossing wakes. On one side of the
cove, the Opera House roof loomed like the upturned prows of a
dozen giant rowboats. On the other side, blue Australian flags
streamed in the breeze atop the long steel arch of the Harbour
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine now, but this postcard spot was where the
First Fleet landed in 1788 with a thousand convicts and sailors.
Eight months and 10,000 miles from home, they might as well have
been on the dark side of the moon. They struggled and almost
starved yet somehow managed to transform their exile into a city
and nation that will soon command the world's attention.
</P>
<P>
   This melding of happy scenery and harsh history captures Sydney
for me. The next Olympic city has become many things: a pan-Asian
cultural center, a Pacific Rim boomtown, a sublime place to dine
and drink and shop and play. But before any of it, there was the
sea and the banished souls who found safe harbor halfway around the
globe. Everywhere I turned, Sydney kept reminding me of them.
</P>
<P>
   A harbor runs through it
</P>
<P>
   The waterfront was the first thing my wife and I wanted to see
when we arrived shortly before Easter. The trip had been
discombobulating. We left the dogwood blossoms of an Atlanta spring
and emerged 22 hours later to find paperbark trees shedding their
skin in an Australian autumn. This being our first time in the
Southern Hemisphere, we gathered over the lavatory in our room to
see for ourselves whether the water actually drains
counterclockwise. Who knew that the revolving doors run backward,
too? The damn thing blindsided me when we left the hotel to begin
our explorations.
</P>
<P>
   We were headed where all visitors seem to gravitate: to the
ferry terminal on Sydney Cove. The cool, salt air of a harbor
cruise seemed just the thing to chase our jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Harbour is actually a flooded river valley that reaches
its long fingers 16 miles inland from the South Pacific. What makes
it so picturesque is its irregular shape; for 155 miles, the
shoreline juts and rises in rocky bluffs, then curves and falls
into sandy coves. Much of it is parkland. At no point is the water
so wide that you can't make out the houses on the other side. If
San Francisco Bay feels like a small sea, Sydney Harbour feels as
intimate as a Georgia lake.
</P>
<P>
   We spent two hours gliding past mansions half-veiled in leafy
hills. These are the most exclusive addresses in Australia, their
very names sounding like money _ Point Piper, Rose Bay, Vaucluse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where Nicole stays when she's in town,'' our guide
said, not bothering with the actress' last name as he pointed
toward another waterside enclave.
</P>
<P>
   Refreshed by the harbor, we boarded a Sydney Explorer bus that
afternoon and got a different perspective on the city. We started
in Kings Cross, a rambunctious red-light district where generations
of American servicemen have taken comfort, and meandered a dozen
miles toward the ocean, to Bondi, the crescent beach where surfing
got its start in Australia during the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Bondi (rhymes with ``sigh'') is nice if you like sugary sand,
booming waves and skimpy bathing suits. But our favorite place in
eastern Sydney was the Gap, a wind-swept park atop sandstone cliffs
near the mouth of the harbor. As we approached the edge to see the
surf crashing into rocks a hundred feet below, we noticed a warning
sign beyond the railing. It was for a suicide hotline. Like the
Golden Gate Bridge, the gateway to Sydney is one of those
timelessly beautiful vistas that attract hopeless souls bent on
hurling themselves into eternity.
</P>
<P>
   The soap opera house
</P>
<P>
   It would seem impossible to improve something as lovely as
Sydney Harbour, but the Aussies did it by erecting one of the most
distinctive buildings of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   People didn't know what to make of the Sydney Opera House when
it opened in 1973. Some thought the sharply angled roofline was a
nautical allusion to sails or waves. Others said the thing looked
like a spiky lizard crawling out of the muck to sun itself. As we
walked the curved promenade to the building, I thought the peaks
resembled the pointy helmets of Spanish conquistadors.
</P>
<P>
   The architect would probably disagree with all of us. Joern
Utzon saw the design as an exercise in deconstruction: a sphere
peeled into segments like an orange to form a living sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   The Opera House is a wondrous thing to behold. Up close, that
famous flying roof, clad in a million white ceramic tiles, has the
scaly texture of a fish. But the real wonder is that any of it ever
got built. The process took 16 years and became such a drama that
the resident opera company once produced an opera about it.
</P>
<P>
   Utzon was an obscure Danish architect when he won an
international competition for the commission in 1957. It was a
radical choice that grew more controversial as he spent six years
figuring out how to engineer his fantastic imaginings. In the
meantime, the price rose fourteenfold and the state of New South
Wales had to sell millions of dollars in lottery tickets to pay for
it. Irritated by money troubles and political meddling, Utzon
resigned from the job in 1966, and the cavernous interior had to be
completed by a consortium of Australian architects. Now in his 80s,
he has never returned to see his masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Utzon's estrangement isn't the only melancholy note in the Opera
House aria. The edifice occupies a tip of land called Bennelong
Point. It was named for an Aborigine who once lived there in a
brick hut, built for him by the British authorities who had adopted
him as a sort of mascot.
</P>
<P>
   In the generation after Europeans appeared, almost all the
indigenous people who had lived beside the harbor fled or succumbed
to disease. Bennelong was no exception. He died in 1813, his
obituary in the Sydney Gazette cruelly noting that he had
contracted one of the white man's sicknesses: The friendly native
had become a drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Placing that accent
</P>
<P>
   When he lived in Sydney during the 1920s, D.H. Lawrence
dismissed it as a pale imitation of London, ``as margarine is a
substitute for butter.''
</P>
<P>
   There's still a strong British flavor about the city. Motorists
drive on the left side of the road, pubs serve bangers and mash,
and the newspapers, God love 'em, can be as rowdy as Fleet Street
tabloids. I almost spewed my coffee one morning when I saw one of
the local wrappers refer to our vice president as ``that rat
bastard Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the cultural similarities, Sydney today is no more
British than Hong Kong. Decades of immigration from the
Mediterranean and more recently Asia have created a cosmopolitan
society that would have been unthinkable in Lawrence's day. In
fact, the multicultural population and mild, sunny climate remind
many Americans of California.
</P>
<P>
   Like any American city, there's a good side of town and a
not-so-good side of town. The harbor and waterfront get the oohs
and ahs. But most of Sydney's 4 million residents (slightly more
than Atlanta) live in the Westies, the flat suburbs that sprawl
unglamorously inland toward the Blue Mountains and the Outback.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Brooks, an Australian journalist, described what it
was like to grow up in the other Sydney in her memoir ``Foreign
Correspondence.'' She was born during the '50s on a ``bland street
of liver-brick bungalows, identically designed, marching in
lockstep away from the grand homes that lined the harbour.... The
farther west, the hotter the summers, the fewer the trees and the
longer the journey back to the harbour and wide scalloped
beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Most visitors don't see that Sydney. But many of them will this
year, at least part of it. The Games will begin and end at Sydney
Olympic Park, a reclaimed waste dump on a far finger of the harbor
called Homebush Bay. Fifteen sports will be contested there, nine
miles west of the Opera House. As I toured the facilities,
marveling at the spotless sidewalks and immaculate new arenas, it
all seemed a bit sterile, as if I were walking through some theme
park that had just been scraped out of the Florida scrublands _
definitely more American than British.

   SYDNEY, Australia :American than British.
</P>
<P>
   Fancy a rubber rat?
</P>
<P>
   From the first convicts to the latest Asian newcomers, Sydney
has been a city of immigrants. We looked for an Ellis Island, but
the closest thing we found was a prison dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyde Park Barracks were built in 1819 to house male
convicts, one of whom, a talented forger named Francis Greenway,
designed the three-story Georgian brick structure. It was turned
into a museum a few years ago, the best displays coming from an
unlikely source. Archaeologists discovered that rats had infested
the space between floors, making their nests with scraps of convict
clothing, shards of pottery and anything else they could get their
grubby claws into.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150,000 prisoners were transported to Australia before
the British stopped the practice during the 1860s. Their
descendants come to the barracks to imagine what it was like in the
long, gloomy rooms where convicts slept in closely packed hammocks.
</P>
<P>
   You can type their names into computers and read their rap
sheets: William Farrell, a Scottish plowman sentenced to life for
stealing bacon; William Moffatt, a bookbinder given seven years for
pilfering tea; John Johnson, a pickpocket punished with 50 lashes
for making too much noise in the isolation box, where he had been
sent for using obscene language.
</P>
<P>
   Australians used to have a difficult time talking about their
nation's convict roots. Their euphemism for it _ ``the stain'' _
sounded as if it were something that could be sent to the dry
cleaner instead of a fact. Fortunately, historians have begun to
write about the penal days, and the shame is lifting as people
become more comfortable with what is, after all, a remarkable story
of underdog triumph.
</P>
<P>
   They actually have a sense of humor about it at the barracks. On
the way out, we noticed a couple of unusual souvenirs in the gift
shop: a rubber rat and a plastic ball and chain.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosts of Gallipoli
</P>
<P>
   Southerners aren't the only people who have revered a lost
cause. When we arrived in Sydney, the papers were full of stories
about Anzac Day, a national holiday of war remembrance focused on a
catastrophic defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Anzac Day commemorates the Australian-New Zealand Army Corps,
the lads in the turned-up hats who rushed to Mother England's
defense during World War I. More than 60,000 Australians perished,
many of them in a disastrous 1915 landing on the Gallipoli
Peninsula in Turkey. The slaughter served as a traumatic coming of
age for a nation that had been independent only 14 years. April
marked the 85th anniversary, and with a new generation discovering
the tragic tale, a record crowd was expected for the Anzac parade
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gray, misty morning, yet more than a quarter of a
million spectators turned out. I noticed a khaki-uniformed Boy
Scout moving through the crowd handing out something green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rosemary for remembrance,'' he explained, and planted a
sprig in the buttonhole of my breast pocket. I looked up and saw a
sepia-toned soldier peering out from a five-story banner, under the
words ``Lest We Forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ghostly aura, it was a surprisingly festive
procession. Men and women, wearing their Sunday best, marched down
the street grinning and waving behind standards that proclaimed
their part in the nation's battles. There were military
photographers from World War II, infantrymen from Korea, nurses
from Vietnam, peacekeepers from Bosnia. One unit strode by singing
``It's a long, long way to Tipperary.'' A pipe band skirled out
``Waltzing Matilda,'' the unofficial Australian anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, many of the old guard loosened their ties and
repaired to the taprooms along the route to lift mugs and play
two-ups, a gambling game that was popular in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Only 31 Australian veterans of the Great War are still living.
One of them, a farmer named Vivian Folland, served in both world
wars but wasn't seriously wounded. Then, as an old man, a kangaroo
attacked him. Reading about him in the paper after the parade, I
was relieved that he had survived; marsupial assault is no way for
a hero to go.
</P>
<P>
   Hang on to your snags
</P>
<P>
   We had sailed the harbor, strolled along it, dined beside it.
Now it was time for the ultimate harbor experience: We were going
to walk across it _ 450 feet above it _ atop the other great icon
of the waters, the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing the ``coathanger,'' as locals fondly call the span that
dominates their skyline, has become the hottest thing in adventure
tourism in Sydney. For days, we had looked up to see tiny figures
raising their arms at the crest of the graceful arch, the only
structure to cross the main body of the harbor. I wasn't sure I
could do it. I mean, 450 feet high out in the open? That's like
window-washing a 40-story building.
</P>
<P>
   We checked into the Bridgeclimb office on an overcast morning
and surrendered everything on our persons, down to coins and lip
balm. For safety reasons, nothing is allowed on the bridge. The
orientation video advised to take a deep breath if we felt dizzy or
our breakfast disagreed with us.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, a vacationer from Melbourne, threw me a wary look. ``You
didn't have any snags for breakfast, did you, mate?''
</P>
<P>
   I assured him I was not digesting sausages.
</P>
<P>
   We changed into gray jumpsuits (gray like the bridge, so as not
to distract motorists) and strapped on harnesses with clasps that
would keep us tethered to a cable that ran the length of the climb.
After some practice with the gear, we were ready to have a go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixteen people died building this bridge,'' our guide,
Michael, said as we stepped onto a catwalk beneath the roadway.
``It could have been worse. They budgeted for 32.''
</P>
<P>
   I pondered that actuarial analysis as we reached the south
pylon, a tower of stone that looked as mighty as the Brooklyn
Bridge. We started to scale a series of ladders. Commuter trains
rolled beneath us, sounding like roller coasters as they popped the
joints of the railbed. I tried not to look down.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, breathing hard, we reached the steel superstructure
that watches over the harbor like a giant eyebrow. The view was so
exhilarating that I almost forgot how high we were as we pressed on
to the pinnacle. The skyline was a toy. The Opera House unfolded
like an origami flower. The harbor was speckled with sails and
ferryboats and kayaks that looked like pickup sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Before we began our descent, I took one last look toward the
Pacific and noticed a fortress we had passed on our cruise. They
used to call it Pinchgut Island, the guide had said, probably
because incorrigible prisoners were sent there to waste away on
bread and water. On the flight back to Atlanta, I read a story
about the place that could serve as an epitaph for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1800s, it seems, a blackheart by the name of
Francis Morgan was taken to Pinchgut to be hanged for murder. When
he was asked whether he had any final words, legend has it that he
gazed upon the waters that surrounded him and said, ``Well, it
certainly is a fine harbor you have here.''
</P>
<P>
   That it is.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there. It takes 20-plus hours to travel from Atlanta
to Sydney, usually connecting through Los Angeles. Air New Zealand,
Qantas and United fly the Pacific leg. Round-trip fares start
around $1,375. Australia requires an entry visa, which airlines and
travel agencies can usually handle when you book.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Time-tripping. Sydney is 14 hours ahead of Atlanta and on the
other side of the international date line. That means you could
leave on a Wednesday evening and not arrive until Friday morning _
Thursday just didn't happen. Coming back, you could depart Sydney
on a Friday morning and land in L.A. on the same day before you
left. Weird.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Money. The coin of the realm is a handy metaphor for
Australia's mingled cultures: Queen Elizabeth on one side, a mob of
kangaroos on the other _ and they call it a dollar. The current
exchange rate ($1 U.S. is worth about $1.70 Australian) makes for
some great bargains. But a new national sales tax of 10 percent
takes away part of the advantage. Tipping is not expected and
needn't exceed 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Olympics. The Games will run Sept. 15-Oct. 1, followed by the
Paralympics Oct. 18-29. For information on tickets and package
deals, contact the official ticket agent in the United States,
Cartan Tours, at 1-800-818-1998 or www.cartan.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to stay. Sydney has 21,000 hotel rooms, one-fourth the
number of metro Atlanta. With such a small supply, it pays to book
ahead. We bunked at the Novotel Darling Harbour, a chain hotel with
spectacular skyline views and easy access to public transit. A
bargain at $132 a night. Our last evening in Australia was spent
downtown at the Grace Hotel, a converted art deco office building
where Gen. Douglas MacArthur had his headquarters before returning
to the Philippines during World War II. Doubles start around $150.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to shop. The Strand Arcade and the Queen Victoria
Building are two of the most elegant shopping centers you'll ever
see. Both built in the 1890s, they contain dozens of exquisite but
expensive boutiques. (Don't miss the Royal Clock at the QVB; it
dramatizes scenes from British history on the hour, including the
beheading of King Charles.) Harbourside is a useful festival
marketplace on Darling Harbour, a redeveloped area reminiscent of
Baltimore's Inner Harbor. For Olympic souvenirs, visit the Sydney
2000 store on the Pitt Street Mall downtown.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to eat. Sydney has become one of the world's most
interesting places to dine. The best restaurants combine Asian
flavors with Australian ingredients, especially seafood. We enjoyed
Salt, a chic bistro in the fashionable Darlinghurst neighborhood
that was named the best new restaurant in town by the Sydney
Morning Herald. The spicy fare at Sailor's Thai, in the Rocks
district, showed us why people here love Asian food so much. For a
taste of old Sydney, we tried the beer-battered fish and chips at
Doyle's, a seafood place on the water at Watsons Bay. Our most
entertaining meal was the barbecued duck at BBQ King, a frantic,
Formica-tabletop joint in Chinatown, where deliciously bronzed
ducks hang in the window and the old chap at the register barks the
same send-off to every departing customer: ``B'bye, mate!'' Sounds
like an Aussie parrot.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Day trips. The Blue Mountains, so named because of the blue
haze cast by eucalyptus forests, begin only 50 miles west of
Sydney. Though not particularly lofty _ the peaks of North Georgia
are taller _ the Blues have some striking gorges and rock
formations. The Hunter Valley, two hours north of Sydney, is one of
Australia's premier wine regions, with dozens of inns and wineries
welcoming visitors.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Reading up. I found the Access and Eyewitness guides to be the
most concise and usable. For that long flight, consider carrying
Robert Hughes' stirring history of Australia's penal colony roots,
``The Fatal Shore'' (Vintage, $17), or Geoffrey Moorhouse's
just-published ``Sydney: The Story of a City'' (Harcourt, $25).
Bill Bryson's new Australian travelogue, ``In a Sunburned Country''
(Broadway, $25), is a jolly read that ranges far beyond Sydney.

 (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOSTER CITY, Calif. _ When President Clinton announced last
month at a White House ceremony that scientists had effectively
mapped the human genetic code, the man who was arguably most
responsible for the achievement was not in the room. The man, Dr.
Michael W. Hunkapiller, was home with chicken pox.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mind too much, though. He has never sought the
limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was his company, PE Biosystems, that designed the
high-speed DNA sequencers used to unravel the human genome. And it
was Hunkapiller, along with his boss, Tony L. White of PE Corp.,
the parent company, who thought to set up Celera Genomics and have
it use 300 of the new machines to sequence the genome years ahead
of the publicly financed Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   The public project responded by stepping up its own pace and
buying about 200 of PE's machines. Hunkapiller, in short, had set
off an arms race in which he was the arms merchant. And while
Celera and its outspoken president, J. Craig Venter, got the
attention and a spot on the dais with Clinton, PE Biosystems and
the quiet Hunkapiller made the money.
</P>
<P>
   Much as Cisco Systems did with the Internet, PE Biosystems _
which is changing its name back to Applied Biosystems _ has emerged
as by far the leading supplier of equipment to the exploding
genomics industry.
</P>
<P>
   The company _ like Celera, a subsidiary of the PE Corp. with its
own tracking stock _ controls at least two-thirds of the market for
gene sequencers. It is also the leading supplier of equipment used
for one of the fundamental processes in biotechnology, the
amplification and detection of DNA by polymerase chain reaction, or
PCR. And it is in the early lead for machines used to analyze
proteins, a field known as proteomics. That field is expected to be
the next big thing after genomics, because it will help researchers
better understand what all those genes, which guide the body's
production of proteins, actually do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a saying in the computer business that no one
ever got fired for buying IBM,'' said Lawrence S. Schmid, president
of Strategic Directions International, a market research company in
Los Angeles that tracks the analytical instrument industry. ``The
same is true with PE.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, customers and competitors often refer to PE as the
Microsoft of genomics equipment, not only because of its commanding
position but also for what they see as its aggressive tactics. And
if PE is the Microsoft, then Dr. Hunkapiller, whose doctorate is in
chemical biology from the California Institute of Technology, is
the Bill Gates, a man most comfortable discussing the intricacies
of technology but able to transform himself into a respected,
shrewd and tough businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Customers say, only half-jokingly, that when the company
operated as Applied Biosystems Inc., the initials ABI stamped on
its machines stood for ``arrogance beyond imagination.'' Rivals say
the company uses its powerful patent portfolio and frequent
lawsuits as cudgels to stave off competition or to force others to
license technology it needs.
</P>
<P>
   And some critics say that until it introduced its powerful Model
3700 sequencers two years ago, the company, facing little
competition, had kept its prices high and improved its machines
only slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the genome project could have gone ahead faster if
they had made the capabilities of the system available sooner,''
said Dr. Clark Tibbetts, a scientist at Virginia Tech. Several
years ago, while at Vanderbilt University, Tibbetts took matters
into his own hands by modifying a sequencer to quadruple its speed.
</P>
<P>
   Any company being compared to Microsoft has to be aware of
antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   PE recently dropped plans to acquire a smaller company, Third
Wave Technologies, saying the Justice Department's antitrust review
was taking too long. In 1998, PE had to divest some patent rights
to clear another acquisition. The Justice Department would not
comment. And after PE sued two of its largest competitors,
contending patent infringement, those rivals countersued,
contending antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health and Human Services, meanwhile, is
investigating whether federal funds were used in the invention of
the first automated DNA sequencer at Caltech in the 1980s. If
federal funds were used, PE might have to give the government a
discount on gene sequencers or share the patents more widely.
Federal officials are also looking at whether someone other than
those listed on the patent might have invented the machine. If so,
the patent could be invalidated.
</P>
<P>
   Hunkapiller, 51, one of the inventors at Caltech, said the
invention issues had already been examined by Caltech and by
various patent offices. He said the Justice Department had told his
company that it was not under investigation. And both he and
Caltech said that while the university received some federal
financing, it was not until the sequencer had already been
invented.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he said, PE already gives the government a discount
and licenses its technology to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite that, we have very strong market shares,'' he said.
``We don't apologize for that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the federal investigations had been stirred up by people
who resented Celera's competing with the public genome project or
by companies sued by PE. ``There are people out there who don't
like paying licenses for technology they do not own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Securities analysts dismiss the Caltech issue. Virtually all
those who follow PE recommend its shares, agreeing with company
projections that it will be able to maintain the 20 percent annual
revenue growth it has recorded since 1993. Profits are also
expected to grow at that pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``PE Bio is the best of breed,'' said Winton Gibbons, an analyst
at William Blair &AMP; Co. in Chicago. The company's stock is up 176
percent over the last 12 months, though it is down by almost half
from its peak in March, to $81.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the going could get tougher, now that the mapping of the
genome is nearly finished. PE sold 1,100 new Model 3700 sequencers
at $300,000 apiece in a single year, adding about $300 million to
revenues. Now the arms race seems likely to subside.

 &HT;    NBAF films showcase hope
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Young people _ struggling against poverty, physical handicaps
and adult-made wars _ can still be filled with dignity and want to
share what little they have.
</P>
<P>
   At least two of the 30 films to be shown at the High Museum's
Rich Auditorium during the National Black Arts Festival are
delicate tales of children and testaments to the human spirit. They
are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Comedia Infantil'' (7:15 p.m. Aug. 1; $7; unrated; in
Portuguese with subtitles) is Swedish director Solveig Nordlund's
1998 film about Nelio (Sergio Titos), a boy orphaned by civil war
in Mozambique, who becomes a street urchin, healer and, ultimately,
a symbol of hope. It's a devastating, rough-around-the-edges work,
at rare times reminiscent of Francois Truffaut's ``The 400 Blows.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Equally moving is ``La Petite Vendeuse de Soleil'' or ``The
Little Girl Who Sold the Sun'' (1 p.m. July 31; $7; unrated; in
Wolof with subtitles), from writer-director Djibril Diop Mambety.
It's about Sili (Lissa Balera), a severely handicapped Senegalese
girl who bucks convention and begins to sell newspapers on the
streets of Dakar, using her wages to care for her blind grandmother
and the poor. There are long shots of her walking on two crutches,
pushing along her dangling bad leg. While at first these shots seem
tedious, they ultimately underscore the girl's persistence, her
will to fend for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Both works are part of the Pan African Film Festival (July
30-Aug. 5), one in a series of NBAF movie presentations. Included
are a family film series at Clark Atlanta University (Aug. 3-5) and
special screenings (Aug. 1-5) at Georgia-Pacific Auditorium, Rich
Auditorium and Spelman College's Cosby Center.
</P>
<P>
   Among the special screenings: selections from ``Hopes on the
Horizon: The Rise of New Africa'' (6 p.m. Aug. 1; free;
Georgia-Pacific Auditorium). It's the latest documentary from
Blackside Productions, which produced the remarkable ``Eyes on the
Prize,'' ``The Great Depression'' and ``America's War on Poverty,''
and relates Africa's struggles over the past decade to alter
political, cultural and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
   Also showing will be ``Free to Dance'' (4 p.m. Aug. 5; Cosby
Center; free with festival admission), a provocative and revealing
documentary about the development of African-American dance. The
film chronicles the careers of Katherine Dunham, Pearl Primus,
Talley Beatty, Donald McKaye and Alvin Ailey and looks deeply into
their primal connections to African tribal movements and rhythmic
gradations developed in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever been stymied by modern dance or felt disconnected
from the nuances of body movement as a means of emotional
expression, then ``Free to Dance'' is the film to help you
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the family series at Clark Atlanta includes two works
from celebrated American director Charles Burnett: ``My Brother's
Wedding'' and ``To Sleep With Anger'' (noon-4 p.m. Aug. 3; free
with festival admission; Clark Atlanta University's Science and
Research Center). The latter stars Danny Glover as a storyteller
and tells of his effect on three generations of a modern family.
</P>
<P>
   At Rich Auditorium, more than two-thirds of the Pan African Film
Festival's full-length features and shorts come from outside the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The opening-night work, ``Orefu'' (6 p.m. July 30; $25; unrated;
in Portuguese with subtitles) is director Carols Diegues' retelling
of the classic ``Black Orpheus'' from the Brazilian point of view.
It will be shown with the Mauritius short ``A Lucy,'' director
Radhaa-Rajen Jaganathen's quick take on the woman considered by
some anthropologists to be the one from whom all humankind can
trace its lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign film highlights: director Idrissa Ouedraogo's
``Kini &AMP; Adams'' (7 p.m. Aug. 2; unrated), about two pals (one
played by Vusi Kunene of ``Cry Freedom'' and ``Cry the Beloved
Country'') who dream of repairing an old car so they can leave
their Zimbabwean village and head for a big city; ``Chickin Biznis:
The Whole Story'' (5 p.m. July 31), a South African comedy about a
businessman ruffling feathers in Soweto; and ``Dancehall Queen'' (1
p.m. Aug. 1; unrated), a Jamaican movie from music video pros Don
Letts and Rick Elgood about a struggling single mother who
discovers lively music (including Third World, Black Uhuru and
Sugar Minott) and relationships in the loud world of the dance
hall.

 &HT;    Cultural celebration emphasizes community
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 23.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture 100 kids locked in the Southwest YMCA on a Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   They've come to learn about everything from personal hygiene to
AIDS awareness to resume writing. When they aren't engaged in
spoken-word routines or ``funkercise'' classes, they munch on pizza
and slurp sodas. But their main objective is to soak up 250 years
of African-American history, from slavery to emancipation, so they
can act it out in a series of vignettes at the National Black Arts
Festival's children's village.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the new interactive NBAF.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be startled if a youngster posing as an Underground
Railroad agent approaches you on the Atlanta University Center
campus, where the NBAF will be spread out during its second weekend
Aug. 3-6, and whispers, ``Psssssss. Follow me to freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   While the festival will have its usual scattering of marquee
attractions around Atlanta _ Ashford and Simpson with Maya Angelou,
Sweet Honey in the Rock, the Broadway show ``It Ain't Nothing but
the Blues'' at the Fox Theatre _ this year's program will have a
decidedly more user-friendly vibe.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its 12-year history, the festival is
charging a gate fee ($5) and consolidating many of its activities
on the grounds of southwest Atlanta's historically black colleges:
Clark Atlanta University, Spelman College, Morehouse College, the
Morehouse School of Medicine, Morris Brown College and the
Interdenominational Theological Center. Festival Executive Producer
Stephanie S. Hughley says ``tens of thousands'' of visitors are
expected for the 10-day celebration of African-American culture.
</P>
<P>
   It's Music Midtown meets an old-fashioned dinner on the grounds:
two stages showcasing such top-notch talent as hip-hop artists
Outkast and Goodie Mob, blues belter Francine Reed and the Georgia
Sea Island Singers. ``You don't need Luther Vandross,'' Hughley
says, joking about the public's fixation on big-name artists. ``You
can get him anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   By keeping many of its signature offerings (the artists market,
book fair and spoken-word panels) contained on campus, the festival
will help rein in what has been a confusing geographical hodgepodge
in years past. Once on campus, visitors will have free access to
performances, visual arts exhibits and discussions of this year's
theme, ``Artists as Agents of Social Change.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, festival ramblers might listen to Atlanta author
Pearl Cleage read from her novel ``I Wish I Had a Red Dress'' at
Spelman's Cosby Center. Or duck into a literary salon with Haki
Madhubuti, Sonia Sanchez and Askia Toure. Or watch a screening of
the American Dance Festival documentary ``Free to Dance.'' And they
can graze on everything from spicy Caribbean fare to barbecue ribs
to healthy vegetarian offerings _ food from 15 vendors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it brings the festival taste back,'' says Collette
Hopkins, the Clark Atlanta University educator who conceived the
children's village. ``In the past, you got out to (the artists
market at) Greenbriar Mall and you worried, `Could I make it back
in time? Could I make it across town? Could I find a place to
park?'''
</P>
<P>
   That's the logistical bonus. The other benefits may be more
spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   M. Akua McDaniel, director of the Spelman College Museum of Fine
Art, says that having the NBAF on campus is ``a homecoming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been nearly 30 years since the AUC has been seen as the
cultural epicenter of Atlanta, so it is fitting that the arts
return to this place,'' says McDaniel, whose gallery is hosting an
exhibit of African-American art inspired by dance.
</P>
<P>
   Because parking on campus can be difficult, visitors are urged
to take MARTA, then hop one of the special buses that will be
running from the West End, Vine City and Ashby Street MARTA
stations to the AU Center.
</P>
<P>
   With the festival's history of managerial neglect _ a combined
deficit of more than $1 million over the past two installments _
sponsors have been somewhat skittish about giving money. But
Hughley, who returned last year to run the festival she helped
start 12 years ago, says she has raised $1.6 million of her $1.8
million operating budget and that another $3 million in donation
requests are still on the table. Major sponsors this year include
the Coca-Cola Co., the Fulton County Arts Council, DaimlerChrysler,
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Arthur M. Blank Family
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Hughley's intention is to turn a biennial celebration into a
year-round community-service organization that fosters education
and arts partnerships. That means programs such as the children's
village, which is meant to live on after the festival. The project
includes some 30 Atlanta teachers who will take the curriculums
they have developed over the summer back to their schools this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   It means collaborations such as the one between Atlanta's
Ballethnic Dance Company and choreographers Salia Sanou and Seydou
Boro of Burkina Faso, whose work will be performed this year. It
means Friday's opening ceremonies and Sunday's block party at the
NBAF's Studioplex headquarters on Auburn Avenue _ free events to
which the public is invited. It means collaborations with local
arts presenters Spivey Hall (where the Geri Allen Trio will
appear), Variety Playhouse (where Mali blues singer Ali Farka Toure
will perform) and numerous others.
</P>
<P>
   While the festival's heartbeat will be at the AU Center, there
will be dozens of related events all over town, as always.
Noteworthy bookings include Los Angeles' Pan African Film Festival,
which is screening some 30 films at the Woodruff Arts Center;
spoken-word and late-night jam sessions at the Yin Yang Cafe and
the Renaissance Hotel on West Peachtree Street; and morning
literary discussions at the hotel. These events, priced at $5 to
$10 and the hidden jewels of the festival, give it intellectual
vigor and a national reputation.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible to enjoy the festival without spending a
cent. The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra will play for free at Ebenezer
Baptist Church. Theatre Emory will do a free staged reading of
Nobel Prize-winning writer Wole Soyinka's ``The Man Died,'' with
such luminous speakers as actor Bill Nunn and former Spelman
president and Emory professor Johnnetta Cole, who will lead a
discussion with Soyinka after the performance. And the Havana-based
Grupo Vocal Baobab, which blends Yoruba chants and Afro-Cuban
percussion, will give a free concert at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   As Hughley says, it's all about returning the festival to its
rightful owners, the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can convince all your neighbors that this is important,
then you have a reason to be,'' she says. ``But if the neighbors
don't think you are important, you can't survive. So we just want
to be important to our neighbors, and then the nation and the world
will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   National Black Arts Festival 2000: ``Connect. Inspire.
Transform.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday through Aug. 6. The multidisciplinary event includes
dance, theater, music, film, literary, spoken-word and visual arts
offerings at more than 20 venues around Atlanta. $5-$45; many are
free. Information: 404-730-0177 or www.nbaf.org. Ticket events:
404-249-6400 or www.ticketmaster.com.

 &HT;    In the afternoon of life, novelist Larry McMurtry takes a
ruminative road

   ESSAYS
</P>
<P>
   ``Roads: Driving America's Great Highways'' by Larry McMurtry.
Simon &AMP; Schuster. $25. 206 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The most resonant phrase in all of ``Huckleberry Finn'' is
Huck's spunky declaration, ``I reckon I got to light out for the
territory.'' Huck was young, and so was the country. If things
weren't working out in one place, a man picked up what he owned and
hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   Now the road leads _ metaphorically or otherwise _ to the dead
ends of divorce or death or plain emptiness. A man doesn't head for
somewhere as much as from somewhere. A man hits the road when he's
run out of gas. John Updike, in ``Rabbit at Rest,'' has Harry
Angstrom driving south in the rain on I-95, away from it all: ``He
even turns off the radio, he feels so battered by pellets of
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel ends with a single word: ``Enough.'' Not affirmation
but ennui.
</P>
<P>
   In a very different novel, Larry McMurtry's ``Lonesome Dove,'' a
wandering Woodrow F. Call digs a narrow grave and lowers into it
the body of Augustus McCrae. ``Yesterday's gone,'' Gus had once
told Call. ``We can't get it back.'' Wherever his dead friend was
headed, Call had lost his sense of direction. ``Maybe,'' he says,
``you just go back to wherever you was happiest.''
</P>
<P>
   Different as they are, you could make a strong case that both
novels _ winners of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction _ could only
have been written by a man. In their restlessness, in their
melancholy pursuit of mirages, they are among the purest
expressions of American life that our literature has produced.
Wherever the rainbow ends, the road never quite gets there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movement,'' V.S. Pritchett wrote, ``is one of the great
consolers of human woe; movement, a process of continual migration,
is the history of America.''
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry titled one of his early novels ``Movin' On,'' and he
has needed over the years to get behind the wheel and put miles
between himself and wherever the sun rose. ``Roads'' is a
deceptively simple book _ a twilight rumination amid reports from
the interstate. Not that there's not plenty about the arteries
carrying Americans north and south, east and west. McMurtry is the
early-rising, long-haul traveler, forsaking the ``blue highways''
that beckoned William Least Heat-Moon for the roads he likens to
the great rivers of transport in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers driving from east to west, when he can, and north to
south, and along the way offers observations alternately witty and
inconsequential. Does it really matter that Arkansans are the most
passive-aggressive of drivers? Is it any revelation that Montana,
of all the lower 48, is the vestibule to heaven?
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are passages as pithy as those McMurtry
wrote 30 years ago in his almost classic ``In a Narrow Grave:
Essays on Texas'': ``It was almost dark when
</P>
<P>
   I crossed the Monongahela River, after which the road steadily
worsened, as if, with only 30 miles of Pennsylvania left, the
highway department had simply given up on it. Perhaps, too, the
people along that stretch of highway had given up on themselves. I
passed an adult video store whose neon sign was the brightest thing
to be seen in all of western Pennsylvania.''
</P>
<P>
   In his best work, McMurtry's bittersweet humor has played
counterpoint to the elegiac. The latter note he struck often and
sublimely in ``In a Narrow Grave.'' (``The cowboy has been
diminished, but the Indian was destroyed. The great homeward march
of the Northern Cheyenne in 1878 is a subject for a Sophocles, and
was lucky to draw even a John Ford.'')
</P>
<P>
   That note is conspicuously absent in ``Roads.'' But the further
one progresses _ and it's a quick drive _ something more personal
than interstate travel takes shape: McMurtry knows his best work is
behind him. A substantial body of work it is _ more than 20 novels
as well as collections of essays and film criticism. But the infant
who rocked in his lap when he was an unknown college English
teacher in Fort Worth, typing away at ``Horseman, Pass By'' (the
movies settled for the less poetic ``Hud''), is grown and a
professional musician. McMurtry himself is in his 60s _ not old,
really _ but heart bypass surgery in 1991 left him feeling that a
part of him had ``died, been lost, vanished, slipped away.''
</P>
<P>
   You have the sense, by the end, that McMurtry is not just
retracing old routes but trying to retrieve what has been lost. The
earliest road he knew, the one near the ranch house in North Texas,
was Highway 281. It runs from Manitoba to McAllen, Texas, at the
Mexican border: ``When I asked my grandfather _ the person assigned
to deal with my questions when I was three or four _ where the road
went, he would merely allow that it went to Oklahoma. An old man
then, near the end of his own road, he could see no reason why
anyone would need to go farther north than Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   All roads don't lead north, but that's where you eventually want
your compass to point. In traveling the great highways, McMurtry
has been wanting to go back _ like Woodrow Call _ to where he was
happiest.

<P>
   ``The real game is not more sequencing,'' said Michael McKenna,
vice president for operations at CuraGen Corp., a genomics-based
drug development company. ``The real game is seeing which genes are
drug targets. It's a completely different set of tools.''
</P>
<P>
   PE officials say sequencers will still be needed for the genomes
of other organisms, for DNA fingerprinting in forensics and for
finding differences among human genes that can help diagnose
diseases. Moreover, each Model 3700 automated sequencer uses as
much as $100,000 of chemicals a year, providing a continuing income
stream. While PE will not be able to keep selling 1,000 high-end
machines a year, it expects its overall sequencing business to keep
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say sequencers account for 40 to 45 percent of PE's
revenue, which is expected to total about $1.4 billion for the
fiscal year that ended in June. Parts of the polymerase chain
reaction business are growing even faster, said Eric Schmidt, an
analyst with SG Cowen. And Celera, which raised $1 billion in a
March stock offering, plans to spend a big chunk of it on
proteomics equipment being developed by PE Biosystems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, PE is not likely to be as dominant in proteomics. And
technology is evolving rapidly: start-up companies have developed
chips as small as postage stamps that can analyze thousands of
genes at a time or perform complex chemical analyses. Such chips
could undermine PE's bigger instruments, just as personal computers
undermined IBM's mainframes and the Internet threatens Microsoft's
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   So PE, which is behind in developing such chips, has entered
into more than 20 alliances with companies ranging from 3M to
start-ups like Illumina and Aclara BioSciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical for our growth that the start-ups, the new
ideas, come to us first,'' said Michael Albin, vice president for
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, PE has long been adept at licensing technology from
others. Even the powerful new sequencers used in the genome project
were developed in good measure by Hitachi. PE's sales force and
financial strength make the company an attractive partner, and it
excels in the combination of chemistry, biology, engineering and
software needed to turn raw ideas into usable products.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Biosystems was founded by venture capitalists in 1981 to
commercialize technology from the laboratory of Leroy Hood, then a
Caltech professor and a pioneer in the automation of genomics. Two
Hewlett-Packard executives, Sam H. Eletr and Andre Marion, were
recruited to run the company, and they in turn recruited
Hunkapiller, Hood's right-hand man. Starting in research and
development, Dr. Hunkapiller rose to head of the company in 1995.
``Mike has really given the vision to the company,'' said Marion,
who retired in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Hunkapiller is a man of few words, rarely shooting from the hip
or showing his emotions. But while outsiders can be put off by his
bluntness, his engineers seem to idolize him for his lack of airs
and the creative atmosphere he has fostered at the company's
sprawling campus here, next to San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is in a cubicle at the end of the hall,'' Albin said.
``If you want to walk up to Mike, you walk up to Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his terseness, Hunkapiller was a star debater in his
high school in Seminole, Okla., having been coached by another
debater from the school, David L. Boren, who later became a
governor and U.S. senator. And that skill shows up in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he believes in something, he'll argue it, argue it,'' said
John H. Richards, a close friend who was Hunkapiller's thesis
adviser at Caltech. ``He doesn't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hunkapiller is all work and no play. In fact, he plays
soccer at lunchtime nearly every day. He is a ``Star Trek'' fanatic
who owns videos of every television episode and movie. And he is a
fervent Dallas Cowboys fan who was thrilled when his company
arranged to have the former quarterback Roger Staubach, whom he had
never met, deliver a videotaped greeting for his 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Oklahoma Baptist University, Hunkapiller
went on to get his doctorate at Caltech and then moved to Hood's
lab.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that Hunkapiller and others, including his younger
brother, Tim, made the key invention of attaching different colors
of fluorescent dyes to the four different chemical units in the
genetic code, allowing the sequence to be read by machine.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Applied Biosystems outran or outlasted bigger
competitors like DuPont, EG&AMP;G and Beckman Coulter.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been helped by its control of the key Caltech
patents. Normally, a company would not be obligated to license
patents to anyone. But the agreement with Caltech requires PE to
license the DNA sequencer patents to others on reasonable terms.
Hunkapiller said the company has abided by this but added,
``reasonable, from our perspective, doesn't mean free.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivals say PE drives a hard bargain and plays its patent hand
brilliantly. Hitachi, the Japanese electronics giant, could not
come to terms on a license. ``There were many attempts to license
it and cross-license it throughout the years,'' said Mark McDonald,
president of Hitachi Instruments.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1997 or so, a huge threat was developing. A Silicon
Valley start-up called Molecular Dynamics was developing a
high-capacity sequencer called the MegaBace that could run rings
around anything PE offered at the time. Molecular Dynamics found
PE's asking price for a patent license prohibitive. But Molecular
linked up with _ and was eventually acquired by _ a company called
Amersham Pharmacia Biotech that had wrestled a patent license from
PE in exchange for giving PE rights to a key enzyme used in the
sequencers.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the MegaBace threat, PE turned to Hitachi fo the
technology to build its own high-capacity machine, the 3700.
</P>
<P>
   But the MegaBace beat the Model 3700 to market by months.
Amersham's first big customer was Incyte Pharmaceuticals, a
genomics company that had grown impatient with what it saw as PE's
slowness in introducing new technology. Some customers say the
MegaBace, which cost less, is more flexible and reliable than the
3700.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have struggled extensively with the reliability'' of the
3700, said Elaine R. Mardis, assistant director of the genome
sequencing center at Washington University in St. Louis, which has
machines from both makers. Dr. Mardis said she had to fly to
California with records of machine's downtime to get PE to provide
more service technicians. ``It's not `The customer is always
right,''' she said of PE's attitude. ``The customer is always
wrong.''

</P>
<P>
   Susan Eddins, product manager for the Model 3700, said early
service problems arose because the company had been overwhelmed by
orders. ``When this thing first came out, it was really insane,''
she said. ``We took our service guys to the limit.'' Service, she
said, has improved since then.
</P>
<P>
   Eddins also said the company's reputation for arrogance was
unjustified and arose because customers expected customized
machines, which PE could not reasonably provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't understand that we put out 5,000 boxes a week,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Amersham's lead in getting the MegaBace to market, PE's
3700 could work with less pure samples of DNA and was more
automated, able to run all day and night without human
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   It thus became the machine of choice for the 24-hour-a-day DNA
crunching at Washington University and at three of the other four
centers that did most of the public Human Genome Project, even
though many of its scientists would have preferred not to buy from
the company that financed Celera.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Amersham Pharmacia, a joint venture of Nycomed Amersham
of Britain and Pharmacia, the drug company, has provided the most
significant competition to PE in years. It sold 288 MegaBace
machines last year, giving it about 20 percent of the high-end
market _ more if Celera's 300 machines were excluded from PE's
sales of 1,100 machines. One of the five centers of the Human
Genome Project, as well as companies like CuraGen and Incyte, now
called Incyte Genomics, uses Amersham's machines exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Amersham and PE are locked in a nasty patent lawsuit over
technology, although in this case it was prompted by Amersham
withholding a license from PE.
</P>
<P>
   PE is also in a battle with MJ Research of Waltham, Mass., the
leading competitor in equipment used to prepare DNA for the
sequencing machines, which is often done by using the polymerase
process. PE wants all makers of machines to buy a PCR license. But
MJ has refused, saying its machines can be used for other
processes. It is countersuing on antitrust grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, PE filed a patent infringement suit against
Affymetrix, the leader in gene chips.
</P>
<P>
   While Hunkapiller has been with Applied Biosystems nearly from
the start, the company's transformation to a powerhouse was
completed by White, the head of the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Applied Biosystems was acquired by Perkin-Elmer, the
old-line scientific instrument company in Norwalk, Conn., that had
rights to the polymerase technology. White took over as chief
executive at Perkin-Elmer in 1995 and focused the company on life
sciences. Last year, he sold off the mainstay but stagnant
analytical chemistry business to EG&AMP;G, which then renamed itself
PerkinElmer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   White's company, meanwhile, became PE Corp., with no stock of
its own but two divisions with tracking stocks _ PE Biosystems and
Celera. Now, because of confusion with PerkinElmer, PE Biosystems
is changing its name back to Applied Biosystems, pending
shareholder approval this fall. PE Corp. is contemplating a name
change, too.
</P>
<P>
   White said that one reason for setting up Celera, which sells
genomic information, was concern that the instrument business might
be ``marginalized'' in the long run, with the real money being made
in using the instruments to study genes or to make drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But the move is risky in that PE Biosystems, through Celera, is
now competing with its own customers. Company officials say Celera
was not favored in shipments or service.
</P>
<P>
   Still, White talks about Celera, which is based in Rockville,
Md., having ``first mover advantage,'' because it gets to look at
the machines while they are still in development. PE expects to
benefit as well, using genetic information from Celera to design
genetic test kits.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, rather than hurting sales to other customers,
the formation of Celera has spurred them. ``It woke up the
industry,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunkapiller said he did not necessarily think that Celera's
formation would provoke the public genome project into buying so
many PE machines. ``We certainly didn't get into it with that
intention,'' he said. ``It just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people at PE Biosystems say the company in general, and
Hunkapiller in particular, should have received more recognition at
the White House ceremony. Hunkapiller said he felt bad for his
employees but not for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The positive side to his being ill was that his daughter,
Kathryn, a biologist who works for Celera, got to go in his stead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just doesn't care,'' his brother Tim said. ``Maybe deep
down there's some little twinge. But he doesn't express it.''

 &HT;    Even yobbos and bludgers love colorful `Strine' lingo
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 23
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the delights of visiting Australia is the language.
Strine, as Australians call their colorful brand of English,
descends primarily from the Cockney spoken by working-class Brits
200 years ago. Here's a beginner's glossary:
</P>
<P>
   Arvo. Afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Billabong. A water hole in an otherwise dry streambed. One of
many Aboriginal words in Strine.
</P>
<P>
   Bludger. A bum or deadbeat (from old criminal slang), as in this
graffito we saw in Sydney: ``Karl Scully is a bludger.''
</P>
<P>
   Bum bag. Fanny pack. The word ``fanny'' will get you slapped in
Australia; it refers to a woman's privates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tucker. Roots, berries, insects and other wild foods that
are part of the traditional diet of Aborigines. From a now rare
English term for eating (to ``tuck away'').
</P>
<P>
   Drongo. A stupid person.
</P>
<P>
   Fair dinkum. The genuine truth.
</P>
<P>
   Good on ya. An exclamation of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Jackeroo. A ranch hand.
</P>
<P>
   Lollies. Candy.
</P>
<P>
   Mateship. The Australian ideal of male friendship and teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   Middy. A small glass of beer.
</P>
<P>
   Ocker. An uncultivated Australian male.
</P>
<P>
   Oz. Australia. Shortened from Ozzie, which is how Aussies
pronounce it.
</P>
<P>
   Poms. The British. According to conventional wisdom, it derived
from the letters POME (Prisoner of Mother England), said to have
been branded on convict clothing. The editors of the Australian
National Dictionary disagree; they say it sprang from the Aussie
penchant for nonsensical sound-alike slang. In this case, any
British immigrant became a ``pomegranate,'' shortened to pom.
</P>
<P>
   Shout. To treat everyone to another round, as in: ``I've got
this shout, mates.''
</P>
<P>
   Snappies. Photos. Australians love to turn words into slang
diminutives. On a tour of the Olympic venues, a PR person told us:
``Take all the snappies you want, and if that isn't enough, we have
plenty of piccies.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall poppy. Someone who acts selfishly or displays too much
individualism. The Tall Poppy Syndrome is the opposite of mateship.
</P>
<P>
   Whinge. To complain or whine.
</P>
<P>
   Yobbo. Yet another term for a person lacking refinement. (Do we
discern a pattern here?)
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CRAWFORD, Texas _ ``It's going to be a little dusty,'' Gov.
George W. Bush announced as he walked toward a sport utility
vehicle and set off down one of the chalky dirt roads that snake
through his 1,583-acre ranch near this blink-and-you've-missed-it
town.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't kidding. The wheels turned, the vehicle lurched
forward and a thick, grimy powder filled the air, already heavy
from the 100-degree heat. The cattle up ahead looked torpid and
ornery. Bush looked happy and utterly relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Here it was: the Texas governor's idea of heaven. Not a cabin on
Lake Tahoe or a chalet in Vail, Colo., but a parched, remote patch
of land without a remotely decent restaurant or hotel nearby.
During the Republican primaries, Bush openly pined for it, telling
an audience or two how eager he was to return. After he cinched the
party's presidential nomination, he arranged his schedule so that
he could spend almost every weekend here, even though that meant
advisers sometimes had to make the two-hour drive northwest from
Austin to see him.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, he settled in for a long weekend during which he
said he would finally reach perhaps the most important decision of
his presidential campaign: Who would be his running mate. But
first, he took a few hours to give a group of reporters a tour of
what would be a kind of western White House if he won the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He did not pretend that he actually worked the land here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm what you call a windshield rancher,'' Bush said. ``I get
in my pickup and drive all over the place, ranching through the
windshield.''
</P>
<P>
   That means he looks at the pretty scenery, and there is plenty:
a river, a canyon, cliffs and oak trees so broad and gnarled that
they look like illustrations from a spooky fantasy book. Deer and
wild turkey roam the fields.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also plenty of relatively flat land with grass that
looks desperate for some liquid refreshment. It is in no sense a
conventional vacation or weekend home, and that is one of the
reasons Bush likes it so much. If fits his vision of himself as a
kind of rugged, simple man without finicky airs or fancy appetites,
and it fits into his claim of being someone whose soul is rooted
somewhere far away from Washington. That was clearly one of the
reasons he was eager to share it.
</P>
<P>
   A new house for the Bushes is under construction on the
property, and as Bush and his wife, Laura, walked reporters through
the structure, Bush said that he had made few demands about the
design of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked for a king-sized bed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a good shower,'' Mrs. Bush chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a good shower,'' Bush agreed. ``That's about all that I
care about.''
</P>
<P>
   At their side was the architect whom they hired for the project,
and the house that they modestly described as a three-bedroom ranch
sprawled over perhaps 4,000 square feet, although it was impossible
to know. The architect had been forbidden by the Bushes to provide
the dimensions, just as he was not allowed to estimate how much the
construction would cost. There was a another two-bedroom guest
house being built beside the Bushes' domain, plus a separate
garage.
</P>
<P>
   And the estimated $1.3 million that real estate agents have said
Bush must have paid about a year ago to buy this property, was an
indication that no matter how ordinary Bush considered his
lifestyle, it was anything but.
</P>
<P>
   The tour that Bush gave Friday also reflected his diligent
efforts over the last several months to forge a friendly, informal
relationship with the press corps. He invited representatives of
most of the nation's largest daily newspapers and all the major
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Although has conducted some campaign business here, the ranch is
mainly the preferred refuge of a man who has vowed not to let
himself get consumed by his political ambitions and has worn that
pledge as a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never forget you're running for president,'' he said, even
on more than a thousand acres far from the madding crowd. ``But it
gives me perspective. It gives me a lot of balance.''

DANFORD INVESTIGATION ABSOLVES GOVERNMENT IN DAVIDIAN SEIGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By DIANNA HUNT 
 And TONI HEINZ 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ A 10-month, $11 million investigation into the
standoff and final inferno near Waco in 1993 has cleared the
government of wrongdoing and blames the Branch Davidians for the
deaths of about 80 sect members.
</P>
<P>
   An interim report released on Friday by Special Counsel John C.
Danforth also ruled out a widespread government conspiracy and
coverup. It concluded that the government did not start the fire on
April 19, did not fire at Davidians that day, and did not
improperly use the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give you these conclusions with 100 percent certainty,''
Danforth, a former Republican senator from Missouri, said in an
afternoon news conference. ``I hope it lays these questions _ the
darkest questions relating to Waco _ to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The report mirrors the findings of an advisory jury in a Waco
civil trial last week. Danforth said he based his conclusions on
more than 2 million pages of documents, interviews with almost 900
witnesses and examination of volumes of physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said his office will continue to look into what he
described as non-disclosure by some FBI officials and government
lawyers about the use of pyrotechnic devices at the Mount Carmel
compound. In the news conference, he blamed their secrecy and
six-year concealment of facts for creating public mistrust in the
government, but said in an interview that he will not pursue
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no criminal prosecution,'' he said. ``It would
be overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   A final report should be ready by the end of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, whose name has surfaced as a possible running mate to
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, was appointed last September by Janet
Reno. His assignment was to investigate the confrontation between
federal agents and the Davidians that led to the deaths of four ATF
agents and about 80 sect members.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he decided to release his interim report, which he
described as 95 percent complete, to avoid conflicts with the
November presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that the timing was related to his desire to join Bush
on the presidential campaign trail, though he made veiled
references to ``an unexpected political possibility'' that surfaced
in May. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Davidians and their families said they weren't surprised by the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mount Carmel site near Waco, a weary, 79-year-old Edna
Doyle shooed some reporters away and waved others into her
double-wide mobile home. A simple white chapel has been built
nearby by survivors and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle left the compound several months before the standoff but
lost her teen-age granddaughter in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is going to do the judging, and they are going to be
eternally sorry and eternally lost, and it's nothing they can do to
get out of it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Thibodeau of Austin, who survived the fatal fire, said the
report's conclusions show that ``the fix is in,'' even though
Danforth is a Republican who was appointed by a Democratic
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that both sides want to protect the American
government,'' said Thibodeau, who has written a book about the
siege and fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Danforth report, he said, ``will just keep the fires of
controversy stoked, like the Warren report did for the Kennedy
assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to go away,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials were relieved by the vindication, their
second in a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's independent review sheds further light on the truth,
and discredits many of the unsubstantiated allegations that have
skewed the public's perception of the events of April 19, 1993,''
said Deputy U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder, who accepted the
report on Reno's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We join Senator Danforth in wishing this report begins the
process of restoring the faith of the people in their government,''
Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said the report confirms what the
FBI has said all along and should comfort beleaguered agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven years of absorbing unproven allegations and unfounded
criticisms has levied a heavy burden on the agents who were at Waco
and their families as well,'' he said. ``There were no ill motives,
as Senator Danforth found.''
</P>
<P>
   In Waco last week, a five-member jury cleared the FBI and the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of wrongdoing. The jury was
acting as an advisory panel to U.S. District Judge Walter Smith
Jr., who is expected to issue his own ruling after conducting a
hearing next month to determine whether FBI agents fired into the
complex on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Caddell, who represented several Davidians in the civil
suit, said the Danforth investigation overlooked inconsistencies in
testimony and failed to explore other possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to pursue criminal charges, moreover, ``cannot
help but add to the impression that a double standard exists for
government misconduct,'' said Caddell, also of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Dick DeGuerin, who entered Mount Carmel during the
standoff to represent Davidians, said critics will describe the
report as a whitewash because it does not question federal agents'
decision to finally use force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to ignore the creation of the situation that caused
the fire, and that is the tanks and tear gas,'' said DeGuerin, of
Houston. ``Even if you accept that Koresh was evil and was
controlling whether they surrendered or not, that doesn't excuse
treating all those innocent people in the same manner they treated
Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just going to feed all these conspiracy theorists who
will be dissatisfied with this as a whitewash.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said his investigation did not consider whether federal
agents acted responsibly in their handling of the standoff or
whether the government's standard operating procedures should be
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation was into bad acts and not bad judgment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's report concluded that FBI officials and several
government lawyers concealed from the public, Congress and the
courts information that three pyrotechnic devices were fired into a
construction area about 75 feet from the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said the tear gas canisters were fired four hours
before the fire began and did not start the blaze. Nonetheless, he
said, his office will continue to investigate why the Department of
Justice team that prosecuted the Davidians did not disclose the use
of the pyrotechnics; what happened to the physical evidence such as
shells and projectiles; and why the FBI denied the existence of
infrared tapes that captured the FBI commander approving use of the
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bradford, the U.S. attorney based in Beaumont who
represented the government in the civil case, said the Danforth
report bolsters the jury's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly totally supported by the facts,'' he said. ``I
would hope the verdict of the jury and the findings of Senator
Danforth would put an end to this matter. It should be a final
resolution to these questions.'' Staff writer Barry Shlachter in
Waco contributed to this report.

 &HT;    No matter how you sell it, it's still
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dawna Cekuta has seen all kinds of deal breakers during her 17
years as a real estate broker.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, she admits, was a first.
</P>
<P>
   One of her home listings was under contract to an Asian couple.
But the deal fell through when their feng shui consultant informed
them the house did not have good energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in my experience that a deal has fallen
through because of feng shui,'' said Cekuta of Amelia Bullock
Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't be the last.
</P>
<P>
   Cekuta and other area real estate brokers increasingly are
learning to work with clients from backgrounds different than their
own, with different cultures and ways of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that we're a global economy and we have to
be sensitive to other cultures,'' said Barbara Wallace, co-owner of
Amelia Bullock Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the U.S. housing industry has watched its
traditional market _ typically white, middle-class couples _ slowly
dwindle. In its place is a growing multicultural market, fueled in
large part by a surge in immigration.
</P>
<P>
   And, thanks largely to the region's high-tech industry, Central
Texas has seen a large influx of people from around the world. That
includes the arrival and expansion of companies with Asian ties,
including Samsung Austin Semiconductor of South Korea and Tokyo
Electron.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, 2,000 people moved to the area from outside the United
States, according to Regional Financial Associates. In 1998, 4,600
of the 24,300 people who moved to Austin came from other countries,
including India, Vietnam, China and Mexico. From 1990 to 1998, the
Austin area's Asian population jumped 75 percent to 34,900.
</P>
<P>
   According to research from the Joint Center for Housing Studies
at Harvard University, the homeownership rate for immigrants in the
age group 25 to 34 _ considered the prime home-buying years _
jumped 17.6 percent to 39.1 percent between 1990 and 1996. At least
51 percent of the foreign-born U.S. population are homeowners,
compared with 68 percent of those born in the United States,
according to the Fannie Mae Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate agents realize they need to be sensitive to the
needs of their increasingly diverse clientele if they want a piece
of this market.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Austin-area home builders also have adapted
their marketing and merchandising efforts. Many are hiring
bilingual employees and learning about different cultures. Some
have developed creative financing plans that, in some cases, enable
people to purchase a home with no down payment.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, foreign-born households accounted for just more than
10 percent of the U.S. population, according to the Harvard
center's 1999 State of the Nation's Housing study. The U.S.
foreign-born population is expected to continue to account for a
substantial share of household growth and home sales.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to immigrants, minority home buyers are becoming a
larger share of the market. The Joint Center for Housing Studies
also reports that African Americans and Hispanics accounted for
more than 30 percent of the increase in the number of homeowners in
recent years. And they will account for three-quarters of the
nation's population growth in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Realtors three years ago started a
diversity program, including its ``At Home with Diversity''
certification. The program helps agents learn about different
minority groups, cultures and ethnic backgrounds, and encourages
more people of diverse ethnic backgrounds to become real estate
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate broker Earline Wakefield's copy of ``Kiss, Bow or
Shake Hands'' _ a book about how to do business in 60 countries _
is well-worn. With her growing roster of international clients, she
keeps the book close at hand to brush up on the business practices
and etiquette of different countries. Many other agents around the
area also have a copy on their bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   A person's culture ``is something that does affect how people
select a home, where they select a home, how they'll pay for it and
how they
</P>
<P>
   do business,'' Wakefield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real estate is bought and sold much differently in other
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   For real estate agents, it may be as simple as bowing instead of
shaking hands when meeting a new client. It could mean hiring an
interpreter familiar with a foreign home buyer's language. One
Austin real estate agent made sure to schedule a visit to a mosque
during a house-hunting trip so the client could say her afternoon
prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural differences also can have a major influence on the type
of house a family buys.
</P>
<P>
   Asian and Latin American immigrants, for example, are much more
likely to have a parent, adult siblings, cousins and aunts or
uncles living in their households, according to the State of the
Nation's Housing. That means they may opt for larger houses with
more bedrooms. Showing a small house can be an affront.
</P>
<P>
   In areas with large Asian and Hispanic populations, builders are
showing larger floor plans with more bedrooms, said Gopal
Ahluwalia, assistant staff vice president of economic mortgage
finances and housing policy for the National Association of Home-
builders.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's feng shui.
</P>
<P>
   When working with many Asian clients, a good knowledge of feng
shui _ which means ``wind and water''_ is a must. With the
3,000-year-old practice of feng shui (pronounced fung shway), one's
physical surroundings are thought to bring balance and success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a few agents around town have learned about feng shui,''
said Marty Halseth, vice president of Prudential Owens Realty
Tejas- Lakeway.
</P>
<P>
   It sets down principles for everything from how a house sits on
its lot to the placement of walls and windows.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples of bad feng shui include a doorway that opens onto
stairs (good energy will escape up the stairs), open floor plans
where the front and rear doors line up (good energy will go
straight out the back door without lingering in the house) and
overhead beams (thought to provide a negative down-- ard pressure).
According to -- eng -- hui, an L-shaped house can raise the divorce
rate and increase the chance of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   An address with the numbers six, eight or nine is good, while
some Chinese and Southeast Asians steer clear of houses with the
number four in the address because in Chinese it sounds like the
word for death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers are looking for particular directions and floor- plans
that will enhance their well being,'' said Kimla Dodds, a real
estate agent with Prudential Owens Realty Tejas-Lakeway and a
consultant and practitioner with Austin-based Design with Feng Shui
Today.
</P>
<P>
   Dodds, who charges $125 an hour, said she has gotten a growing
number of calls from home buyers relocating from California who
want feng shui consultations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Austin has only two dozen or so feng shui consultants,
Southern California has more than 300 for agents and builders to
call. An entire subdiv-- -- ion in San Jose _ an area with a large
number of Asian home buyers _ was designed according to the
principles of feng shui.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, I'd just heard the term feng shui,'' said
Cindy Goldrick, a real estate broker with Wilson &AMP; Go-- drick
Realtors. ``Now you can almost count on it being important to
almost any client from Southeast Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   When Goldrick was working with a couple from Singapore, she
learned that they were concerned with the feng shui of their new
house. So she worked hard to find a house that faced in the right
direction, sat back from the street and had certain numbers in the
address. She even made sure the sales contract price had the lucky
sixes and eights in it.
</P>
<P>
   Goldrick viewed it as she would any other request by a home
buyer, whether it be a desire for a swimming pool, a preference for
three bedrooms or four, or a distaste for two-story houses. Her
job, she said, is to make the client happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To certain people, this is an important criteria of their home
purchase,'' she said. ``It's part of their culture and philosophy,
and we respect that.''

DANFORTH INVESTIGATION ABSOLVES GOVERNMENT IN DAVIDIAN SEIGE

   ST. LOUIS _ A 10-month, $11 million investigation into the
standoff and final inferno near Waco in 1993 has cleared the

<P>
   Danforth said the tear gas canisters were fired four hours
before the fire began and did not start the blaze. Nonetheless, he
said, his office will continue to investigate why the Department of
Justice team that prosecuted the Davidians did not disclose the use
of the pyrotechnics; what happened to the physical evidence such as
shells and projectiles; and why the FBI denied the existence of
infrared tapes that captured the FBI commander approving use of the
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bradford, the U.S. attorney based in Beaumont who
represented the government in the civil case, said the Danforth
report bolsters the jury's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly totally supported by the facts,'' he said. ``I
would hope the verdict of the jury and the findings of Senator
Danforth would put an end to this matter. It should be a final
resolution to these questions.'' Staff writer Barry Shlachter in
Waco contributed to this report.

   A car carrying Home Secretary Jack Straw, a champion of ``zero

this month going 103 mph, police said. Under guidelines laid down
by Straw's department, a motorist exceeding 100 mph can be banned
from driving and fined up to $1,200. Police say they have not
decided whether to charge the detective driving the car. At the
time, Straw was late for a Labor party meeting with Prime Minister

   The police continued to arrest members of the outlawed Falun

DANFORTH INVESTIGATION ABSOLVES GOVERNMENT IN DAVIDIAN SEIGE
</HEADLINE>
  (Resending to fix byline)

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ A 10-month, $11 million investigation into the
standoff and final inferno near Waco in 1993 has cleared the
government of wrongdoing and blames the Branch Davidians for the
deaths of about 80 sect members.
</P>
<P>
   An interim report released on Friday by Special Counsel John C.
Danforth also ruled out a widespread government conspiracy and
coverup. It concluded that the government did not start the fire on
April 19, did not fire at Davidians that day, and did not
improperly use the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give you these conclusions with 100 percent certainty,''
Danforth, a former Republican senator from Missouri, said in an
afternoon news conference. ``I hope it lays these questions _ the
darkest questions relating to Waco _ to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The report mirrors the findings of an advisory jury in a Waco
civil trial last week. Danforth said he based his conclusions on
more than 2 million pages of documents, interviews with almost 900
witnesses and examination of volumes of physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said his office will continue to look into what he
described as non-disclosure by some FBI officials and government
lawyers about the use of pyrotechnic devices at the Mount Carmel
compound. In the news conference, he blamed their secrecy and
six-year concealment of facts for creating public mistrust in the
government, but said in an interview that he will not pursue
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no criminal prosecution,'' he said. ``It would
be overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   A final report should be ready by the end of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, whose name has surfaced as a possible running mate to
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, was appointed last September by Janet
Reno. His assignment was to investigate the confrontation between
federal agents and the Davidians that led to the deaths of four ATF
agents and about 80 sect members.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he decided to release his interim report, which he
described as 95 percent complete, to avoid conflicts with the
November presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that the timing was related to his desire to join Bush
on the presidential campaign trail, though he made veiled
references to ``an unexpected political possibility'' that surfaced
in May. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Davidians and their families said they weren't surprised by the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mount Carmel site near Waco, a weary, 79-year-old Edna
Doyle shooed some reporters away and waved others into her
double-wide mobile home. A simple white chapel has been built
nearby by survivors and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle left the compound several months before the standoff but
lost her teen-age granddaughter in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is going to do the judging, and they are going to be
eternally sorry and eternally lost, and it's nothing they can do to
get out of it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Thibodeau of Austin, who survived the fatal fire, said the
report's conclusions show that ``the fix is in,'' even though
Danforth is a Republican who was appointed by a Democratic
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that both sides want to protect the American
government,'' said Thibodeau, who has written a book about the
siege and fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Danforth report, he said, ``will just keep the fires of
controversy stoked, like the Warren report did for the Kennedy
assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to go away,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials were relieved by the vindication, their
second in a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's independent review sheds further light on the truth,
and discredits many of the unsubstantiated allegations that have
skewed the public's perception of the events of April 19, 1993,''
said Deputy U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder, who accepted the
report on Reno's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We join Senator Danforth in wishing this report begins the
process of restoring the faith of the people in their government,''
Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said the report confirms what the
FBI has said all along and should comfort beleaguered agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven years of absorbing unproven allegations and unfounded
criticisms has levied a heavy burden on the agents who were at Waco
and their families as well,'' he said. ``There were no ill motives,
as Senator Danforth found.''
</P>
<P>
   In Waco last week, a five-member jury cleared the FBI and the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of wrongdoing. The jury was
acting as an advisory panel to U.S. District Judge Walter Smith
Jr., who is expected to issue his own ruling after conducting a
hearing next month to determine whether FBI agents fired into the
complex on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Caddell, who represented several Davidians in the civil
suit, said the Danforth investigation overlooked inconsistencies in
testimony and failed to explore other possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to pursue criminal charges, moreover, ``cannot
help but add to the impression that a double standard exists for
government misconduct,'' said Caddell, also of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Dick DeGuerin, who entered Mount Carmel during the
standoff to represent Davidians, said critics will describe the
report as a whitewash because it does not question federal agents'
decision to finally use force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to ignore the creation of the situation that caused
the fire, and that is the tanks and tear gas,'' said DeGuerin, of
Houston. ``Even if you accept that Koresh was evil and was
controlling whether they surrendered or not, that doesn't excuse
treating all those innocent people in the same manner they treated
Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just going to feed all these conspiracy theorists who
will be dissatisfied with this as a whitewash.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said his investigation did not consider whether federal
agents acted responsibly in their handling of the standoff or
whether the government's standard operating procedures should be
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation was into bad acts and not bad judgment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's report concluded that FBI officials and several
government lawyers concealed from the public, Congress and the
courts information that three pyrotechnic devices were fired into a
construction area about 75 feet from the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said the tear gas canisters were fired four hours
before the fire began and did not start the blaze. Nonetheless, he
said, his office will continue to investigate why the Department of
Justice team that prosecuted the Davidians did not disclose the use
of the pyrotechnics; what happened to the physical evidence such as
shells and projectiles; and why the FBI denied the existence of
infrared tapes that captured the FBI commander approving use of the
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bradford, the U.S. attorney based in Beaumont who
represented the government in the civil case, said the Danforth
report bolsters the jury's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly totally supported by the facts,'' he said. ``I
would hope the verdict of the jury and the findings of Senator
Danforth would put an end to this matter. It should be a final
resolution to these questions.'' Staff writer Barry Shlachter in
Waco contributed to this report.

 &HT;    Would you like a loan with that hammer?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Home Depot is catering to do-it-yourselfers who just can't wait
for their savings accounts to catch up with their desire to remodel
their kitchens and bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer this month began offering home-improvement loans of
$3,000 to $30,000 at its dozen stores in Palm Beach County and the
Treasure Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can apply for the loans at Home Depot stores. For
those with good credit and sufficient income, approval comes in
less than 10 minutes, said Heather Wilson, credit marketing manager
for Atlanta-based Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers get plastic cards _ not credit cards _ good for six
months. The cards let customers buy products against their credit
lines.
</P>
<P>
   The borrower repays the loan over a term as long as 10 years.
Interest rates range from 10.99 to 14.99 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The credit lines can be turned into home-equity loans so that
the interest is tax-deductible, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot markets the loans, but financial giant GE Capital is
the lender.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's chief rival, North Carolina-based Lowe's, tried
similar loans in 1998 in Indianapolis, but customers weren't
interested, said Lowe's spokeswoman Jule Eller.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, financial planners warn consumers not to be lured
into taking on too much debt through the Home Depot program.
</P>
<P>
   Home improvement projects typically aren't emergencies, so
consumers would be better off saving to pay for materials later
rather than borrowing the money now, said Mary Lou Nason, a North
Palm Beach financial planner and chairman of the Financial Planning
Association of the Gold Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why (Home Depot) is doing this, because they're
in the business of getting people to spend money on home
improvements,'' Nason said. ``I would caution people to look at
other ways of finding the money instead of taking on debt.''

   The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.2 percent as investors
returned their focus to corporate earnings, a day after pleasant
surprises from the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The Nasdaq was
off 90.11 points, to 4,094.45, while the Dow dropped 110.31 points,
or 1 percent, to 10,733.56. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
slumped 15.38 points, or 1 percent, to 1,480.19. But bond prices
rallied a little as hopes persist that new signs of slowing
consumer spending and economic growth will persuade Fed policy
makers to leave interest rates alone when they next meet, on Aug.

   PROFIT AT KODAK MEETS EXPECTATIONS

<P>
   Eastman Kodak said second-quarter profit rose 4.5 percent, in
line with Wall Street Expectations, as it cut costs and sold more
film. Profit from operations increased to $513 million, or $1.65 a
share, compared with net income of $491 million, or $1.52 a share,
in the period a year earlier. Even so, the largest photography
company said its United States market share shrank this year.

</P>
<P>
   Sears said that its second-quarter profit jumped 17 percent as

CAR COLLECTING: AUTOS THAT MOVE ON SURF OR TURF 
</HEADLINE>
   by KEITH MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has your car left you up the creek without a paddle? If you had
an Amphicar, you'd simply float back to shore. Or you could relax,
catch some rays and have a cool drink after you drop the anchor.
(What? Your car doesn't have an anchor?)
</P>
<P>
   Both the anchor and the paddle were options on the Amphicar,
built in 1961-68 by IWK in West Germany. Sales brochures described
it as ``the car that swims.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amphicar's origins are misty. Some think it was designed to
let commuters avoid traffic by diving into the canals of Northern
Europe. But of the 3,700 built, more than 3,000 came to the United
States, where they were promoted as dual-purpose recreational
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The car was powered by an 1,147-cubic-centimeter, 43-horsepower
engine built by Triumph of England. The engine was mounted in a
watertight compartment at the rear. There were separate
transmissions for land and water; a conventional floor shifter
worked the four-speed manual (with internal parts by Porsche) that
was used on terra firma. A nearby lever activated the two nylon
propellers at the rear.
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect, these odd ducks appeal to collectors with a
sense of humor and an adventurous streak. In 1965, two Amphicars
made news by crossing the English Channel. One stalled halfway over
after a bilge-pump failure let water into the engine compartment;
that car was towed by the other to France, where they were met on
the beach by surprised customs officials.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Gordon, 60, of La Habra, Calif., recalled driving an
Amphicar from Detroit to Mexico in his college days. He took it
into the sea to Cozumel, he said, but the engine stopped running
when his bilge pump failed. ``We drifted for two days and landed on
a deserted island,'' he said. A tugboat eventually came to the
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has also crossed Lake Michigan. Compared with boats that
bob atop the waves, the Amphicar ``goes through the waves rather
than over them,'' he said. ``It's a little like being in a
submarine.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's experience did not sour him on Amphicars. He now owns
Gordon Imports, the primary supplier of parts worldwide. He also
makes replacement parts.
</P>
<P>
   Launching an Amphicar requires some forethought, as the
steel-bodied car would quickly sink if not properly sealed. Before
taking the plunge, the driver must lock the doors with a lever that
makes them watertight. (Oversized rubber seals, similar to those on
a refrigerator, are available to prevent what owners refer to as
``door dribble.'') The door lock also prevents distracted
passengers from opening a door while in the water, which has an
immediate, negative effect on the car's buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
   But most important is the drain plug for the bilge and engine
compartment, which must be tightly secured. Owners tell a story,
perhaps apocryphal, about a German owner who proudly drove his new
Amphicar into a river but forgot to secure the plug. The car
quickly settled to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little scary the first time you go down the boat
ramp,'' said Jeff Sweet of Gloversville, N.Y., president of the
International Amphicar Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get that feeling like, `Is this going to work?' It seems
like the nose is going in the water a long ways before it picks up
and starts to float.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then the driver shifts the water-drive lever to the
forward-propellers position and the car swims away. The front
wheels act as twin rudders; the steering wheel is used in the usual
manner. As with most boats, there is no need to shift in the water;
the accelerator controls the speed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As in a boat, there are no brakes. Marc Schlemmer, 32, an
Amphicar owner in Hebron, Ky., said, ``The most common thing every
Amphicar owner has done, and is embarrassed to admit, is they push
the brake pedal while they're in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   When new, the Amphicar reached 75 miles an hour on land and 8 on
the water. ``But it's no fun to go boating with the engine revved
that loud,'' Sweet said. ``Five miles an hour is cruising speed.''
Performance on land is leisurely, too: 43 seconds from zero to 60
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Schlemmer described how it feels to set sail:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unnatural to be sitting in the water in a car. You
have your left arm on the window sill. You're looking in the
rearview mirror. You're driving. You feel low in the water. You're
sitting at about water level. Your feet are below water level. You
can easily drape your arm over the door and drag it in the
water.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Handling, on sea or land, was never the Amphicar's forte. In a
'60s road test, the vehicle was described as ``not a very good car,
and not a very good boat either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like driving a helium balloon,'' said Billy Syx,
who operates East Coast Amphicar, a restoration and repair shop in
Mays Landing, N.J. ``The cars weigh 2,200 pounds, have 10 inches of
ground clearance, a short wheelbase and narrow track.''
</P>
<P>
   If only the Amphicar moved fast enough, it could be a car, a
boat and a plane. Because of its high, blunt front end, it catches
the wind at highway speeds. This trait, combined with the engine's
weight at the rear, tends to make the front lift up. The steering
can become quite vague.
</P>
<P>
   But the mere fact that the Amphicar covered both surf and turf
set it apart, and it has a cult following. Sweet's club has some
250 members in 13 countries. Besides its Web address,
www.amphicar.com, other sites include www.amphicars.com and
www.amphicar.net.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-annual Amphicar Swim In, held by the club and
organized by Schlemmer, will be July 28-30 in Celina, Ohio, as part
of the Celina Lake Festival. About 40 cars are registered; they
will parade through town and plunge into Grand Lake St. Marys for a
group swim.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved cars and boats, so it made sense that I
would own an Amphicar,'' said Rick Young, of Murfreesboro, Tenn. In
1970, Young's father purchased a second-hand Amphicar for $600.
``He used to fish out of it,'' Young said. Today, he and his father
own three Amphicars, which they take for cruises on the Stones
River in Tennessee. ``It's very relaxing,'' Young said. ``I would
compare it to golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Some government agencies classify the Amphicar as both boat and
car.
</P>
<P>
   Schlemmer has two titles for his '65 model; it wears auto
license plates as well as boat registration numbers on the front
fender.
</P>
<P>
   Complying with contemporary nautical regulations, Amphicars have
red and green lights on a chromed pod on the hood, with a white
light in the rear. When new, Amphicars offered options like the
anchor ($12.95), anchor cleats ($10.85) and a marine kit consisting
of a fire extinguisher, floating cushions, flares and a paddle
($49.25). The car had a list price of $3,395 in 1961, or about
$20,000 in today's dollars. Increasingly strict safety and
emissions regulations, for cars and boats, contributed to the car's
demise.
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect of a steel-body car immersed in water _
often salt water _ the maintenance needs are high, like those of a
car and a boat combined. In water, the steering mechanism,
driveshaft and brakes are submerged. Frequent lubrication is
necessary; there are nearly 30 grease fittings on the steering and
suspension. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Amphicar is not the only wheeled beast in the water. Among a
number of amphibious military vehicles, the German-built
Schwimmwagen (of World War II vintage) is the most carlike and
coveted by collectors. Currently, Dutton Marine in Worthing,
England, produces amphibious cars that use mechanical parts from
Ford Fiestas and Suzuki Samurais.
</P>
<P>
   While prices of pristine Amphicars can top $35,000, ``a car
that's been restored, that's in nice condition, that swims good and
runs good, is worth $18,000,'' Schlemmer said. ``If it runs at all,
it's worth $10,000. Anything that swims at all is $12,000.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is roughly equivalent to the price of a vintage MGB sports
car. Since both are convertibles, either would be at home on a
topless beach. But only the Amphicar would dare to venture into the
waves. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ John Danforth, the special counsel investigating the
1993 tear-gas assault by federal agents on the Branch Davidian
compound, Friday issued a sweeping report that cleared Attorney
General Janet Reno and the government of any wrongdoing in the
deadly episode.
</P>
<P>
   Reminding a crowded news conference of his initial pledge to
answer the ``dark questions'' surrounding the case, Danforth, a
former Republican senator from Missouri, did not mince words. He
declared that agents did not shoot at the Branch Davidians and did
not start the fire that destroyed the compound on April 19, 1993,
claiming the lives of about 80 people.
</P>
<P>
   He said the military was not used improperly and that the
government ``did not engage in a massive conspiracy and cover-up.''
Danforth placed blame and responsibility for the deaths on members
of the religious sect, particularly the group's leader, David
Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certain,'' he said, reading from a statement. ``And I
give you these conclusions with 100 percent certainty. ``The blame
rests squarely on the shoulders of David Koresh. ``This is not a
close call.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Danforth exonerated the government, he also rebuked it.
He spoke pointedly and passionately about how public confidence in
government had eroded because certain officials failed to speak
candidly about aspects of the case. His own appointment by Reno had
come in September after disclosures that agents of the FBI, despite
repeated denials, had fired pyrotechnic tear-gas canisters capable
of starting a fire into the compound on the day it burned.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Danforth said that Reno and other high-ranking
government officials had not known that agents fired such
projectiles. But he blamed ``a few government lawyers and an FBI
agent'' for concealing the use of the projectiles. They were
launched hours before the fire and did not contribute to it,
Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that FBI agents fired three pyrotechnic
rounds at a bunker about 75 yards from the living quarters of the
Davidians. The rounds did not cause any damage, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Danforth report comes one week after an advisory jury
hearing a federal wrongful death civil lawsuit ruled that the
government was not liable for the deaths of the Branch Davidians.
The jury's verdict is not binding and the ultimate decision will be
made by the judge hearing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he waited to publish his report in order not to
influence the jury's deliberations. He called his investigation
``95 percent complete,'' saying another 3 1/2 months will be needed
to determine whether ``further action'' is necessary against those
involved in covering up the use of the projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a conference room at a downtown hotel, Danforth
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us should be more skeptical of those who make
sensational accusations of evil acts by government. At the same
time, government personnel, especially government lawyers, owe the
American people an openness and candor that was lacking in response
to the tragedy at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the government did nothing evil on April 19, 1993,
the failure of some of its employees to fully and openly disclose
to the American people the use of pyrotechnic devices undermined
public confidence in government and caused real damage to our
country.''

 ST. LOUIS: our country.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Washington, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder issued a
statement praising Danforth's findings. ``Today's independent
review sheds further light on the truth, and discredits many of the
unsubstantiated allegations that have skewed the public's
perception of the events of April 19, 1993,'' Holder said. ``We
join Senator Danforth in wishing that this report begins the
process of restoring the faith of people in their government.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said he was concerned about the findings that government
lawyers had withheld the information about the pyrotechnic rounds
but ``heartened'' that those rounds had not caused the fire. He
also said the report underscored the attorney general's ``diligent
efforts to learn the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Freeh, the FBI director, said: ``The simple truth, as the
FBI has maintained since April 19, 1993, has been unmistakingly
confirmed again today. The FBI fired no shots on that day and the
Davidians started the fire that ultimately engulfed the compound.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caddell, the lead lawyer for the Branch Davidians in the
wrongful death lawsuit, expressed disappointment with Danforth's
findings and found particular fault with his conclusion that
federal agents had not fired weapons. Next month, Caddell and
government lawyers will litigate that issue as a separate, but
related, part of the wrongful death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said Danforth disregarded flaws in a special simulation
conducted in March to help discern if weapons were fired. The
simulation was intended to determine if flashes that appeared on an
aerial, infrared videotape filmed the day of the fire were caused
by gunfire. A British company hired by Danforth to conduct the
simulation determined that the flashes were caused by reflections
from water and metal, not gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell had initially sought the test, but he later argued that
the simulation was imprecise. He said overlooking the flaws, such
as the poor quality of the simulation tape and what he termed
mistakes by the British company in carrying out the simulation,
``is both irresponsible and a disservice to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Friday's news conference, Danforth emphasized that
the scope of his probe was limited to ``whether government agents
engaged in bad acts, not whether they exercised bad judgment.'' He
said his parameters were confined to certain specific questions:
Did federal agents start the fire? Did they shoot at the Davidians
on April 19? Did they use pyrotechnic devices? Was there any
illegal use of the military? Was there a cover-up?
</P>
<P>
   An ordained Episcopal minister, Danforth was chosen, in part,
because of his reputation in the Senate for integrity and
rectitude. In conducting his inquiry, he had 16 lawyers and 38
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidian episode began on Feb. 28, 1993, when a
gunfight broke out as Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents
attempted to serve a warrant on Koresh at the compound near Waco.
Four ATF agents were killed. The ensuing 51-day standoff ended on
April 19 when FBI agents sought to subdue the Branch Davidians by
firing tear gas into the compound with tanks. The wooden structure
erupted in flames and burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Government critics have claimed that federal agents, frustrated
and angry, were either partly, or completely, responsible for the
deaths of those inside.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the investigation will address the actions of
those who hid information about the use of pyrotechnic rounds,
which have disappeared from evidence collected at the scene. In the
report, Danforth criticizes government lawyers for making
misleading statements about the rounds during the discovery process
of the civil wrongful death lawsuit. He also criticized the FBI's
failure, until September 1999 to release an audiotape of Richard
Rogers, the head of the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, authorizing the
use of the explosive rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said Reno and then-FBI Director William Sessions had
sought and received reassurances from field agents that pyrotechnic
rounds had not been used on April 19. Both testified to this before
Congress in 1993. The report stated that Rogers sat behind them
silently and his failure to correct their statements was `a
significant omission that contributed to the public perception of a
cover-up, which permitted a false impression to persist for several
years.`
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he was not paying attention to their comments during
the testimony. Danforth said the remainder of his investigation
would address questions surrounding why government lawyers and FBI
officials hid the existence of the pyrotechnic rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's office will not pursue any further investigation of
Rogers or any other members of the hostage rescue team, the report
said.

 &HT;    Bush give press tour of ranch; quiet on VP selection
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRAWFORD, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush took about two-dozen
reporters on a scorching tour of his 1,600- acre ranch Friday, the
place where he said he plans to come this weekend to make a final
decision about a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gave no hints of his thinking as he fielded a daily litany
of questions about his vice-presidential pick before jumping behind
the wheel of a Chevy Suburban and leading a procession of pick-ups
and vans packed with TV and print reporters on a ride over the
ranch's bumpy terrain in McLennan County, 90 miles south of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But the Associated Press reported that Dick Cheney, who is
heading Bush's vice presidential selection effort, may be emerging
as the leading candidate for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting an unnamed senior Republican official, the AP said Bush
is ``very, very close'' to choosing Cheney, who served as Secretary
of Defense under President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The official also confirmed that Chaney, who has been living in
Dallas, switched his voter registration to Wyoming, which he once
represented in Congress, to avoid having two Texans on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The switch is aimed at avoiding any conflict with language in
the 12th Amendment of the Constitution that forbids Electoral
College voters in Texas from voting for both the president and vice
president who are ``inhabitants'' of their state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gave no hint of such intrigue as he and his wife, Laura,
hosted reporters to a buffet lunch in the airy, modest farmhouse
where they are staying until a main house, now being built, is
completed. The target date for finishing that house is Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Looking relaxed in a green, cotton shirt, Wranglers and boots,
Bush said he does not need to meet with Arizona Sen. John McCain or
anyone else before making a decision. McCain reportedly told
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge in a telephone conversation this week
that he would serve as Bush's running mate if asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't need to, `` talk to McCain, Bush said in response
to a reporter's question. ``I'm going to make up my mind here over
the weekend. I'm not talking to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said there would be no visitors to the ranch this weekend.
He and his wife, Laura, travel to Atlanta today for the funeral of
U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell, Bush's point-man in the Senate. Coverdell
died Tuesday after suffering a massive stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would be in Austin Monday afternoon for a
television interview, heating up already intense speculation that
he could make an announcement as early as Tuesday. He is scheduled
on Friday to leave for a five-day tour leading up his arrival at
the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would first tell Laura the name of the person he
chooses, then notify that person and then let the other contenders
know they didn't make it. Asked when he would tell his father, Bush
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``He fits in there somewhere between Laura and the staff,'' he
said, laughing. ``No, I don't know. He'll know ...But he's not that
anxious to find out. He wants to know the decision, but he doesn't
need to be the first person to know. He trusts his boy to make the
right decision and I will make the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is beginning to ``fine-tune'' his convention speech,
``to make it flow better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have yet to say it out loud, let me put it to you that
way,'' Bush said. ``And I will here pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Friday was devoted to showing off the ranch's cliffs and
lowlands. The ranch features seven small canyons and is darted with
cedar elm, live oak, native pecan trees, among others. Laura Bush
said she plans to plant native Texas grasses around the main house.
The ranch has 200 breeding cows which belong to the foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters stepped over construction materials with architect
David Heymann, associate dean for undergraduate programs at the
University of Texas, and Laura Bush as their guides. Heymann said
the couple asked him not to reveal the size of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The group walked through the main house, a long, one-story
structure featuring a breezeway, a master bedroom and kitchen area,
an office for Bush and bedrooms for the couple's twin daughters,
Jenna and Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every room offers wide-open views and the house is
constructed to allow fluid movement from the indoors to the
outdoors. It will be finished in a type of limestone from Lampasas
and will feature a roof made of galvanized steel over aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly proud of the ranch, Bush said he'll leave the interior
design to his wife. He had a few, simple requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked for a king-sized bed, and that's about all I care
about,'' Bush said. ``And a good shower. And I want some
comfortable chairs out on the porch.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   One plays the part of the hayseed, the other the quintessential
New York tough guy, complete with flinty stare and a vocabulary
that might stun the crowd at a hip-hop concert. One loves bridge,
and jokes that he reluctantly drags himself around a golf course;
the other is a bundle of energy whose idea of relaxation is
rocketing down a frozen ski trail.
</P>
<P>
   Look deeper, though, and these two men _ Warren E. Buffett of
Omaha and Maurice R. Greenberg of Manhattan _ have more in common
than what sets them apart. By dint of intellect and Olympian drive,
each has built a far-reaching empire that for decades has delivered
immense value to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Each rules his company _ Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway,
Greenberg at American International Group _ with imperial
authority, in gracious defiance of the conventions of good
corporate government.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, Greenberg, who is 75 and known as Hank, and
Buffett, who will be 70 in August, are giants in the same game.
Though both Berkshire, quite famously, and AIG, less obviously,
have other operations, each is mainly in the insurance business; it
represents nearly 80 percent of Buffett's revenue, and, along with
related financial services, nearly all of Greenberg's. Glamorless?
Unexciting? Maybe _ until you understand that both see it as the
business of deploying assets to the greatest possible gain. ``We
think alike,'' Buffett said recently. ``If you showed us 10 deals,
we would probably come to pretty similar conclusions on most of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And that makes all the more extraordinary this simple fact: For
10 years, Greenberg's company has, for investors, been the better
bet.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire, of course, has been a spectacular long-haul
investment. A stake of $10,000 sunk into Buffett's
holding-company-cum-investment-fund in 1965 has grown to about $39
million. Built for long-term investors _ Class A shares, never
split, now sell for $53,300, a price that discourages trading _
Berkshire has minted many a millionaire and has made Buffett an
investing icon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an investor who plopped down $10,000 in Berkshire on June
30, 1990 _ a lifetime ago, by today's market standards _ would have
had $25,600 less on June 30, 2000, than one who bought an equal
stake in AIG: $74,700 versus $100,300. Over five years, the gap is
even greater: $10,000 invested in AIG in June 1995 would have grown
to $44,100 through June 2000, while the same amount in Berkshire
would have grown to just under $23,000.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett's recent underperformance of both the stock market and
his own historical record is no secret. Last year, Berkshire's gain
in net worth was less than 1 percent _ the ``absolute worst
performance of my tenure,'' he has acknowledged. And he offers his
investors little reason for optimism. Unbending in his value
discipline, Buffett says he finds it increasingly difficult to
uncover companies or stocks worth buying. Over the coming decade,
he says, Berkshire's gains will probably only modestly surpass
those of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg makes no such concessions. He has been averaging
annual earnings growth of about 20 percent since taking AIG public
in 1969, two years after he rose to chief executive; the stock has
gone up at about the same pace. As for the future, ``I don't see
anything that's going to rock that boat,'' Greenberg said in a
conversation this month at the company's Art Deco skyscraper on
Pine Street in Manhattan's financial district.
</P>
<P>
   That may be hubris on Greenberg's part, and Buffett's modesty
may be misplaced: his protestations of fallibility have often
preceded stellar performance. Indeed, the fading of technology
stocks this spring and the revival, at least temporarily, of the
consumer and financial sectors he favors have helped Berkshire
Class A shares rebound about 30 percent from a low of $40,800 in
March.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term numbers don't lie. AIG _ today the pre-eminent
U.S. commercial insurer, with operations in more than 130 countries
_ has earned comparison to Berkshire as a vehicle for long-term
investors. And it is high time, too, to examine Greenberg's legacy
in the same light as Buffett's.
</P>
<P>
   AIG is not as well known on Main Street as Berkshire. But on
Wall Street, said Doug MacKay, a portfolio manager at Oak
Associates, a mutual fund company that holds more than seven
million AIG shares. ``Maurice Greenberg is just legendary.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposite Styles of Investing
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg may act like the tough guy, but when it comes to
investing AIG's capital, he turns cautious. The company, which has
$268 billion in assets, making it the largest American insurance
company, has a classic insurance securities portfolio, heavy with
high-quality bonds and constructed to produce steady gains. His
acquisitions and new ventures generally amplify the successes of
the past.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Buffett invests like a riverboat gambler, limiting
his market plays to a few big bets and buying up companies with
little in common except that they are moneymakers with superb
managers and products that he personally likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berkshire will buy businesses with very volatile earnings if
the returns are high enough,'' said Alice Schroeder, an analyst at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter who has studied both companies. ``AIG
wants companies that produce predictable earnings over time.''
</P>
<P>
   AIG, she added, ``likes to have its capital fully allocated at
all times; Berkshire is an opportunistic investor.''
</P>
<P>
   Trained as an investor, not as a businessman, Buffett was first
drawn to the insurance business in the mid-1960s by the money _
other people's money, that is. The float on premium payments can be
put to work earning investment profits until a claim is filed.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg is an insurance man from the ground up. An Army
veteran of the Normandy invasion, he got a law degree and returned
to front-line service in the Korean War. Back in New York in 1952,
he walked into the office of Continental Casualty Co. and asked for
a job. The personnel manager showed him the door, but Greenberg
tracked down the head of the New York office, who liked his spunk
and put him to work as an underwriting trainee. In late 1960, he
joined the insurance company that would become AIG as a senior
executive. Seven years later, at the age of 42, he became chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing illustrates the differences between the two men's
investing personalities so much as their biggest single
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Buffett moved into the big time in insurance with
the purchase of General Re, one of the world's leading reinsurers _
the companies that take on other insurance companies' biggest risks
for a share of the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Most years, reinsurers collect substantial premiums without
having to make big payouts; the float can be very attractive. But
the risks of Buffett's investment quickly rained down on Berkshire:
big earthquakes in Turkey and Taiwan contributed to an underwriting
loss of more than $1 billion at General Re last year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, Buffett loves the company. It has everything it needs, he
says, ``to become the world's most profitable reinsurance
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg is no stranger to the wild, caroming fortunes of
reinsurance; AIG owns 60 percent of TransAtlantic Re, another
global leader in the field. But far from a walk on the wild side,
his biggest acquisition _ made shortly after Buffett bought General
Re _ was of a company built to be a safe bet.
</P>
<P>
   That company, SunAmerica, is a leader in variable annuities,
which combine mutual funds and insurance and are blazing new sales
records as baby boomers fret about retirement. The business itself
is one giant annuity for AIG, piling up money in long-term
investments from customers and throwing off management fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have bought a commercial bank,'' Greenberg said,
``but commercial banks, to us, have more volatility in earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Buffett notes, the two men follow similar disciplines
in analyzing a deal. Each carefully studies the financials himself,
rather than relying on staff summaries. Buffett is famous for
spending days reading annual reports; Greenberg seldom leaves the
office without two big satchels full of papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My weekends are playing tennis and reading,'' he said. ``And
on the telephone. That's generally my weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Reins, Loose and Tight
</P>
<P>
   As a manager, Buffett says he tries to keep his hands off
Berkshire's companies. But Greenberg is totally hands-on. As
Buffett puts it, ``He knows when the sparrow falls, and he even
knows when the sparrow is thinking of falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a month, Greenberg assembles his division presidents around
a rectangular table in a large, plain room on the 16th floor of
AIG's headquarters. To start ``the chairman's meeting,'' as it is
known, he swings his eyes around the room and, like a stern law
professor putting students to a test, finally lets his gaze rest on
one executive.
</P>
<P>
   That person has a minute or so to rattle off current sales,
expenses, profits and any unusual developments. Then, moving
clockwise, each of the other subordinates reports. It can be a
crisp, charged atmosphere. Greenberg tells his people that he wants
them to be entrepreneurs. And he wants performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they believe you are doing everything you possibly can,
they might accept some performance slippage,'' said Susan Rivera,
the president of an AIG division that sells workers' compensation
and other business insurance. ``But if you're not performing and
it's perceived you're not doing all you can, it is a short-lived
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg often recruits specialists from other fields and
teaches them the insurance business _ as long as they are quick
studies. He signed up Joseph L. Boren, who spent years in
government and business solving pollution problems, to develop new
coverages in his field.
</P>
<P>
   Boren, now president of AIG Environmental, has been attending
the chairman's meetings for four years. Greenberg, he said, is
``not denigrating; he's penetrating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't say, `You must be the biggest dope I've ever
seen,''' Boren added. ``But he might say: `You're alarming me. You
don't sound like you're in control.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In the scheme of things, you'd rather walk into a meeting and
have people say to you, `How are you today? Did you have a nice
weekend?' But that isn't how our business works, which is why our
business is so successful.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, when AIG acquired an 8 percent stake in Risk
Labs, a dot-com start-up in Atlanta, Greenberg sent in one of his
executives as acting chief executive. That is not the Buffett way.
Buffett says that one reason he buys a company is for its
management; when he takes newcomers into the Berkshire fold, he
leaves the managers alone. That is his plan for Justin Industries,
the maker of Tony Lama boots; Berkshire said last month that it was
acquiring the company.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said a senior executive of one of Buffett's companies,
``if you want to get him involved, you practically have to drag him
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has ways of letting his managers know what he wants done.
Years ago, after he acquired 50 percent of Geico, the discount auto
insurer that Berkshire now owns entirely, AIG offered to buy the
business.
</P>
<P>
   As John J. Byrne Jr., then Geico's chief executive, tells the
story, Buffett agreed only reluctantly to join him for lunch in
Greenberg's private dining room at AIG Greenberg and Felix Rohatyn,
a friend who was then a senior partner in the Lazard Freres
investment banking firm, tried to aim their conversation at
Buffett. ``You're looking at the wrong side of the table,'' he told
them. ``You've got to speak to Mr. Byrne.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne felt the chill. The next day he told Greenberg that Geico
was not for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, though, Buffett showed that he can lose his cool
as readily as any hands-on boss. Byrne had shifted much of Geico's
investment portfolio into long-term bonds _ at precisely the wrong
moment. Interest rates were starting to rise, which meant that he
would not only soon be locked into below-market yields, but that
the value of his bonds would be falling.
</P>
<P>
   As Byrne recalls it, Buffett invited him to play golf at the
Burning Tree Club outside Washington. Rather tentatively, Buffett
started to talk about the economy, and Byrne defended his decision.
As they played, Byrne could see Buffett becoming agitated. On the
ninth hole, he noticed Buffett gritting his teeth, the veins in his
neck pulsing. Unleashing a furious swing that clipped the top of
the ball and sent it dribbling about 14 feet, Buffett wheeled on
Byrne in a rage. ``Only a fool would lend long at this point in
time,'' Byrne recalls him shouting. ``Only a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne managed to stay on as chief executive. But he immediately
hired a specialist to run his investment portfolio.

   Woods on top at British Open
</P>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ They bide their time and keep waiting
impatiently. Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els, Sergio Garcia and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   If only Tiger Woods would supply them with a shred of hope,
maybe the attitude would be different going into the weekend at the
129th British Open. If he would make just one stinking bogey, maybe
they could dream.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods refuses to let any optimism creep into his pursuers'
thoughts. He remains as relentless as a headache for which there is
no pill.
</P>
<P>
   Through 36 holes at the Old Course, Woods has yet to make a
bogey. He rattled off six birdies Friday, tied three other players
for the lowest round with a 6-under-par 66 and built himself a
three-stroke cushion midway through the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The deja vu factor is getting ridiculous. It was barely a month
ago that Woods built a six-shot lead halfway through the U.S. Open.
All he did was mow down the field by 15 strokes. This seems all too
familiar, even if his advantage is only three shots over David Toms
and four over Garcia, Loren Roberts and Steve Flesch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good spot,'' Woods said. ``What you try to do in any
tournament is not make mistakes. Bogeys aren't good for the
scorecard. Everybody knows that. If you go around for the week and
don't make any bogeys, I guarantee you'll have a good chance to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm playing very similar to the way I played at
Pebble Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that Woods has a string of 62 consecutive holes in
major championships without a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   He teased everybody on the wicked Road Hole on Friday. His
approach rolled over the 17th green down to a patch of grass near
the blacktop road that runs behind the green. He pitched back to
eight feet, using the slope beyond the hole as a backstop. Then he
drilled the putt, giving a hearty fist-pump as the ball disappeared
into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was big because, first of all, I didn't want to make a
bogey,'' he said. ``But also, it was a double-break putt from no
more than eight feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I could go out and play solidly, the way the wind
was dying off in the evening, I'd probably be able to post a good
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods birdied three of the first five holes to jump to the top
of the leader board. He passed Toms, who finished four hours
earlier, with a birdie at the ninth hole. And he never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   It is getting to look so easy for Woods. He has avoided every
hazard at St. Andrews, including a topless female admirer who
stormed onto the 18th green after Woods' group putted out. She was
apprehended before she could get close to her target, which just
proves nobody can touch Woods this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who plays mistake-free golf is going to be tough to
beat,'' said Tom Lehman, one of five players at 6-under 138. ``He
hasn't made a bogey yet. All we can do _ all I can do _ is play my
best and not worry about what he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is playing coy, in spite of his strong play so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the trophy sitting next to me,'' he said, no
doubt resisting the temptation to insert the word yet at the end of
the sentence. ``I'm not in their shoes, so it's hard for me to
imagine what they're thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   What they mostly are thinking is how to get a run of birdies
going to close the gap. Clearly, Woods is playing well enough not
to go very far in reverse, if at all, when the third round
commences.
</P>
<P>
   What may keep him looking over his shoulder is the strong list
of players behind him. Mickelson matched Woods' 66 Friday, and an
international cast of marquee players is bunched together at 5, 6
and 7 under par. The question is whether they have too much ground
to make up.
</P>
<P>
   One chaser, Garcia, believes the tournament remains wide-open,
particularly because he's found a new weapon that has helped his
scoring _ cross-handed putting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's working so far,'' Garcia said. ``Because I played poorly
at the U.S. Open, I tried it. I played the Champions' Challenge
with my dad the week after and made a lot of putts. I went to
Ballybunion, the Irish Open, and putted really well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's helping me make putts, and it's helping my address. I
feel a lot better over the short putts than the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia has been mostly quiet since the PGA Championship at
Medinah last August. He had middle-of-the-pack finishes at the
Masters and U.S. Open, although he did have a third place at the
Buick Classic last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I am playing a lot like Medinah,'' he said. ``And I'm
in a perfect position. If you can be 10 ahead of the field, it's
great. But if not, you want to be really close to the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Four shots might not be really close to Woods. But it is about
as good as anybody could do Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Only Toms could manage better. His 67 left him at 8-under, and
he will have the chore of being paired with Woods today when the
duo tees off last at 9 a.m. CDT.
</P>
<P>
   Toms had five birdies and no bogeys Friday, playing wonderfully
by mere mortal standards, if not quite Tigeresque. But he seems
ill-equipped for the battle to come, although with three titles, he
is a proven winner on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in contention (in a major),'' Toms said.
``This is the first time I've been exempt for all four majors.''
</P>
<P>
   His first round on a weekend at the British Open figures to be a
tough initiation.

   Governance and Succession
</P>
<P>
   If Greenberg and Buffett run their companies like owners, it is
not without a certain logic. Buffett owns more than 30 percent of
Berkshire's stock; Greenberg owns 2.2 percent of AIG's, but he
estimates that top management and the board control about 30
percent of the shares. And each is accorded complete authority as
the builder of his enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, each man has aligned things in his favor. In defiance
of the norms of governance for public companies, their boards are
heavy with insiders. Neither man is interested in hearing about
mandatory retirement; both say they plan to go on leading their
companies indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg had to face a few hecklers on such issues at AIG's
annual meeting in May. But their reward for speaking up was chilly
glares from other shareholders and employees who had crowded into
the modest company cafeteria. As Greenberg was detailing yet
another stellar year and announcing yet another stock split, one
protester rose to argue that earnings often suffer at companies
with less-than-independent boards. Greenberg lobbed a soft reply:
``Are you sure you're in the right place?'' And the room, full of
loyalists, chuckled and clucked.
</P>
<P>
   Professional financial analysts tend to melt before Buffett and
Greenberg, too.
</P>
<P>
   At Berkshire's annual meetings in Omaha, reporters ask Buffett
for autographs; instead of trying to poke holes in his strategies,
many securities analysts admiringly quote Buffett aphorisms. When
Greenberg invites insurance analysts once a year to what they refer
to as a fireside chat, the questions are gentle. They have all
heard the tales of how Greenberg has called analysts and read them
_ and their bosses, who covet AIG's investment banking business _
the riot act.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't mess around with Hank,'' one analyst said on
condition of anonymity. ``He could squash me like a bug.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that such a leader would have dynastic dreams,
and Greenberg intends to keep the future of AIG in the family. His
eldest son, Jeffrey, had been regarded by AIG watchers as the heir
apparent, but he resigned abruptly five years ago, later becoming
chief executive of Marsh &AMP; McLennan, the giant insurance broker.
Now Jeffrey's 45-year-old brother Evan, AIG's president, has been
designated as next in line to run the company, where he has worked
for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the confidence of his father, it is hard to tell, at
this point, how well Evan Greenberg might perform. Subordinates
earnestly describe his thoroughness and command of the nuances of
the business. Some say he is brilliant. But industry executives who
know him well are noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know he's a competent fellow,'' said Barber B.
Conable, a former congressman and past president of the World Bank
who is one of six directors on AIG's 18-member board who are
neither company executives nor contractors. ``This is not an issue
we've been worrying about,'' he added, ``because Hank shows every
sign of continuing as the leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Conable said, after the senior Greenberg dies,
there is nothing to stop the board from choosing whomever it
decides is best suited to run the company. Conable said he once
told Greenberg: ``You must understand, your son will be tested by
the board at such time as you step down.''
</P>
<P>
   At Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has installed a seven-member
board that comprises his wife, Susan, who lives apart from him in
San Francisco; his son, Howard G. Buffett; Charles T. Munger, the
company's vice chairman, who has long been Buffett's confidant; a
law partner of Munger's and two other longtime business associates
of Buffett's.
</P>
<P>
   After Buffett dies, his wife is to receive nearly all his stock.
But she will not run the company; instead, he has designated two
Berkshire executives to take his place _ one to handle investments,
the other operations. Neither has been publicly named, but there
has been speculation that Louis A. Simpson, who is in charge of
investments at Geico, would take over the investing side. Buffett
watchers mention several candidates for the operations job, with
little conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever they are, Buffett's successors will be hard pressed to
preserve Berkshire's unique place in the investment pantheon. The
market does not value Berkshire as it would an insurance company,
even though that is what it mainly is. Rather, it is priced largely
on the performance of its chief executive's stock picks. Whether
the cult followers will remain in thrall to Buffett's successors is
anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   AIG certainly revolves around Greenberg _ ``If you don't have a
relationship with Hank Greenberg, you don't have a relationship
with AIG,'' said an insurance executive who has known Greenberg for
years. But analysts say an AIG without Greenberg is a surer bet
than Berkshire without Buffett: There are more units, more decision
makers, a broader playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the Scorecards
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, neither Buffett nor Greenberg shows any sign of
slowing down. Indeed, their business strategies put them face to
face more and more, inviting the comparisons that previously were
not so obvious. For example, will Buffett's Geico or Greenberg's
AIG Direct reap the most rewards in the competition for
bargain-minded auto insurance customers?
</P>
<P>
   Both are pouring money into advertising and expansion.
Characteristically, Buffett is going for broke; he wants Geico to
become one of the giants in the business. Greenberg wants to grow,
too, but earnings in car insurance fluctuate too much to suit him,
so he will keep the line from dominating AIG's portfolio of
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, do you bet on the Manhattan tortoise or the Omaha
hare? Schroeder, the Morgan Stanley analyst, finds it difficult to
choose. ``That's like asking whether to buy a Van Gogh or a
Monet,'' she says.
</P>

   &UR; FROM RIVALRY TO COOPERATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH B. TREASTER &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   After decades of rubbing shoulders around the casino tables of
finance, Warren E. Buffett and Maurice R. Greenberg have come to
admire each other warmly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vibe between us is not competitors,'' Buffett said. ``The
vibe between us is friends.'' Envious friends, but friends. ``I
wish I had done some of the deals he's done,'' Buffett said, ``and
maybe he wishes he'd done some of the deals I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Greenberg said, ``we have a great relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But things have not always been so rosy. Fifteen years ago, they
exchanged verbal punches. Buffett criticized the way the American
International Group, of which Greenberg is chief executive, used
reinsurance, and Greenberg fired back that Buffett had ``a
peanut-sized book'' of insurance business _ which was true at the
time _ and that he was a fine one to be telling him how to run his
company, already a giant in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a long time ago. Now they are doing business
together; AIG is the biggest single customer of General Re,
Buffett's main insurance holding. And they are keen competitors:
TransAtlantic, the big reinsurer that AIG controls, goes after some
of the same business that General Re does, and the two titans are
pursuing the same customers in car insurance businesses.
</P>
<P>
   They have collaborated on some joint projects, but their biggest
idea _ the attempted rescue and takeover of Long Term Capital
Management, the hedge fund that nearly failed in 1998 _ came to
nothing. Others on Wall Street beat them to it.
</P>
<P>
   But they're still thinking. ``It's logical that we would team up
on something,'' Buffett said. ``We and they have enormous capital
resources.''

ONLINE STORE REACHES DEAL TO SELL DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over continued objections of privacy advocates and attorneys
general of 39 states, the Federal Trade Commission announced Friday
that it had reached a settlement to permit Toysmart.com, a defunct
online toy seller, to sell its customer database as part of its
bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 3-2 vote late Thursday, the commission also put strict
limitations on the sale. Under the settlement, a buyer of
Toysmart's database must be in a family-related commerce market,
buy the entire Web site and agree not to sell the database without
getting permission from the individuals included in it.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement must now be approved by the court hearing
Toysmart's bankruptcy proceedings. It was reached in a civil
lawsuit filed by the FTC earlier this month in U.S. District Court
in Boston in an attempt to prevent Toysmart from selling the
database.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also amended its original complaint against
Toysmart on Friday, adding a second charge that the company had
collected personal information from children in alleged violation
of the Children's Online Privacy Act of 1998. It is the first time
the government has filed charges under the act since it went into
effect in April.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it announced the second complaint, the commission said
it reached a settlement in which Toysmart agreed to destroy about
2,000 records that might have been in violation of the law, said
Harry Murphy, a lawyer for Toysmart. The law prohibits sites from
collecting data from children younger than 13 without parental
consent.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering on Friday highlighted how important the case has
become to privacy advocates, legislators and Internet industry
observers. With Internet companies able to easily build massive
databases on their visitors, various political and policy groups
have expressed concern about how to balance the benefits to
companies and consumers of collecting the information, which can be
used to create targeted advertising, with privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   While the company, which is majority owned by Walt Disney Co.,
posted an explicit policy stating that it would not sell customer
information to a third party, it later went bankrupt and sought to
sell the database along with its other assets, raising the specter
that other dot-com companies would fail and would hawk their
databases too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely sending a message that just because a company
fails, we're going to continue to pursue action,'' said Eric
London, a spokesman for the trade commission. ``If there's a
bankruptcy tidal wave, this is going to happen a lot,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time the commission has filed a complaint
pertaining to the release of database information from an online
company; in August 1998, the FTC settled with GeoCities, which the
government alleged made information available to third parties
without disclosing the activity to its users. But the Toysmart case
is the first time the FTC has brought such an action in a
bankruptcy setting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the case of Toysmart, the database amounted to information
collected on about 250,000 individuals, Murphy said. Murphy
declined to speculate on the value of the database, but he said
that earlier this year he represented a client that liquidated a
far larger database for $210,000, suggesting that the Toysmart data
might not be so lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said that the company has received two, or possibly
three, bids for the database, including one from Disney, which held
three of the company's five board seats. Disney said after the
commission sued Toysmart that it would buy the database and
``retire'' it. Murphy said a second bid was from Digital Research
Inc. of Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   However, it remains to be seen whether any sale of the database
will go through. A bankruptcy court in Boston is scheduled to hear
the case Wednesday, and it will hear objections to the sale that
have been filed by at least two groups _ an online privacy
organization and attorneys general from 39 states.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the attorney general of Massachusetts filed an
objection on behalf of his state and 38 others in the bankruptcy
court, asserting that the sale of the database constitutes an
unfair and deceptive trade practice.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Kogut, an assistant attorney general in Massachusetts
handling the case, said Toysmart should be forced to live up to its
promise to never sell the data to a third party. ``Outside the
context of this bankruptcy filing, Toysmart should be prohibited
from selling this customer list,'' she said, noting that the
bankruptcy should not free Toysmart from its promise.
</P>
<P>
   She said the attorneys general were studying the FTC settlement
but wouldn't comment on it until after the bankruptcy hearing on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the court will also hear an objection from Truste, a
nonprofit agency that certifies the privacy policy of online
retailers. Toysmart was among about 2,000 sites that have received
Truste's seal of approval, and it was the organization that brought
Toysmart's effort to sell its database to the attention of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   David Steer, a spokesman for Truste, said that he had not
studied the FTC settlement thoroughly but that it did appear to
leave too much room for the sale of the database in a way that
would violate the promise made to Toysmart visitors. ``We're going
to go ahead with our own suit,'' he said, referring to the
objection filed by Truste on Friday in bankruptcy court. ``We
applaud the FTC for getting halfway there.''

ERICSSON STOCKS DROP ON WARNING OF SLOW SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors hammered shares in Ericsson on Friday despite a
healthy increase in second-quarter earnings, as concern grew that
the Swedish company might be losing ground in the battle for
control of the thriving market for wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Ericsson fell $2.75, or 12 percent, to $19.8125 on the
Nasdaq market, its deepest one-day decline in more than a year and
a half. Much of the sell-off was attributed to Ericsson's warning
that third-quarter sales of cell phones would be more sluggish than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ericsson attributed part of the expected slowdown to a
recent fire at an Albuquerque semiconductor plant operated by its
main supplier, Royal Philips Electronics, some analysts questioned
whether the company's overall mobile phone strategy in the last
several years was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ericsson is paying the price for not seizing on the general
direction of the industry,'' said Mark Roberts, a
telecommunications analyst in the San Francisco office of First
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones have emerged as one of the top-selling electronic
items in the world, with more than $70 billion in revenue expected
from the sale of 450 million units this year. And it increasingly
appears that companies betting on the specialization of the
devices, as opposed to their commoditization, are winning.
</P>
<P>
   This means that Nokia, the Finnish company that has succeeded in
increasing its market share largely by providing a wide array of
devices for consumers, is doing better than competitors. Motorola,
which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., and is the second-largest cell
phone manufacturer, has been attempting to follow Nokia's strategy
in making variety a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson, meanwhile, the No. 3 manufacturer, has been derided
for not structuring its operations to produce phones profitably.
``Their design cycles are slow, and they exposed themselves to a
fire in a single factory,'' said Brian Modoff, a telecommunications
analyst at BT Alex. Brown. ``I see no reason at all why they should
be in the business of making phones.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to make its mobile phone operations profitable by
the middle of next year, Ericsson said it was planning to focus on
fewer production lines and increase research to market more
attractive lower-end models. Kurt Hellstrom, Ericsson's chief
executive, told investors in a conference call that the company had
no plans to sell its division that manufactures mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to building networks for wireless operations,
Ericsson's other main business, the company continued to show
promise, with a 32 percent increase in sales in the second quarter.
Ericsson has won some of the most lucrative contracts in Europe to
build the next generation of networks that are expected to widen
the spread of the wireless Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Network manufacturing activities largely fueled an increase in
Ericsson's profit from operations in the second quarter, which
climbed 46 percent to 2.35 billion kronor, or about $261 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ericsson excels when it comes to the construction of networks,
which is becoming a huge market,'' said Andrew Cole, who heads the
wireless practice at Renaissance Strategy Worldwide. &QL;

FOND FAREWELL FOR NICKLAUS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ They were perched on the balconies of
Rusack's Hotel and hanging out of windows at the Tom Morris Golf
Shop. They were lined 10 deep along Links Road, and thousands more
were stretched from tee to green for close to 400 yards as Jack
Nicklaus approached.
</P>
<P>
   He was ``playing up toon,'' as they say here, making the walk up
the 18th fairway at St. Andrews for what is expected to be his
final appearance in a British Open. The obligatory photo on the
Swilken Bridge was taken, Nicklaus doffing his cap to the roar of
thousands, a hero in a sport that covets its history, and as he
approached his ball on the edge of the Valley of Sin, the cheers
grew louder.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were terrific,'' he said. ``They let me know that they
appreciated the good years that I've had in Scotland (all three of
his British Open triumphs were in this country, two at St.
Andrews), and they gave me a very, very nice farewell.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is a farewell, after 37 British Opens?
</P>
<P>
   ``Never say never,'' said Nicklaus, ``but I would say the
chances are I've probably played my last hole in the British
Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Former champions are awarded exemptions through the age of 65,
which for Nicklaus would mean 2005. He was told the 2005 British
Open is tentatively penciled in for St. Andrews, but Nicklaus said
that was too far down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say no,'' he said, ``but I certainly am not going to
play unless I can be competitive. I don't want to take up a spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The game's most accomplished player feels anything but
competitive these days. He missed the cut at the Masters in April
and the US Open in June, and Thursday he shot 77 here. Friday,
after making the turn in 34 to offer a hint of life, he came home
in 39 to finish 73_150. His feet are bothering him, though not as
much as a deficiency that was quite evident on the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   From just 6 feet after a superb approach, Nicklaus hung over the
birdie putt and saw the left-to-right break. ``It just broke like
the devil,'' said Nicklaus, who parred the hole. Nicklaus had
delighted the US Open crowd in June when he reached Pebble Beach's
par-5 18th in two, only to douse the enthusiasm by three-putting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never putted like this in my life,'' he said, shaking his
head. ``Today was a good putting round for me. I made two putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like resignation talk from a guy who has made more clutch
putts than anyone in the game's history. There isn't much more
competitive golf on his schedule this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am playing a show match Monday, and the chances are I will
probably play golf on Sunday,'' he said. ``That excites me a real
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't tomorrow his 40th wedding anniversary? Yes, it is, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Barbara would approve of a golf date? ``I played golf the
day I got married,'' Nicklaus said. ``Barbara did not mind it then,
she's certainly not going to mind it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus laughed, knowing his time has come and gone on the golf
course, but his wife and five children remain the core of his life.

COMMENTARY: A CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE FOR BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Thousands of American lawyers, here for the annual
meeting of the American Bar Association, celebrated their ``common
bond'' with English law: the legal protections of freedom developed
since the barons forced King John to sign Magna Carta in 1215.
</P>
<P>
   The two legal systems do have much in common, but there is a
fundamental difference. The United States has a written
Constitution, and Americans rely on judges to enforce its
guarantees against official abuse. Britain has no such higher law,
and judges have been bound to carry out whatever Parliament said.
</P>
<P>
   That is about to change. In October, the European Convention on
Human Rights will become binding on British courts. Judges will
have to measure acts of Parliament and government decrees against
the convention's guarantees of free speech, fair procedure and the
like.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking to a visitor is how little understanding there
is of the difference that change is likely to make. Tony Blair's
New Labor government put through a statute that will bring the
European Convention into British courts. But it is nevertheless
coming up with one proposal after another that seems, to an
outsider, to violate basic concepts of civil liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The home secretary, Jack Straw, asked a commission last year to
consider whether the rule against double jeopardy should be
abandoned under some circumstances. The rule has been part of the
judge-made law of England for 900 years, preventing the retrial of
anyone for an offense of which he has been acquitted. It is part of
the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The British commission considering the issue has tentatively
recommended a partial breach of the rule, and Conservative Party
spokesmen have called for action. Straw says he will wait for the
final commission report, but the expectation is that he will move
to allow some retrials of people who have been acquitted. However
limited, that would give prosecutors enormous discretion. Americans
would surely regard the step as a drastic violation of traditional
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Straw also has a bill pending to deprive many criminal
defendants of the right to trial by jury. Again, that would be
impossible in the United States, where jury trial in criminal cases
is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   And right now Straw is pushing through Parliament an
extraordinary bill to deal with the hooligans who go to foreign
stadiums when British soccer teams play there. As drafted, the bill
would have allowed the police to seize the passports of _ and hence
prevent international travel by _ anyone they suspect is likely to
act violently at a match.
</P>
<P>
   Guilt by suspicion, in short. Happily, the bill came under such
strong criticism that Straw modified it to cover only those
believed to have committed what would be a criminal offense. But
even then its standards are so vague that it would raise
constitutional hackles in America.
</P>
<P>
   One more venture by Straw is a bill to let the state make anyone
who uses coded e-mail give officials the key to decode it, so they
can intercept and read it as they wish. That proposal has drawn
outraged protests from leading technology companies in Britain and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Like Straw, Blair seems to have no concern for civil liberties.
What matters, evidently, is pleasing the voters by being tough on
law and order. The respected Guardian columnist Hugo Young wrote
this week of Blair's ``indifference to, almost his contempt for,
civil liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of the legislation I have mentioned, or other bills
in the pipeline, will actually be found to violate the European
Convention remains to be seen. What is notable is that, on the eve
of a great step for the protection of civil liberties, the
government shows no sign of caring.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Britons do not understand what a difference judicial
protection of individual rights can make. Some people, especially
on the ideological left, say that British judges are too
conservative to care about civil liberties. Such commentators have
not noticed that the judges in recent years have shown an
increasing tendency to scrutinize official action. Giving them
constitutional power will make a profound difference.

PENTAGON ORDERS PUNISHMENT FOR HARASSMENT OF GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon announced an ``anti-harassment action
plan'' Friday that would require military commanders to discipline
service members who engaged in, condoned or ignored anti-gay
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan was short on details, and Carol DiBattiste,
undersecretary of the Air Force and head of the panel of civilian
and military leaders that drafted the plan, acknowledged in a news
conference that it was ``going to take some work'' to get the four
military services to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, the Army formally released its internal
investigation into circumstances surrounding the murder of a gay
private last summer, which found evidence of anti-gay remarks and
harassment on the base where the murder occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department's plan recommends training tailored to
the specific rank of troops to implement the Clinton
administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which allows gay
men and lesbians to serve in the military provided they keep their
sexual orientation a secret and do not engage in homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is a response to a survey of 38 military bases and 11
warships that concluded that anti-gay remarks and harassment were
commonplace in the U.S. military, and that most service members
believed their superiors and colleagues tolerated it ``to some
extent.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, ordered after Pfc. Barry Winchell, a 21-year-old gay
soldier, was bludgeoned to death last July in his barracks at Fort
Campbell, Ky., suggested that disparaging and hostile attitudes
toward gays remained a pervasive part of military culture.
</P>
<P>
   The Army investigation into the murder provided more evidence of
those attitudes. The investigation concluded that the ``command
climate'' in Winchell's unit was ``poor,'' and admitted that
``joking and bantering'' on the base before his death could be
viewed as harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The report found isolated incidents ``where leaders had
subjected soldiers to derogatory name-calling and slurs,'' and
evidence of ``inappropriate cadence calls'' in which unit leaders
led soldiers in derogatory chants as they marched in formation.
</P>
<P>
   The report details specific incidents of harassment. For
example, 21 of 568 soldiers interviewed during group sessions said
that they had knowledge of verbal harassment of service members
perceived as homosexuals. Half of those who observed such
harassment said it was done ``on a daily basis.'' Most of the
harassment was in a work area or in formation during duty hours.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the evidence of anti-gay behavior, the report cleared
all officers of blame in the murder of Winchell and concluded that
there was no general climate of homophobia at the base, home of the
101st Airborne Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was determined that the command climate at Fort Campbell''
before the murder was ``a positive environment,'' with some
exceptions, the inspector general's report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that the Army had failed to educate service
personnel about the policy. Except for first sergeants,
noncommissioned officers could not recall any training on the
policy toward gays during any officer development course, the
report said. Less than 5 percent of commanders, command sergeant
majors and leaders interviewed said that they had received training
on the policy in their units.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task force was unable to confirm a single occasion where
unit training was ever conducted on the policy at Fort Campbell''
before the murder of Winchell, the report said. Half of the
soldiers interviewed said they did not fully understand the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that is not a lack of leadership, I don't know what is,''
said Michelle M. Benecke, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network, an organization that provides legal aid to gays in
the military.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the sergeant who was Winchell's immediate superior was
accused in the report of ``abusive'' behavior, stripped of his
leadership position and reassigned, no criminal charges have been
filed against him. Asked repeatedly whether the sergeant was under
criminal investigation, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric K. Shinseki
said only that such a decision was in the hands of the base.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on an accusation by Patricia Kutteles, Winchell's
mother, that the Army was covering up a gay-bashing atmosphere on
the base, Shinseki said, ``I will tell you this, if this were a
cover-up I wouldn't be standing here today.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Winchell as he slept renewed the debate over the
Clinton administration's policy on gays, and the issue has
permeated the presidential campaign. Vice President Al Gore vows to
allow gays to serve openly. His Republican opponent, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, supports the existing policy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has described the policy, which he instituted
in the first year of his presidency, as ``out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked Friday if he agreed with the president's
description, Bernard D. Rostker, undersecretary of defense for
personnel and readiness, said: ``I don't agree with that
characterization. I think the policy is working reasonably well to
provide a degree of safety for those who want to serve in the
military regardless of sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBattiste described the process by which a service member has
to report anti-gay harassment and the commanding officer has to
respond. The service member must report the details of the
harassment, but not whether he or she is gay; his or her superior
must elicit the details without asking the alleged victim whether
he or she is gay.

VOTES ON CUBA ARE SEEN AS SIGNALING BIG CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Cuban American (no hyphen) is cq in next-last graf) 
 By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Successive House and Senate votes on Thursday night
to ease restrictions on American travel and certain sales to Cuba
are the latest evidence of a gradual but significant shift toward
normalizing ties with the Marxist-run island, according to
lawmakers and experts on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans defected by the score from their party's traditional
pro-embargo stance and this week handed a dual victory to the
coalition of farming interests, business groups and Democrats
trying to lift American sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Both chambers of Congress approved the sale of food and medicine
to Cuba. And the House went one step further, seeking to allow
American tourism to the island by barring money to the federal
agencies that enforce against the ban on such travel.
</P>
<P>
   None of the provisions are expected to win final approval before
September, if ever. But they signal an important change in how
American decision-makers view Cuba, possibly the most momentous
shift since 1994, when the Clinton administration first decided to
intercept Cuban refugees at sea and send them home.
</P>
<P>
   And, the experts and lawmakers say, the change raises the
likelihood that the next president and Congress will feel freer to
remove the remaining restrictions on ties with Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the barriers are coming down,'' said Peter Hakim,
president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a hemispheric forum in
Washington. ``The people who want to hold onto the structure of the
embargo are slowly losing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official, who asked not be named, predicted
that the trade ban would likely be eliminated after the November
elections, no matter who controlled Congress or the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo-easing amendments in the House on Thursday night,
sponsored by Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Rep. Jerry
Moran of Kansas, both conservative Republicans, passed with votes
of 232-186 in favor of the travel provision and 301-116 supporting
food and medical sales. Within an hour, the Senate overwhelmingly
approved _ 79-13 _ an agriculture bill that also approved food and
medicine sales but barred American credits to facilitate the trade.
</P>
<P>
   The votes are likely to strengthen the prospects for a separate
measure by Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., to allow food and
medical sales, which moves into a conference committee in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders and Cuban-American lawmakers who have sought
to stymie the Nethercutt proposal will have to rethink their
stance, said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and
Economic Council, a clearinghouse for American businesses
interested in trade with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be Democrats fighting Republicans on wanting to
expand the relationship with Cuba,'' Kavulich said. ``Now, it's
Republicans fighting Republicans, with the Democrats standing to
the side waiting to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba watchers say a number of factors have changed the
perception of Cuba and the United States policy of diplomatic
isolation and economic boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The bruising battles over trade with China and the Clinton
administration's rationale that engaging Beijing is in America's
strategic interest has invited charges of hypocrisy over Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In advocating greater contact with Cubans, Sanford invoked a
conservative icon, former President Ronald Reagan, saying his
decision to let American students travel to Eastern Europe helped
bring down the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rhetoric behind this was that you change societies by
contact, and that Americans can make a difference by being there,''
said Pamela Falk, a Cuba expert at the City University of New York
law school.
</P>
<P>
   But some supporters of sanctions say Fidel Castro has shown
himself much more impervious to liberalizing reforms than have
China's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American public believes Cuba has changed because the
world has changed,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``It's an
assumption that unfortunately is contradicted by reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Another significant factor influencing Americans' shifting
perceptions of Cuba came in the Elian Gonzalez case. From the
morning news through the nightly talk shows, Americans were forced
to think about Cuba _ and Cuban-Americans _ for months.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's decision to return Elian to Cuba over what
many saw as the strident objections of the 6-year-old's Miami
relatives undercut the image of the well-financed Cuban-American
lobby as invulnerable and not to be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Joe Garcia, the newly appointed executive
director of the Cuban American National Foundation, a lobby that
long exerted virtual veto power over United States policy,
acknowledged losing critical ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the most important thing we realized was we have to
depend on ourselves in this struggle to educate the American
people,'' Garcia said.

<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is investigating why its own
officials ignored evidence for 18 years that W.R. Grace and Co. had
used ore laden with asbestos in an array of building products.
</P>
<P>
   An agency study in 1982 found alarming levels of asbestos in ore
that Grace had said included harmless amounts of the material,
which can cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency shelved the report, scuttled follow-up studies
and continued to accept the company's lower figures, EPA officials
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed Grace, a maker of specialty chemicals and building
materials, largely to avoid government scrutiny and use the ore in
products, like fireproofing, that the company promoted as a safe
alternative at a time of growing anxiety about asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The widely used fireproofing materials, as well as attic
insulation and other products, remain in thousands of homes and
offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the health risks are unclear, because it is not known how
much asbestos may be present in the products. Grace said it tried
to remove as much asbestos as possible during processing. EPA
officials are advising homeowners to call the agency for more
information if they are concerned that they may have the company's
loose-fill insulation, known as Zonolite, in their attic.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, EPA officials said this week, an agency official
misrepresented the report in 1983 and downplayed its findings in
responding to congressional inquiries about the level of asbestos
in the ore.
</P>
<P>
   The report resurfaced after the EPA began an investigation in
December into a health crisis in Libby, Mont., where Grace mined
the ore, known as vermiculite, until 1990. Workers and town
residents are dying from lung disease at rates far above the
national average. Agency officials are poring through thousands of
documents to figure out why the government failed to properly
oversee the mining operation and why EPA officials didn't follow up
their report.
</P>
<P>
   The report, letters and other records have been sent to the EPA
inspector general, who plans to begin an inquiry on Monday, agency
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't ask our inspector general to do an investigation
lightly,'' said Steve Johnson, deputy assistant administration of
the office of prevention, pesticides and toxic substances. ``We
want to know precisely what did happen. With regard to W.R. Grace,
more and more information seems to be uncovered that raises
questions about what they knew and what they didn't know and what
they released and didn't release to us, and it's entirely possible
that information may come out through this investigation that may
show they have done something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials said this week that they had uncovered Grace
documents that show high levels of asbestos in the ore. Paul
Peronard, head of an EPA team trying to clean up the Montana mine
site, said, ``It doesn't appear to me that the data contained in
the documents were shared with anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace officials Friday did not dispute the EPA report, but said
their own studies had consistently shown much smaller amounts of
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our results from measuring the ore do not find the same thing
that EPA's results do,'' said William Corcoran, vice president of
public and regulatory affairs for Grace, which is in Columbia, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the mining operation were touched off by
newspaper articles last fall on the health problems of Libby
workers and residents. Lawsuits that they have filed accuse Grace
of covering up the hazards posed by the mining operation.
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran said, ``We don't believe we've ever covered them up. We
know people have been hurt.'' He added that Grace's preference is
to continue trying to settle the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The ore went into insulation that Grace began selling in the
early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   At issue now is how much asbestos _ in a form known as tremolite
_ made its way into those products as a contaminant. A growing body
of medical evidence has raised concern among doctors about this
lesser known form of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tremolite is one of the most dangerous fibers,'' said Dr.
Jacqueline Moline, an occupational and environmental health
specialist at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   At processing plants throughout the country, Grace had sought to
remove most of the asbestos from the vermiculite in its Zonolite
line of products, which included a popular loose attic insulation
that Grace sold until 1984 and is believed to still be in as many
as 1 million homes. Some asbestos remained in the insulation, but
Grace did not warn consumers, The Boston Globe reported earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has maintained that its products contain only trace
amounts of asbestos _ far below the 1 percent level at which the
EPA restricts its use.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer concern over the insulation has raised another issue
that is confounding government officials: how best to measure
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners who are having their insulation tested for
contamination are getting widely varying results _ from ``traces''
to 2 percent asbestos, said Wayne Toland, the EPA asbestos
coordinator in Boston. One test turned up 5 percent. ``The results
are not necessarily consistent,'' Toland said. ``The method being
employed varied and so did the results.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that testing laboratories are
unfamiliar with vermiculite and tremolite and do not know how to
properly prepare the samples. He said his office has hired an
asbestos expert, Eric J. Chatfield, of Chatfield Technical
Consulting, Mississauga, Ontario, to develop a standard procedure
for preparing the test sample.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Peronard said he also is working to develop new
methods of testing vermiculite for asbestos, since the common
techniques are designed to detect asbestos at quantities of 20
percent or more _ huge by today's standards, where 1 percent or
less may be cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it at the wrong angle, you won't see the
fibers,'' Peronard said. ``We obviously have the fear that we're
under-counting and under-reporting the asbestos content of
samples.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace has written to the agency questioning the need for new
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA does have methods for determining what is asbestos
content, which have been peer reviewed and scientifically accepted
for years and years,'' Corcoran said, ``so we are trying to get
some understanding of why, if those methods are good enough for
every other situation, why are they not good enough for this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Yang, who while working as a scientist for Grace designed
the company's asbestos laboratory techniques, said in a recent
interview that she had developed her own method of measuring
asbestos fibers. She said she thus avoided counting things that
looked like fibers but were not, like the edges of platelets. As a
consequence, she said she came up with results that were typically
50 percent less than the methods suggested by regulatory
authorities would have produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used a modified technique,'' Yang said.
</P>
<P>
   Because she was convinced the ore had minimal amounts of
asbestos, Yang said she rarely checked the levels in Grace's
products, maybe once or twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   The 1982 EPA study was triggered by an earlier outbreak of
health problems among workers at a Marysville, Ohio, plant where
vermiculite from Grace's Montana mine was used in making
fertilizer. A federal inquiry in 1978 found that four workers
suffered from bloody lungs. X-rays showed that one in four workers
had lung abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   In late October 1980, Thomas Dixon, an EPA analyst who then
worked in the toxicology branch, went to Montana to gather samples
of Grace's vermiculite ore. With an early winter storm threatening,
Dixon recalled that he and the agency's consultants rushed over the
next five days to collect dozens of scrapings from the mine and an
adjoining cleaning plant, which were then shipped to a laboratory
for testing.
</P>
<P>
   They found between 21 percent and 26 percent asbestos in the raw
ore, and up to 7 percent in the cleaned form that was shipped to
plants for further processing. The five grades of cleaned ore they
tested ranged for the most part between 2 percent and 7 percent,
with only one category falling below the EPA's regulatory threshold
of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Grace has maintained over the years that far less
amounts of the cancer-causing substance contaminated its ore. For
instance, in a 1986 letter to the EPA in which Grace argued for an
exemption from proposed rules to label products that have asbestos,
the company said its Montana ore was sullied by only 4 percent to 6
percent asbestos coming out of the mine, and less than 0.5 percent
on average when cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   EPA staff became anxious for their own safety. A Grace official
described in a memorandum how he received a call on May 20, 1982,
from a Denver EPA employee who ``had just heard that vermiculite
may be contaminated with asbestos. The EPA uses vermiculite to pack
samples for shipments to laboratories for analysis. I spoke to him
for a few minutes because he was so upset and I did not want to
transfer him without calming him down. They dump half a bag of
vermiculite into a shipping carton two or three times a day. I told
him that the exposures would undoubtedly be low if good ventilation
was provided and that the respirator he indicated they were using
would provide additional protection.''
</P>
<P>
   But the EPA never carried out its plans to follow up on its mine
study by examining the Grace material at its processing plants. Nor
did it test the consumer products made with the ore as planned,
agency officials said. Agency staff say they moved on to pressing
health matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priority dropped and we were off on other things, like
looking at dioxin for the first time,'' said Martin Halper, a
former toxicology division chief.
</P>
<P>
   The report surfaced briefly in 1983 when the late Peter Rodino
and another member of Congress forwarded to EPA a letter from a
Grace competitor in the fireproofing business who asked: ``Why did
EPA embark on such an extensive project collecting, analyzing and
characterizing vermiculite samples for asbestos contamination and
then suddenly choose both to simply drop its intended second, and
more critical, phase of the project.''
</P>
<P>
   The response came from an acting assistant administrator for
pesticides and toxic substances, who, according to Peronard,
wrongly cited a table of data in the study as indicating the
asbestos fell below 1 percent. ``He mixed it up,'' Peronard said.

   &QL;  WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, Ext. 218.
WASHINGTON, July 21 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Estate
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on July 14 approved, 59-39, a bill to end the federal
inheritance tax. The legislation would phase out taxes on an estate
after the owner dies. Supports said it would save family farms,
businesses and resources. Opponents said it would threaten spending
on benefits for senior and poor Americans. A ``yes'' vote supports
the elimination of the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: Monuments
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday rejected, 49-50, a measure to prevent the
administration from designating federal monuments without
congressional approval. Supporters said the measure would restore
local input in the development of federal lands. Opponents said it
would reduce the president's power to protect the environment. A
``yes'' vote supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: Interior
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 97-2, a $15.5 billion spending
bill for the Department of Interior, a Northeast oil reserve and
other federal programs. Supporters said it would provide critical
funding for national parks and energy programs. Opponents said it
would underfund conservation efforts. A ``yes'' vote supports the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: Marriage
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 61-38, a bill to eliminate the
``marriage penalty'' tax. The bill would increase the standard
deduction for married couples, cutting $246 billion in taxes over
10 years. Supporters said it would offer equitable tax commitments
to married Americans. Opponents said it would shrink the projected
federal surplus. A ``yes'' vote supports the marriage tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: Medicine
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday voted, 74-21, to amend a spending bill
to allow importation of medicines approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. Supporters said it would allow pharmacists to
negotiate better prices with manufacturers. Opponents said it would
swell the FDA's responsibilities and add to the spread of dangerous
drugs. A ``yes'' vote supports the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: Funding
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday passed, 79-13, a $75.3 billion spending
bill for food, drug and farm programs. The bill includes $900
million in emergency aid. Supporters said it would relieve flood
and crop damage. Opponents said it would ruin federal budget plans.
A ``yes'' vote supports the spending bill.

   The House on Monday defeated a bill to prohibit most forms of
Internet gambling. Failing to reach the two-thirds vote needed to
pass the bill, the House rejected the legislation, 245-159.
Supporters said it would have prevented crime and addiction.
Opponents said it would have created regulatory problems and
allowed for invasion of privacy. A ``yes'' vote supports the
gambling bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: Spam
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday passed, 427-1, a bill to limit unsolicited
email messages, or spam, and allow Internet service providers to
sue spammers in federal courts. Supporters said junk emails cost
providers $1 billion every year. Rep. Ron Paul(R-Texas), the only
member to vote against the bill, contended it infringes on states'
rights and wastes federal funds. A ``yes'' vote supports spam
restrictions.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Japan _ President Clinton emerged from a meeting here with
Russian President Vladimir Putin with more questions than answers
regarding North Korea's offer to abandon its ballistic missile
program if other countries gave Pyongyang help in exploring space.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, if genuine, could undercut the U.S. argument for
building a National Missile Defense (NMD) to protect the United
States against missile attacks. Russia fiercely opposes the plan,
saying it would spark a new, costly and dangerous arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not entirely clear what's in (North Korean leader) Kim
Jong Il's mind with regard to this possible trade-off,'' said a
senior White House official who attended the 75-minute
Clinton-Putin meeting, as the annual Group of Eight summit of world
leaders began on this heavily guarded island.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very dangerous idea would be the international community
would provide actual launch capability to North Korea,' the
official said, ``that is to say rockets launched from North Korean
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if Kim envisions launching North Korean satellites on
foreign soil, ``it's something we'd be prepared to pursue,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are set to meet again Saturday with their Russian
counterparts to get a clearer understanding of the proposal. A
senior administration official said the offer was the major topic
of discussion among G8 leaders at their dinner Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting with Putin, coming just six weeks after his
trip to Moscow in June, centered largely on security issues and
Putin's trip to North Korea this week, in which he announced that
Pyongyang had offered to give up its missile program if other
nations would provide it with rockets to launch satellites into
space.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's missile program is the prime motivation for a U.S.
national missile defense which is vigorously opposed by Russia and
China. France and Germany also have opposed the defense system.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told reporters,
``I'm skeptical about it.'' He stressed that America can do what it
sees in its national interest, but said it should discuss the issue
with NATO and Russia. Chirac said he feared creation of a missile
shield could start another arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will decide this summer whether to go ahead
with the missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate media briefing, Russian Foreign Minister Igor S.
Ivanov told reporters that North Korea is not interested in
receiving missiles or missile technology to independently launch
satellites but, rather, wants other nations to launch satellites
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If such assistance is offered, North Korea is ready to stop
ballistic missile tests,'' Ivanov declared. ``It's too early to
discuss specifics, such as whether such assistance would envisage
providing funds or carrying out launches.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the United States and Russia issued a joint
statement saying they are dedicated to finding new ways to
cooperate on controlling the spread of nuclear missiles by
implementing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty _ that the
U.S. Senate has rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding for a greater role in the Group of Eight, Putin also had
a lengthy discussion with Clinton on the Middle East peace talks
going on at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   The president has decided to leave Okinawa early to resume these
talks. He will now arrive in Washington late Sunday afternoon
instead of late Sunday night. Although it was unclear whether he
would head straight to Camp David, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said, ``I expect him to get right to work.''
</P>
<P>
   A Sunday afternoon speech Clinton was scheduled to make to U.S.
troops and their families in Okinawa has been moved to late
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had a bilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori Saturday morning which yielded no new ways to deal
with the anger of Okinawan residents over the huge U.S. military
presence on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, amid criticisms that the leaders of the world's
seven richest nations have done little to meet their commitments to
reduce the debt of poor nations, the leaders pledged to work harder
to fulfill their goals.
</P>
<P>
   However, critics said the countries _ the United States, Canada,
France, Italy, Germany, Britain and Japan _ are still moving too
slowly in meeting their promise from last year's summit in Cologne
to cancel up to $100 billion of debt owed by 40 of the world's
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders at Cologne made a big political statement last
year saying they'd cancel $100 billion in debt,'' said Marlene
Barrett, a spokesperson for Jubilee 2000, an organization
campaigning for debt cancellation for poor countries. ``They simply
failed to get that through.''
</P>
<P>
   The G8 discussion of debt relief came one day after a meeting in
Tokyo in which leaders of several developing countries stated their
frustration with the slow pace of debt relief by the world's
richest nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of (the G8 leaders) referenced the meeting that had taken
place yesterday . . . and which gave greater impetus to the need to
get the Cologne debt commitments implemented,'' said Lael Brainard,
deputy national economic advisor.
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by G8 leaders Friday _ not including Russia
_ expressed concern that many of the poor nations are at war or
have military conflicts which prevent them from qualifying for debt
relief. They agreed to do more to help those countries qualify, but
Brainard said there was no discussion of relaxing the terms of debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton landed in Okinawa Friday morning and headed straight to
a peace memorial in an effort to placate criticism from another
corner _ local Okinawans unhappy with the large U.S. military
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa hosts about 26,000 American military personnel, more
than half of the American forces in Japan, even though it comprises
less than 1 percent of Japan's land mass. An estimated 27,000
people turned out Thursday to form a human chain around Kadena
Airbase in a show of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged to continue efforts to ``reduce our footprint on
this island,'' but some Okinawans were disappointed that he neither
said anything specific about base reduction nor apologized for an
incident earlier this month in which a drunken U.S. marine
allegedly entered a local house and molested a sleeping 14-year-old
girl.
</P>
<P>
   A few small, scattered groups of anti-base protesters appeared
at various summit venues and along the main road.
</P>
<P>
   The Okinawa summit is Clinton's eighth and last G8 summit. He
joined the group as the new kid on the block and leaves as the
veteran.

   NAGO, Japan _ President Clinton emerged from a meeting here with
Russian President Vladimir Putin with more questions than answers
regarding North Korea's offer to abandon its ballistic missile
program if other countries gave Pyongyang help in exploring space.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, if genuine, could undercut the U.S. argument for
building a National Missile Defense (NMD) to protect the United
States against missile attacks. Russia fiercely opposes the plan,
saying it would spark a new, costly and dangerous arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not entirely clear what's in (North Korean leader) Kim
Jong Il's mind with regard to this possible trade-off,'' said a
senior White House official who attended the 75-minute
Clinton-Putin meeting, as the annual Group of Eight summit of world
leaders began on this heavily guarded island.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very dangerous idea would be the international community
would provide actual launch capability to North Korea,' the
official said, ``that is to say rockets launched from North Korean
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if Kim envisions launching North Korean satellites on
foreign soil, ``it's something we'd be prepared to pursue,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are set to meet again Saturday with their Russian
counterparts to get a clearer understanding of the proposal. A
senior administration official said the offer was the major topic
of discussion among G8 leaders at their dinner Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting with Putin, coming just six weeks after his
trip to Moscow in June, centered largely on security issues and
Putin's trip to North Korea this week, in which he announced that
Pyongyang had offered to give up its missile program if other
nations would provide it with rockets to launch satellites into
space.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's missile program is the prime motivation for a U.S.
national missile defense which is vigorously opposed by Russia and
China. France and Germany also have opposed the defense system.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told reporters,
``I'm skeptical about it.'' He stressed that America can do what it
sees in its national interest, but said it should discuss the issue
with NATO and Russia. Chirac said he feared creation of a missile
shield could start another arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will decide this summer whether to go ahead
with the missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate media briefing, Russian Foreign Minister Igor S.
Ivanov told reporters that North Korea is not interested in
receiving missiles or missile technology to independently launch
satellites but, rather, wants other nations to launch satellites
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If such assistance is offered, North Korea is ready to stop
ballistic missile tests,'' Ivanov declared. ``It's too early to
discuss specifics, such as whether such assistance would envisage
providing funds or carrying out launches.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the United States and Russia issued a joint
statement saying they are dedicated to finding new ways to
cooperate on controlling the spread of nuclear missiles by
implementing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty _ that the
U.S. Senate has rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding for the Middle East peace talks going on at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   The president has decided to leave Okinawa early to resume these
talks. He will now arrive in Washington late Sunday afternoon
instead of late Sunday night. Although it was unclear whether he
would head straight to Camp David, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said, ``I expect him to get right to work.''
</P>
<P>
   A Sunday afternoon speech Clinton was scheduled to make to U.S.
troops and their families in Okinawa has been moved to late
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had a bilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori Saturday morning which yielded no new ways to deal
with the anger of Okinawan residents over the huge U.S. military
presence on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, amid criticisms that the leaders of the world's
seven richest nations have done little to meet their commitments to
reduce the debt of poor nations, the leaders pledged to work harder
to fulfill their goals.
</P>
<P>
   However, critics said the countries _ the United States, Canada,
France, Italy, Germany, Britain and Japan _ are still moving too
slowly in meeting their promise from last year's summit in Cologne
to cancel up to $100 billion of debt owed by 40 of the world's
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders at Cologne made a big political statement last
year saying they'd cancel $100 billion in debt,'' said Marlene
Barrett, a spokesperson for Jubilee 2000, an organization
campaigning for debt cancellation for poor countries. ``They simply
failed to get that through.''
</P>
<P>
   The G8 discussion of debt relief came one day after a meeting in
Tokyo in which leaders of several developing countries stated their
frustration with the slow pace of debt relief by the world's
richest nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of (the G8 leaders) referenced the meeting that had taken
place yesterday . . . and which gave greater impetus to the need to
get the Cologne debt commitments implemented,'' said Lael Brainard,
deputy national economic advisor.
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by G8 leaders Friday _ not including Russia
_ expressed concern that many of the poor nations are at war or
have military conflicts which prevent them from qualifying for debt
relief. They agreed to do more to help those countries qualify, but
Brainard said there was no discussion of relaxing the terms of debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton landed in Okinawa Friday morning and headed straight to
a peace memorial in an effort to placate criticism from another
corner _ local Okinawans unhappy with the large U.S. military
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa hosts about 26,000 American military personnel, more
than half of the American forces in Japan, even though it comprises
less than 1 percent of Japan's land mass. An estimated 27,000
people turned out Thursday to form a human chain around Kadena
Airbase in a show of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged to continue efforts to ``reduce our footprint on
this island,'' but some Okinawans were disappointed that he neither
said anything specific about base reduction nor apologized for an
incident earlier this month in which a drunken U.S. marine
allegedly entered a local house and molested a sleeping 14-year-old
girl.
</P>
<P>
   A few small, scattered groups of anti-base protesters appeared
at various summit venues and along the main road.
</P>
<P>
   The Okinawa summit is Clinton's eighth and last G8 summit. He
joined the group as the new kid on the block and leaves as the
veteran.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lloyd Tysuir was trying, without much success, not to
shake. He had tightly pursed his lips and pressed his forearms
against his knees. His head was bent low, eyes fixed on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Two Immigration and Naturalization Service officers, in white
short-sleeved shirts and blue pants, stood over Tysuir, their
detainee from Kingston, Jamaica, at Kennedy International Airport.
And nearby, Dr. Robert M. Trager, the man with the unusual title of
airport dentist, pulled on his surgical gloves with a snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax,'' he said. ``This isn't going to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Much, though, was at stake for the young man on this afternoon
as he at last opened his mouth inside Trager's tiny dental office,
just down the hall from the American Indian gift shop in the
airport's Terminal 4.
</P>
<P>
   Dental and bone X-rays, in the view of the INS, are one of the
most reliable ways of determining age. The eruption of wisdom
teeth, and the fusion of bones in the wrist, usually signify that a
person is over 18, Trager said. And an immigrant's age can be
critical to his or her effort to gain entry to, and residence in,
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So, hundreds of Chinese, Somalis, Sri Lankans, Albanians,
Hondurans and others who claim on travel documents to be under 18
have filed through Trager's office in recent years. He takes X-rays
of their teeth, and often of their wrists as well.
</P>
<P>
   They get a look out the office's small window onto the airport
tarmac. For most, it is all they see of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Trager, who also has a private practice in Queens, works under
contract to the INS. In his airport office, he also sees a regular
roster of airport employees and businessmen who need fillings and
the like. ``I was in the right place at the right time,'' he said
of his work for the INS, which began in 1997. ``My office is right
above Customs and Immigration. Lawyers for the detainees have tried
to challenge my diagnosis and method, but these challenges have all
been dismissed in federal court.''
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, INS agents single out immigrants who appear to
be older than their paperwork indicates, and take them to see
Trager. Minors who enter the United States, unlike adults, are
exempt from immediate deportation. They are automatically released
to any family members living in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The INS will allow minors to remain in the United States if they
are granted political asylum or ``special immigrant juvenile
status,'' given when a child is the victim of abuse or neglect.
Most cases take at least six months to resolve. If they are denied
asylum, they cannot be sent home until their relatives are
contacted in their country of origin.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile immigrants who have no relatives in the United States
can be detained. But during any period of detention, they are
housed separately from adults for their safety.
</P>
<P>
   For the immigrants, then, the stakes can be high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use this method because it is a widely accepted process
within forensic medicine to accurately, within a given range,
determine an individual's age,'' said Russell Bergeron, a spokesman
for the INS. ``This is important to us because we need to determine
age in order to ensure juveniles are handled as juveniles and
adults do not use false statements with respect to their age to
avoid treatment as adults.''
</P>
<P>
   But some specialists view the dental and wrist X-rays as far
from foolproof. Dr. Herbert H. Frommer, the director of radiology
at New York University College of Dentistry, is one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to make an exact judgment based on
radiographs of whether an individual is above or below the age of
18,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates cite the case of a teen-ager from
Liberia, Mekabou Fofana, who arrived at Kennedy Airport in July
1999 and had a dental and bone exam. Based on the X-rays, he was
determined to be over 18, and was therefore ordered held at a
detention center in Queens. His family members, including an uncle
who is a U.S. citizen, continue to insist that he was born on July
20, 1983, and that he should be treated as a minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about the accuracy of this practice,''
said Eleanor Acer, a staff attorney for the Lawyers Committee for
Human Rights, which is handling Fofana's case. ``We have found
teen-age children, inaccurately determined by the INS to be adults,
detained in adult facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates also criticize the INS's decision not to allow those
determined to be adults to appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be some objective scrutiny of this decision by
someone like an immigration judge,'' said Wendy Young, the director
of government relations at the Women's Commission for Refugee Women
and Children. ``One of the problems we encounter is that there is
an incentive by the INS to detain children with adults, because it
is cheaper. When you have one dentist contracted to the INS making
these calls, it raises red flags.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the dentist's office last week, Tysuir was so nervous that he
could barely make it to the beige vinyl dental chair. He started
moaning: ``They are going to lock me up and put me in jail. They
are going to lock me up and put me in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only 15,'' he implored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calm down, Louie,'' Trager said, mispronouncing the young
man's name. ``You are going to be all right, brother. Just relax.''
</P>
<P>
   When the dentist finished taking pictures of Tysuir's mouth, he
took two X-rays of his wrist, tossing the first aside because his
patient was shaking too much.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with a smile, he waved goodbye to his patient and the two
uniformed escorts and shut the door to his tiny dark room, built in
what was once a closet, with a bang.
</P>
<P>
   Trager, 60, has examined well over a thousand undocumented
immigrants and those with questionable documents, and nearly all,
after his 20-minute procedure, have been determined to be older
than 18.
</P>
<P>
   While the exams are routine, intended to detect the wisdom teeth
and determine whether the wrist bones are fused, many of the
immigrants take one look at the dental drill, the stocky doctor and
the rows of medicine bottles and collapse in fear.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, a Polish applicant fell to his knees, clasped his
hands and began praying loudly. He wet his pants before the INS
guards could coax him into the chair. He turned out to be 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at me as if I was Dr. Mengele,'' Trager said.
</P>
<P>
   The dentist's business _ he hands out fliers advertising his
business as the Smiles High Club _ got a huge boost in April 1997,
when the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility
Act went into effect. Immigration officials began bringing him
about 600 people a year. He declined to reveal how much the agency
pays him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, immigrants were no longer released and told
to appear at hearings. Instead, undocumented immigrants seeking
asylum were detained if their status was in doubt, or immediately
deported.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has not housed minors and adults in the same facility
since the rape several years ago of an underage girl in a detention
center. The INS took 4,607 minors into custody last year.
</P>
<P>
   Trager said he believed that he was the only dentist who did
both the medical and dental exams for the INS. In Miami, a dentist
under contract to the INS examines teeth, and an orthopedist takes
X-rays of the wrist. Trager acknowledged that he was not trained in
orthopedics, but insisted that he had enough medical background to
interpret the X-ray results correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the molars first,'' the dentist said, referring to
the wisdom teeth. ``When all four molars have erupted in a
Caucasian male, this means the patient is between 18 and 21. In
black males the person is between 17 and 21. In females the molars
erupt about six months later.''
</P>
<P>
   When the dental X-rays are inconclusive, he turns to a large
book with a blue cover he calls ``my bible.'' It is a 1959 edition
of the Radiographic Atlas of Skeletal Development of the Hand and
Wrist, by William Walter Greulich and S. Idell Pyle. He keeps a
second volume in the trunk of his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get a call in the middle of the night to do an exam, I
need to bring a copy with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dentist matches the X-rays of the wrists of his patients
with the photos in the book. Female wrist bones are fused at the
age of 17. Male wrist bones fuse at 18. The fused bone, with the
fully erupted wisdom teeth, allow him to determine whether a
patient is under or over 18, he said, to within three months.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when he finished taking the X-rays of Tysuir, Trager
had the film developed and then filled out an INS form. Tysuir, he
wrote, was about 20. One of the INS officers glanced at the form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just as well,'' said the guard. ``He'll get shipped home
quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   As Tysuir departed, he turned to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not over 18, am I?'' he asked. ``I'm 15.''
</P>
<P>
   The dentist was unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he is lying,'' Trager said as the young man was being
taken away to an INS detention center. ``He was putting on an act.
I would say at least 90 percent don't tell the truth. It is part of
the game. This charade is over.''

   BEIJING _ China announced a vast reorganization of domestic
airlines Friday, merging seven carriers into the three largest to
reduce the overlap of routes and half-empty planes that have
plagued the industry for years.
</P>
<P>
   Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines
will absorb the other carriers, giving each of the three surviving
airlines roughly $6 billion in assets, China's state news agency,
Xinhua, reported. It did not give a timetable for the mergers or
indicate which airline would merge with which. Shares of China
Eastern and China Southern are listed in New York and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   China's airline industry has had a turbulent ride since the
country broke the Civil Aviation Administration of China's state
airline monopoly into six regional carriers in the late 1980s and
later allowed provincial governments to start their own airlines.
The idea was to better serve the enormous increase in passengers
that came with relaxed controls on air travel by Chinese citizens
and a subsequent economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion led to a series of crashes that made China the
most dangerous place to fly during the early 1990s. China rectified
that with increased pilot training and a moratorium on aircraft
purchases. But a second wave of expansion left the industry with
far more airline seats than passengers when the growth of air
travel tapered off with the 1997-98 Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   China's airline industry, which includes 34 airlines, lost over
$72 million in 1998 as companies cut ticket prices in a frantic
scramble for passengers. China fixed prices and banned discounts in
1999 to try to stop the bleeding. It delayed delivery of aircraft
that had been ordered. It cut air routes.
</P>
<P>
   It even demanded that all airlines pool 80 percent of their
ticket revenue on specific routes and divide it among the carriers
servicing that route. The industry edged back to profitability last
year, but none of that solved the problem of too many planes and
too few passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The country is loath to allow the market to solve the problem by
letting money-losing airlines go bankrupt, a solution considered
too brutal in China's planned economy.
</P>
<P>
   The seven airlines to be absorbed employ about 73,000 people and
carry heavy debts. It is not clear how much of those burdens the
three surviving airlines will be forced to assume.
</P>
<P>
   The seven airlines are China Southwest, China Northwest, China
Northern, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Great Wall and Zhejiang,
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation would in theory create economies of scale and
give the industry the potential to develop hub-and-spoke networks
similar to those of airlines in the United States. China Southern
is based in the southern city of Guangzhou, China Eastern in the
eastern commercial hub of Shanghai, and Air China in Beijing, in
the north.
</P>
<P>
   And it could prepare the industry for increased competition
after China's entry into the World Trade Organization, expected
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners are expected to be allowed up to 49 percent stakes in
China's airlines, up from the present limit of 35 percent.

   Air raid hits Cowboys camp
</P>
<P>
   By JODY GOLDSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ Unless you're a college or high school coach
looking for pointers, NFL training camps generally aren't much fun
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   They're drill after drill, repetition after repetition, with
little resembling the actual 11-on-11 contact you see in an actual
game.
</P>
<P>
   But Dallas Cowboys camp has been more interesting this year.
With Troy Aikman and Joey Galloway working to get their timing
down, fans have been treated to some spectacular air shows.
</P>
<P>
   Add Rocket Ismail, Jason Tucker, Wane McGarity, James McKnight
and Jeff Ogden, and the Cowboys' speed will be the envy of many a
staff.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cowboys are working hard to take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that new head coach Dave Campo is spending
a bit more time with his offense this summer. It's the focus of
training camp _ a new, more exciting (and hopefully less
predictable) offense to help lead the Cowboys back to glory.
</P>
<P>
   And it's no coincidence Aikman is smiling a bit more these days.
The Cowboys have thrown out Chan Gailey's playbook and brought back
offensive coordinator Jack Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object is to score points, whatever it takes,'' Reilly
said. ``If that means running the ball, fine. But we want to be
aggressive and go after people with both the running game and the
passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly is known as a passing fundamentalist who favors the
crisp, timing routes rather than the short, underneath stuff for
which Gailey was criticized. Time after time on third-and-long,
Cowboys fans were frustrated to see handoffs to Emmitt Smith or
short passes up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys struggled to convert third downs last season and
finished 16th overall in offense. Adding to the frustration, Aikman
lost four receivers _ McKnight (during preseason), Michael Irvin,
McGarity and Ernie Mills _ to injury.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't simply the talent. The game plan had gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I thought we were conservative,'' Campo said of the
old regime. ``We got set in what we could do. Jack is more
unpredictable in his play-calling. There will be times when we're
more of an off-the-seat-of-our-pants operation, which puts pressure
on the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The up-tempo style the Cowboys hope to run during games has
already been implemented in training-camp practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the tempo we're going at right now, we're finishing
practice quite a bit early,'' Campo said. ``Normally, we go a rep a
minute, so in a 10-minute period, we hope to run 10 plays. With
this tempo change, sometimes we run 12, 14, 15 plays. And we're
getting through that and still finishing practice a bit early.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that the Cowboys worked all offseason to begin
implementing the new offense. They worked as a team during
minicamps and quarterback schools, installing the basics before
they got to Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minicamps and quarterback schools really helped us,''
Campo said. ``We really started ahead of the game offensively
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   The new offense, which is actually the old offense with a few
tweaks, will look similar to the one used by the Super Bowl
champion St. Louis Rams last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys won't abandon the ground game. But with the addition
of Galloway, the emphasis thus far clearly has been on the passing
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have a real deep threat now,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of pass-catching tight end Jackie Harris, formerly
of the Tennessee Titans, also adds to the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   How well the Cowboys will do in their first season with the
``old'' offense will hinge on the success or failure of Aikman, who
called last year ``disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be naive in saying that we'll be where we
eventually want to be when training camp is over,'' Aikman said.
``But I certainly believe we'll be where we need to be to at least
be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the Cowboys won't be putting their fans to sleep on
game day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm well aware that offenses bring people into the stands,''
Campo said. ``I understand what offenses mean in this league. I'm
excited about this.''

CHARLES C.I. MERRITT, 91, CANADIAN WAR HERO 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Charles C.I. Merritt, a Canadian army officer who was
taken captive in the Dieppe raid of World War II but emerged as a
heroic figure on a disastrous day for his countrymen, died July 12
in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   He received the Victoria Cross, the highest award for valor in
the British Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:52 in the morning, Aug. 19, 1942, 523 soldiers of the South
Saskatchewan Regiment commanded by Merritt scrambled out of landing
craft in the English Channel and dashed across a pebbled beach on
the western flank of the German-occupied port of Dieppe, France.
They were among 5,000 Canadians, 1,000 British commandos and 50
U.S. Rangers testing assault tactics as a prelude to the D-Day
invasion mounted almost two years later.
</P>
<P>
   The raiders had orders to destroy port facilities, radar
installations and the guns overlooking the beach, then withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the village of Pourville, Merritt's troops came
under heavy fire from German pillboxes on the cliffs, and soon
fallen Canadians were piled two deep along a 100-foot-long bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Merritt saw that a house 100 yards inland would provide cover
for his men. He removed his steel helmet, wrapped it around his
wrist, went to the center of the bridge and shouted: ``Come on
over. They can't hit anything. There's nothing to worry about
here.''
</P>
<P>
   His back was turned to the German defenders in disdain while
shells tore away chunks of concrete on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now let's go get them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He dashed toward the house, leading a small group of soldiers,
four of whom were shot down. He then returned to the bridge and
told the troops who had hung back: ``Hardly anyone got hurt. Now
let's have all of you over this time. Keep your heads down and run
like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   He led the way, 40 soldiers following.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Merritt sprang from the shelter of the house and
sprinted to a pillbox, his men following reluctantly. He blew it up
with grenades and then led his soldiers in destroying additional
pillboxes. But as the morning wore on, the main force of German
defenders could not be dislodged.
</P>
<P>
   Orders came to end the raid at 11 a.m., but hundreds of Canadian
troops were under intense fire on the beach as they waited for
boats to return them to England.
</P>
<P>
   Merritt led a rear-guard action that provided covering fire for
those soldiers and was shot in the shoulder when he dashed onto the
beach to pick up an unconscious corporal.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon, after all the boats had departed, Merritt and
more than 80 soldiers who had covered the retreat with him had to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not in a position to take Paris,'' he remarked long
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 2, 1942, while Merritt was being held at a prisoner of
war camp in Bavaria, Canadian authorities announced that he had
been awarded the Victoria Cross for ``matchless gallantry and
inspiring leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night of June 3, 1943, Merritt and more than 64 other
prisoners escaped from the camp through a 120-foot tunnel, but he
and most of the others were quickly recaptured, and he remained a
prisoner until the war ended.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cecil Ingersoll Merritt, known as Cecil or Cec, was born
in Vancouver on Nov. 10, 1908. A broad-shouldered 6-footer, he
graduated from the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario,
then practiced law until mobilized from the reserves in September
1939.
</P>
<P>
   He left for war with a directive from his wife, Grace: ``Don't
try to win medals, Cec. You just come home.''
</P>
<P>
   When he did come back, he was elected to the Canadian Parliament
from a Vancouver district and served four years in Ottawa. He then
returned to his law practice.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sons, Cecil, of Bellevue, Wash., and
Peter, of Edmonton, Alberta, and a daughter, Elizabeth Merritt, of
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Merritt was one of two Canadians who won the Victoria Cross for
their actions at Dieppe. The Rev. John Foote, chaplain of the Royal
Hamilton Light Infantry, who was also taken prisoner, was honored
for aiding wounded soldiers under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Merritt's death leaves 24 living holders of the Victoria Cross,
established by Queen Victoria in 1856. There is only one surviving
Canadian winner of the medal, Ernest Smith, 86, of Vancouver,
honored for valor in the Italian campaign of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the Canadians who came ashore at Dieppe were
killed, wounded or captured, and few of the raid's objectives were
attained, the troops having received inadequate fire support from
ships and aircraft. But Merritt refused to join in criticism of the
commanders who planned the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very glad to go, we were delighted,'' he said. ``We
were up against a very difficult situation, and we didn't win. But
to hell with this business of saying the generals done us dirt.''

CANADA SEEKS SUPPORT FOR WORLD COURT, ESPECIALLY IN U.S.
</HEADLINE>
  By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ When a majority of the world's nations decided
two years ago to establish a permanent court to try those charged
with the most serious war crimes, political opposition emerged in
both the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Prime Minister Jean Chretien were early
supporters of the permanent tribunal, now taking formal shape as
the International Criminal Court, which is intended to bring trials
on charges of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   But both faced problems in their respective legislatures, where
members had to approve the countries' participation.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, Canada ratified the treaty creating the court and
announced that it was the first nation to have brought its national
laws in line with the new tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, on the other hand, is fighting a last-ditch
battle to prevent Americans from falling under the court's
jurisdiction. Clinton administration officials say America will not
join the court in the foreseeable future because the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, especially its chairman, Senator Jesse Helms,
Republican of North Carolina, has warned that its members will
never approve the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadian and American situations are different. Most
important, Chretien has a majority in the Canadian Parliament,
while President Clinton must deal with a Congress controlled by
Republicans. Although Canada is active in peacekeeping around the
world, the United States, as the world's most powerful nation,
would be a bigger target for frivolous or politically motivated
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview here, Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd
Axworthy, said the Canadian government, unlike the United States,
had decided nevertheless to take no chances with public opinion. It
opened a national debate about the court and began a campaign of
``public diplomacy'' to build support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good debate,'' Axworthy said. ``One party raised a
number of objections to it, about national sovereignty and
individual rights, but it got approved overwhelmingly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view,'' he said of the government's position, ``was that
if you have a functioning national court system, then the
international court is simply a court of last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy said government leaders had made acceptance of the
court a top political priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sponsored a national forum across the country,'' he said.
``Plus we have a major Web site on the issue. Most important _ and
I underline this _ is that we enlisted the support of a number of
key parliamentarians to do our work internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   These members of the Canadian Parliament not only support the
court in their constituencies but also go to international meetings
to build up wide backing in organizations like the
Inter-Parliamentary Union or NATO. Canadian diplomats also promote
the court, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Canada also recently appointed a member of Parliament who is
considered an expert on the international court, Erwin Cotler of
Montreal, as a special envoy for this issue.
</P>
<P>
   For Canada, the campaign is over domestically, and officials can
turn to the questions of how to build more support in the United
States for a court that could be functioning within a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer something that's going away; in fact it's
probably something that's coming quicker than most people would
anticipate,'' Axworthy said. ``It's now taking form, shape and
movement, plus some energy. That in itself should be a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to keep the U.S. engaged,'' said Axworthy, who
meets regularly with a dozen of his counterparts from around the
world to discuss issues of ``human security,'' an area where the
court ranks high, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's continue to work and massage and accommodate,'' he said
of Washington's fears. ``But there has to be flexibility on the
U.S. side. They have to adjust their sights now too and recognize
that they are not going to get an exemption from this court. That's
pretty clear. They've been told that.''
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy said Canada and others would like to see a shift in
American thinking, but he added that they were aware that the
American public was not behind this issue. ``It is so important, so
crucial that the debate here shift its focus from how you thwart
it, frustrate it or stop it to how do we make sure that your
interests are looked after and that you can support probably what
will be the most significant new institution of this century.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ When Maryam Barati first left her home in Isfahan
three years ago to attend college in the capital, she prayed
silently as each of the 200 miles rolled by.
</P>
<P>
   She prayed that her father, who was at the wheel, would not
suddenly turn the car around and say that she, like all the women
in her family for uncounted generations, could leave the family
nest only to get married.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very reluctant to let me go away to a different city to
study,'' recalled Barati, a 23-year-old physical education
teacher-in-training at Alzahra University in central Tehran. ``But
he finally decided it was all right, and he realized that this has
been an incredible experience for me. Here we have to learn how to
live on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Her adventure in independence is being repeated all over Iran,
where young women now make up nearly 60 percent of university
entrants although women represent barely half the school-age
population.
</P>
<P>
   In a quiet revolution in political and social relations, they
are leaving home as single women in historically high numbers,
forsaking their conservative villages and small towns to seek
higher education wherever they can get it.
</P>
<P>
   Their self-assured mobility _ an independence of action that
their mothers and grandmothers could not even imagine _ represents
a grand social experiment whose impact is making itself felt on
campus and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phenomenon will change the country in ways we cannot even
predict as they enter the labor market and the professions,'' said
Elaheh Koulai, an administrative dean at Tehran University and a
reformist member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that old taboos against higher education for women
have collapsed is that Iranian universities, under the overall
control of Muslim religious leaders, offer worried parents strict
controls over their daughters' lives on campus. Often, the
prohibitions are far more severe than they would have faced at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Their dress, their visitors, even their music and reading
materials are closely monitored. Still, the women say, they are
relishing a fresh sense of freedom even as they realize that their
newfound access to education does not guarantee them jobs
commensurate with their skills.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the educational development of women has been
building for decades, as overall literacy rates have climbed and
the poor and middle-class gained access to education that was the
near-exclusive preserve of the urban rich before the Islamic
revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The women _ and men _ now clamoring for university spaces are
the children of that revolution, born in a baby boom that began in
the early 1980s and slowed only in the last few years. From 1976 to
1986, the national population grew from 33.7 million to 49.4
million. Today it is estimated at 61 million, with 40 percent of
the people under 15.
</P>
<P>
   The desire of women for university slots skyrocketed. From 1990
to 2000, the number of women entering universities tripled as baby
boomers came of age. In some disciplines, like medicine and social
sciences, women now far outnumber men.
</P>
<P>
   And while they have not yet broken into the labor force in
comparable numbers, they have made their expectations and demands a
factor in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The landslide election in 1997 of President Mohammad Khatami, a
moderate cleric who pledged wider social freedoms, is widely
attributed to his popularity among young people and especially
among young women. The failure of conservatives to retain their
hold on Parliament after elections earlier this year is also widely
attributed to a backlash from young women against their support for
hardline social restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the conservatives as a whole have begun to
really understand what the impact will be of having so many
educated young women graduating from our universities,'' said
Mohammad Javad Larijani, a veteran hard-line parliamentarian who
lost his seat in the reformist wave, in an interview after the
elections. ``These women are going to demand that society give
value to their skills and their degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Women have long been underrepresented in politics and the
professions in Iran. They make up just 14 percent of the labor
force, according to a recent United Nations report on human
development in Iran. When they do find jobs, it is in government,
where they hold 23 percent of the public sector posts, and in
farming. They are overrepresented in comparison to men _ by a
factor of 2 to 1 _ only in the unemployment rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many trained and skilled women and girls must stay at home
because of social and traditional obstacles from their families,''
said Dr. Koulai. ``Many men in our society don't want their wives
working outside the home. But this is going to change. The process
is unstoppable.''
</P>
<P>
   Those obstacles have not deterred many families from breaking
tradition and pushing their daughters to get a university degree at
any cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our daughters don't study, they won't have anything in
life,'' said Ashraf Juyandeh, a 49-year-old cafeteria worker in the
city of Shiraz who is trying to get her two daughters into the
local university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself only finished sixth grade,'' she added. ``Back then,
the rich could afford to send their daughters to school, but
traditional families considered it a bad thing. My mother was never
allowed to go to university and my father could never have afforded
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Juyandeh was married at 14 and widowed at 39. She says she will
get as many jobs as she can to earn enough money to send both her
daughters to university _ anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where religious traditions and the conservative
clergy still dictate a subservient role for women in many families,
the movement of young women out of their hometowns in search of
education and work has already brought about changes in attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience I am having _ and other girls are having _ is
going to affect this country in many ways,'' said Raziyeh Bigonah,
23, an arts student at Alzahra University. ``People who leave their
homes to go to a bigger city experience different things. I'm sure
my generation of women will make itself felt in society.''
</P>
<P>
   She came to Tehran from Tabriz, about 330 miles away, leaving
behind four older housebound sisters who had no desire and no
encouragement from their parents to go to university. ``I try to
keep up my relations with my sisters,'' Bigonah said. ``But now, I
prefer to live here for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Iranian authorities have tried at different times in recent
years to control the impact of the demand by the new generation of
school-age women for higher education. For nine years, from 1989
until 1997, they limited the number of university slots for women
in order to provide space for male veterans of the war with Iraq.
They have been slow, as well, to build new dormitories at big
campuses where out-of-town women are required to live, sometimes by
their families and sometimes by the university itself.
</P>
<P>
   To control the activities of women on campus, for example, the
universities enforce strict rules at dormitories. Young women are
required to wear the traditional black chador _ the all-enveloping
cloak _ over long coats and tightly pinned headscarves, not only
outside the dorm but inside as well. There are curfews, bans on
visitors and music, and constant supervision of reading material
brought into the dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the regulations, which often are more severe than
what students faced at home, many women say they have learned an
independent way of thinking that can not be unlearned. ``I'm sure
it will effect our choices in marriage,'' said Barati, the Alzahra
student who once feared that her father would not even let her
begin studies. ``I'm educated now, and, young people like me, we
all have more expectations from life these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking just about economics,'' she continued.
``Actually our parents' economic situation was probably better. But
because my future husband and I will both be people who separated
from our parents to go to university and faced the problems of
being independent, we will understand each other better than our
parents probably did when they married.''

   One last hurrah for Golden Bear
</P>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ The drive was long and straight, finding
almost dead center of the 18th fairway and landing just across the
path known as Grannie Clark's Wynd.
</P>
<P>
   His second shot was reminiscent of one of those smart bombs from
the Gulf War, falling from on high and seemingly with eyes over the
Valley of Sin, bouncing once, twice and rolling to a stop about
five feet from the hole.
</P>
<P>
   So Jack Nicklaus, the once-Golden Bear now looking more like the
warm, muted glow of a setting sun, made the final walk to the most
storied green in the game with the deserved thunder from golf's
most discriminating fans ringing in his ears one more time.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered from the grandstands and from the balconies of
Rusacks Hotel. They yelled from the rooftops of houses that line
the right side of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a poignant scene to see playing partner Angel
Cabrera bow in deference to usher the great ex-champion over the
Swilken Bridge first and to see Nicklaus call for son Steve, his
caddie, to join him on the bridge for one last round of
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   But then Nicklaus stood over that five-footer for birdie and
missed the putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been that way all year,'' he said later with a frustrated
shake of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Which, in case we forgot, reminds us of everything that made him
Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   In this age when the precocious Tiger Woods is trying to prove
he is the greatest young golfer in history, it is wise to remember
that Nicklaus is still, quite simply, the greatest golfer in
history.
</P>
<P>
   But now, on another brilliant day along the North Sea coast,
this was likely his final turn at the British Open. A 73 placed him
at 6 over par, and just as last month at the U.S. Open at Pebble
Beach, it meant he missed the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's a mixed emotion,'' Nicklaus said. ``The walking
over the Swilken Bridge and up the 18th hole is very nice, but not
on Friday afternoon. The reception was terrific. . . . I just
wasn't playing enough golf to make anything happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 60 now, with an artificial hip and two bad feet that may
require surgery. But he will never be a so-called ``walking
trophy,'' a tribute to the past like Arnold Palmer or the
88-year-old Sam Snead.
</P>
<P>
   With Nicklaus, the competition has always been the thing.
Through all those years on the storied old courses around Great
Britain, Jack was always about contending. Especially at this
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember growing up and talking with Bobby Jones,'' Nicklaus
said. ``He told me, `All great golfers have to win at St. Andrews.
The record is not complete until you do.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Nicklaus won on the grounds of the Royal &AMP; Ancient in 1970
and 1978 and also at Muirfield in 1966. But the amazing part of his
record in Britain is that he finished second seven times and third
on three occasions.
</P>
<P>
   They have already invited him back to play in the Open in 2005
at St. Andrews, and he shrugs at the possibility. But the steely
eyes tell you not to count on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, when people asked me how long I'm going to play, I
always said, `As long as I enjoy it and can be competitive,'''
Nicklaus said. ``I think the two of them go hand in hand. As I
become less competitive, a lot of the enjoyment goes out of it for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He had given himself and us a jolt of excitement at this year's
Masters by shooting even par and showing up on the leader board at
the midway point. And he did it while resenting his placing in an
old-timers group with Palmer and Gary Player. While they joked and
chatted around Augusta National, the Golden Bear was on the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Nicklaus gave himself a chance to stay around for the
weekend with three birdies on the front side. But his putter failed
him all day, and when he drove into the Beardies bunker on No. 14,
his chances dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The die was cast,'' he said. ``What are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus will play the PGA Championship next month, but he isn't
sure what he'll do after that. More surgery? Or does he sit back
and watch Tiger try the assault on all of his records?
</P>
<P>
   Twelve minutes after the golfer of the 20th century waved his
cap and blew kisses to the Scottish crowd, the man who has grabbed
the new millennium by the throat teed off at No. 1 en route to 11
under par and the halfway lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound silly, but I'm kind of rooting for Tiger or
somebody to come along and break the records or whatever,''
Nicklaus said. ``It would be good for the game of golf. It needs a
shot in the arm constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees his own competitive drive in Tiger. What he'd like to
see is more players come along to challenge Tiger, to push him.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that you can learn everything about a man on a golf
course. With Jack Nicklaus, the lesson is that even in the light of
a fading sun, the glory, the dignity is always in competing.

CHENEY EMERGES AS TOP CANDIDATE FOR BUSH'S RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary who is
heading Gov. George W. Bush's search for a vice presidential
nominee, has emerged as a leading contender for the job, changing
his voter registration Friday to make his selection possible,
Republicans close to the governor said Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not expected to announce his final decision for several
days, and one Republican cautioned that he still planned to do some
thinking over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans close to Bush said that Cheney, whose wealth of
government experience includes a stint as White House chief of
staff under President Ford and a long career as a congressman from
Wyoming, had become a top choice of the governor's in recent days.
They said that his change of registration from Texas to Wyoming was
needed to pave the way for his likely, though still not assured,
selection.
</P>
<P>
   The registration switch, which Cheney carried out Friday, so he
could vote in Wyoming, was designed to avoid problems under the
12th Amendment to the Constitution. That provision forbids
Electoral College voters to choose candidates from their state as
both president and vice president.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican close to Bush said the former defense secretary
was now the leading candidate, though he cautioned that Bush still
had not come to a final decision. Another Republican familiar with
the governor's thinking said Cheney was among the few finalists.
Yet another Republican, who is close to the former defense
secretary, said, ``Bush really, really, really likes Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign did not offer confirmation, but did nothing to
dampen the speculation about Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told
reporters at his Texas ranch Friday that he was going to think
``long and hard'' at the ranch this weekend and review the options
that had been carefully prepared by Cheney himself. By the end of
the weekend, Bush said, ``I'll be a lot closer to the decision.''
He said, ``The days of speculation are over.''
</P>
<P>
   His aides said the announcement would come next week, possibly
as early as Monday, a week before the opening of the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Other names that have figured prominently in the speculation
include Govs. Frank Keating of Oklahoma and George Pataki of New
York; Rep. John Kasich of Ohio; and Sens. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska,
John McCain of Arizona, and Bill Frist and Fred Thompson, both of
Tennessee. Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania was also under
consideration, but his stance in favor of abortion rights had
caused his star to dim in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush announced this spring that Cheney, who was his
father's defense secretary, would lead his search, he praised
Cheney, an executive at the Dallas-based Halliburton Co., and said
that his role would not preclude him from being considered for the
No. 2 job himself. ``I trust Dick Cheney's judgment; I know his
character,'' Bush said. ``It's obviously an important decision for
me and I can't think of a better person to work with on making that
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans said Cheney, 59, had repeatedly insisted
he did not want the job. In recent weeks, however, as Keating had
looked as if he was emerging as Bush's favorite, prominent
Republicans began lobbying Bush for Cheney. And several Republican
Party officials pressed Cheney to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   He initially fretted about his health, they said _ he has
suffered three mild heart attacks and has had bypass surgery _ but
did not say no. And he slowly warmed to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge movement for this,'' one Republican said,
``and it started several weeks ago. This did not come out of the
blue.'' A Republican familiar with the conversations said Bush's
father has also been an active advocate for Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Though his health could become an issue, one Republican familiar
with the past few days' events said the Bush campaign had checked
on Cheney's medical records and health with the doctor who
performed the heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 House Republicans petitioned Bush Friday on McCain's
behalf, and Ridge, Republicans said, implored McCain to reconsider
in a telephone conversation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An associate of McCain's said the senator told Ridge that he
would prefer not to be asked but would accept the vice presidency
if offered it by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, said Friday, ``I don't believe anything has
changed'' since he told Bush in May that he did not want to be
considered for the ticket. And Bush gave no indication he would be
influenced by the pressure from House Republicans. He said simply
that he was sure that McCain would be a ``loyal soldier for my
candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Like McCain, Cheney would bring a wealth of experience in
national security to the ticket. He was a strategist of the Persian
Gulf war as defense secretary under Bush's father. He has good
relation with Republicans in Congress, where he was a party whip,
and he has served in the White House, as chief of staff to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike McCain, he has no further political ambitions of his
own, Republicans said, and would be devoted solely to the Bush
presidency.

METS AND REDS COMPLETE DEAL BUT AWAIT LARKIN'S APPROVAL
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The New York Mets and the Cincinnati Reds have agreed
on a deal to send Barry Larkin, an 11-time All-Star shortstop, to
New York. Larkin must now decide if he will accept a trade from the
only team he has known.
</P>
<P>
   After Larkin told Cincinnati reporters Friday that he had been
approached by Reds general manager Jim Bowden about accepting a
deal to the Mets, the Mets' general manager, Steve Phillips,
acknowledged that he had made the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips refused to say which players he had given up, but the
Mets' top prospect, the 21-year-old outfielder Alex Escobar, was in
the lineup for Double-A Binghamton Friday night. Other top
prospects, including pitcher Grant Roberts, outfielder Jason Tyner
and infielder Jorge Toca, all played Friday night for Triple-A
Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Saturday afternoon, the Mets will have 72 hours in
which to convince Larkin to join them. Phillips plans to speak with
Larkin's agent, Eric Goldschmidt, and with Larkin, and said he was
prepared to fly to Cincinnati if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Larkin said he was not a hired gun, and after
speaking with Larkin by telephone this week, Mets infielder Lenny
Harris, a close friend of Larkin's, came away believing that Larkin
would insist on a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't feel he's in that renting situation,'' Harris said
on Wednesday. ``I know he doesn't want to come here or anywhere
else to visit for two months. He'd want to stay for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be a problem for the Mets, who owe Rey Ordonez $16
million over the next three years and appear poised to make a pitch
for the free-agent shortstop Alex Rodriguez of the Seattle Mariners
during the off-season. Ordonez is out for the season with a broken
left forearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a shortstop for the future, so it means you're
looking for somebody to get you through this year,'' Phillips said
before Friday night's game against the Atlanta Braves. After he
announced the trade during the first inning, Phillips said that
Ordonez's contract would be a ``complicating factor,'' and that
this move ``doesn't affect any long-term decisions at all, right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin, 36, who has been with the Reds since making his debut in
1986, had asked Cincinnati for a three-year contract extension
worth around $28 million. The Reds balked, and after Larkin met on
Tuesday with John Allen, the Reds' chief operating officer, he said
he felt the Reds had no intention of bringing him back.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Reds agreed on a deal Thursday afternoon, prompting
Bowden to make an unscheduled flight to Houston, where the Reds
were playing the Astros. Bowden met with Larkin for eight minutes,
and Larkin left the meeting when Bowden would not reveal the
players the Mets would send the Reds in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting was cool until then,'' Larkin said. ``I won't even
tell you the response I got. That's when I left.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he has at least 10 years in the majors and the last five
with the same team, Larkin must approve any deal. There may still
be hope that he will stay in Cincinnati, where he said he wanted to
finish his career. Reds center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. _ who
himself declined a potential deal to the Mets last winter, when he
was with Seattle _ has offered to defer salary to help the Reds
sign Larkin, who can be a free agent after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior is not trying to tell anybody what they're worth or
what they should sign for,'' said Griffey's agent, Brian Goldberg.
``All he's saying and offering is, should the two sides want to
make a deal, compromise some and there is still some gap to be
bridged, he'll help bridge the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldschmidt did not return several calls seeking comment,
although he said on Thursday that Larkin would not necessarily
insist on a contract extension before accepting a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to evaluate any situation that's put in front of
him and make a decision on his future based on all the
circumstances,'' Goldschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets, Larkin would be a substantial improvement over
Melvin Mora, who has filled in adequately but began the second half
of the season with a 3-for-26 slump. Some in the organization
believe Mora, who is in his first full season, is better suited as
a role player than a starter. As starting shortstops go, Larkin is
considered the best in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melvin has done an admirable job for us at shortstop,''
Phillips said. ``But Barry Larkin was the National League's
starting All-Star shortstop and he'd fit what we are trying to add,
which is a significant improvement over what we have.''

BUSH RETREATS TO RANCH 
TO MAKE V-P DECISION 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRAWFORD, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush plans to spend this
weekend on the rolling blackland prairie of his ranch, deciding who
should be his running mate on the Republican presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of speculation are over,'' Bush told reporters while
standing in the shade of a pair of native pecan trees at his ranch
house Friday. ``I'm going to make up my mind over the weekend. You
don't need to stake out the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, indicating that his final decision was all but made, said
he will receive no visitors at the ranch this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's best efforts to end speculation, it abounded as
the week ended, with the focus on his former GOP rival, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, and the head of Bush's vice-presidential
selection process, former Secretary of Defense Richard B. Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney set off speculation after it was learned Friday that he
has changed his voter registration from Texas to Wyoming, where he
had been a congressman. The Associated Press quoted anonymous
Republican officials as saying Cheney had emerged as a top
contender for the Bush presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's registration switch could be designed to avoid conflict
with language in the 12th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which
forbids Electoral College voters from voting for vice-presidential
and presidential candidates who both are ``inhabitants'' of their
state.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Cheney's health raises questions about the likelihood of his
selection, though. Cheney, 59, has suffered three heart attacks and
has had quadruple coronary bypass surgery. An unhealthy heart is a
downside for a man who would be a heartbeat away from the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has a lengthy political resume, serving as White House
chief of staff under President Ford; Wyoming congressman and
eventually House Republican whip; and secretary of defense under
President Bush. Since 1995, he has been chairman and CEO of
Dallas-based Halliburton Corp., a leading engineering and
construction company for the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   McCain earlier this year said he did not want to be considered
as Bush's running mate, and their bitter battle for the GOP
nomination made it seem unlikely that Bush would pick McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday word broke that Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge,
another of Bush's potential running mates, had called McCain to see
if he would be interested in running. McCain reportedly told Ridge
he did not want the job but would accept if asked.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain drumbeat also gained volume as House Republicans
circulated a letter urging Bush to pick McCain, saying his appeal
to independent voters could help Republicans retain control of the
House.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told CNN he does not expect to be picked. ``It's
hypothetical because I don't believe I'm in the process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aide John Weaver told the Houston Chronicle that McCain
does not want the job.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, a Texan who is a political consultant to McCain, said
Friday that the Arizona senator still doesn't want to be vice
president and hopes that Bush won't offer the job to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (McCain) doesn't want to be asked. His position hasn't
changed,'' Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said McCain hopes that Bush won't call because ``if
you're asked, you have to do it ... He (McCain) is not going to be
disloyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said McCain and Bush hadn't talked. ``It's the silly
season,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused to answer direct questions about whether he still
would consider McCain as a vice-presidential pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's a good man and he's a good friend of mine,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you this about John McCain. During the course of
this campaign he'll be a loyal soldier for my candidacy. He is a
man of duty. He loves his country.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what rank McCain would have in the Bush army, the
governor just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Ridge called McCain led to speculation that Ridge
considered himself to be out of the running.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge had been a popular potential choice because he is a
moderate Republican, a longtime friend of Bush's and the governor
of a key swing state. But social conservative leaders have opposed
Ridge because he supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Another governor high on Bush's list is Frank Keating of
Oklahoma. Keating is a Roman Catholic who opposes abortion, and he
is a former FBI agent. Keating also got high marks for how he
handled the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But Keating serves as little more than a safe choice because
Bush already is virtually sure to win Oklahoma. Keating on Thursday
said he does not expect the call asking him to join the ticket:
``I'm not holding my breath.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign on Friday touted a conference call with U.S.
Rep. John Kasich of Ohio to defend Bush's state budget against
attacks from Democratic candidate Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich declined to comment on the vice-presidential speculation,
other than to point out he had provided biographical information to
the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the letter promoting McCain that some Republican
congressmen were circulating, Kasich replied: ``I haven't signed
any letter or done anything. I really didn't know there was any
letter circulating.''
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent names considered to be on Bush's short list
include Sens. Fred Thompson and Bill Frist of Tennessee, George
Voinovich of Ohio and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, and New York Gov.
George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he and his wife will travel to Georgia on Saturday for
the funeral of U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdale, a Republican. Then he will
return to to the 1,600-acre Crawford ranch to finalize his
vice-presidential decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like big decisions,'' Bush said, noting the first person he
will tell would be his wife. He said he would notify his father _
former President Bush _ ``somewhere between Laura and the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will first call the person he has selected and then
call those who were not chosen.
</P>
<P>
   While there was much speculation about Bush making an
announcement on Monday, Bush indicated that he already has that day
planned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to come back to Austin on Monday afternoon,'' Bush
said. ``I've got a TV interview here on the place, I've got another
TV interview in Austin Monday afternoon.''

 UNDATED: new procedures. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``EPA does have methods for determining what is asbestos
content, which have been peer reviewed and scientifically accepted
for years and years,'' Corcoran said, ``so we are trying to get
some understanding of why, if those methods are good enough for
every other situation, why are they not good enough for this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Yang, who while working as a scientist for Grace designed
the company's asbestos laboratory techniques, said in a recent
interview that she had developed her own method of measuring
asbestos fibers. She said she thus avoided counting things that
looked like fibers but were not, like the edges of platelets. As a
consequence, she said she came up with results that were typically
50 percent less than the methods suggested by regulatory
authorities would have produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used a modified technique,'' Yang said.
</P>
<P>
   Because she was convinced the ore had minimal amounts of
asbestos, Yang said she rarely checked the levels in Grace's
products, maybe once or twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   The 1982 EPA study was triggered by an earlier outbreak of
health problems among workers at a Marysville, Ohio, plant where
vermiculite from Grace's Montana mine was used in making
fertilizer. A federal inquiry in 1978 found that four workers
suffered from bloody lungs. X-rays showed that one in four workers
had lung abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   In late October 1980, Thomas Dixon, an EPA analyst who then
worked in the toxicology branch, went to Montana to gather samples
of Grace's vermiculite ore. With an early winter storm threatening,
Dixon recalled that he and the agency's consultants rushed over the
next five days to collect dozens of scrapings from the mine and an
adjoining cleaning plant, which were then shipped to a laboratory
for testing.
</P>
<P>
   They found between 21 percent and 26 percent asbestos in the raw
ore, and up to 7 percent in the cleaned form that was shipped to
plants for further processing. The five grades of cleaned ore they
tested ranged for the most part between 2 percent and 7 percent,
with only one category falling below the EPA's regulatory threshold
of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Grace has maintained over the years that far less
amounts of the cancer-causing substance contaminated its ore. For
instance, in a 1986 letter to the EPA in which Grace argued for an
exemption from proposed rules to label products that have asbestos,
the company said its Montana ore was sullied by only 4 percent to 6
percent asbestos coming out of the mine, and less than 0.5 percent
on average when cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   EPA staff became anxious for their own safety. A Grace official
described in a memorandum how he received a call on May 20, 1982,
from a Denver EPA employee who ``had just heard that vermiculite
may be contaminated with asbestos. The EPA uses vermiculite to pack
samples for shipments to laboratories for analysis. I spoke to him
for a few minutes because he was so upset and I did not want to
transfer him without calming him down. They dump half a bag of
vermiculite into a shipping carton two or three times a day. I told
him that the exposures would undoubtedly be low if good ventilation
was provided and that the respirator he indicated they were using
would provide additional protection.''
</P>
<P>
   But the EPA never carried out its plans to follow up on its mine
study by examining the Grace material at its processing plants. Nor
did it test the consumer products made with the ore as planned,
agency officials said. Agency staff say they moved on to pressing
health matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priority dropped and we were off on other things, like
looking at dioxin for the first time,'' said Martin Halper, a
former toxicology division chief.
</P>
<P>
   The report surfaced briefly in 1983 when the late Peter Rodino
and another member of Congress forwarded to EPA a letter from a
Grace competitor in the fireproofing business who asked: ``Why did
EPA embark on such an extensive project collecting, analyzing and
characterizing vermiculite samples for asbestos contamination and
then suddenly choose both to simply drop its intended second, and
more critical, phase of the project.''
</P>
<P>
   The response came from an acting assistant administrator for
pesticides and toxic substances, who, according to Peronard,
wrongly cited a table of data in the study as indicating the
asbestos fell below 1 percent. ``He mixed it up,'' Peronard said.

INQUIRY ON SENATOR'S AIDES SAID TO BE RENEWED

<TEXT>
<P>
   As Sen. Robert Torricelli prepares to seek the Democratic
nomination for governor of New Jersey, federal prosecutors are
intensifying their inquiry into the role that his office may have
played in a series of illegal contributions to his 1996 Senate
campaign, lawyers and others familiar with the case say.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Torricelli said he believed
prosecutors had effectively wrapped up their investigation last
month, when a Korean-American businessman who was a major donor to
Torricelli and other Democrats pleaded guilty to campaign-finance
violations.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers familiar with the federal inquiry say it has gained
new momentum with the decision of the businessman, David Chang, to
cooperate with the authorities in return for the promise of a
lighter sentence.
</P>
<P>
   They say prosecutors working for the Justice Department's
campaign-finance task force are focusing more closely on the
possible role of Torricelli staff members in directing and
accounting for the improper contributions of Chang and others.
</P>
<P>
   While Torricelli suggested that his staff members had not been
singled out by the prosecutors and were cooperating fully, lawyers
and others with knowledge of the case said one of Torricelli's
longtime aides had refused to answer at least some questions,
citing her constitutional right against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer said that the aide, Roberta Stern, was involved in
arranging one or more fund-raising events at the Hilton hotel in
Fort Lee, N.J., that was formerly owned in part by Chang. Two
lawyers said prosecutors were scrutinizing how the campaign used
the hotel and whether it was properly reported as an in-kind
contribution to the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not characterize the strength of the evidence
provided by Chang, whose credibility has sometimes been an issue in
his business dealings as well as his legal troubles. Nor is it
clear that any laws were broken by aides to Torricelli, who, as
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, is one of
the party's most important fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Torricelli said several aides, including James
P. Fox, his chief of staff, and Adam C. Crain, his executive
assistant, submitted to questioning by prosecutors and FBI agents
as the government was preparing to go to trial against Chang.
``Each cooperated fully, and provided valuable information, and
each was prepared to testify on behalf of the government at the
trial of David Chang,'' said Abbe D. Lowell, the lawyer who
represents both Torricelli and the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell would not discuss whether Stern had asserted her Fifth
Amendment right and declined to answer questions of the task force.
But he said, ``I do know that she was one of the people ready to
testify as a government witness at the Chang trial.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lowell has fought to limit the scope of the federal inquiry,
lawyers said. They said he had repeatedly called senior Justice
Department officials, including Eric Holder, the deputy attorney
general, to complain about the actions of the prosecutors on the
campaign-finance task force.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he believed the task force was focusing on his own
fund-raising activities, Torricelli said, ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's about three incidents where people unfortunately
reimbursed contributors,'' he said, referring to cases in which six
donors to his 1996 campaign pleaded guilty to illegally funneling
contributions through others. ``As far as I know, those three
incidents have now been discovered and fully explored. As far as I
know, that has run its course.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first episode came to light last year, when a former Bergen
County Republican leader, Berek P. Don, and a former law partner,
Carmine Alampi, pleaded guilty to illegally reimbursing employees
in his office with Chang's money for $11,000 that they gave to
Torricelli's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Another major Torricelli supporter, Lawrence Penna, a
Hackensack, N.J., stockbroker, also pleaded guilty last year to
making $20,000 in illegal contributions to the Torricelli campaign
and $12,000 in illegal contributions to President Clinton's
re-election effort. (Separately, Penna also pleaded guilty to
illegally manipulating the stock price of a pharmaceutical company,
defrauding investors of millions of dollars in a deal in which
Torricelli's blind trust made a one-day profit of $50,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Chang, a shadowy New Jersey businessman who befriended
Torricelli and later sought his help in at least two failed
business schemes, was accused of crimes including perjury,
obstruction of justice, and funneling almost $54,000 in illegal
contributions to the senator's campaign. He pleaded guilty on June
2 to five misdemeanor campaign-law violations and an unrelated
conspiracy charge.
</P>
<P>
   One of Chang's former employees, Audrey Yu, and a Korean-born
businessmen, Cha-kuek Koo, pleaded guilty to helping Chang hide his
contributions in the names of other people.
</P>
<P>
   But contrary to the assertions of Torricelli and Lowell, his
lawyer, the interest of federal prosecutors did not end with the
donors to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said one of the areas which the prosecutors are
continuing to investigate is how Torricelli's staff accounted for
an in-kind contribution of $1,700 for the campaign's use of a plane
that was paid for by one of Chang's companies, Bright &AMP; Bright
Corp. The company was ultimately reimbursed for the flights, but
the expense appears to have been charged after the campaign ended,
two lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors are also looking closely at how the campaign
accounted for the use of the Fort Lee Hilton for one or more
fund-raising events. Chang, who was a co-owner of the hotel, has
since transferred his interest to his former wife, Angeline Cho.
</P>
<P>
   Chang has provided extensive information to the authorities
about these and other transactions, they said. Chang's Washington
lawyer, David Schertler, said he would not discuss what information
his client had provided as part of his plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, as the focus of the investigation began to
shift from Chang and his associates to the possible role of the
campaign staff in the illegal contributions, the Justice
Department's task force added a third prosecutor to the inquiry
into Torricelli's fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But far from acknowledging concerns about his political future,
Torricelli insisted that in a campaign that had some 20,000 donors,
the illegal contributions that had been uncovered were isolated
problems that could scarcely be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem,'' he said, ``and it's embarrassing, but you
know, it happened.''

INVESTIGATION CLEARS FEDS 
IN WACO TRAGEDY 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ An investigation led by special counsel John
Danforth into the 1993 Waco tragedy cleared the government of any
wrongdoing and laid full blame for the fire at the Branch Davidian
compound on cult leader David Koresh and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   In a 156-page preliminary report released Friday, the
investigation concluded that government agents, at the end of a
51-day siege on the Davidian compound on April 19, 1993, did not
shoot at Davidians or start the fire that killed about 80 people at
the Mt. Carmel compound near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-month investigation also cleared the government of
charges it improperly used the military at the scene and that it
conspired to cover up its handling of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report admonished government lawyers and an FBI
agent for concealing information about the use of pyrotechnic
tear-gas rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The concealment, the report stated, raised ``darker questions''
about the government's response after it came under scrutiny for
its handling of the incident. It also resulted in the tragedy being
shrouded by a pervasive sense of distrust among the American
public, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it possible that, last August, 61 percent of the people
of this country believed the government started the fire when there
is no evidence to support that, really none, when the evidence is
so overwhelming on the other side. How could that be?'' Danforth
said at a news conference in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, who left the Senate in 1995 to practice law in St.
Louis, was appointed last September by Attorney General Janet Reno,
who yielded to calls for an independent inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Led by congressional Republicans, the demands for appointment of
a special counsel escalated dramatically after the government
acknowledged, following years of denials, that it used pyrotechnic
tear-gas canisters during the final assault.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said Friday the investigation showed that the
pyrotechnic projectiles were fired, four hours before the blaze, at
a concrete construction site filled with water &UR; . &LR;  He said the tear
gas rounds were fired in an attempt to keep Davidians from seeking
refuge in a buried school bus that was used as a bunker. It was
linked to the compound through an underground tunnel that ran to
the construction site about 75 feet way.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us should be more skeptical of those who make
sensational accusations of evil acts by government,'' Danforth
wrote in the report.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that although the government ''did nothing evil ...
the failure of some of its employees to fully and openly disclose
to the American people the use of pyrotechnic devices undermined
public confidence in government and caused real damage to our
country.``
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, Reno's top assistant, said
Danforth's report ``sheds further light on the truth and discredits
many of the unsubstantiated allegations that have skewed the
public's perception of the events of April 19, 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh also welcomed Danforth's report and
lauded the former senator's inquiry as ``both vigorous and
thorough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple truth, as the FBI has maintained since April 19,
1993, has been unmistakingly confirmed again today _ the FBI fired
no shots on that day and the Davidians started the fire that
ultimately engulfed the compound,'' Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Houston attorney James Brannon, who is representing the
estates of the three children Davidian leader David Koresh had with
his wife, Rachel Jones, was critical of the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see the results of a lie detector test of all the FBI
agents that testified to his (Danforth's) committee, then I will
begin to believe anything the FBI says. Until then, he is relying
on known, admitted perjurers. ... I personally will never believe
anything the FBI says for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet unresolved, Danforth said, were:
</P>
<P>
   _ What happened to the shells and pyrotechnic projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   _Why the FBI denied for six years the existence of tapes of
audio transmissions of the FBI commander authorizing the use of
pyrotechnic rounds.
</P>
<P>
   _Why Justice attorneys who prosecuted the Davidians did not
disclose the use of the rounds to defense attorneys and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   _Why the FBI provided incorrect information about the use of
pyrotechnic projectiles to the Justice Department during the 1995
congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statements were made that were just plain wrong about the
non-use of pyrotechnics, and the remaining four questions of the
investigations all pertain to the question of why were those
statements made that were just plain wrong,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   He said those issues will take another 3{ months to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, a five-member jury in a civil trial in Waco decided
that the government was not responsible. The ruling came in a $675
million wrongful-death suit brought by surviving cult members and
the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey Clark, who represented several survivors and relatives at
the trial, said the Danforth investigation ``failed to address the
obvious,'' the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their conduct was so right,'' Ramsey asked, ``how did it
end so very wrong, with so many deaths?''
</P>
<P>
   Though Danforth has prosecutorial powers as special counsel, he
said he will not pursue charges based on his preliminary findings.
But he did not rule out the possibility of pursuing charges after
the remaining questions are answered and the investigation is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The siege began when about 100 Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
agents stormed the compound on Feb. 28, 1993, after learning that
the Davidians were receiving large shipments of firearms, inert
grenades and black powder. A gunfight broke out, leaving four ATF
agents and six Davidians dead.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff ended April 19, 1993, when tanks driven by FBI
agents pumped tear gas into the compound. A fire broke out and
nearly all of the Davidians, including Koresh and 18 children, died
_ some from the fire, some from gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation revealed that on the morning of April 19,
Davidians spread combustible liquids through the compound and
started fires at three locations and that many of the Davidians had
no intention of escaping the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving Davidians said in interviews that they saw others
making no effort to leave the burning structure and that one member
expressed remorse because she did not die in the fire. They
recalled Koresh teaching that fire was an acceptable means of death
for Davidians and they would ascend to heaven in a great fire.
</P>
<P>
   Concealed listening devices inside the complex indicated the
Davidians started the fire and that they discussed how they could
prevent fire trucks from reaching the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Experts determined that fires were started on the second floor
of the southeast corner of the compound, the stage area at the rear
of the chapel and the kitchen-cafeteria area.
</P>
<P>
   The report also stated that autopsy reports and anthropological
work showed that Davidians who died of gunshot wounds on April 19
were killed by other Davidians, and that at least 20 members were
shot and stabbed. Five of the victims were children under 14. Also,
many of those who died of gunshot wounds had been shot in the mouth
or head.

CLINTON ASKS PUTIN'S INPUT

 SUMMIT-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  ON N. KOREAN MISSILE DEAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By DAVID IVANOVICH &QL; 
c2000 Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OKINAWA, Japan _ President Clinton on Friday sounded out Russian
President Vladimir Putin about a possible deal with North Korea
aimed at persuading the nation to abandon its missile program.
</P>
<P>
   Putin arrived in Okinawa flush from a visit to Pyongyang, where
North Korean leader Kim Jong Il proposed shutting down his
country's missile program in exchange for international help in
developing its space program.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials are wary of dealing with the often-erratic
government in North Korea. But they also are clearly intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's envisioned here would be for North Korea to give up, to
foreswear its ballistic missile program in exchange for some kind
of international assistance in putting into orbit satellites and
that kind of thing,'' noted one senior Clinton administration
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if it was clearly understood that the launch capability
was going to be outside the territory of North Korea and thoroughly
subject to international technology controls, that not only would
be something that we would be prepared to pursue but it's actually
something we have pursued.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials are under no illusions they fully
understand North Korea's intentions. ``It's not entirely clear
what's in Kim Jong Il's mind with regard to this possible
trade-off,'' the official noted.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin deemed the North Korean proposal ``something to be
studied and discussed,'' the official said. ``I'd say he was
cautiously optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met early today with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori and discussed the North Korean proposal. Clinton said the
proposal is ``something that needs to be explored. ... We need to
see exactly what the specifics are.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea caused great alarm throughout East Asia in 1998 when
it fired a missile over Japan, a launch North Korea called a
satellite launch.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of an attack by an unpredictable regime like that in
Pyongyang is one of the driving forces behind a U.S. proposal to
build a missile defense system to protect both the United States
and U.S. troops stationed abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, North Korea and China have all expressed concern at the
prospect of the United States developing a missile defense system.
Russia insists deployment of such a system would represent a
violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Putin reiterated those concerns again during his meeting with
Clinton. The president has not decided whether to move forward with
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those differences, the United States and Russia have
agreed to continue cooperating to control the spread of missile
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin came here to Okinawa on Friday to meet with
their counterparts in the so-called Group of Eight, the seven
industrialized powers and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who arrived in Japan one day later than scheduled to
spend more time at the Camp David peace talks, is considering
leaving Okinawa early to hurry back to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Putin offered Russia's help in brokering an Israeli-Palestinian
peace agreement, but Clinton administration officials would not
discuss what kind of role Russia may play. ``How exactly it might
be helpful will depend on the outcome in Camp David,'' the
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating the state of the world economy, the leaders expressed
concern about the risk that increased oil prices may represent.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from reiterating the argument that stable oil prices
would help both producing and consuming nations, the world leaders
did not consider any specific proposals to push crude prices lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of Eight members also expressed regret that plans to
relieve the world's poorest nations from crushing debt is
proceeding more slowly than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Security at the economic summit remained extremely tight, two
days after an estimated 20,000 demonstrators blocked the entrance
to the Kadena Air Base to protest the U.S. military presence in
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to ensure demonstrators did not disrupt the economic
summit, the Japanese government brought in more than 20,000 police
officers from other parts of Japan to augment the Okinawan police
force.
</P>
<P>
   Police lined the roads to the summit area, and businesses in the
vicinity were closed. In addition, streets were cordoned off, and
the beaches around Okinawa's resort hotels were off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   Police scuffled with protesters again Friday outside the summit
area. And a small group of about 40 protesters marched down a key
street near where world leaders had gathered.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators carried a banner which, roughly translated,
read: ``We want to shatter the Okinawa Summit into pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The police, many in riot gear, kept that demonstration
contained.

NEWHALL LAND MALL SALE WILL BUY BACK SHARES

<P>
   VALENCIA, Calif. _ Negotiations are under way for the sale of
the Valencia Town Center - the mall, office buildings and
entertainment complex that make up the busiest retail district in
Santa Clarita, an official with The Newhall Land and Farming
Company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Escrow is expected to close by the end of summer on the mall
itself, the retail buildings along Town Center Drive and the
entertainment center with its IMAX theater, company spokeswoman
Marlee Lauffer said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Newhall Land expects to finalize the sale
later this year with a second buyer interested in the three-story
office building on Town Center Drive and Princess Cruises' three
buildings, two of which are under construction, Lauffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither buyer was identified, nor were the selling prices of the
various properties.
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Land also is accepting offers on the Bank of America
building east of the mall, and the Spectrum Club gym on Town Center
Drive, including the 7.9 acres that surround it.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from the pending sales will be reinvested into the
company as part of a stock buyback program. Newhall Land announced
plans last year to repurchase up to 6.4 million shares - about 20
percent of the outstanding shares at that time.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is that the stock is undervalued and offers a
healthy investment for the Valencia-based developer.
</P>
<P>
   The sales will provide a cash infusion but substantially reduce
the company's income from commercial properties, according to its
second-quarter report, released this week. During the last quarter,
escrow closed on two neighborhood retail centers - in Castaic and
in the Valencia Industrial Center, adding $18.8 million to revenues
and $3.7 million to income.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue and income were down for the third quarter, which ended
June 30. Revenue fell $63 million to $55.3 million over the same
period a year ago and net income dropped $12.7 million to $6.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Lauffer said the drops were not significant and that sales
cannot be timed around quarterly earnings reports. In fact, Newhall
Land expects its third straight record year, she said.

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Only hard-core soccer fans know much about
the Galaxy's Peter Vagenas, but don't be surprised if the Pasadena
native is spotted in Sydney for the Olympic Games in September.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Vagenas has been all over the place for the Galaxy. He
has scored three goals with five starts in nine games played
overall.
</P>
<P>
   He's as feisty as a fly at a picnic and he'll get another start
against Tampa Bay in Raymond James Stadium this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy is without six starters for the second straight match
because of World Cup qualification matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity for all of us, not just myself,'' said
Vagenas. ``We feel like we have the best team in the league, not
just the best starting 11. We didn't get the job done last week
against D.C., so now we have to get the job done on the road before
the boys get back.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid loves about Vagenas. He
talks like a seasoned team leader, not a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has one of those good soccer brains,'' said Schmid. ``His
technical skills are going to improve, but he's having success
because he loves and understands this game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was never more apparent than last week. After creating and
finishing a beautiful goal to give the Galaxy a 1-0 lead, all
Vagenas would talk about later was the easy goal he missed, which
led painful 2-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know Pete, he was as upset as anybody,'' said Schmid.
``And that's how I measure players: Does that sort of thing bother
him or did it worry him? It bothered Pete, and if he gets that
opportunity again he's not going to do the same thing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   During a practice Wednesday, Vagenas was still harping on his
missed opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play a game of soccer for 90 minutes hoping to get one
chance and I had two of them in a span of 20 minutes,'' he said.
``That's why I'm gearing toward this game with Tampa. I'm going to
make amends. I'm going to make this game my best one all season.''

AFTER TWO ROUNDS, WOODS EYES A KNOCKOUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Tiger Woods sensed a career Grand Slam.
His opponents sensed the door slamming shut.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Woods work Friday was like watching a top surgeon
performing a delicate operation. His most precarious moment
occurred at the Road Hole, the par-4 No. 17 at the Old Course at
St. Andrews, when his second shot rolled off the green and down a
ledge onto a thin strip of grass near the road. But Woods showed
his brilliance once again, hitting a deft chip over the ledge that
ran eight feet past the cup before making the putt coming back to
save par.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive round at the British Open, Woods did
not have a bogey. He has now played 62 consecutive bogey-free holes
at major championships.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Saturday's third round, Woods held a three-stroke
lead and the path to history in his hands. At age 24, Woods can
become the youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam,
having already won the Masters (1997), the PGA Championship (1999)
and the U.S. Open, which he won last month.
</P>
<P>
   Will anyone beat Woods? Perhaps only if he falters, and after
Friday's performance that did not seem likely. Shooting a 6-under
66 after his opening-round 67 on Thursday, Woods was 11 under (136)
for the tournament, three strokes ahead of David Toms (8 under,
69-67) and four strokes ahead of three players who were tied at 7
under: Steve Flesch (67-70), Sergio Garcia (68-69) and Loren
Roberts (69-68).
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is magical, or simply methodical, Woods is by far the
world's No. 1 player. And with 36 holes remaining between Woods and
history, he looked determined to let nothing stand in his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am playing very similar to how I played at Pebble,'' Woods
said, referring to the U.S. Open, which he won by 15 strokes, the
largest margin in major championship history.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his bogey-free streak, Woods smiled and said:
``Bogeys aren't good for a scorecard. If you go around and not make
any bogeys for the entire week, I guarantee you're going to have a
chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Five prominent players were tied at 6 under _ Fred Couples,
Ernie Els, Tom Lehman, Thomas Bjorn and Phil Mickelson. They will
all try to catch Woods, but that can be like trying to catch a
world-class sprinter who has a 10-yard head start.
</P>
<P>
   His competitors have seen it before. They do not want to see it
again. But there may be nothing they can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't made a bogey, and anybody who plays that kind of
golf is going to be tough to beat,'' Lehman said. ``All we can do,
all I can do, is play my best.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods has played the Old Course as if it's his home course,
taking advantage of the benign conditions that have allowed players
to attack. There are 112 bunkers on the course, and Woods has not
been in one since the tournament started.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Els faded Friday with an even-par 72, quickly
surrendering the one-stroke lead he held over Woods and Flesch
through 18 holes. Playing in near-prefect conditions in the
morning, Els missed several short putts on the front nine, lost
confidence and squandered an opportunity to put more pressure on
Woods before he teed off in the afternoon. ``I never got into a
rhythm,'' Els said. ``Today was my bad round. I know I can play
better over the weekend, and I'll do that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Els foundered, Toms, Flesch and Garcia played well in the
morning and put themselves in the hunt. But Flesch has yet to win a
professional tournament, and Toms has only one top 10 finish in a
major championship. Garcia, however, took on Woods last year in a
thrilling back-nine duel at the PGA Championship, losing by one
stroke but gaining great respect at age 19. Garcia turned 20 in
January, and he is young enough not to be intimidated by the
prospect of chasing Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be something special,'' Garcia said about the
prospect of another final-round battle with Woods. ``I feel I'm
playing very solid, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one is playing better than Woods, who displayed his
versatility in front of a crowd estimated at 47,000, the largest in
tournament history. Woods opened with a birdie at the par-4 opening
hole, hitting a sand wedge approach shot to eight feet, then making
the putt. He added a 12-foot putt for birdie at No. 4, then birdied
the par-5, 568-yard No. 5, hitting his second shot just short of
the green, then chipping to four feet and making the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Woods also made 12-foot birdie putts at Nos. 9 and 12, but his
up-and-down at No. 17 to save par was the highlight of his day.
Showing his touch and imagination, Woods stood on the thin grass
bordering the famous road and hit a soft shot over a three-foot
ledge onto the green, running the ball past the cup but
intentionally using a slope behind the hole to slow down the ball.
He also saved par at No. 18 by making a testy six-foot
double-breaking putt.
</P>
<P>
   With the tournament at his midway point, the world's best player
had a three-stroke lead. The weather could turn nasty this weekend,
which would make the Old Course far more difficult. That could also
work to Woods' advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think that to put some heat on Tiger Woods, we
need to have some good weather,'' Roberts said. ``If it's bad
weather, he's such a strong player, with his length, it would be
tough to catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the weather, Woods planned to stay where he was.
When asked how he would feel in his competitors' shoes, he offered
no advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to answer that one, because I am not in their
shoes,'' Woods said. ``It's hard for me to understand what their
thought process is. I know what mine is. And that's all I need to
know.''

GORE FINALLY SEEMS TO DRAW BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI with ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For much of the late spring and summer, on
issues ranging from education to the environment, Vice President Al
Gore dissected and disparaged Gov. George W. Bush's record in
Texas, and the Texas governor never failed to fight back. He stood
before television cameras to dismiss what he said were gross
distortions, and his advisers churned out news releases that
contradicted Gore's claims.
</P>
<P>
   But never has the Bush campaign mounted as furious a
counter-offensive as it did day after day this week, in response to
the vice president's latest salvo: that the Texas governor had
mismanaged his state's finances, creating serious cost overruns
that jeopardized the state's fiscal health. At long last, the Gore
campaign seemed to hit a nerve, or at least stoke an outrage that
suggested the emergence of a line of attack that might have some
staying power.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign set up conference calls between reporters and
Republican and even Democratic lawmakers who said that an estimated
$610 million in unanticipated expenses in Texas would be more than
covered by a budget surplus of over $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign arranged for Bush to read a statement publicly
denouncing Gore's tactics on a day when the governor had not
planned to make any public appearances. His aides approached major
television networks about booking Bush's senior advisers on weekend
news programs. And the language Bush used to castigate his
Democratic rival grew sharper than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now know what Bill Bradley meant when he said, `How can we
trust this man as president when we can't trust him as a
candidate?''' Bush told reporters Friday at his ranch near
Crawford, referring to Gore's opponent in the Democratic primaries.
``I'm beginning to get a feel for why he uttered those words.''
</P>
<P>
   But was he also beginning to get a little nervous? Republican
and Democratic strategists said that Gore's attack on Bush's
experience and ability as a fiscal manager marked an important
moment in the presidential race for several reasons, and that the
Bush campaign's aggressive reaction was a clear reflection of that.
</P>
<P>
   These strategists said that by calling Bush's aptitude for
fiscal responsibility into question, Gore was challenging Bush on
an issue _ the ability to manage the economy and sustain prosperity
_ on which Republicans have often maintained an advantage over
Democrats in voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Gore was doing it in the context of the
ever-expanding surplus projections that have become one of the
brightest legacies of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's two main strengths are education and the economy, and
you don't give when your opponent strikes at your strengths,'' said
Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``This is still a race about
pocketbook issues, and it's where Bush's strengths really lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican strategists said that while voters often had
difficulty making sense of competing education proposals and seldom
supported candidates on the basis of rival philosophies about the
environment, they understood money, and Gore's claim that Bush was
not managing it properly amounted to perhaps the boldest attack yet
on Bush's Texas record. That record, several strategists said, was
perhaps the principal credential that Bush carried into this race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polling shows that the view of him as a successful governor is
an essential reason why people believe he has the capacity to be a
good president,'' said one Republican strategist. ``The Bush
campaign can't afford to have that pillar shaken.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said that the
vigor that the Bush campaign was bringing to the rebuttal of Gore's
charges about the Texas budget was an offensive of its own, aimed
at showing voters how readily Gore would alter facts to tear down
his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question's going to turn on Al Gore's credibility,'' he
said in an interview Friday. ``This is so clear-cut. In the
post-Clinton era, one of the key questions is whether voters want
four more years of honesty problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore and his aides were bubbling with confidence Friday,
saying that the questions they had raised about the Texas budget
embodied and brought into vivid relief the larger concerns they had
been trying to stoke about Bush's experience and what they see as
his nonchalant approach to governing.
</P>
<P>
   To hammer home that last point, the Gore campaign has been using
one of Bush's recent quips about the Texas budget. Asked about the
budget recently, Bush alluded to his presidential hopes and said,
``I hope I'm not here to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore, in a speech before labor leaders in Washington on
Friday, said, ``I think that this week will be looked back upon as
a turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also clearly saw its current line of attack in
the context of Bush's campaign proposal for an enormous tax cut,
something that voters have not demonstrated a sharp appetite for
and that Gore has said would endanger continued prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   That situation is portrayed differently by the two campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign cited recently released estimates about the
cost overruns, primarily in its Medicaid and state prison programs,
as evidence that the state budget was out of whack. Bush's aides
said that the state's expected surplus of $1.1 billion would take
care of the expenses, and on Thursday, when Gore came to Texas to
denounce Bush's record on the governor's home turf, the state's
Republican comptroller held a news conference in which she raised
the surplus estimate to $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore did not seem to be cowed, and the Bush campaign stepped
up its fight Friday. Fleischer said that it had asked Republican
members of the House and Senate budget committees to hold news
conferences in their districts and talk to reporters to make the
case that Gore was playing fast, loose and dishonest with the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also arranged a conference call so that
reporters could talk to Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the
House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no deficit in Texas; there's a big surplus, and the
vice president has the gall to try to distort this,'' Kasich said.
``Texas has had six consecutive years of budget surpluses, balanced
budgets, increased funding for education, and tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By contrast,'' Kasich continued, ``four of the eight budgets
submitted by the Clinton-Gore administration over the past eight
years have left the budget in deficits.''
</P>
<P>
   Several strategists said that part of what the Bush campaign was
doing was serving notice to Gore, at a time when the presidential
race is heating up and more voters may begin to pay attention, and
that it would not let any charge go unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   David Doak, a Democratic strategist, said that the motivation
behind the response by Bush and his advisers might be pure anger,
amplified by the awareness that Gore was taking a page out of the
kind of assault Bush's father waged against former Gov. Michael
Dukakis of Massachusetts during the 1988 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate the possibility that he may have just made
Bush mad,'' Doak said. ``These guys are human. They have emotions
and feelings and pride and competitiveness.''

GORE PURSUES UNIONS 
WITH MINIMUM WAGE 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to shore up his support from labor, Vice
President Al Gore warned union members Friday that his Republican
rival for president would gut the federal minimum wage law and
drain working people's retirement safety net while giving huge tax
cuts to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the side of the men and women who work hard, physical
jobs all their lives, who drive those buses and lay down train
track and carry bags at airports for others,'' Gore told
transportation trades workers at an AFL-CIO convention. ``They need
something more than an IOU when they retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore secured the labor federation's endorsement months ago, and
unions have donated about $15 million to the Democratic Party this
year, compared with $9 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic candidate has met resistance from the
Teamsters and the United Auto Workers, who have so far withheld
their support and may be considering backing Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   The two unions, which constitute about 2 million of the
AFL-CIO's total membership of 13 million, were angered earlier this
year over the Clinton-Gore administration's support of free trade
legislation, especially the granting of permanent normal trade
relations to China.
</P>
<P>
   Unions, which normally provide a bedrock of support for
Democrats, also winced at Gore's recent appointment of former
Commerce Secretary Bill Daley to run his campaign. Daley led the
administration's fight for China trade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, union members gathered at Washington's Capital Hilton
gave Gore a warm reception Friday, with leaders enthusiastically
hugging him and a packed ballroom drowning out his speech with
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pledged to increase the minimum wage by $1 an hour, and
noted that his opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, would allow
states to opt out of minimum wage laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is that all about?'' he asked. ``You talk about a
reactionary lurch back to the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been attacking Bush all week on his budget priorities
in Texas and on his economic adviser's recent acknowledgment that
the governor's plan for beefing up Social Security would
temporarily allow the Social Security trust fund to ``run dry.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has charged that Bush's plan, which calls for
letting workers invest as much as 2 percent of their Social
Security payroll taxes in the stock market, would drain the Social
Security trust fund and could lead to raising the retirement age or
cutting benefits or both.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was asked about Gore's comments by reporters touring his
Crawford, Texas, ranch Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome the Social Security debate,'' Bush responded. ``This
is an administration that has done nothing for Social Security. I
have laid out a plan to save the strength of Social Security. I
can't wait to debate the vice president on this subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan said Bush, like Gore, supports
increasing the minimum wage, ``so long as there is flexibility for
states who have work force or economic challenges.''

CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA PREPS TO BATTLE IN ROSE BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; PASADENA, Calif. _ They managed to stay at the same hotel
without incident. They sat in the same restaurants and attended the
same charity benefits. Now it's time for the players to battle in
what many consider the most attractive high school all-star
football game in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to end years of debate over which state boasts the most
talented players, California and Florida's best prep football
standouts will meet at 7 tonight in the inaugural CaliFlorida Bowl
at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   California has already proven its dominance over Texas, another
of the nation's prep-talent hotbeds. California beat Texas for the
sixth straight year in last month's Shrine All-Star Football
Classic in Cerritos.
</P>
<P>
   Florida coach David Wilson marveled at the history of the Rose
Bowl earlier this week. But he admits his team is here to defend
Florida football's reputation, not get caught up in tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has proven its dominance over Texas, so we're
another measuring stick for them,'' said Wilson. ``But this is a
measuring stick for Florida football, too. We have talked about
this game a long time. And we have talked about leaving here
victorious.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a meeting many can't wait to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the emergence of Florida as a power in football, I think
this will be far and away the marquee game in the nation,'' said
Chuck Price of Air 7 Sports, tonight's chief sponsor. ``There are
so many all-star games out there. We didn't want this to be just
another game. With this event, at least 95 percent of the kids will
be going to Division I colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   The California squad features Concord De La Salle linebacker and
University of Miami-bound standout D.J. Williams, the consensus top
player in the nation. The team also includes USC-bound Matt
Grootegoed of Mater Dei and Santa Margarita quarterback Chris Rix,
formerly of Bishop Amat, who's headed to Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's all-star team features 6-foot-5, 225-pound linebacker
Eric Moore (Florida State) as well as quarterback Dominic Dunbar,
who prepped at Manatee High in Bradenton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Wink Barnett, director of the Florida Athletics Coaches
Association, hopes this all-star event sets the standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire state of Florida is extremely excited about being
involved with this event,'' said Barnett. ``We hope to build a
long-term relationship and rivalry with California.''
</P>
<P>
   California coach Gene Vollnogle said earlier in the week that
his players would have to be dead not to get excited about
tonight's game. He was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we couldn't beat Texas and look what we did to
them,'' said Williams. ``Now we want to find out who the real
champion is. It's a big thing. You want to be able to say when you
play football in California, you come from the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Vollnogle, the longtime coach of Los Angeles City championship
teams at Banning and Carson, said his team will run the ball only
five to 10 times. That means a lot of work for Rix, as well as
fellow quarterbacks Scott Vossmeyer (Van Nuys) and Matt Cassel
(Chatsworth).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running a four-wide receiver set,'' said Rix. ``We'll be
throwing the heck out of the ball and it will be exciting because
we're surrounded with all this talent and speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Vollnogle expects Florida to mix it up more than his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Florida will run the ball more than us,'' said
Vollnogle, who has been in semiretirement for 10 years, though
working as an assistant coach. ``They're sort of like Texas. They
run the option, the power and they will throw a little. Hopefully,
we have done enough this week to be prepared for it.''

FCC RULE REQUIRES NARRATION TO ACCOMPANY SOME TV PROGRAMMING 
</HEADLINE>
   By The New York Times   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Communications Commission approved a
plan Friday requiring broadcasters to adopt technology allowing
blind people to follow the action on television by listening to a
narrator describe what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are part of a broad plan to make telecommunications
and new technology like wireless phones more accessible to people
with disabilities. Of the 54 million Americans with disabilities in
the United States, 8 million to 12 million have severely impaired
vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important to allow everyone to participate in the
television experience,'' said William Kennard, the FCC chairman.
``Television is the modern equivalent of the public square.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology allows the user to turn on a secondary audio
programming channel, where a narrator describes the action of a
scene during pauses in the dialogue. Audiences can hear that an
actor sadly buries his face in his hands, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will model its video description rules on
guidelines governing closed-captioning technology for the hearing
impaired.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, which were adopted by a 3-2 vote, will require that
network-affiliated broadcasters in the top 25 television markets
use the secondary channel for roughly four hours per week, either
as prime-time or children's programming, beginning in the spring of
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Cable systems and satellite operators with 50,000 or more
subscribers will have to provide the service for their most popular
networks.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting commissioners questioned whether the agency had
the statutory authority to impose the rules on the broadcast
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Live news shows, sporting events _ which often include
play-by-play descriptions _ and talk shows would be exempt from the
rules, because the action is generally covered in natural dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But the rules will cover local emergency information that is
part of a newscast, or that interrupts regularly scheduled
programming. And when emergency information scrolls across the
screen, an audible tone will be required to alert people that
important information has been provided. The emergency policy will
take effect in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   The video descriptions delivered over the secondary audio
programming channel would only be heard when that channel is
activated. All televisions made in the United States since the
early 1990s have the channel.
</P>
<P>
   In some markets, however, the secondary channel is used for
Spanish and other foreign language audio, a potential conflict. The
cost of providing video descriptions is another concern among
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is limited to analog broadcasters, but could be applied
to emerging digital broadcasters later. The commission intends to
gather information and experience with this technology, officials
said, to help evaluate the possibility of expanding and improving
the program.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to the the National Association of Broadcasters
were not returned Friday. A spokesman for the National Cable
Television Association said that the group looks forward to reading
the FCC order, but that the industry should be able to create its
own standards.
</P>
<P>
   Public television has been active in the video description
effort for more than a decade. WGBH in Boston, for example, began
to narrate the popular programs ``Masterpiece Theater'' and
``Nature'' in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Pfanstiehl, the chairwoman of the National Television
Video Access Coalition, called the proposal ``a huge step
forward.''

BRASWELL GETS CSUN EXTENSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Bobby Braswell has done things the right way.
</P>
<P>
   And so Cal State Northridge rewarded its men's basketball coach
with a four-year contract extension on Friday that will pay the
37-year-old Valley native nearly $140,000 annually plus incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for me and for my family,'' said Braswell,
who graduated from CSUN and began his career as the coach at
Cleveland High in Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell has a 63-53 record in four years at CSUN and led the
Matadors to their first 20-win season at the Division I-A level
last season.
</P>
<P>
   He has built the program while remaining steadfastly loyal to an
old-school brand of coaching that at times has left some of his
best players on the bench for important games because they violated
a team rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the most satisfying thing about it,'' Braswell
said. ``We've done this without sacrificing our principles. It's
been a fun ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Braswell will earn a base salary of $100,116 plus an additional
$38,000 from outside sources. He said he can earn more by achieving
a number of incentives that are written into the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The salary puts Braswell in line with other men's basketball
coaches in the Big West Conference, which CSUN is moving to
following a final season in the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Morgan at Long Beach State, for example, signed a contract
extension earlier this summer that pays him $140,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been impressed with Coach Braswell's integrity and with
his concern for student-athletes and their development on and off
the court,'' CSUN athletic director Dick Dull said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has molded this program into a highly competitve team, and
I look forward to even bigger and better accomplishments in the
years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Braswell has been interviewed several times for coaching
vacancies at other universities. He said his new contract raises
the bar for employment elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I am committed to Cal State Northridge,'' Braswell
said. ``It's going to have to be a very, very, !ital!very!off good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN twice has come one victory away from reaching the NCAA
Tournament under Braswell, most recently in April when the Matadors
lost in the Big Sky Tournament final in overtime to Northern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, while playing inconsistently at times this past
year, nevertheless defeated both Fresno State and Oregon _ two
eventual NCAA teams _ on the road.
</P>
<P>
   This year's team returns four starters: Brian Heinle, Markus
Carr, Jeff Parris and Carl Holmes. Together they averaged 44 points
a game.

ON DAY 2, MALLON LEADS BY CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL FIELDS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. _ Meg Mallon abandoned her maverick strategy on one
hole but held on to her patience for the entire round. It was the
latter that allowed her to maintain the lead through two rounds of
the U.S. Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was much more of a scramble day,'' said Mallon, whose
even-par 72 at the Merit Club put her at 4-under 140, one stroke
ahead of Betsy King and Karrie Webb. ``I hung in there. Just making
a bogey in an Open is OK''
</P>
<P>
   Cristie Kerr is at 143, and six players are another stroke back
at 144: Juli Inkster, the defending champion, who shot a 74; the
19-year-old Dorothy Delasin, who had the day's best round, a 68;
Laura Davies (71); Rosie Jones (71); Kathryn Marshall (72), and
Shani Waugh (75). Annika Sorenstam, the LPGA's leading
money-winner, who has five victories this season, has ground to
make up after shooting a 75 and finishing 36 holes at 4-over 148.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon and King were in the same grouping, which gave the two
former Women's Open champions a chance to practice what they had
recently preached to one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betsy and I are very good friends,'' Mallon said, ``and we
made a pact to be patient golfers this week. Sometimes we get a
little fired up out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The pace was tedious and the wind was fickle, but Mallon, who
won this event in 1991, and King, who won consecutive titles in
1989 and '90, were up to the challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meg played very well,'' said King, who shot 70. ``I think that
helped me keep it up with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb, the 25-year-old Australian star, who has won four
tournaments this year, said she was inspired by the tough
conditions and the importance of the championship on her way to a
72.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest event we play all year,'' Webb said.
``Whether or not I win this weekend, it's a tournament I'll be
gunning to win every year. The atmosphere _ there's just a little
more electricity out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb's only blemish was a bogey on her last hole, but on a day
when the field averaged 76.8 and 31 players shot in the 80s, Webb
did not leave the course too concerned about it.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon attracted attention while taking the first-round lead
when she purposely played her tee shot on the 14th hole into the
adjacent 13th fairway. But she took the conventional route Friday,
making a par 4 as she had done in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   USGA officials did not take any action to deter players from
taking the alternate route. Pat Hurst and Beth Daniel took the
detour, but the most of the field played the 14th hole
conventionally.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when rounds stretched beyond five hours and many of the
holes were buffeted with crosswinds, golfers had to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty tired right now,'' said King, 45, who has two
victories this season. ``It took a lot to play out there. When
you're a little bit older, it's tough. It's hard to give that age
up to the competitors. But I'm happy to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb started this season on a tear with four early victories.
But she last won in the year's first major, the Nabisco
Championship, in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's just been a drought hasn't it?'' she joked when
someone noted that it had been a while since she won. &QL;

   &UR; SUPERHEROES, COLLECTIBLES AND TRINKETS DRAW 45,000 TO SAN
DIEGO &LR;
</P>
<P>

   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;

   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tom Twohy traveled all the way from San Jose to
the San Diego Convention Center to spend $300 for a new light
saber. He wanted a really good one to go with his Jedi Master
costume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to carouse around and get my picture taken,'' the
40-year-old Silicon Valley dot-commer explained. ``Of course, that
happens more when I wear my Klingon costume.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of crowd at the 31st Comic-Con International,
North America's largest comic-book confab and trade show. The
event, which features the latest trends in the comics industry and
attracts more than 45,000 visitors, commenced Thursday and ends
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   This year's convention received an extra spark from the recent
opening of the ``X-Men'' movie. Yet while X-Men paraphernalia was
everywhere, the mutant heroes themselves were noticeably absent.
</P>
<P>
   At the sprawling booth of Marvel Comics, publisher of the
various X-Men titles, visitors had to make do with a skinny guy in
a Spider-Man costume. Spider-Man will have his own movie out by the
end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enough other superheroes to take care of things,''
Spider-Man said when asked who was keeping the streets of San Diego
safe while he was inside posing for pictures. The X-Men, he added
with a measure of scorn, ``are all busy with their movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the aisle, rival DC Comics trundled out its writers and
artists instead of guys in costumes. San Francisco writer Judd
Winick, 30, was on hand to discuss his new role as author of the
Green Lantern series, a move to keep the character fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Green Lantern, he said, ``is going to grow up. He's going to eat
fast food and surf the Net. He's going to be one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, another San Francisco writer, Ed Brubaker, said he was
looking forward to his debut next month as the new author of
Batman. He said alert readers might notice Gotham City seeming a
little more like his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent more time in San Francisco than Manhattan,''
Brubaker said, ``so when I think of corrupt city politicians and
city crime, I think of San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he admitted that he ``can't see Willie Brown
coming out and turning on the Bat Signal.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood at the convention was decidedly festive, with the
event's hundreds of exhibitors peddling everything from vintage
comics to original artwork to all manner of toys and collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Hanford, a San Diego third-grade teacher, kept busy by
poking through bins at various booths in search of vintage Classics
Illustrated comics. His face lit up as he plunked down $100 for a
stack that included titles such as ``The House of the Seven
Gables'' and ``Silas Marner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I now have every Classics Illustrated except one,'' he said
with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford gingerly fingered the one missing piece from his
collection, a mint-edition copy of Westward Ho! selling for $650.
He said he planned to cruise the other booths before purchasing
this long-sought treasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like good literature,'' Hanford said. ``I read the
books, too. I like to see how they compare.''
</P>
<P>
   His 13-year-old daughter, Cathy, said her dad lets her read his
comics from time to time. ``I liked A Tale of Two Cities,'' she
noted. ``It was better than the book. It had better pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking around the convention hall, some might conclude that
Comic-Con was populated almost exclusively by geeky overweight guys
with ponytails and scraggly little beards. But that would be
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   There were women present as well.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriella Tejeda, 15, prowled among the booths in a black
leather Catwoman outfit. ``I'm just being myself,'' she said.
``I've always loved Catwoman. She's so brave and stands on her own
two feet.''
</P>
<P>
   She also commits crimes, it was pointed out. ``Yeah, she does
that,'' Tejeda reluctantly allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine Thomas, 35, flew up from Venezuela for the show. She
was looking to round out her collection with some missing Fantastic
Four and Little Lulu comics. Asked how many Little Lulus she now
possessed, Thomas whipped out her Palm handheld device and punched
in some commands. ``Seventy,'' she reported.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, women at Comic-Con fell into the
girlfriend/wife category and seemed to be struggling to share their
guys' passion for men who wear tights and capes.
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Jill Durham, 21, who sported a blue Superman shirt as
she trailed her fiance, said women didn't really see what the big
deal was. But they did have this to say: There's an awful lot of
sex at a comic-book convention.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everywhere visitors looked, they saw drawings and
photos of women with unusually robust proportions clad in skimpy
costumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans like tough, dominant women,'' said Monte Michael
Moore, an illustrator who specializes in cheesecake depictions of
fantasy heroines. ``That will never change.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles artist Paul Dale was promoting his creation, Chopper
Chicks of Mars, which he said is ``kind of like `Baywatch' on
Mars'' and is marketed to male readers ages 16 and up. ``I'm trying
to capture kids who are just discovering sex,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few of those kids gathered near the booth of Stacy
Walker, a Chopper Chick of Mars come to life. Walker, wearing a
low-cut blue-sequined gown, has worked for the past decade as a
model for some of the leading illustrators in the fantasy/superhero
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Among the numerous prints for sale was one of Walker in the
guise of an icy villain beating the tar out of Superman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comics are very over the top, very over-exaggerated,'' she
said of her suitability as a comic-book model. ``I'm sort of an
unknown, but in this realm, I'm really big.''
</P>
<P>
   Falling into the same category was Esther Hwang, the curvaceous
former assistant to Mayor Brown and former spokeswoman for the San
Francisco Department of Public Works who has since refashioned
herself as an Internet pinup princess.
</P>
<P>
   Like Walker, Hwang attracted a crowd of admiring boys of all
ages as she autographed prints and calendars showing her in a
variety of too-small swimsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make appearances at a lot of conventions,'' she said.
``These guys love the Internet, and I'm really big on the Net. I
fit right in at Comic-Con.''
</P>
<P>
   Hwang said she's making a much better living now peddling her
flesh online than she ever did as a municipal worker. She intends
to use the proceeds to help pay for law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``My site isn't just about babes, boobs and bikinis,'' Hwang
insisted. ``I have something to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Her site says that ``Esther desires to be recognized for her
talents and intelligence and is determined to uphold strong morals
and values on her upward strive toward stardom.'' She charges $10 a
month for access to photos of her in lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, muscleman Lou Ferrigno, who played the
Incredible Hulk on television, was selling prints of himself in
even tinier swimsuits and flexing his still-huge biceps for fans.
He said he's looking forward to making a cameo appearance in a
coming film version of the Hulk.
</P>
<P>
   And looking more than a little startled by the goings-on around
her, Veronika Kirueshkin-Stepanoff did her best to appear
comfortable in the barely there costume of a new superhero called
Gamma Girl.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to San Jose from Moscow four years ago and was
recommended by a friend for a gig at Comic-Con. In heavily accented
English, Kirueshkin-Stepanoff said she believed Gamma Girl would do
well in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gamma Girl fights with the bad guys,'' she pointed out, ``and
Russia has a lot of bad guys right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamma Girl is the creation of Dan Marquez, an engineer at a
Silicon Valley maker of integrated circuits who has invested
$10,000 into publishing his own comic. And he's about to sink
thousands more into a second issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping it will turn into a big comic-book company,''
Marquez said. He gazed hopefully around the crowded hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a lot more fun than integrated circuits,'' he
said.

HEZBOLLAH CELL REPORTED IN NORTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a series of raids throughout the Charlotte, N.C.,
area, federal officials on Friday arrested 18 people in what they
called a broad conspiracy to aid the militant Islamic organization
Hezbollah, listed by the government as a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested, most of whom originally came from a neighborhood
south of Beirut, were part of an active Hezbollah cell in North
Carolina that trafficked in contraband cigarettes and laundered
money that was then sent to the group's leaders in Lebanon, the
government charged in an affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Although the authorities did not specify the amount transferred
to Hezbollah, they did say that one suspect alone had sent it at
least $1 million. Lending support to an organization designated by
the government as terrorist is a federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   This cell meets weekly in Charlotte to plot ways to assist
Hezbollah, the affidavit said, and ``is extremely anti-United
States.'' The meetings invariably include a reading from the
Ayatollah Khomeini, it said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the suspects were charged with any terrorist activities
themselves. But the man identified as the leader of the group,
Muhammad Youssef Hammoud, was described as having received military
training from Hezbollah, and the government said he ``would not
hesitate'' to carry out a terrorist act if ordered to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, Said M. Harb, was accused of helping to purchase
technical equipment for Hezbollah, including global positioning
systems, night vision goggles and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the group were also charged with aiding a terrorist
organization, and with immigration and visa fraud, money laundering
and racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the information about the suspects came from five
informers who infiltrated the cell, said the affidavit, presented
in court Friday by U.S. Attorney Mark T. Calloway.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money sent overseas was raised through illegal
cigarette trafficking, the government charged. Members of the group
were said to have set up wholesale tobacco businesses as fronts and
to have then smuggled large quantities of cigarettes from North
Carolina, where the tax is 5 cents a pack, to Michigan, where it is
75 cents a pack. The difference in price, officials said, could
result in a profit of $3,000 to $4,000 for every truckload of
cigarettes sent to Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said about 250 federal, state and local agents took
part in the raids, which began before dawn Friday and struck at
homes and businesses alike.
</P>
<P>
   George Levkulich, who lives next door to one suspect, Ali Fayez
Darwich, said vehicles from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms pulled up at Darwich's home early Friday morning and spent
the whole day there, with agents removing much of the house's
contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took all kinds of things out of there, video cameras and
stuff,'' Levkulich said. ``We asked them what was going on, and
they said it was just a routine investigation. But I guess it
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Levkulich said he was amazed to hear that his neighbor was
involved with Hezbollah. He knew Darwich as a painter who worked
for a local home builder and supervised a crew of other painters.
(In fact, he said another painter pulled up to the house Friday
with his truck full of ladders and was immediately searched by
federal agents.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped me with a water pipe once,'' Levkulich said. ``He
was a nice guy, a regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The government said Darwich was the brother of a ``well-known
Hezbollah fighter'' in Lebanon and had regularly sent large sums of
cash there via courier. He also participated in the cigarette
scheme, as did his cousin, Hammoud, the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   Darwich was charged with eight crimes, including marriage fraud:
He is accused of having entered into a false marriage in order to
receive American citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, backed by Syria and Iran, is Israel's fiercest enemy
in southern Lebanon, where it recently claimed victory when Israeli
troops withdrew after 18 years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1997, the State Department designated Hezbollah a foreign
terrorist organization, based on its participation in the bombing
that killed 241 U.S. Marines in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1983 and the
kidnapping of Western hostages in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorism designation, renewed in October, makes it illegal
to provide any material or other support to the group. Israel has
long urged the United States to crack down on cells that it says
are funneling money to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The caseagainst the suspects dates from 1997, a result of a
local investigation into cigarette smuggling, which is widespread
in North Carolina because of its low tobacco tax. The affidavit
describes numerous cigarette buying and selling trips by the
suspects, and gives a detailed record of their checking-account and
credit-card dealings with cigarette distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the proceeds from the smuggling have been invested in
semilegitimate businesses, like a tobacco shop and a Lebanese
restaurant and deli in Charlotte, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   But the most personal information in the affidavit involves the
group's ideological associations with Hezbollah, as described by
the informers. It says, for example, that Hammoud frequently
downloads songs and speeches from Hezbollah Web sites, which, it
says, he uses in the cell's Thursday night meetings. He also has a
collection of Hezbollah's videotapes, which he plays at meetings to
encourage donations, the government said.

NEW YORKERS DEBATE WHAT'S WORSE: WEST NILE OR PESTICIDES? 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Camille Glad and Daiva Kezys are close in age, live
in the same borough and spent part of Friday a yard from each other
on a commercial strip in northern Queens. But when it comes to
their opinions on how the city should deal with the threat of the
West Nile virus, the two could not be further apart.
</P>
<P>
   Glad, 64, bars her elderly mother from outings in the park and
keeps her grandchildren inside when they visit from Maine to
protect them from mosquitoes that carry the virus. And, though she
worries that pesticides may have some risks, she says she believes
strongly that the city should spray them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You weigh one against the other, the good against the bad,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kezys, 61, says seven people _ the number who died from the
virus last year _ are not enough to justify substantial squirts of
chemicals near her home. Last year's spraying, she says, left her
with a six-month cough, and she fears for her dog's safety when she
sees him trample the misted grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think somebody is making a buck off this spraying,'' said
Kezys, a real estate agent. ``If it is so safe, why do they tell
people to stay inside?''
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma faced by Glad and Kezys is an increasingly common
one: what to fear most, the threat of West Nile or the threat of
the chemicals being used to prevent it? And interviews conducted
around the city and suburbs on Friday indicate that how people
react depends largely on a complex array of factors, many of them
highly subjective.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that many people feel ill-informed about both
the dangers and specifics of West Nile, and the dangers posed by
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Heilman, who lives in Scarsdale, N.Y., and is an
administrator for a pathology laboratory, falls into the group
doesn't think there is enough information. ``They haven't had any
real incidents of West Nile, so I'm reluctant about spraying,'' she
said. ``I've thought about contacting an environmental organization
to actually ask them what problems they might anticipate.''
</P>
<P>
   People who were raised in parts of the country where riding a
bicycle behind a truck puffing huge clouds of pesticide was
childhood sport, for instance, have different views from those who
never even went to summer camp. People's attitudes can be shaped by
where they get their news and how they feel about government.
</P>
<P>
   Science, in this case, is often of little help. Few people, even
top epidemiologists, can illuminate West Nile much; it was never in
North America before last year. It has no cure. The number of birds
and mosquitoes found to be infected with the illness changes every
day. And while the mayor and other officials are quick to dismiss
concerns about pesticides, they do not dole out much more
information on the chemicals than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have questions about whether strategic public
health interventions do more good than harm,'' said Gerard
Fergerson, a public health historian at the Wagner School at New
York University.
</P>
<P>
   The issue becomes more pressing each day with mounting evidence
that the disease has affected bird and mosquito populations around
the region. Friday, the State Health Department said it had
discovered nine new birds carrying the virus in Rockland,
Westchester, Richmond and Queens counties, raising the number of
birds testing positive for the virus this summer to 29.
</P>
<P>
   Further, a mosquito carrying the West Nile virus was found
farther north, in Orange County. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that
in response, the city would extend its pesticide spraying to
northern Queens and Staten Island, where spraying began earlier
this week, in spite of protests and a lawsuit brought by
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Viewpoints are informed greatly by personal experience and even
jobs. Ken Pulvidente, who owns a pet store in Amityville, N.Y.,
suspects that fish in ponds in the area died last year as a result
of spraying, which led him to worry about his drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought that when they sprayed last year it was
ridiculous,'' Pulvidente said. ``The spraying is probably going to
kill us 20 years from now. You're spraying it in the middle of
residential areas. How can that make sense?''
</P>
<P>
   A scientific background can bring an added twist.
</P>
<P>
   Mary-Ann Karpel, who has studied entomology, said that she had
learned that mosquitoes and people both could build up a tolerance
to chemicals. It is not an environmental opposition she harbors,
but a fear of what happens next. She envisions a world where
supermosquitoes dwell, flying about immune to all poisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what do we do?'' mused Karpel, munching on an ice-cream
bar in a Mount Kisco health food store. ``You should keep your
antibiotics and insecticides for desperate situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Political leanings can inform as well. Denise Walter, who lives
in Stamford, Conn., said she was ``one of those people who trust
their public officials.'' As such, she tends to believe them when
they promise that pesticides are safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're being responsible,'' she said. ``I support
what they're doing. Better than finding it out on the back side,
after someone's gotten West Nile.''
</P>
<P>
   And while opinions about pesticides do not divide along age
lines, there are some subtle distinctions. Marilyn Morello, 63,
lives on Staten Island, where dead birds infected with West Nile
have been discovered this month. She has grandchildren. But she
fears for her own health most and at the same time worries about
the efficacy of the spraying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really scared to death,'' she said. ``I have lung cancer
so I'm really worried about what the spraying might do to my lungs
when I breathe the stuff in. I don't know how effective spraying
for mosquitoes will really be. Mosquitoes are everywhere and they
can fly from place to place.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Barone, a teacher's aide who lives on Staten Island, also
worries whether spraying is effective. But she adamantly supports
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have children, everything just becomes much more
frightening,'' she said. ``You just take so many precautions. I'm
not all that concerned about what the spraying will do to humans
because I heard that it doesn't really affect us, but I'm afraid
that it might not completely get rid of the virus.''
</P>
<P>
   People with world travel experience tend to view the specter of
disease more gravely. Randy Altman, a tea trade consultant from
Pleasantville, in Westchester County, said he was reluctantly in
favor of the spraying and feared that the United States was far
behind other countries in understanding the full health risks of
outbreaks like West Nile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States middle class feels it is immune from these
insect-borne diseases,'' he said. ``They think it is a third world
problem. And it is not.''

TAX INCREASE NO LONGER JUSTIFIABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   A development that hasn't gotten nearly
the attention it deserves is the recent House Republican push to
roll back the 1993 tax levied on Social Security benefits.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tax raised the portion of Social Security benefits subject
to income tax from 50 percent to 85 percent for some relatively
high-income retirees. Although the tax affects only about one in
five beneficiaries, the rollback is the fitting thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was part of an effort to pare the federal budget
deficit, which hit a record $290 billion the year before. The
budget is now in surplus, thanks to excess revenue generated by the
Social Security payroll tax. This means there is no further
economic justification for the imposition.
</P>
<P>
   Another good reason is that a tax on any portion of benefits is
unfair and immoral. Working taxpayers not only pay Social Security
taxes from the first dollar of their wages but also are obligated
to count as income for tax purposes the wages they never see that
have been paid into Social Security. This means the money made over
a working lifetime paid to Social Security is effectively taxed
twice.
</P>
<P>
   To tax it a third time in the form of benefits made possible by
a worker's own tax money already contributed to the system has
always seemed the worst sort of tax-policy immorality. Washington,
however, got away with it because the levy affected only those
perceived as affluent. Thus, the class-warfare ploy worked when
stated in the context of a patriotic obligation to help fight the
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   This rationale no longer exists, though, and House Ways and
Means Chairman Bill Archer is hoping to marshal enough support to
return the limit of benefits subject to taxation to the pre-1993
level. A recent story in The New York Times said Archer hoped to
get floor consideration for the bill by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   The '93 tax increase was passed over considerable GOP objection
when Republicans were still a congressional minority. Archer
characterized it as ``money grubbing'' and said with the budget now
in the black, it was time ``to right this wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Excellent point. It's too bad there probably won't ever be
enough support for a total elimination of taxation of Social
Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   When most Americans are confronted with any proposal to convert
Social Security to a means-tested entitlement, the objection is
unfairness, because they paid their money into the system and
deserve their payoff.
</P>
<P>
   In the early debate over whether to tax any part of Social
Security benefits, however, this wasn't an issue because most
beneficiaries wouldn't be affected. Nevertheless, the principle
remains the same. If you paid the money into the system as taxes,
what's the justification for taxing it again on the way back into
the taxpayer's pocket?
</P>
<P>
   There was no justification, but it happened because just like
the income tax itself nearly 90 years ago, it was sold as a
class-warfare package that would affect only a relatively few
richies.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, it seems, is just trying to keep history from repeating
itself by making sure a tax designed to soak ``the rich'' doesn't
eventually become a tax on everybody.

AMGEN INC. WINS SOME ARGUMENTS, AS PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT
PROCEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amgen Inc. won another round Friday in its patent infringement
lawsuit against Transkaryotic Therapies when the judge overseeing
the case eliminated some of the arguments Transkaryotic was trying
to use in its defense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lawyers and analysts said the trial, which is expected to
last at least until September, was far from decided.
</P>
<P>
   Transkaryotic wants to sell its own version of erythropoietin,
the best-selling drug in the biotechnology industry. Transkaryotic
says it can make erythropoietin, which is used to treat anemia, in
a manner that does not infringe Amgen's patents, but Amgen
disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its defense, Transkaryotic is trying to persuade
Judge William Young of the U.S. District Court in Boston to declare
Amgen's patents invalid. One set of arguments it made was that
Amgen's claims did not warrant a patent because they were obvious
and anticipated by the previous work of others.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who is trying the case without a jury, ruled against
Transkaryotic on those points Friday. But he did not rule on
whether Transkaryotic infringed any patents.
</P>
<P>
   Elise Wang, an analyst with PaineWebber, said the ruling
weakened the position of Transkaryotic and its partner, Aventis SA,
the European drug company that is also a defendant in the suit.
Shares of Transkaryotic fell $3.875, to $31.125, while Amgen rose
$3.9375, to $78.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are other grounds on which Amgen's patents can be
declared invalid. TKT's main argument is expected to be that the
claims in Amgen's patents are broad and seek to cover things beyond
what Amgen invented. It is also arguing that Amgen defrauded the
U.S. Patent Office by withholding information.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still have half a dozen defenses left,'' said Jonas
Alsenas, portfolio manager for ING Furman Selz Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Erythropoietin is a protein normally produced in kidneys that
stimulates production of red blood cells. Amgen makes it by cloning
the human gene for erythropoietin and putting it in hamster ovary
cells that are grown in culture. Transkaryotic puts DNA into human
cells grown in culture to turn on the erythropoietin gene, which is
usually dormant.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high because erythropoietin accounts for roughly
$2 billion in sales for both Amgen and its licensee, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson. The industry is watching closely because if Transkaryotic
prevails, it might also make versions of other drugs. However, each
such attempt by the company is likely to face a separate patent
challenge.

IBC DENIES ACQUISITION RUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once again, Interstate Bakeries Corp. has denied reports that
it's being courted by Mexico's largest bread and cake maker, Grupo
Industrial Bimbo.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate Chairman Charles Sullivan on Friday tried to quash
the rumor that seemingly refuses to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming from a reporter in Mexico, and I have no idea in
the world where he dreams it up,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   After the report erupted, Interstate's stock price went up 18
percent. The New York Stock Exchange even suspended trading in
Interstate for a little more than an hour, until shortly after the
company released a statement denying the speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate, which makes Wonder bread, Twinkie snack cakes and a
slew of other products, is the largest wholesale baker in the
United States and one of Kansas City's few Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   It's been widely reported that Bimbo, which has a presence in
Texas and Southern California, is eyeing other acquisitions north
of the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   In a story appearing in El Financiero//Infolatina, business
writer Dario Celis Estrada reported that Bimbo had been considering
four acquisition targets and had settled on Interstate.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate has been vulnerable to a takeover since its stock
took a huge one-day hit in late 1998 when the company missed
earnings expectations. The stock has never recovered, prompting the
company to implement a poison pill late last year.
</P>
<P>
   That poison pill, or so-called shareholder rights plan, was
later dissolved after a protest from Interstate's largest
shareholder, Ralston Purina Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston owns more than 40 percent of Interstate's stock, which
it received when it sold its Continental Baking Co. to Interstate
in 1995 in a cash-and-stock deal.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate and Ralston resolved the issues over the poison pill,
and Interstate reinstated it earlier this year. The poison pill
can't prevent a takeover of Interstate but does force a possible
suitor to deal directly with the company's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   But as of late Friday afternoon, Sullivan said, Interstate had
not heard from Bimbo or any other interested acquirer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position has always been we do what's best for the
shareholders, so if someone is interested and wants to talk to us,
we certainly have an open mind to it,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bimbo spokesman Gustavo Solares, in response to an inquiry as to
whether the company was pursuing Interstate, e-mailed a response
that said in part that Bimbo was always looking for opportunities
to grow, including through acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless,'' Solares wrote, ``it is our policy not to
comment on rumors or speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bimbo had sales of about $2.3 billion last year, compared with
about $3.5 billion for Interstate.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said Interstate also normally did not respond to
rumors, but issued its statement after receiving a call from the
stock exchange saying it was going to halt trading unless the
company put out a release.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation sparked heavy trading and sent Interstate's
stock up from its opening price of $15.50 a share to a high of
$18.25 a share. However, after Interstate reported the rumors were
false, the stock fell back to just above its opening price to end
the day at $15.75 a share.
</P>
<P>
   There was some speculation that Bimbo might be talking to
Ralston Purina about buying its Interstate shares, but Sullivan
said that was highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agreement with Ralston precludes them from doing anything
like that,'' Sullivan said. ``If they violated that agreement, the
penalties would be onerous.''

LAZIO IS ASSAILED FOR VOTE ON BILL INCLUDING PAY RAISE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBION, N.Y. _ Fending off another attack on his voting record,
Rep. Rick Lazio on Friday defended his vote to approve a bill that
gave members of Congress a raise and said Hillary Rodham Clinton's
campaign was resorting to ``cynical'' tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, the Clinton campaign and the New York State
Democratic Party lambasted Lazio for throwing his support on
Thursday behind an appropriations bill that included a $4,000 pay
raise, also called a cost-of-living increase, for members of the
House of Representatives, because Lazio, a Long Island congressman,
campaigned against pay raises when he first ran for office in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   During a sweep through western New York for his Senate campaign
that ended in this rural village 50 miles east of Buffalo, Lazio
said several times that he was opposed to pay raises. But he said
he had voted Thursday in support of a budget bill that included the
raise and several other measures after an attempt to remove the
increase from the bill failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have generally opposed the cost-of-living increases for
House members,'' Lazio said, adding, ``I don't recall that I've
ever voted for one, to the best of my recollection. And that's
consistent with my past record.''
</P>
<P>
   But Howard Wolfson, Clinton's spokesman, and Judith Hope,
chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, cited news reports that
Lazio voted for a pay raise in 1997. Lazio spokesman Dan McLagan
said the campaign was not aware of his supporting a pay increase in
1997, and said he had consistently opposed pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just more double talk from Rick Lazio,'' said Wolfson.
``He ran for Congress against perks, privileges and pay raises but
once he got there he voted twice for pay raises in the dead of
night.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's the worst kind of dog-ate-my-homework excuse
I've ever heard. Why doesn't he just come clean with New Yorkers
and admit that he voted for a pay raise?''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of raises for members of Congress has been such a
traditionally hot topic in campaigns that Congress several years
ago changed the rules to mute it. Under current rules, unless
Congress votes to block a pay raise, members are automatically
given a certain percentage increase in the general Treasury budget,
which is voted on as a part of a huge appropriation bill that
includes financing for much of the government, the IRS, the Secret
Service and other divisions. There is no specific language in the
appropriations bill for the Treasury that gives Congress the pay
raise; it is drawn from those general revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's votes, the first vote involved a procedural
motion that could have opened a way for opponents of the increase
to block it. But that motion was defeated, 250-173, with Lazio
among those voting to block it. That vote effectively halted
efforts to defeat the pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   The two subsequent votes pertained specifically to the Treasury
appropriations bill, and on those Lazio voted yes each time, and
the appropriation was approved.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio campaign then criticized Clinton, saying she did not
understand the legislative process if she believed that Lazio
should have voted against the Treasury bill, which included
financing for things like child care for federal employees. And it
noted that her husband, President Clinton, has signed several pay
raises for federal employees into law.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the second day in a row that Lazio's voting record
was the subject of sharp exchanges between the two campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton lashed out at Lazio for trying to kill and
then scaling back a program to help first-time home buyers secure
mortgages in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Lazio suggested several times during stops in
Buffalo, Niagara Falls and Albion that the Clinton campaign
appeared to be desperate for dirt on him.
</P>
<P>
   During a morning radio program on WLVO-AM in Buffalo, Lazio
said, ``I understand what the opposition is trying to do. They've
made a decision. They can't win this race by staying positive or
being honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at Kafana's Coffee Shop in Albion, he told a small crowd,
``This campaign will be about taking the high road. I'm not going
to sink down. We're not going there.''

CHENEY EMERGES AS TOP CANDIDATE TO BE BUSH'S RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for inserts in 4th, 10th and 11th grafs.)   
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary who is
heading Gov. George W. Bush's search for a vice presidential
nominee, has emerged as a leading contender for the job, changing
his voter registration Friday to make his selection possible,
Republicans close to the governor said Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not expected to announce his final decision for several
days, and one Republican cautioned that he still planned to do some
thinking over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans close to Bush said that Cheney, whose wealth of
government experience includes a stint as White House chief of
staff under President Ford and a long career as a congressman from
Wyoming, had become a top choice of the governor's in recent days.
They said that his change of registration from Texas to Wyoming was
needed to pave the way for his likely, though still not assured,
selection.
</P>
<P>
   The registration switch, which Cheney carried out Friday, so he
could vote in Wyoming, was designed to avoid problems under the
12th Amendment to the Constitution. That provision forbids
Electoral College voters to choose candidates from their state as
both president and vice president. Property records from 1999 show
that Cheney has a home in Casper, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican close to Bush said the former defense secretary
was now the leading candidate, though he cautioned that Bush still
had not come to a final decision. Another Republican familiar with
the governor's thinking said Cheney was among the few finalists.
Yet another Republican, who is close to the former defense
secretary, said, ``Bush really, really, really likes Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign did not offer confirmation, but did nothing to
dampen the speculation about Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told
reporters at his Texas ranch Friday that he was going to think
``long and hard'' at the ranch this weekend and review the options
that had been carefully prepared by Cheney himself. By the end of
the weekend, Bush said, ``I'll be a lot closer to the decision.''
He said, ``The days of speculation are over.''
</P>
<P>
   His aides said the announcement would come next week, possibly
as early as Monday, a week before the opening of the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Other names that have figured prominently in the speculation
include Govs. Frank Keating of Oklahoma and George Pataki of New
York; Rep. John Kasich of Ohio; and Sens. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska,
John McCain of Arizona, and Bill Frist and Fred Thompson, both of
Tennessee. Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania was also under
consideration, but his stance in favor of abortion rights had
caused his star to dim in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush announced this spring that Cheney, who was his
father's defense secretary, would lead his search, he praised
Cheney, an executive at the Dallas-based Halliburton Co., an energy
company, and said that his role would not preclude him from being
considered for the No. 2 job himself. ``I trust Dick Cheney's
judgment; I know his character,'' Bush said. ``It's obviously an
important decision for me and I can't think of a better person to
work with on making that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans said Cheney, 59, had repeatedly insisted
he did not want the job. In recent weeks, however, as Keating had
looked as if he was emerging as Bush's favorite, prominent
Republicans began lobbying Bush for Cheney. Many of them felt that
Keating was too conservative and not impressive enough to win over
independent and swing voters. And several Republican Party
officials pressed Cheney to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   He initially fretted about his health, they said _ he has
suffered three mild heart attacks and has had bypass surgery _ but
did not say no. And he slowly warmed to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge movement for this,'' one Republican said,
``and it started several weeks ago. This did not come out of the
blue.'' A Republican familiar with the conversations said Bush's
father has also been an active advocate for Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Though his health could become an issue, one Republican familiar
with the past few days' events said the Bush campaign had checked
on Cheney's medical records and health with the doctor who
performed the heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 House Republicans petitioned Bush Friday on McCain's
behalf, and Ridge, Republicans said, implored McCain to reconsider
in a telephone conversation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An associate of McCain's said the senator told Ridge that he
would prefer not to be asked but would accept the vice presidency
if offered it by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, said Friday, ``I don't believe anything has
changed'' since he told Bush in May that he did not want to be
considered for the ticket. And Bush gave no indication he would be
influenced by the pressure from House Republicans. He said simply
that he was sure that McCain would be a ``loyal soldier for my
candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Like McCain, Cheney would bring a wealth of experience in
national security to the ticket. He was a strategist of the Persian
Gulf war as defense secretary under Bush's father. He has good
relation with Republicans in Congress, where he was a party whip,
and he has served in the White House, as chief of staff to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike McCain, he has no further political ambitions of his
own, Republicans said, and would be devoted solely to the Bush
presidency.

BRITISH COMPANY LITTLE-KNOWN LOCALLY HAS BECOME SIZABLE AREA

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Days before the April layoffs of 1,300 union
workers by Associated Wholesale Grocers Inc., Teamsters leaders met
privately with executives of a British company in hopes of averting
a showdown with the Kansas City, Mo., food wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   Although the meeting didn't prevent the layoffs in Kansas City,
Kan., and Springfield, Mo., it helped lay the groundwork for the
union's current working relationship with Elite Logistics, a
company owned by the North American arm of the British company,
Tibbett &AMP; Britten Group plc.
</P>
<P>
   Elite Logistics was one of four companies Associated had
contracted with to take over running its distribution centers April
2 _ provided Associated and the union didn't reach a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters officers came away from the late-March meetings
convinced they could reach an agreement with Tibbett &AMP; Britten if
its Elite Logistics alone took over all of Associated's operations
in Springfield and Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen in April, and a bitter two-month battle
ensued between Associated and the 1,300 employees who contended
they were locked out. But following a May ruling by the National
Labor Relations Board that was favorable to the union, Associated
in June agreed to outsource all its operations in the two cities to
one company _ Elite Logistics.
</P>
<P>
   Elite Logistics, in turn, returned Associated's union employees
to their jobs and agreed to an eight-year contract with the
Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Tibbett &AMP; Britten has become a sizable area
employer. About 680 people work for the company at Associated's
warehouse in Kansas City, Kan., under the name Elite Logistics.
</P>
<P>
   Although little-known locally, Tibbett &AMP; Britten is becoming a
prominent player in the logistics business nationwide. It provides
warehousing and transportation services in the food and retail
industries, and entered North America in 1989 in Canada with about
35 employees, said Mike Sprague, president of Tibbett &AMP; Britten
North American Group in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   After establishing a Canadian presence, Tibbett &AMP; Britten moved
into the United States in 1995, and gained contracts with companies
such as Kroger Co., Safeway Inc. and Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague said Tibbett &AMP; Britten has about 30 different contracts
in the United States and has its biggest operations in California
and Texas. The North American Group has about 12,000 employees and
last year posted sales of about $630 million, one-third of the
entire company's annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   While Sprague directs the overall strategy of North American
operations from Toronto, he said the various units, such as Elite
Logistics, are relatively autonomous.
</P>
<P>
   Each member-company, as Tibbett &AMP; Britten calls its units, has
its own name. In Nashville, Tenn., for example, Tibbett &AMP; Britten
operates Galaxy Logistics, which handles food distribution for
Kroger. In the Dallas area, Southstar Logistics has a contract with
Kroger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all these member-companies focus on the local
community and the local customers,'' Sprague said. ``Each
member-company has its business partner. The member-companies may
exchange ideas, but they run themselves and make the day-to-day
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping its entities locally based is a strategy that has worked
for Tibbett &AMP; Britten. Although Tibbett &AMP; Britten has lost a few
contracts that were not renewed, Sprague said that was because of
ownership changes that led the partners to move in other
directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been thrown out due to bad performance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Tibbett &AMP; Britten apparently has a pretty fair
reputation among union workforces. After talking with union
counterparts in other parts of the country, Teamsters leaders in
Kansas City, Mo., and Springfield were agreeable to seeking a new
contract with Tibbett &AMP; Britten instead of Associated.
</P>
<P>
   While Associated had been prodding the Teamsters for ways to
reduce labor costs in a new contract, Tibbett &AMP; Britten came up
with an eight-year deal that provided wage increases and pension
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people we've dealt with at the top have been reliable,
straightforward and fair to deal with,'' said Jim Kabell, business
manager with Teamsters Local 245 in Springfield. ``Does that mean
we'll never have a fight with them? No, but there's a different
attitude from in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, problems have surfaced with Elite Logistics in the first
six weeks as sole operator of Associated's warehouses in
Springfield and Kansas City, Kan. The company laid off 19 workers
in Springfield after that division lost a big customer during
Associated's dispute with the Teamsters. A worker in the Kansas
City, Kan., warehouse died earlier this month in a forklift
accident. The company has declined to comment on details of the
accident during its investigation and an inquiry by federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In union relations, Tibbett &AMP; Britten operating Kroger's
warehouse in the Dallas area has been beneficial for members of
Teamsters Local 745.
</P>
<P>
   After rejecting the company's first proposal, the 250-member
workforce ratified the second contract by a 2-1 margin in 1998,
said Randy Thorn, Local 745 business agent. The agreement
eventually eliminates a two-tier wage system that Kroger had
obtained from the union in 1987, Thorn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overall relationship, compared to Kroger, I feel like it's
better,'' said Thorn, who worked in Kroger's warehouse for 17 years
before taking the union position. ``You may have people working in
the warehouse who feel differently. But Tibbett &AMP; Britten has done
a lot of things for our people that Kroger never would have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Tibbett &AMP; Britten's labor relations have been as
smooth. Last year, about 325 members of a Teamsters local in
Nashville struck Galaxy Logistics for six weeks before a settlement
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   However, Teamsters leaders made no allegations in the Nashville
media that Tibbett &AMP; Britten was attempting to break the union. And
both sides reportedly were satisfied with the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Clete Daniel, a professor of labor history at Cornell
University, said Tibbett &AMP; Britten's roots in Canada and the United
Kingdom probably make its management culture more accommodating to
organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadian transportation companies are more amenable to unions
than transportation companies in the U.S.,'' Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague said about 50 percent of Tibbett &AMP; Britten's workforce
in North America is unionized. However, the company doesn't
distinguish between union and nonunion, he said, just as it tries
not to separate its Canadian and U.S. businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat team members like team members, whether they're union
or not,'' Sprague said. ``We work pretty well with most unions. But
if a group of workers chooses not to be union, that's fine, too.''

EPA ADMITS SHELVING REPORT ABOUT ASBESTOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct administration to administrator in 10th graf.)  
 By MICHAEL MOSS and ADRIANNE APPEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is investigating why its own
officials ignored evidence for 18 years that W.R. Grace and Co. had
used ore laden with asbestos in an array of building products.
</P>
<P>
   An agency study in 1982 found alarming levels of asbestos in ore
that Grace had said included harmless amounts of the material,
which can cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency shelved the report, scuttled follow-up studies
and continued to accept the company's lower figures, EPA officials
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed Grace, a maker of specialty chemicals and building
materials, largely to avoid government scrutiny and use the ore in
products, like fireproofing, that the company promoted as a safe
alternative at a time of growing anxiety about asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The widely used fireproofing materials, as well as attic
insulation and other products, remain in thousands of homes and
offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the health risks are unclear, because it is not known how
much asbestos may be present in the products. Grace said it tried
to remove as much asbestos as possible during processing. EPA
officials are advising homeowners to call the agency for more
information if they are concerned that they may have the company's
loose-fill insulation, known as Zonolite, in their attic.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, EPA officials said this week, an agency official
misrepresented the report in 1983 and downplayed its findings in
responding to congressional inquiries about the level of asbestos
in the ore.
</P>
<P>
   The report resurfaced after the EPA began an investigation in
December into a health crisis in Libby, Mont., where Grace mined
the ore, known as vermiculite, until 1990. Workers and town
residents are dying from lung disease at rates far above the
national average. Agency officials are poring through thousands of
documents to figure out why the government failed to properly
oversee the mining operation and why EPA officials didn't follow up
their report.
</P>
<P>
   The report, letters and other records have been sent to the EPA
inspector general, who plans to begin an inquiry on Monday, agency
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't ask our inspector general to do an investigation
lightly,'' said Steve Johnson, deputy assistant administrator of
the office of prevention, pesticides and toxic substances. ``We
want to know precisely what did happen. With regard to W.R. Grace,
more and more information seems to be uncovered that raises
questions about what they knew and what they didn't know and what
they released and didn't release to us, and it's entirely possible
that information may come out through this investigation that may
show they have done something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials said this week that they had uncovered Grace
documents that show high levels of asbestos in the ore. Paul
Peronard, head of an EPA team trying to clean up the Montana mine
site, said, ``It doesn't appear to me that the data contained in
the documents were shared with anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace officials Friday did not dispute the EPA report, but said
their own studies had consistently shown much smaller amounts of
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our results from measuring the ore do not find the same thing
that EPA's results do,'' said William Corcoran, vice president of
public and regulatory affairs for Grace, which is in Columbia, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the mining operation were touched off by
newspaper articles last fall on the health problems of Libby
workers and residents. Lawsuits that they have filed accuse Grace
of covering up the hazards posed by the mining operation.
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran said, ``We don't believe we've ever covered them up. We
know people have been hurt.'' He added that Grace's preference is
to continue trying to settle the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The ore went into insulation that Grace began selling in the
early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   At issue now is how much asbestos _ in a form known as tremolite
_ made its way into those products as a contaminant. A growing body
of medical evidence has raised concern among doctors about this
lesser known form of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tremolite is one of the most dangerous fibers,'' said Dr.
Jacqueline Moline, an occupational and environmental health
specialist at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   At processing plants throughout the country, Grace had sought to
remove most of the asbestos from the vermiculite in its Zonolite
line of products, which included a popular loose attic insulation
that Grace sold until 1984 and is believed to still be in as many
as 1 million homes. Some asbestos remained in the insulation, but
Grace did not warn consumers, The Boston Globe reported earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has maintained that its products contain only trace
amounts of asbestos _ far below the 1 percent level at which the
EPA restricts its use.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer concern over the insulation has raised another issue
that is confounding government officials: how best to measure
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners who are having their insulation tested for
contamination are getting widely varying results _ from ``traces''
to 2 percent asbestos, said Wayne Toland, the EPA asbestos
coordinator in Boston. One test turned up 5 percent. ``The results
are not necessarily consistent,'' Toland said. ``The method being
employed varied and so did the results.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that testing laboratories are
unfamiliar with vermiculite and tremolite and do not know how to
properly prepare the samples. He said his office has hired an
asbestos expert, Eric J. Chatfield, of Chatfield Technical
Consulting, Mississauga, Ontario, to develop a standard procedure
for preparing the test sample.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Peronard said he also is working to develop new
methods of testing vermiculite for asbestos, since the common
techniques are designed to detect asbestos at quantities of 20
percent or more _ huge by today's standards, where 1 percent or
less may be cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it at the wrong angle, you won't see the
fibers,'' Peronard said. ``We obviously have the fear that we're
under-counting and under-reporting the asbestos content of
samples.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace has written to the agency questioning the need for new
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA does have methods for determining what is asbestos
content, which have been peer reviewed and scientifically accepted
for years and years,'' Corcoran said, ``so we are trying to get
some understanding of why, if those methods are good enough for
every other situation, why are they not good enough for this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Yang, who while working as a scientist for Grace designed
the company's asbestos laboratory techniques, said in a recent
interview that she had developed her own method of measuring
asbestos fibers. She said she thus avoided counting things that
looked like fibers but were not, like the edges of platelets. As a
consequence, she said she came up with results that were typically
50 percent less than the methods suggested by regulatory
authorities would have produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used a modified technique,'' Yang said.
</P>
<P>
   Because she was convinced the ore had minimal amounts of
asbestos, Yang said she rarely checked the levels in Grace's
products, maybe once or twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   The 1982 EPA study was triggered by an earlier outbreak of
health problems among workers at a Marysville, Ohio, plant where
vermiculite from Grace's Montana mine was used in making
fertilizer. A federal inquiry in 1978 found that four workers
suffered from bloody lungs. X-rays showed that one in four workers
had lung abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   In late October 1980, Thomas Dixon, an EPA analyst who then
worked in the toxicology branch, went to Montana to gather samples
of Grace's vermiculite ore. With an early winter storm threatening,
Dixon recalled that he and the agency's consultants rushed over the
next five days to collect dozens of scrapings from the mine and an
adjoining cleaning plant, which were then shipped to a laboratory
for testing.
</P>
<P>
   They found between 21 percent and 26 percent asbestos in the raw
ore, and up to 7 percent in the cleaned form that was shipped to
plants for further processing. The five grades of cleaned ore they
tested ranged for the most part between 2 percent and 7 percent,
with only one category falling below the EPA's regulatory threshold
of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Grace has maintained over the years that far less
amounts of the cancer-causing substance contaminated its ore. For
instance, in a 1986 letter to the EPA in which Grace argued for an
exemption from proposed rules to label products that have asbestos,
the company said its Montana ore was sullied by only 4 percent to 6
percent asbestos coming out of the mine, and less than 0.5 percent
on average when cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   EPA staff became anxious for their own safety. A Grace official
described in a memorandum how he received a call on May 20, 1982,
from a Denver EPA employee who ``had just heard that vermiculite
may be contaminated with asbestos. The EPA uses vermiculite to pack
samples for shipments to laboratories for analysis. I spoke to him
for a few minutes because he was so upset and I did not want to
transfer him without calming him down. They dump half a bag of
vermiculite into a shipping carton two or three times a day. I told
him that the exposures would undoubtedly be low if good ventilation
was provided and that the respirator he indicated they were using
would provide additional protection.''
</P>
<P>
   But the EPA never carried out its plans to follow up on its mine
study by examining the Grace material at its processing plants. Nor
did it test the consumer products made with the ore as planned,
agency officials said. Agency staff say they moved on to pressing
health matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priority dropped and we were off on other things, like
looking at dioxin for the first time,'' said Martin Halper, a
former toxicology division chief.
</P>
<P>
   The report surfaced briefly in 1983 when the late Peter Rodino
and another member of Congress forwarded to EPA a letter from a
Grace competitor in the fireproofing business who asked: ``Why did
EPA embark on such an extensive project collecting, analyzing and
characterizing vermiculite samples for asbestos contamination and
then suddenly choose both to simply drop its intended second, and
more critical, phase of the project.''
</P>
<P>
   The response came from an acting assistant administrator for
pesticides and toxic substances, who, according to Peronard,
wrongly cited a table of data in the study as indicating the
asbestos fell below 1 percent. ``He mixed it up,'' Peronard said.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ George W. Bush left Yale University in the spring of
1968 with a diploma in hand, but no plans on what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   So for five years, not unlike many young men his age, he
drifted.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in three states, had at least seven apartments and at
least that many girlfriends, held three full-time jobs _ one in
business, one in politics and one in public service _ and learned
to fly fighter jets with the Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who, the minute they get out of college,
know exactly what they want to do,'' Bush said in a recent
interview about what he calls his nomadic years. ``I did not. And
it didn't bother me. That's just the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   These youthful years, in which the candidate concedes he was
trying to find himself, also contain the gray areas of his
biography: periods of unemployment and a hiatus of at least six
months in his National Guard obligations while he worked on a
political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This was also a period in which Bush has seemed to acknowledge
having tried drugs. Although he has steadfastly refused to answer
directly whether he used marijuana, cocaine or other illegal drugs,
he said last August that he could have passed a 15-year FBI
background check when his father became president, apparently
ruling out drug use since 1974, but not before then.
</P>
<P>
   Of those preceding years, he stood on an earlier answer: ``When
I was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   But in dozens of interviews conducted over several months,
friends, former girlfriends, neighbors and roommates said they did
not recall seeing any signs of drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the interviews and an examination of National Guard
records create a complicated and sometimes contradictory portrait
of Bush at that time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sometimes seemed to inhabit two distinctly different social
worlds, joining poolside parties on some nights and attending
formal country club dances on others.
</P>
<P>
   He spent more than a year learning to fly supersonic military
jets, becoming, by most accounts, among the best in his squadron.
Yet he gave up flying _ and failed to show up for alternative
military duty as he had promised _ for months on end to work on the
hopeless campaign of a political neophyte running against one of
the most powerful men on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   He counted among his friends people who today say they smoked
marijuana back then, and acquaintances say they saw him at a
popular night club where pot was sometimes smoked on the premises.
(Bush says he does not recall going there.) Yet dozens of people
who knew him well described him as a conservative young man who
preferred to party with beer. These friends professed to be utterly
baffled by the questions of drug use that have cropped up during
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He went for months without a steady job, and the jobs he held
all came from associates of his father. And he seemed to inhabit a
series of cheaper, less desirable apartments in Houston, a city
that was beginning to boom on oil money. Yet friends and
acquaintances recalled Bush as a stable, outgoing, hard-working,
unpretentious, idealistic young man who cherished his family and
was simply trying to figure out how to make his own way in the
world, something he would do a few years later as he started his
own business and ran for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Just before leaving Yale, Bush was accepted into the Texas Air
National Guard, thanks largely to the prominence of his family.
After a summer of basic training, he spent two years on active duty
learning to fly, first in Georgia and later at Ellington Air Force
Base, near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Munson, who met him at a poolside rice-and-beans party she
held in 1970 and dated him off and on for several years, recalled
that he was very good at arguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was conservative, and he hung around with people who were
more liberal,'' Munson said. ``Most of George's friends were the
type who would sit on the floor with torn jeans and T-shirts. They
were people who were well educated and interested in making the
world better.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman who dated Bush at the time remembered him as
``very nice, very straight. There was a little tension between the
two of us. I was `little miss liberal.' He was more conventional
than people I knew.'' The woman, a former beauty queen who is now a
lawyer living outside Texas, asked that her name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of counterculture stuff going on,'' she said,
but ``I've been mystified by the rumors about drugs. He wasn't
using drugs. I thought he was about the straightest person I knew.
He was straight in a refreshing way. He had a very good sense of
humor. He had an edge, an energy, charisma. He could be wild and go
to a party and drink a lot, but he was a very conventional college
guy. He could have been a college guy from the early '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Gow, a colleague of Bush's father, who hired young
George W. in early 1971 to work at his agricultural and
horticultural conglomerate, Stratford of Houston, remembered him as
``a presentable, attractive young college student.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard all this about a wild youth, but I never saw it,''
he said. ``He was wearing a Brooks Brothers suit. He showed up on
time and worked well past five, as we all did.'' Bush was assigned
to research small nurseries that Gow hoped to acquire, a job that
occasionally took him to Central America. His new boss had been an
executive at the elder Bush's Zapata Oil Co. and a guest at the
Bush home over the years. He gave his young employee a friendly
ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``George liked to talk,'' Gow said. ``He was searching for what
to do. He was constantly wanting to talk about what to do with his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston itself was poised for a boom. The 1970s would bring 200
corporations and a flood of newcomers that reached 6,000 a month.
As Houston expanded to cover 450 square miles, anything but zoning
and mass transit seemed possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big change from what I knew in New England,'' Gow
recalled. ``One time, possibly at the Bushes', I went to a dinner
party where one man was talking about walking on the moon. Another
transplanted hearts. Another was digging for gold in Guyana. George
and I were talking about drilling for oil at the bottom of the
ocean. My father thought everybody in Texas must be mad.''
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam continued to rage. But to the affluent of
Houston, it could seem far away. ``There was only one country they
were concerned about,'' observed Bob Roy, who supplied fine wines
to Houston's country clubs. ``That country was France.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the raw southwestern edge of Houston in the early 1970s, just
after the glittering Galleria shopping complex opened, the Chateau
Dijon apartments were the place to live if you were young,
ambitious and well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   The complex on Beverly Hill street included a mock French
chateau and a web of 300 semitropical garden apartments connected
by walkways and set among oak trees and swimming pools. One tenant
rented an extra apartment for his wine collection. Another, an
inventor, used his apartment as a lab.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush called it home.
</P>
<P>
   The developer built the Chateau Dijon to be beautiful and
comfortable and hired Mildred Alexander, a formidable widow with
high-society credentials, as the manager who could keep it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew everybody's family,'' recalled Robert Sakowitz, the
department store heir. ``If you made too much noise, she'd let you
know. It was a bit like a dormitory; it had that kind of feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   John W. Link, who lived in the apartments after law school,
said, ``You could literally have a whole social life without going
outside the Chateau Dijon. You would date different people, and
there were groups inside of groups. The guys would have contests:
This week, we'll date from only this side of the street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston was on the edge of the sexual revolution,'' Link
recalled. ``It got here, but it didn't quite get here. We were not
L.A., not New York. We were all young, trying to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Former neighbors at the Chateau remembered the youthful Bush as
a ``regular guy'' who did not try to capitalize on his family name.
But the Bush name was hard to miss. In the fall of 1970, his father
ran for the Senate against the father of another Chateau resident,
Lloyd M. Bentsen III, a member of a powerful and wealthy Texas
family. Bush worked in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Bush banners stretched across the street,'' remembered
Louis Atlas, a neighbor. ``We had banners on our cars. The girls
wore Bush scarves.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bush smiled as he recalled his days at the
Chateau Dijon. ``I'm a person who makes friends easily,'' he said.
``It didn't matter whether I'd grown up there and gone to the
University of Texas. There were University of Texas people there
and a lot of other people. My wife-to-be was living in the
apartments, although I didn't know her. She was at the other end _I
was at the sedate end, of course. But we had fun. We had a lot of
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us had jobs,'' he added. ``It wasn't a bunch of people
hanging around.'' He didn't remember attending the banana daiquiri
parties for which two of his friends were famous. ``That was a
little sophisticated for me,'' he said. ``I might have been more
willing to drink beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the residents of the Chateau, including Bush, belonged
to a social club that was a far cry from beer parties in someone's
apartment. It was the Master's Club, an elite group of about 100
bachelors that held formal dances at local country clubs, allowing
its members to keep a toehold in the comfortable, exclusive world
in which most of them were raised.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Woodson, the club's organizer and now a Houston real estate
executive, got the idea for the name from the golf tournament. The
club's parties, he said, offered ``a controlled atmosphere. You
knew who was dancing next to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Munson remembers the less formal side of the future
presidential candidate, the side that cared little about his
appearance, for example. ``George would wear his father's suit
coats when he'd throw them away,'' Munson said. ``They were
obviously his father's suit coats. George wasn't as tall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``George was interested in people,'' Munson said. ``He seemed to
like to sit around and talk about serious things in a fun way. You
didn't get that with most of the guys there. He knew he wanted to
own a baseball team, and he wanted to do politics,'' she said. ``He
wasn't sure how he was going to get to those goals.'
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   After a year of work at Stratford, Bush quit his job in the fall
of 1971 and was unemployed for the next five or six months. In an
interview, he said he spent the time flying with the Air National
Guard. He was 25. His father had given up his seat in Congress and
was living with his mother in New York, serving the Nixon
administration as its U.N. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   But according to his parents, there was never any concern about
what young George was doing with his life.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, former President Bush and his wife,
Barbara, were both asked whether they had worried about their son's
nomadic period. Both dismissed the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't aimless,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``I don't know why they
say that.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``We never worried about it. That's sort of a
fiction-ary thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush echoed the thought. ``I think they must have had
pretty good confidence in their ability to raise children,'' he
said, ``plus they had other children to worry about, too. A
teenager is a heck of a lot harder to raise than a guy who has just
gotten out of college.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he did not ask them for financial support. ``I was
supporting myself,'' he said. ``I wasn't calling them saying, `Hey,
I'm out of money again,' or `Help!' I was making a living.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that hard to get along financially if you don't have
a lot of desires,'' he added, ``and I wasn't spending a lot of
money. I think my friends will tell you I'm a frugal person. I was
not living it up big time.''
</P>
<P>
   By September 1971, Bush had moved from the Chateau Dijon to an
unfurnished one-bedroom garage apartment at 2039{ South Blvd., an
elegant neighborhood near Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Thornton, whose widowed mother, Georgia Corbett, rented
the main house at 2039 South Blvd., said her mother, who was 75
then, liked to sit out on her patio and would banter with Bush, who
``had to walk down her driveway to get to his place.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton also recalled her mother's saying: ``He doesn't seem
lonesome, but you never see him with groups or other people. He's
always alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though his parents profess to have had little concern at
the time, one of his father's friends came forward in May 1972 to
offer him a job. Jimmy Allison, a former newspaper publisher in
Midland, Texas, who had served as the elder Bush's political
adviser, recruited Bush to go to Alabama to join the Senate
campaign of Winton M. Blount, a Republican novice running against a
powerful Democratic incumbent, John J. Sparkman.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Bush described Allison, now dead, as ``an
older figure who served as a mentor in a way, a wonderful friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount, a millionaire contractor known throughout Alabama as
Red, had served three years as President Nixon's postmaster general
but had never run for elective office. After he announced his
intention to run, a newspaper columnist remarked that Blount must
have decided ``it's as good a time as any to go over Niagara in a
barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   Nee Bear, who dated Bush at the time, said she was struck by how
hard Bush worked for Blount.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be a hands-on guy,'' remembered Bear, who first
met Bush while working on the campaign. ``He put bumper stickers on
in the parking lot, and believe me, that is the pits. At that time
in Alabama, people would spit on you if you were a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay Blount Miles, who worked in the office for her father's
campaign, remembered Bush as ``funny and fun to be around. He was
good at keeping the office up. He worked as part of the team. I
never felt he was somebody from the outside coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was an uphill battle. George C. Wallace heaped scorn on
Blount for living in a Montgomery mansion with, as Wallace
exaggerated it, 26 bathrooms. Even Nixon, a fellow Republican, did
not help for fear of angering the powerful Sparkman, even though he
was a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Nixon did not support me,'' Blount recalled.
``Sparkman was a leading senator, and the president needed his
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who monitored the polls, kept the bad news to himself. Not
until Election Day did he warn Devere Mclennan, who worked for him
and shared an apartment with him, what to expect. ``George
explained to me we weren't going to win,'' said Mclennan, who was
expecting a victory.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview 28 years later, Bush remembered the numbers.
``We all teamed together and helped Red get about 36 percent of the
vote,'' he said with a short laugh, ''in spite of the fact that
Nixon had gotten 72 percent of the vote. The ticket-splitting was
phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Bush went to work on the campaign he was still
obligated to serve in the National Guard, and accordingly he sought
a transfer to Alabama. His original request, to serve with the
9921st Air Reserve Squadron in Montgomery, was rejected because the
unit would not meet his military obligation. He requested another
assignment in July, and the Texas Air National Guard recommended
letting him serve with another Montgomery group, the 187th Tactical
Recon Group, during September, October and November 1972.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 15, 1972, the head of personnel for that unit wrote:
``Lieutenant Bush should report to Lt. Col. William Turnipseed,
DCO, to perform equivalent training.''
</P>
<P>
   Controvery over Bush's military service arose in May when The
Boston Globe quoted Turnipseed, who retired as a general, as saying
Bush never appeared for duty.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, the general took a tiny step back,
saying, ``I don't think he did _ but I wouldn't stake my life on
it. I think I would have remembered him. The chances are 99 percent
he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bush disagreed. ``I was there. I know this guy
was quoted as saying I wasn't, but I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily Marks, who worked in the Blount campaign and dated Bush,
said she recalls that he returned to Montgomery after the election
to serve with the Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   National Guard records provided by the Guard and by the Bush
campaign indicate he did serve on Nov. 29, 1972, after the
election. These records also show a gap in service from that time
to the previous May. Bush says he made up for the lost time in
subsequent months, and guard records show he received credit for
having performed all the required service.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Back in Houston, Bush went to live in a four-unit apartment at
2910 Westheimer, a busy east-west artery. His downstairs neighbor,
a florist, had a dog and refused to let the landlord spray
pesticides, Munson recalled, and ``the roaches were just
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nee Bear agreed: ``It was little and dumpy, and there were a lot
of bugs. It wasn't a nice place. He drove a white Cutlass, dirty
laundry, tennis shoes, and everything else in the back of his car _
just like a guy. No Gucci loafers or things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about other women in Bush's life at the time, Bear said:
``Not that summer _ well, I don't know. I spent a good deal of time
with him. Mr. Lothario I never got the idea that he was. Do you get
the impression he's a big romantic? I don't. He never was wolfish.
He was a decent guy. He would never be a kiss-and-tell guy,
never.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1973, Bush went to work for a Houston inner-city
youth program, Professionals United for Leadership for Youth, set
up by the late John L. White, a former pro football playerwho knew
his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``John had a vision of matching off-season athletes with city
kids in the Third Ward, and he wanted me to come work with him,''
Bush said. ``It was 27 years ago, so I don't remember the exact
incident where John and I met each other, but I went down, and it
was a great experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming from the west side of town, and this was in the
inner city. I saw a lot of tragedy, and I saw a lot of goodness. I
saw people who really cared about kids. There are some success
stories out of that program, and there are some horrible failures,
including this one little boy whom he and I had a very close
attachment to, named Jimmy Dean, who's dead, shot on the streets of
Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Bear recalled that Bush ``was trying to get a lot of the
baseball players from the Astros and professional athletes to come
there and show kids there was a way out. He spent time and energy
on those children. He wasn't a dilettante who comes in and says,
`This will look good on my resume.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bear said she never went to a nightclub with Bush. ``We went to
the VFW dance hall in Navasota, Texas, where you saw little old
ladies dancing with each other in their housedresses and listened
to Bob Wills and the Texas Troubadours. He loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during this time that Bush applied to Harvard Business
School, a move for which he now thanks White. ``A friend of mine
sent me the application, and I really didn't seem to be that
interested,'' Bush said. ``And his attitude was: `Well, it's a
great challenge, and you ought to try it.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I filled out the application. I don't remember all of it,
but I got in, and I wasn't really that excited about going. I think
if you look at my full life, I have never been a person _ I haven't
had a game plan. I could put it in the perspective of this race:
I've never said, `Gosh, I'll do this in high school, and then this
will lead to that, and I'll end up being president.' Or, `I will go
to Harvard Business School so I can be president.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is, I don't know what I'm going to do
next, and it doesn't bother me. I do know I'm going to be the
president, at least I think I am. We're about to find out in about
four months. But I don't know what's after that. I truly don't.''

MORALES LOOKS FOR HIS NEXT SIGN 
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Andy Morales gleefully trotted around the bases after
his three-run home run helped the Cuban national team clinch a 12-6
victory over the host Baltimore Orioles last year, and he felt on
top of the baseball world. As it turned it, he said Friday, that
moment turned into a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 40 years of having no professional baseball, to come
here and be the first Cuban player to hit a home run against a
professional team was a tremendous feeling,'' Morales said Friday
at a news conference at a Little Havana restaurant to celebrate his
defection this week. ``But instead of that being a triumph for me,
it turned into a defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving back in Cuba, the third baseman-right fielder said,
Cuban authorities began suggesting that he was going to attempt to
defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made my life impossible,'' he told reporters. ``They
wouldn't let me travel overseas. So it turned out to be a negative
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales, 25, was removed from the national team for having been
seen talking to the California-based agent Gus Dominguez in
Baltimore. Dominguez was by his side on Friday and talking
excitedly about Morales' prospects of becoming a major leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez called Major League Baseball Friday to inquire about
the possibility of conducting a special lottery on Morales' behalf,
as it did in 1991 after the first Cuban defector, Rene Arocha,
arrived in America. All interested teams would participate in the
drawing to gain negotiating rights with him.
</P>
<P>
   But Dominguez said he was told that there was an 80 percent
chance against a lottery being approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to be seen as doing anything special for
anybody,'' he said, adding that there had been interest shown from
``at least five teams,'' including three in the minutes shortly
after it became clear Morales was going to be released in the
custody of his father-in-law, Carlos Castillo.
</P>
<P>
   If Morales, 6 feet 1 inch and 205 pounds, remains in the United
States, he will participate in an amateur draft in 2001. That means
he could negotiate with only the team that drafts him. He could
establish residency in another country, most likely Nicaragua,
Venezuela or Peru, and go to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Morales' decision could be affected by his family
situation. His wife, Daiyana, and their 6-month-old son, Yandy,
have received U.S. approval to immigrate and are now awaiting Cuban
approval to leave.
</P>
<P>
   How good is he? Dominguez's Total Sports International issued
revised statistics from what had been available earlier in the
week. Playing for Havana, he was said to have hit .371 during the
1998-99 season, with 71 runs batted in and 17 home runs. The season
before: .349 with 68 RBI and 12 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees pitcher Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, who called to
congratulate Morales, told his friend and the Dominguez publicist
Rene Guim that Morales was one of the premier all-around third
basemen in Cuban history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to see him in the major leagues one day soon,'' Guim
said Hernandez had told him.
</P>
<P>
   Morales tried to defect in early June, but was one of 31 Cubans
repatriated after they were intercepted at sea. The U.S. policy on
Cubans is clear. Those found at sea are usually returned to Cuba;
those who reach land are not.
</P>
<P>
   He found himself ostracized upon returning and felt he was
virtually forced out of baseball before his next defection try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like nobody wanted me because I was bearing the cross
of having been a defector,'' he said.

`DARK QUESTIONS' RESOLVED, WACO INQUIRY CONCLUDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA and KIT WAGAR  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Answering the ``dark questions'' that have lingered
for seven years, John Danforth said Friday that blame for the
bloodshed in Waco rests entirely with Branch Davidians, not
government agents.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-month probe led by the former Missouri senator also found
no evidence of a government coverup or improper military
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's 149-page interim report exonerates Attorney General
Janet Reno and, he hopes, puts to rest conspiracy theories about
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any open-minded person, any fair-minded person, who
reads this will say, `This is the way it was,' '' Danforth told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   David Koresh and about 80 Davidians died in an inferno following
raids of their compound near Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1993. The
raids, and allegations of a coverup, caused some lawmakers to
demand Reno's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Reno appointed Danforth special counsel to
investigate Waco after revelations that the FBI used tear-gas
rockets that could have sparked a fire, a contradiction of earlier
government claims.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's report concluded that government agents did not set
the fire at Waco or shoot at the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   But the government did not get off entirely. In an interview
with The Kansas City Star, Danforth said the lack of candor about
the pyrotechnic devices contributed to public suspicion about Waco.
</P>
<P>
   He said that deception allowed the media, politicians and
extremists to fuel conspiracy theories and erode public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is that people who want to believe the worst in
government say, `Aha! This is something that is really bad so
everything is suspicious.' The lesson is that government has to be
open,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Danforth's report indicated that skepticism remains
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Klayman, chairman and general counsel of the conservative
legal group Judicial Watch, said he wasn't surprised. He said his
group, which is suing the Justice Department to get access to
documents involving the Waco standoff, will continue its
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet Reno knew what she was getting when she appointed
Danforth,'' Klayman said. ``Danforth is establishment and we expect
him to scratch the back of the establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Klayman said Danforth's sweeping exoneration of the agents on
the scene would breed further mistrust of government. To exonerate
the government for actions that left about 80 dead insults the
American people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth would not comment on whether the government exercised
bad judgment at Waco because his research only addressed ``bad
acts.'' He said he did not want to emulate special counsels whose
investigations ``morphed'' into wide ranging topics.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth expects to present a final report by the fall. He said
his investigation of the 51-day siege is about 95 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   The report addresses four major questions: Did federal law
officers shoot into the compound? Did agents start the fire? How
involved was the military? Was there a government coverup?
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found no evidence that FBI agents returned fire
from the Davidians. The report stated flashes that occurred around
government vehicles were reflections or ``glint'' from scattered
debris.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews, autopsies, ballistics tests and other evidence
indicates that Davidians who died from gunshot wounds committed
suicide or were killed by other Davidians, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also placed blame for the deadly fire on the
Davidians. The report describes conversations among Davidians
picked up by government listening devices within the compound.
Several discussions involved ways to pour fuel and start a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did find evidence that an FBI agent fired three
pyrotechnic tear-gas rounds. But the report states that the rounds
were fired at an outbuilding that was under construction 75 feet
from the Davidian complex.
</P>
<P>
   They could not have ignited the fire because the bounced off the
building and they were launched about four hours before the fire
erupted, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's report was the second time in a week that the
government was cleared of wrong-doing at the Davidians' Mt. Carmel
complex.
</P>
<P>
   A five-member jury in Waco decided July 14 that federal agents
were not responsible for the Davidians' deaths. The jury's ruling
was only advisory, but both sides expect a U.S. District judge to
hold the government blameless when he issues a final ruling.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh was heartened by the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple truth, as the FBI has maintained since April 19,
1993, has been unmistakingly confirmed again today _ the FBI fired
no shots on that day and the Davidians started the fire that
ultimately engulfed the compound,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the military's involvement, the report found that armed
forces ``conducted themselves properly and commendably,'' by
providing reconnaissance, training and medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found no evidence that Reno intentionally
covered up the use of the three pyrotechnic rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any misstatement that (Reno) made was inadvertent and occurred
after diligent efforts on her part to learn the truth,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Danforth harshly criticized several Justice Department
lawyers and FBI agents for concealing the use of pyrotechnic
devices, even though the rounds caused no harm.
</P>
<P>
   He said repeated denials by the FBI and the Justice Department
from 1993 until last year seriously undermined the government's
credibility. The report noted that the last page of a key FBI lab
report was omitted from the information turned over to
congressional investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The missing page showed that the FBI had used pyrotechnic tear
gas canisters, which can spark a fire under certain conditions.
Reno, in granting the order to storm the Davidians' compound, had
ordered the FBI not to use such propellants because of the risk of
fire.
</P>
<P>
   An internal Justice Department report was at best misleading
when it said tear gas delivery systems were ``completely
nonincendiary,'' the report said. Testimony to Congress was
similarly suspect, it said.
</P>
<P>
   And during preparation for a criminal trial against surviving
Davidians, prosecutors falsely told defense attorneys that they had
no evidence that government agents used pyrotechnic rounds. They
made the statement despite agents' reports that such rockets were
used, the report said. {MORE}
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ ...report said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth wrote that those actions were reprehensible because
they undermined public confidence. Lawyers in private practice
might skirt the truth, but that is not acceptable for the
government, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government lawyers have responsibilities beyond winning the
cases at hand...,'' he wrote. ``Government lawyers carry on their
shoulders responsibility for not only the prosecution of specific
cases, but also for public confidence in our system of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, who has the power of prosecution, said he does not
expect to charge the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caddell, a Houston attorney who represents most of the
families of people who died, said several of Danforth's conclusions
echoed his own. But he said he was bothered that Danforth decided
not to pursue criminal charges against those who lied.
</P>
<P>
   ``That cannot help but add to the impression that a double
standard exists for government misconduct,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, an ordained Episcopal priest, said he saw his Waco
investigation as part of a higher crusade to restore public
confidence in government. He called it ``the most important work
I've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said his conclusions are unanimously shared by the
team's 16 attorneys and 38 investigators. Danforth's team, based in
St. Louis, sifted through more than 2 million pages of documents
and interviewed almost 900 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt, whatsoever, in my mind as to these
conclusions. This is not a close call,'' Danforth said. ``These
`dark questions' have been answered with total certainty.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Jack Danforth for vice president?
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that the former senator from Missouri was back
on Texas Gov. George W. Bush's short list of potential running
mates was the subject of another frantic round of political
speculation Friday _ at least in Danforth's home state.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney emerged
as a leading contender after switching his voter registration from
Texas to Wyoming, which removed a constitutional impediment to his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth himself has fueled much of the buzz based on what he's
said. And not said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday in St. Louis to release his
preliminary report on the government's assault on the Branch
Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, Danforth parried question after
question about his interest in the vice presidency with some
version of ``no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he didn't deny that he might be interested.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Kansas City Star, Danforth said he
didn't think the Waco briefing was the right venue to discuss his
political prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to talk about it,'' Danforth said, obviously
tired of the questions. ``This is a different subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's non-answers weren't the only thing fueling the talk.
The Republican's decision to release the report Friday _ instead of
in the fall when the report was expected _ gave rise to scuttlebutt
that Danforth was clearing the decks so that he would be available
to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Thursday night by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch whether
he would ``unequivocally'' state that he would not be the vice
presidential candidate, Danforth said through a spokeswoman that
there was ``no answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday in Washington, however, much of the running-mate
speculation focused on others: Arizona's Sen. John McCain, who this
week indicated an interest in the office; Cheney, who is in charge
of Bush's vice presidential search; and Oklahoma Gov. Frank
Keating, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's name didn't even appear in some national news
organizations' vice presidential roundup stories, although GOP
strategist Rich Galen said he was hearing a lot of talk about
Danforth in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of only three people being mentioned,'' Galen
insisted. ``It's Danforth, McCain and Keating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign wasn't commenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has asked his campaign staff to not enter into
speculation,'' said Tucker Eskew, a Bush spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   So the amount of Danforth talk grounded in fact and in idle
media speculation remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop the speculation, particularly among
Missouri Republicans who stand to gain if a favorite son is on the
national ticket. The party is engaged in competitive races with
Democrats up and down the ballot this year, including the John
Ashcroft-Mel Carnahan Senate race and the Jim Talent-Bob Holden
race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would likely sprain my back doing cartwheels'' if Danforth
was picked, said John Hancock, executive director of the Missouri
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Others said Danforth almost certainly would serve if Bush asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed that if Governor Bush called him up and
said, `I need you to do this,' that he would do it,'' said Talent
of Chesterfield, Mo., a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's name first surfaced in May when Time magazine
reported that the Missourian, a lawyer who left public office in
1995 after three terms in the Senate, was on Bush's short list.
</P>
<P>
   ``What name does Bush return to in his private ruminations?''
the magazine asked. ``Danforth.''
</P>
<P>
   But in mid-June, Danforth, 63, publicly backed away, saying that
running for national office would take too much from his personal
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with politics, particularly at that level, is that
it crowds out everything else,'' Danforth told The Star on June 13.
``I just think it would have bumped everything else, and I didn't
want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the wishes of Danforth's wife, Sally. Ann
Wagner, chairwoman of the Missouri GOP, said Friday that Sally
Danforth no longer objected to her husband running for the office.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Danforth would bring considerable dignity to the
ticket. The integrity of Danforth, an Episcopal priest, is
unchallenged and he earned bipartisan respect for his willingness
to work with members of both parties. He is an abortion opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth was re-elected for the last time in 1988 with 68
percent support, and his selection would go a long way toward
assuring that Missouri's 11 Electoral College votes swung
Republican. A recent poll The Star commissioned gave Bush an
11-point lead over Gore in Missouri, although Democrats are
confident of narrowing that gap.
</P>
<P>
   On the down side, Republicans would have to contend with
lingering resentment from women stemming from Danforth's unwavering
defense of Clarence Thomas in 1991 in the wake of Anita Hill's
allegations. Others suggested that Danforth had so much stature
that he might outshine Bush in a side-by-side comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Danforth was picked,'' said Missouri Democratic Party
executive director Roy Temple, ``at least we would know that Bush
would have adult supervision.''  &LR; tag1:The Star's Oscar Avila
