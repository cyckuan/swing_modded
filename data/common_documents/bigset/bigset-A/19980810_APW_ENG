winning streak.
	   Dan Serafini (5-4) limited the Orioles to two runs in six
innings, and Rick Aguilera pitched the ninth for his 28th save.

10 hospitalized in Japan after drinking suspect green tea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ten employees of a wood preservative company in
northwestern Japan were hospitalized Monday when they complained of
nausea and other symptoms after drinking green tea made with water
from a communal hot pot, officials said.
	   Preliminary tests by police investigators showed traces of
cyanide in the hot pot water and victims' vomit samples, Kyodo News
reported.
	   A police spokesman with the Niigata prefectural, or state,
police could not confirm the report, however, saying an
investigation was still under way.
	   The sickening comes just two weeks after four people in Japan
died from eating arsenic and cyanide-laced curried rice.
	   Emergency medical authorities received a call at 8:01 a.m.
Monday (2301 GMT Sunday) from a branch office of Xyence Co.,
located near the city of Niigata, said Toshihide Watanabe, a
spokesman for the Niigata municipal fire department.
	   Ten of the 13 employees in the office were rushed to local
hospitals for treatment of nausea, dizziness and numbness after
drinking the hot tea, Watanabe said.
	   Niigata, on the Japan Sea coast, is 256 kilometers (159 miles)
northwest of Tokyo. The curry poisonings occurred in Wakayama, a
small coastal city 453 kilometers (283 miles) southwest of Tokyo.

During troubled times, oil-rich Brunei installs future ruler
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ceremony held, color, details &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos planned
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ A wide-eyed, 24-year-old with
a passion for snooker and Bon Jovi was installed Monday as heir to
one of the world's richest monarchies.
	   Amid Islamic prayers and booming guns, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah
passed on a jeweled Malay dagger to his eldest son, Prince
Al-Muhtadee Billah, making him rightful heir of the throne held by
the family for more than 500 years.
	   The prince, dressed in an ornate gold-embroidered jacket and
wearing a gold crown, looked solemn throughout the hourlong
ceremony before 4,000 guests. The huge palace hall, its walls
painted gold, was packed with royal relatives, the who's who of
Brunei society and foreign diplomats.
	   The sultan wore military dress and a sword at his belt. On
either side were his two wives in green and pink sequined gowns
reflecting the palace lights.
	   But the royal pomp and pageantry at the 1,788-room palace on the
banks of the Brunei river mask a growing unease in the Southeast
Asian kingdom, which has withstood liberal tides to remain one of
the world's last absolute monarchies.
	   It comes at a time of economic troubles for the oil-soaked
sultanate and amid an embarrassing family feud brought on by the
wayward financial dealings of the sultan's younger brother, Prince
Jefri, who is now in self-imposed exile.
	   Prince Jefri was abruptly removed from the controlling positions
of Brunei's flagship company, Amedeo, after a reported dlrs 16
billion loss. He was stripped of his post as head of the nation's
international investment arm, the Brunei Investment Agency.
	   A spokesman for Jefri recently quoted the estranged prince as
saying conservative forces backed by shadowy foreign advisers from
Iran and Libya were tightening their grip on Brunei. The government
quickly denied it.
	   But the rift appears to be widening, as the sultan, according to
officials, also plans to strip his brother of control over three
large oil wells.
	   ``Everything in Brunei is behind closed doors,'' said Abdul
Latif Chuchu, a former chief of a political party, now banned from
politics for his anti-palace views. ``We don't know what is going
on.''
	   Analysts say economic pains are forcing the royal family to stop
expanding its fleet of Rolls-Royces and Mercedes, its squadron of
private jets and even to quietly sell off some of its prize race
horses.
	   Citizens in Brunei, where officials face jail for disclosing
financial secrets, will likely never know the extent of damage
caused by the failure of Amedeo, which owns the New York Palace
Hotel, London's Dorchester Hotel and Asprey Plc, jeweler to
Britain's royal family.
	   The clock on democracy in this nation of 300,000 stopped in 1962
when parliament was scrapped by royal fiat after Brunei's first
free elections under British administration swept an
anti-monarchist party to power.
	   Since then, a state of emergency has allowed the sultan to
decree as he pleases. Criticizing royalty borders on treason.
	   In the run-up to Monday's investiture, the palace has attempted
to portray the future ruler as a devout Muslim with the necessary
modicum of modernism.
	   On Sunday, the young prince sat in a gold-domed mosque for
nearly three hours for evening prayers attended by more than 1,000
Brunei men answering the muezzin's call.
	   But official pamphlets have also carried pictures of the prince
playing snooker in a waistcoat and bow tie and posing in a tuxedo
at Oxford University, from where he recently received a degree in
diplomacy.
	   The crown prince's carefree years may be coming to an end as he
joins a royal battle to keep Brunei a fairy tale kingdom where
there is no income tax and education and health care is free.
	   The young prince is already sounding like a statesman.
	   ``Along with me, every single individual in this country has a
vital part to play in propelling Brunei toward a positive future in
the 21st century,'' he said in a recent interview with the local
``Muhibah'' magazine.

China's flood diversion scaled back as water levels fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Officials scaled down plans to dynamite dikes and
divert flood waters into farmland as the level of the swollen
Yangtze fell slightly on Monday.
	   But urban areas remained on high alert as another flood crest,
the fourth this summer, roared past Wuhan on Monday afternoon,
forcing residents to stack more sandbags atop dikes that have been
constantly reinforced and raised over past weeks.
	   Flood officials blasted dikes at Jianli county in Hubei on
Sunday to divert flood waters and lower the river by 10-25
centimeters (4-10 inches) along its middle and lower reaches.
	   At the same time, the water level at the Shashi monitoring
station further upriver fell slightly, alleviating the immediate
need to open sluice gates and possibly blow more dikes in the much
larger Jingjiang flood diversion area.
	   Facing strong opposition from farmers unwilling to see their
land and homes destroyed, officials who had originally evacuated
330,000 residents in the Jingjiang area, scaled back the size of
the area to be flooded, necessitating the removal of just 110,000
people, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   In Jiangli, 50 kilometers (31 miles) downriver from Jingjiang,
all 50,000 persons living in the 180,000-square-kilometer
(72,000-square-foot) area were resettled before the dikes were
opened, Xinhua said. There, too, residents had been unwilling to
sacrifice homes and fields to the river, and it took local
officials ``some time to persuade the reluctant villagers,'' Xinhua
said.
	   The decline in water levels gave a long awaited reprieve for
millions of soldiers and civilian volunteers who have been battling
the river for weeks during an unusually long and destructive flood
season.
	   More than 2,000 people have died in flooding caused by seasonal
rains that arrived earlier and fell much harder than usual,
according to official figures. The river has risen to levels not
seen since 1954 when catastrophic floods killed some 30,000 people.
	   With more rains falling on the upper reaches of the Yangtze in
Sichuan province, the river is expected to sustain dangerously high
levels for weeks.
	   Millions of persons made homeless by flooding have been living
in plastic covered lean-tos on the tops of dikes for more than six
weeks, raising concerns over outbreaks of contagious diseases,
along with dysentery, infections from contact with filthy river
water and psychological stress.
	   Relief organizations have appealed for flood relief
contributions from private citizens, businesses and the wealthy
special administrative region of Hong Kong. In Beijing, collection
boxes and a 24-hour hotline have been set up to receive
contributions for tents and food, the Beijing Morning Post
reported.
	   China's military has played a high profile role in combatting
the floods, with reports of selfless soldiers working themselves to
exhaustion on the dikes dominating the evening news and newspapers
lauding the ``wall of olive green'' as China's salvation.

Prince Harry's rappelling adventure criticized as ``stupid''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Buckingham Palace officials were preparing Monday
to consult safety experts after an outing in which Prince Harry
scaled down a dam without a helmet was branded ``horribly
irresponsible.''
	   Royal officials said Sunday they would investigate after the
News of the World tabloid published a photograph of the 13-year-old
Prince Harry attached to a rope, easing hinself down the incline of
a 160-foot (49-meter) dam without a helmet, moutaineering boots or
back-up safety rope.
	   The prince was with his former nanny, Tiggy Legge-Bourke, and
his brother, 16-year-old Prince William, who the newspaper reported
also had descended the wall without safety equipment. Press reports
said the incident happened a week ago when the three were visiting
Legge-Bourke's parents in Wales.
	   ``Dam Stupid,'' said a banner headline Monday in the tabloid
Mirror newspaper, which fumed that the ``lunatics who put two young
royal lives at risk are not fit to look after any children.''
	   ``People who endangered royal lives used to be hauled off to the
Tower of London, via Traitor's Gate, pending a short walk to the
executioner's block. Let's see some heads roll again,'' the
newspaper said, calling the episode ``horribly irresponsible.''
	   The Daily Mail reported Monday that their father, Prince Charles
had summoned Legge-Bourke to explain after seeing the News of the
World photograph.
	   ``He is absolutely livid. He has lost track of the times he has
made clear that William and Harry can't do whatever they want to do
because they are not ordinary children,'' the newspaper quoted an
unnamed ``close friend'' of Prince Charles' as saying.
	   There are a variety of strict safety measures surrounding the
conduct of the royal family, such as the fact that Prince Charles,
heir to the throne, and Prince William, next in line for the
throne, never travel in the same aircraft.
	   ``Now we have seen the photographs we shall be showing them to
experts ourselves and making sure that the appropriate safety
measures are taken if or when something like this is done again,''
a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.

New faces in new places
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IRA PODELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf weren't the only
big-name quarterbacks to debut in new places as the NFL's
exhibition season got into full swing.
	   Doug Flutie moved slightly south from Canada to Buffalo, Neil
O'Donnell wore Bengals stripes instead of Jets green and Jim
Harbaugh took the opposite route of the Colts by going from
Indianapolis to Baltimore.
	   While Harbaugh and Leaf enjoyed success, Flutie, O'Donnell and
Manning struggled with their new clubs.
	   Harbaugh, obtained in an offseason trade from Indianapolis, went
10-for-13 for 60 yards and scrambled twice for 28 yards in
Baltimore's 19-14 victory over the Bears. He left with 6:07 left in
the second quarter after moving the Ravens 80 yards in 17 plays in
a drive that consumed more than 11 minutes and gave Baltimore a 9-0
lead.
	   ``We were playing little ball,'' Harbaugh said. ``We'll try to
get the ball downfield more, but we took what they gave us.''
	   In other NFL preseason games, Minnesota beat New England 28-0 in
the only game Sunday night.
	   On Saturday, Pittsburgh topped Buffalo 24-13, the New York
Giants defeated Cincinnati 24-17, Miami downed Washington 19-16,
Carolina defeated Jacksonville 30-27, Kansas City beat the Tampa
Bay 17-13, Denver topped St. Louis 20-13, Green Bay beat New
Orleans 30-7, Oakland defeated Dallas 16-3, Seattle defeated
Indianapolis 24-21 and San Diego beat San Francisco 27-21.
	   Flutie played much of the second half of the Bills' loss to the
Pittsburgh Steelers. He was 6-of-12 for 44 yards as the Steelers'
reserves outscored Buffalo's 14-3 after halftime.
	   ``It's another step forward,'' said Flutie, who at 36 is
returning to the NFL at an age when many quarterbacks are leaving.
``It was fun. It was exciting.''
	   O'Donnell, who is battling Jeff Blake for the Bengals starting
job, was 6-of-15 for 49 yards. Cincinnati turned the ball over to
the Giants four times _ leading to all of their points.
	   ``Sloppy,'' Bengals coach Bruce Coslet said. ``The Giants made
their run last year leading the league or being second in the
turnover ratio, and they continued that unabated tonight. We talk
about turnovers all the time. Now we have to start taking about
giveaways, and we gave away the ball way too many times.''
 &UR; Vikings 28, Patriots 0 &QC; 
	   Minnesota's No. 1 pick Randy Moss caught a 44-yard touchdown
pass, and last year's top choice, Dwayne Rudd, scored on a 34-yard
interception return as Minnesota won at New England.
	   After neither starting quarterback could move his team, Vikings
backup Randall Cunningham threw two touchdown passes and was
9-for-16 passes for 165 yards. He was sacked three times.
	   Minnesota starter Brad Johnson was 6-for-12 for 40 yards. New
England's Drew Bledsoe was 7-for-14 for 74 yards with an
interception and three sacks as the Patriots lost for the second
time in two exhibition tries.
 &UR; Seahawks 24, Colts 21 &QC; 
	   Manning, whose first NFL pass went for a touchdown, was 8-of-15
for 113 yards and was outplayed by Seattle backup Jon Kitna.
	   After four handoffs to Marshall Faulk on his first series,
Manning, the first pick in this year's draft, threw a 48-yard
touchdown pass to Marvin Harrison.
	   Kitna completed 9 of 13 passes for 92 yards, including a 25-yard
touchdown pass to Mike Pritchard.
	   The Seahawks (2-0) played their second game without No. 1
quarterback, Warren Moon, who has refused to report to the team's
training camp in a contract holdout.
 &UR; Chargers 27, 49ers 21 &QC; 
	   Leaf, the No. 2 pick in this year's draft, led two scoring
drives for the Chargers _ capping one with a 3-yard TD pass to
Bryan Still.
	   Leaf, 14-of-20 for 116 yards, had a more productive night than
San Francisco's Steve Young.
	   Young threw only seven passes, completing three for 20 yards and
was sacked once.
 &UR; Dolphins 19, Redskins 16 &QC; 
	   Olinde Mare made field goals of 27, 45, 50 and 46 yards in
Miami's victory over Washington.
	   Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino, in his only series, was 6-for-7
for 58 yards, and running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar rushed for 46
yards in eight carries.
	   Redskins rookie Skip Hicks had 52 yards and a touchdown on nine
rushes.
 &UR; Panthers 30, Jaguars 27 &QC; 
	   John Kasay, who kicked field goals of 38, 24, 27 and 29 yards in
the first half, hit his fifth in as many attempts, a 30-yarder with
four seconds left, for the win.
	   Carolina quarterback Kerry Collins was 16-of-22 for 162 yards
and a touchdown and was not intercepted.
 &UR; Broncos 20, Rams 13
	   With John Elway in Minnesota with his ailing wife, backup
quarterback Bubby Brister produced 13 first-half points for Denver.
	   Brister was 13-for-22 for 181 yards and a touchdown, and helped
set up two field goals by Jason Elam. Rookie Brian Griese, who also
saw extensive playing time, was 10-for-15 for 123 yards.
 &UR; Packers 31, Saints 7 &QC; 
	   Travis Jervey rushed nine times for 100 yards and two touchdowns
for the Packers (2-0).
	   Jervey has rushed 14 times for 172 yards during the preseason,
an average of more than 12 yards per carry.
	   Packers quarterback Brett Favre, who was only 1-of-5 for two
yards and a fumble against Kansas City last week, completed all
seven of his passes for 86 yards and a touchdown.
 &UR; Chiefs 17, Buccaneers 13 &QC; 
	   Kansas City receiver Chris Ortiz recovered a Tampa Bay fumble in
the end zone with 44 seconds left, giving the Chiefs (1-1) a wild
victory in the first exhibition game at the University of Oklahoma
since 1976.
 &UR; Raiders 16, Cowboys 3 &QC; 
	   Jeff George was 6-of-11 for 128 yards and one touchdown in one
quarter as he helped make Jon Gruden's Oakland coaching debut a
success.
	   Dallas' Troy Aikman was only 1-of-6 for six yards in his brief
appearance. Backup Jason Garrett was 5-of-9 for 32 yards for the
Cowboys (0-2).

10 hospitalized in Japan after drinking suspect green tea

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ten employees of a wood preservative company in
northwestern Japan were hospitalized Monday when they complained of
nausea and other symptoms after drinking green tea made with water
from a communal hot pot, officials said.
	   Preliminary tests by police investigators found traces of
cyanide in the hot pot water and victims' vomit samples, Japan's
Kyodo News reported.
	   A police spokesman with the Niigata prefectural, or state,
police could not confirm the report, saying an investigation was
still under way.
	   An initial diagnosis by doctors pointed to something more
serious than spoiled food-related illness, however, said Niigata
City General Hospital spokesman Akimi Takahashi.
	   ``It was apparent this was no ordinary food poisoning,'' he
said.
	   The sickening comes just two weeks after four Japanese died from
eating curried rice laced with arsenic and cyanide. That case, the
latest incident to shake Japan's increasingly tenuous sense of
security, remains unsolved.
	   Niigata, on the Japan Sea coast, is 256 kilometers (159 miles)
northwest of Tokyo. The curry poisonings occurred in Wakayama, a
small coastal city 453 kilometers (283 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Word of the apparent poisoning topped midday television
newscasts in Japan and was reported as the lead story in evening
newspapers.
	   Emergency medical authorities received a call at 8:01 a.m.
Monday (2301 GMT Sunday) from a branch factory office of Xyence Co.
located near Niigata, said Toshihide Watanabe, a spokesman for the
Niigata municipal fire department.
	   Ten of the 13 employees in the office were taken to local
hospitals for treatment of nausea, dizziness and numbness after
drinking the hot tea, Watanabe said.
	   Of the seven who were taken to Niigata City General Hospital,
two had preexisting ailments such as asthma and were affected more
seriously than the others, the hospital spokesman said.
	   All seven of the patients were in ``stable'' condition, but
continued to suffer from headaches and numbness, he said.
	   Japan has become particularly sensitive to poisonings in the
wake of a March 1995 nerve gas attack on Tokyo subways masterminded
by a fringe religious cult. The gassing killed 12 people.

Toxic ships' ballast polluting Botany Bay, Capt. Cook's landing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Botany Bay, the site of Capt. James
Cook's landing in 1770, has been polluted by cargo ships dumping
toxic ballast water that could cause an outbreak of shellfish
poisoning, a report said Monday.
	   More than half of the 1,300 ships serviced in Botany Bay in the
past year discharged ballast water, putting at risk human health,
aquaculture and the environment, The State of Botany Bay report
said.
	   Traces of a toxic organism known to cause paralytic shellfish
poisoning in humans were found at sites around Brotherson Dock, at
the third runway, and at Woolooware Bay, an oyster growing area.
	   The scientific report, which was commissioned by a task force of
six local town councils, also found that 37 million gallons (140
million liters) of raw sewerage flowed into the bay every year.
	   The report was reviewed by scientists from Sydney University and
the University of New South Wales and will form the basis of a
public campaign called Reclaim the Bay.
	   It also found that if development around Botany Bay continues at
the current rate, there would be no natural shoreline left by the
year 2025.
	   Up to 75 percent of sea grass was killed in the area in the past
30 years and one important species of sea grass could be lost
within 10 years.
	   Botany Bay mayoral task force chairman and Sutherland mayor
Kevin Schreiber on Monday called on the state and federal
governments to save the bay.
	   ``Sydney has sat back and watched as one of its most important
waterways slowly dies,'' Schreiber said.
	   ``This is the birthplace of modern Australia and we will no
longer sit back and let this happen to the bay,'' he said.
	   Capt. Cook, a famous explorer who also sailed to the Hawaiian
Islands, led the first British landing in Australia at Botany Bay.

President calls for low-technology for cash-strapped Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Once a champion of high-tech
development, Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie Monday said his
country needs simple ways to raise production and beat the worst
economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Habibie said cash-strapped Indonesia should devise technology
not reliant on costly imports.
	   He said millions of rural poor would benefit from the use of
low-tech solutions to everyday problems.
	   ``The villages need simple technology that can increase the
production of agriculture and small scale industries,'' Habibie
said in a speech marking National Technology Day.
	   Before becoming president in May, Habibie was Indonesia's
research and technology minister and sponsored state funding for
several controversial and costly high-tech industries such as
aircraft building.
	   At one stage he also called for the establishment of nuclear
power plants.
	   However, Indonesia is now battling soaring inflation and mass
unemployment.
	   An 80 percent drop in the value of the currency, the rupiah,
since July 1997 has dramatically pushed up the cost of imports.
	   In his speech, Habibie also announced the opening of a new
fertilizer plant and the connection of 20,000 solar power units for
villages in eastern Indonesia.

Philippine president decides not to stop first execution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said Monday
he has decided not to pardon a convicted rapist who is likely to
become the first criminal executed in the Philippines since the
death penalty was restored in 1994.
	   Estrada said Leo Echegaray, a poor carpenter who twice raped his
10-year-old stepdaughter, did not commit his crime out of poverty.
	   ``I will not condone this,'' Estrada said in a radio interview.
``I am sad to say that this is my decision.''
	   Estrada, who won the May 11 elections on a pro-poor platform,
acknowledged that many of the more than 600 people who have been
sentenced to death are poor.
	   ``If he killed somebody because he needed food for his family or
he's going hungry, maybe I could forgive him, Estrada said. ``But
rape is an act of an animal and it should not be forgiven.''
	   He said Echegaray's execution would deter more rapes, a rampant
crime.
	   A lower court convicted Echegaray of raping his stepdaughter in
1994. In 1996, the Supreme Court upheld the decision.
	   In 1997, the highest court affirmed its earlier decision, saying
Echegaray ``must be permanently prevented'' from repeating his
crime. It later said he could be executed by lethal injection
between Feb. 27 and Aug. 27, 1998.
	   In February this year, however, it stopped a lower court from
fixing a specific date until the Supreme Court has ruled on a
petition by Echegaray's lawyers questioning the constitutionality
of execution by lethal injection.
	   The 1987 constitution abolished the death penalty, but a law
that took effect in January 1994 restored it for 13 ``heinous
crimes'' including rape, murder and drug trafficking.
	   Opponents say many people sentenced to death are unable to
afford good lawyers, and that the crime rate has not declined
despite the restoration of capital punishment.
	   Proponents, however, say the penalty has not yet sent its
message to would-be criminals because no one has been executed
under the 1994 law.
	   The Supreme Court automatically reviews death sentences. The
president can stop executions by granting executive clemency or a
commutation of the sentence.

Ten more killed in India-controlled Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ At least seven suspected militants and
three Indian soldiers were killed in fighting Monday in troubled
Kashmir, where a general strike imposed by a pro-separatist group
shut down offices, shops and businesses.
	   The All Party Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella group of
separatist organizations, called the strike after the death of a
top militant commander, Burhanuddin Hijazi of the Hizbul
Mujahideen, on Sunday. Cars, buses and trucks stayed off the roads.
	   The Hurriyat accused the police of executing Hijazi in custody.
Police claimed the guerrilla commander was killed in a battle when
they raided his hide-out in Srinagar, the summer capital of
Jammu-Kashmir state.
	   Brigadier A.K. Chopra, an army spokesman, said seven suspected
militants and three soldiers were killed in fierce clashes in two
villages in the Kashmir Valley on Monday. Four of the militants
were Pakistani nationals, he said, without offering evidence.
	   An army major was killed near Zojila pass, 130 kilometers (80
miles) northeast of Srinagar, while trying to defuse an improvised
explosive device planted by suspected militants, Chopra said.

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A blistering heat wave claimed 10 more
lives overnight on the island of Cyprus, the Health Ministry said
Monday.
	   The latest deaths raised to 45 the number of people who have
died since Friday. Many of the victims were elderly.
	   Weathermen said temperatures were expected to rise again to 43
degrees Celsius (110 Fahrenheit). That temperature is the highest
recorded in more than 40 years, the weather bureau said.
	   Deaths also have been reported in Egypt and the Palestinian
territories, and scores of people in the Middle East have been
treated for heat exhaustion.

Planes and boats a new thorn in Singapore-Malaysia dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Shifting the squabble from trains
to planes and boats, Malaysia's information minister now says the
country should take control of the air and sea space it shares with
Singapore.
	   ``We are not a race that likes to quarrel but we must be serious
about protecting our rights,'' said Mohamed Rahmat, adding that
Malaysia should review Singapore's rights under existing agreements
to control the traffic of vessels that pass through Malaysian
territory.
	   The comments come amid tense relations between the two Southeast
Asian neighbors, caused by differences over the shifting of a
shared railroad immigration and customs point.
	   ``We must settle territorial claims amicably to avoid any
confusion in the future,'' Mohamed was quoted as saying in the New
Straits Times on Monday.
	   Under existing agreements, Singapore has control of certain air
and sea movement from Seremban, in the Malaysian coastal state of
Negri Sembilan, down south through the Straits of Malacca, which
separate the countries, as well as a lighthouse on the Malaysian
island of Pulau Pisang.
	   ``It's time for us to regain sovereignty of our air, sea and
land,'' Mohamed said, adding that just because Singapore had been
operating a lighthouse on Malaysian land, ``We don't want people to
think the lighthouse belongs to Singapore.''
	   Mohamed said Malaysia needed control of the lighthouse for
navigational purposes in connection with plans to open a port at
Tanjung Pelepas, on its southern border with Singapore.
	   A flare-up that started last month was provoked by Singapore's
relocation of its immigration, customs and quarantine post from a
railway station at Tanjong Pagar, in the south, to a site at
Woodlands, on the Malaysian border.
	   Malaysia has refused to move its immigration control from the
original site because it owns the land under an old treaty, a move
Singapore has deemed unlawful.
	   Analysts say the squabble is underscored by problems related to
the region's economic turmoil, which has hurt Malaysia much more
than Singapore.
	   The tit-for-tat response has aggravated already souring
relations between the two nations. Other longstanding unresolved
issues include land disputes and the sale of Malaysian water, on
which Singapore depends heavily.

Asian stock markets pulled lower by yen's fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Led by Japan, Asian stock markets on Monday
picked up where they left off last week, following a sinking
Japanese yen lower.
	   But in a sign of easing speculative pressure on the embattled
Hong Kong dollar, interbank interest rates declined early Monday
after a recent advance.
	   Traders across the region said much hinged on the movement of
the yen against the dollar and Hong Kong's markets. A weaker
Japanese currency or a de-linking of Hong Kong's currency to the
United States dollar could trigger a new wave of devaluations
throughout Asia, they said.
	   In early trading, most Asian currencies lost ground against the
U.S. dollar, tracking the yen's continued retreat.
	   The U.S. dollar rose to an intraday high of 146.50 yen early
Monday in Tokyo on worries about fading recovery prospects for
Japan and the rest of the region.
	   It then retreated slightly to 146.14 yen as of midday as
Japanese banks sold the U.S. currency to take profits. But that was
still up 0.60 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and marginally above
its New York rate of 146.13 yen.
	   The Japanese currency's limited gains were capped by persistent
speculation _ despite official reassurance otherwise _ that China
will be forced to devalue its yuan, and Hong Kong's currency will
lose its peg to the U.S. dollar.
	   Japanese share prices dropped on these worries, along with
lingering concern over a possible delay in the passage of
legislation to stabilize Japan's bad loan-burdened banking system.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 179.47 points,
or 1.13 percent, to 15,649.70 at the end of the morning session. On
Friday, the Nikkei index closed down 47.05 points, or 0.30 percent
_ the fifth straight day of losses.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index breached the
7,000-point support level for the first time since January 1995,
before rebounding to end the seesaw morning session at 7,077.68
points, 0.8 percent higher than Friday's close. The index had lost
12 percent last week.
	   Interbank rates eased slightly, a sign that speculators were
taking profits and that large institutions were lending
aggressively in Hong Kong.
	   New Zealand's NZSE-40 capital index finished at its lowest point
since June 30, falling 30.20 points to 2,000.98. Brokers said
investor caution and a rise in local short-term interest rates
weighed on the market.
	   In Taiwan, share prices were also sharply lower on worries over
the continuing depreciation of the currency, analysts said. The
Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed down
157.90 points, or 2.1 percent, to 7,372.12.
	   Philippine shares sank as well, with the key index shedding
21.06 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,427.66.
	   In Malaysia and Indonesia, new signs of political unrest led the
currency and stock markets to drop in early trading. Shares in
Thailand, South Korea and Australia also opened lower.
	   Financial markets in Singapore were closed for a national
holiday.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran holds Pakistan responsible for the
safety of 11 diplomats it says were captured by the Taliban Islamic
movement in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   ``We demand that Pakistan secure the release of the Islamic

Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as saying in a phone conversation

	   The Taliban have denied they are holding any Iranian diplomats.
	   Forces of the hard-line Taliban blazed into the northern
opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif Saturday, capturing the
last major Afghan city not in their hands.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to be the force behind the Taliban,
who accuse Iran of aiding an opposition coalition that was
headquartered in Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Kharrazi said he rejected claims by Taliban commanders that
there was no one inside the Iranian consulate building in
Mazar-e-Sharif when it was raided by the Taliban Saturday.
	   ``The fact that the Taliban and Pakistani officials right after
the storming of the consulate assured the Iranian government of the
well being of its staff leaves no doubt that the diplomats are
being held by the militia,'' IRNA quoted Kharrazi as saying.
	   It quoted Aziz as saying that the Pakistani government had
mobilized its resources to learn about the fate of the Iranian
diplomats.

Japan's opposition takes aim at Obuchi over economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Graphic JPN_ECONOMY
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Criticizing the ``qualifications and ability'' of
Japan's new Cabinet, opposition lawmakers Monday called for new
elections and said that only a revolution in politics could end the
country's economic woes.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi faced blistering criticism as he
fielded questions on the floor of the Diet, Japan's Parliament, for
the first time since becoming prime minister last month.
	   ``What qualifications and ability does this new Cabinet have?''
said lawmaker Kansei Nakano, a member of Japan's largest opposition
party, the Democratic Party.
	   ``Without new policies there will be no reforms. We must
dissolve the Diet,'' he said as several lawmakers broke into
applause.
	   Obuchi ignored the demand, saying he would ``exert all his
energy'' to resolving the country's economic problems.
	   Opinion polls have shown Obuchi's Cabinet to be one of the least
popular new governments in decades, with less than one-third of
voters expressing approval.
	   No where was the declining popularity of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party more clear than last month's parliamentary
elections, when a landslide victory by opposition parties cost the
LDP control of the upper house of Japan's bicameral Diet.
	   As a result, Obuchi must win the support of opposition lawmakers
for his bills even to pass.
	   The tone of Monday's debate suggested he may face a tough time.
	   Obuchi has promised quick action to revive a recession-bound
economy that threatens to throw the rest of Asia into a new round
of economic chaos.
	   He is seeking to stimulate consumption with more than 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 41 billion) worth of tax cuts and 10 trillion yen (dlrs
69 billion) in public spending.
	   But that's not enough, say opposition politicians.
	   They point out that many of Obuchi's initiatives were written by
Japan's powerful bureaucrats, who have traditionally made policies
to be rubber-stamped by the Diet.
	   It was exactly such an arrangement, with its backroom deal
making and lack of accountability, that led Japan into its current
morass, said opposition lawmaker Takenori Kanzaki.
	   ``The LDP's tradition of collusion between politicians and
bureaucrats caused them to put off fixing (the economy's)
problems,'' he said.
	   Instead, bureaucrats have sought to protect client industries,
thus preventing market forces from weeding out weaker companies and
forcing the others to get their houses in order, he said.
	   ``I want to grapple with economic problems with strong political
leadership,'' Obuchi replied.
	   The opposition directed its sharpest criticisms at new Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, a former prime minister who served as
finance chief once before from 1986-1988.
	   One opposition lawmaker branded Miyazawa a ``war criminal'' for
having approved loose monetary policies during his tenure that
sparked an orgy of speculative land buying that resulted in a price
bubble.
	   When land prices crashed in the 1990s, banks were left burdened
with an estimated 76 trillion yen (dlrs 524 billion) in bad loans,
which economists now call the greatest single drag on Japan's
economy.

	   Weathermen said temperatures were expected to rise again to 43
degrees Celsius (110 Fahrenheit). That temperature is the highest
recorded in more than 40 years, the weather bureau said.
	   Deaths also have been reported in Egypt and the Palestinian
territories, and scores of people in the Middle East have been
treated for heat exhaustion.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with support from idea from ANU professor of

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The ancestors of New Zealand's
Maori and the other Polynesian peoples of the Pacific came from
China, according to research carried out using new techniques for
analyzing human DNA.
	   Victoria University scientist Dr. Geoffrey Chambers reported
Monday the people who eventually became the Maori and other
Polynesians originated in mainland China, then migrated into and
across the Pacific over many centuries.
	   The DNA study shows that, starting from Taiwan, they
island-hopped their way through the Philippines and Indonesia to
West Polynesia, on into the islands of East Polynesia and then New
Zealand.
	   Atholl Anderson, a professor of prehistory at Australian
National University in Canberra, supported the theory.
	   ``It's by no means a new idea. The historical evidence certainly
suggests that the people of Oceania came from somewhere in the
south China region ... from among the Mongoloid peoples,'' Anderson
said.
	   Chambers, who is in Victoria University's school of biological
sciences, said in a research paper: ``There is an exact living
record of these voyages of colonization preserved in the DNA of
their m institute's molecular biology laboratory used the blood
samples of volunteers, and the data was compared with human genetic
studies from other populations around the world.
	   Chambers said forensic DNA profiles completed at Victoria had
also found that Polynesians in general, and New Zealand Maori in
particular, showed less genetic diversity than many other ethnic
groups.
	   While the probability of finding two individuals with the same
specific DNA profile was one in 112 million for Asians, one in 47
million for Caucasians and one in 6.7 million for Polynesians, it
was a low one in 2.8 million for Maori.
	   This was wholly consistent with a history of recent migration,
he said.
	   Last month research scientists at Massey University at
Palmerston North said DNA research there suggested that about 70
women were among New Zealand's founding Polynesian population.
	   Massey research leader, associate professor Rosalind
Murray-McIntosh of the university's institute of molecular
biosciences, said the results excluded the possibility that one or
two canoes of castaways formed the first Maori population.
	   ``These new results are consistent with deliberate Polynesian
exploration and then settlement of Pacific Islands,'' she said.
	   Chambers said his findings show the direct ancestors of New
Zealand Maori came from island groups northeast of New Zealand.
	   Maori oral history and mythology identify Hawaii (Hawaiki in
Maori) as the traditional Pacific home from which ancestors of New
Zealand Maori set out on planned voyages of discovery and migration
down through the South Pacific region to Aotearoa (New Zealand).
	   But many Maori also believe that their people originally came
out of Asia, and then moved across the Pacific.

Government says it delivered a budget surplus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ With an election near, the
government's budget outcome for 1997-98 came in with a surplus of
U.S. dlrs 672 million (1.2 billion Australian dollars), Treasurer
Peter Costello said Monday.
	   The figure, described by the government as preliminary, compares
to a U.S. dlrs 2.94 billion (4.9 billion Australian dollars)
deficit recorded in 1996-97. Final figures will be released next
month.
	   ``The stronger-than-expected outcome reflects both higher
revenue and lower outlays,'' Costello and Finance Minister John
Fahey said in a joint statement.
	   ``This outcome is indicative of the fundamental underlying
strength of the Australian economy.''
	   It is welcome news for Prime Minister John Howard's conservative
government, which has stressed fiscal accountability. He must call
an election no later than March 1999, but many pundits believe he
may go to the polls as soon as October.
	   The government had originally forecast a U.S. dlrs 690 million
(1.15 billion Australian dollars) deficit for 1997-98.
	   Total revenues received were U.S. dlrs 82.2 billion (137 billion
Australian dollars), and total spending was U.S. dlrs 81.5 billion
(135.6 billion Australian dollars).
	   Japan, Australia's biggest trade partner, remained a worry with
little or no growth expected in the year ahead, Costello added.
	   ``I think as we said at the time of the budget ... we had a
great deal to say about the East-Asian crisis and regional
outlook,'' Costello told reporters.
	   Costello said Japan could be in recession to the extent of 5
percent, South Korea and Thailand are in International Monetary
Fund bailout programs, and the Indonesian economy is contracting.
	   A recession is expected in Singapore and there had been a
negative quarter of growth in New Zealand, he said.
	   ``Australia is the growth economy of Asia at the moment. We are
possibly the only economy, with the exception of China, in the
Asian region that is growing,'' Costello said.
	   That was principally as a result of low interest rates and good
domestic demand, he said.
	   The ministers said revenue collections were higher than
expected, mainly reflecting unexpectedly higher taxation revenue,
driven by stronger company tax receipts.
	   Meanwhile, outlays were lower than expected, with lower spending
on areas including transport and communications, social security
and welfare, general services, education and health.

Dollar rises in Tokyo, Japanese stocks finish sharply lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
price

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar rose against the yen Monday on fresh
signs of economic weakness in Japan, with Tokyo stock prices
finishing the day's trading sharply lower.
	   The dollar bought 146.48 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.94
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also higher than its New York
rate of 146.13 yen late last week.
	   Traders said dollar-buying was accelerated by overseas players
in the afternoon after Tokyo share prices fell further on news that
a medium-sized copy machine maker filed for court protection from
creditors.
	   Mita Industrial Co., an unlisted Osaka-based manufacturer of
copy machines, filed with the Osaka District Court on Monday
morning to restructure itself under Japan's corporate
rehabilitation law.
	   Japanese banks earlier in the session sold the U.S. currency to
take profits, nudging the dollar back from its intraday high of
146.50 yen. The dollar reached an eight-year high of 146.73 yen on
June 16.
	   ``The selling of Japanese bank stocks and the virtual collapse
of a leading copy machine maker are proof that the Japanese economy
is weak,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange
at ABN AMRO Bank.
	   The Japanese currency remained vulnerable to selling amid
disappointment with the first major speech Friday by Japan's new
prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, who offered little fresh policy
initiatives to prop up the anemic economy.
	   The dollar also got support against the yen on mounting
speculation that China will be forced to devalue its yuan, and Hong
Kong will de-link its currency's long-standing peg to the U.S.
dollar.
	   Meanwhile, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
202.75 points, or 1.28 percent, closing at 15,626.42. On Friday,
the Nikkei index closed down 47.05 points, or 0.30 percent.
	   Among losers were bank issues and export-oriented high
technology stocks.
	   ``The market is likely to continue to trend lower this week'' in
the wake of Prime Minister Obuchi's failure to instill confidence
in his administration's economic policies, said Masaru Arai,
general manager at Ryoko Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section declined 18.21 points, or 1.49 percent, to 1,207.09.
The TOPIX closed down 1.79 points, or 0.15 percent, on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.170 percent from Friday's close of 1.195
percent, driving its price up to 112.00 yen from 111.82 yen last
week.

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ A wide-eyed, 24-year-old with
a passion for snooker and Bon Jovi was installed Monday as heir to
one of the world's richest monarchies.
	   Amid Islamic prayers and booming guns, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah
passed on a jeweled Malay dagger to his eldest son, Prince
Al-Muhtadee Billah, making him rightful heir of the throne held by
the family for more than 500 years.
	   The prince, dressed in an ornate gold-embroidered jacket and
wearing a gold crown, looked solemn throughout the hourlong
ceremony before 4,000 guests. The huge palace hall, its walls
painted gold, was packed with royal relatives, the who's who of
Brunei society and foreign diplomats.
	   The sultan wore military dress and a sword at his belt. On
either side were his two wives in green and pink sequined gowns
reflecting the palace lights.
	   The only words spoken at the ceremony were from an imam who led
a brief prayer and Prince Mohamad, the Sultan's brother, who
proclaimed his nephew Brunei's 30th ruler.
	   Prince Al-Muhtadee is the third child of the monarch, the two
older daughters being ineligible for the crown because women aren't
allowed to rule here.
	   The ceremony at the 1,788-room palace on the banks of the Brunei
river masked a growing unease in the Southeast Asian kingdom, which
has withstood liberal tides to remain one of the world's last
absolute monarchies.
	   It comes at a time of economic troubles for the oil-soaked
sultanate and an embarrassing family feud brought on by the
financial dealings of the sultan's younger brother, Prince Jefri,
now in self-imposed exile in the United States.
	   Jefri was abruptly removed from the controlling positions of
Brunei's flagship company, Amedeo, after a reported dlrs 16 billion
loss. He was stripped of his post as head of the nation's
international investment arm, the Brunei Investment Agency.
	   A spokesman for Jefri recently quoted the estranged prince as
saying conservative forces backed by shadowy foreign advisers from
Iran and Libya were tightening their grip on Brunei. The government
quickly denied it.
	   But the rift appears to be widening, as the sultan, according to
officials, also plans to strip his brother of control over three
large oil wells.
	   ``Everything in Brunei is behind closed doors,'' said Abdul
Latif Chuchu, the former chief of a political party who is banned
from politics for his anti-palace views. ``We don't know what is
going on.''
	   Analysts say economic pains are forcing the royal family to stop
expanding its fleet of Rolls-Royces and Mercedes, its squadron of
private jets and even to quietly sell off some of its prize race
horses.
	   Citizens in Brunei, where officials face jail for disclosing
financial secrets, will likely never know the extent of damage
caused by the failure of Amedeo, which owns the New York Palace
Hotel, London's Dorchester Hotel and Asprey Plc, jeweler to
Britain's royal family.
	   The clock on democracy in this nation of 300,000 stopped in 1962
when parliament was scrapped by royal fiat after Brunei's first
free elections under British administration swept an
anti-monarchist party to power.
	   Since then, a state of emergency has allowed the sultan to
decree as he pleases. Criticizing royalty borders on treason.
	   The palace has attempted to portray the future ruler as a devout
Muslim with the necessary modicum of modernism.
	   On Sunday, the young prince sat in a gold-domed mosque for
nearly three hours for evening prayers attended by more than 1,000
Brunei men answering the muezzin's call.
	   But official pamphlets have also carried pictures of the prince
playing snooker in a waistcoat and posing in a tuxedo at Oxford
University, from where he recently received a degree in diplomacy.
	   The crown prince's carefree years may be coming to an end as he
joins a royal battle to keep Brunei a fairy tale kingdom of no
income tax and where education and health care are free.
	   ``I expect a bright future, perhaps with more development,''
said Manaf Azlan, who stood in the rain with several thousand
people hoping for a glimpse of their future ruler. The prince led a
procession through the capital, carried in a jeep-drawn chariot
shaped like a traditional Malay home with sloping tile roofs.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mita Industrial Co., a medium-sized Japanese maker
of copy machines, sought court protection Monday from creditors to
whom it owes more than a billion dollars, company officials said.
	   An official of the Osaka-based company said it filed with the
Osaka District Court to restructure under the nation's corporate
rehabilitation law.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
debts at Mita Industrial and subsidiaries totaled 205 billion yen
(dlrs 1.4 billion).
	   About 70 percent of Mita Industrial's total production now comes
from its firms in Hong Kong, but the company's overall earnings
have been sharply hurt by the weakening yen in recent years, the
official said.
	   Another reason for the mounting debts was slow action on the
part of the company to cut its bloated workforce of 3,600 despite
falling sales amid Japan's economic slowdown, the official said.
	   Mita Industrial, an unlisted company founded in 1948, had sales
of 100 billion yen (dlrs 680 million) in the year ended November
1997.

Chinese woman arrested for running sex ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police in Shanghai cracked an international
prostitution ring that forced Chinese women into the Southeast
Asian sex trade, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The alleged ringleader, a 37 year-old woman identified by her
surname Yu, was arrested at Shanghai airport as she attempted to
flee the country, the China Women's News reported. It did not say
when the arrest was made.
	   Yu, a divorcee who had worked as a prostitute in Southeast Asia,
attracted unemployed women by offering high salaries for legitimate
work overseas, the paper said. Each woman paid Yu a 15,000 yuan
(U.S. dlrs 1,829) fee, but only discovered the real nature of their
new jobs after arriving alone and in debt overseas, said the paper.
	   Police were tipped off to the scam by a letter from one of Yu's
recruits pleading for help, the paper said.
	   Yu conspired with gangsters and brothel owners to forge travel
documents for the women, pocketing a 210,000 yuan (U.S. dlrs
25,609) profit, it said.
	   Unemployment in China is worsening with the closures of scores
of state run businesses, forcing millions of workers into an
unfamiliar and highly competitive job market.

Negotiations reopen to end strike at Hyundai Motor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Management and union negotiators sat
down Monday for the first time in a week to try to settle a
three-week strike at Hyundai Motor Co. over layoffs.
	   But with both sides apparently holding fast to their positions
and little progress expected, the government was reported ready to
break up the strike with police force.
	   Hyundai Motor's 26,000-member union wants the nation's largest
automaker to take back 1,600 employees it fired July 31 because of
sharply falling domestic sales.
	   The company, which earlier got rid of 6,100 workers by offering
them enhanced early retirement packages, insists it has to reduce
its work force in line with slumping demand for its cars.
	   Hyundai Motor, a subsidiary of Hyundai group, South Korea's
second largest conglomerate, has been operating at 40 percent of
its annual capacity of 1.25 million cars.
	   The union proposed a reduction in working hours or a
work-sharing program to avoid layoffs, but the company rejected
that as a makeshift solution.
	   About 10,000 union workers rallied Monday at Hyundai Motor's
plants at Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Seoul,
where they have been picketing since July 20.
	   ``We say `No' to layoffs. If the company doesn't retract
layoffs, we will all die together. There is no reason for us to
live if we have no jobs,'' said Kim Moon-seok, a union spokesman.
	   Authorities have ruled the strike illegal, noting that the union
did not seek mandatory government mediation, but have so far taken
no action against the strikers.
	   The government reportedly was asking Hyundai's management to
request police intervention to end the strike. Police cannot
intervene without a formal request from the company.
	   ``We don't really want to use force. But if the talks fail and
there is no other way, we will have to ask police to arrest the
labor leaders. If the strike goes on, we won't meet our export
schedule,'' said the company's spokesman, Min Kyong-hwan.
	   Hyundai's union is known for its militancy. Previous police
intervention in Hyundai's disputes resulted in violent clashes with
workers.
	   Hyundai is the first major employer to push massive layoffs amid
a deepening economic crisis gripping South Korea, whose shattered
economy was bailed out by the International Monetary Fund in
December.
	   The Samsung group, the nation's largest conglomerate, is also
pushing plans to lay off 15,000 workers this month, mostly in its
semiconductor and other electronic operations.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ As hope of finding more survivors of the
embassy bombing in Nairobi dimmed, investigators focused Monday on
finding the architects of the terror at a crime scene guarded by
armed Marines and hidden from view by black fabric.
	   Nearly simultaneous blasts at the American embassies in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, were sophisticated
attacks and suspicion instantly turned to the usual suspects:
Islamic terrorists.
	   The explosions took a terrible toll: At least 200 dead in
Nairobi and nearly 5,000 injured; at least 10 dead in Dar es Salaam
and 74 injured.
	   The powerful blast in downtown Nairobi destroyed a building next
door to the embassy and damaged others blocks away. The damage in
Tanzania was far less because the embassy is in a residential area.
	   Israel army radio, in a report from Nairobi Monday, said
investigators suspect the bombers used the Czech-manufactured
Semtex, which is much more powerful than more traditional
explosives such as TNT.
	   The investigators, who were not identified, said use of the
plastic explosive, which is favored by the Irish Republican Army,
implies a big organization, or even a state, plotted the attack
because Semtex is not readily available, the radio report said.
	   On Sunday, Israeli rescuers found a mother and son in a building
near the Nairobi embassy. They were alive and well. But the
rescuers also brought out a dead woman.
	   And at the pile of concrete, steel and glass next door that once
housed a secretarial school, hopes of finding anyone alive were
slim. As night fell, only bodies were brought out.
	   ``Every day that passes, the chances are becoming slimmer and
slimmer,'' said Farid Abdul Kadir, a relief coordinator for the
Kenyan Red Cross.
	   The mother and son in the bank building were lucky. They weren't
hurt, just terrified to come out until rescuers arrived to help
them down the rubble-strewn staircase from the 20th floor.
	   Rescue teams labored into the night with everything from
bulldozers to fiber optics in their quest for life inside the
ruins.
	   Sniffer dogs from the United States, France and Israel padded
over rubble, one with a cut nose from the sea of broken glass.
	   Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi visited the embassy site Sunday
morning and said there were some leads. He did not elaborate.
	   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned
Sunday that it could take a long time to find out who was behind
the attacks. She promised ``appropriate action'' against any
country or person found responsible.
	   The FBI and other U.S. agencies have sent teams to both Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam. If they can figure out what kind of explosives
were used and how, the FBI says it would be like finding the
bombers' ``fingerprints.''
	   The United States is a favorite target of militant Islamic
fundamentalists, such as the exiled Saudi financier Osama bin
Laden, one potential suspect.
	   Another favorite target _ Israel _ on Sunday offered the help of
Mossad and other intelligence agencies.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early signs were that the
attacks were the work of ``international terrorism centered on
Islamic fundamentalism.''
	   The Washington Post on Monday quoted an unidentified U.S.
Embassy official as saying the vehicle apparently containing the
bomb first drove to the embassy's main entrance but was sent by
guards to the rear, where the bomb exploded.
	   ``They saved people's lives by sending it around back,'' said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``If they hadn't
done that, I don't think I would be around today talking to you.''
	   The Post also reported that at least one hand grenade was used
to kill guards at the rear entrance. The main bomb exploded after
that attack, the newspaper said.
	   The Sunday Nation quoted a man who works for the environment
ministry, Ocheng Okwach, as saying he saw two men drive a yellow
pickup truck to the back of the embassy and jump out brandishing
machine-guns.
	   ``One man ran back into the vehicle as the other sprayed bullets
into the American Embassy,'' Okwach was quoted as saying.
	   It also quoted an unnamed security man as saying he'd seen three
people filming the embassy four days before the attack.
	   The Sunday Times of London, meanwhile, quoted Kenyan police
superintendent Mike Harries as saying witnesses saw a suicide
bomber drive a pickup truck into the car park behind the embassy
and sit there quietly until the blast.
	   Security at the damaged embassy _ now a crime scene that might
yield clues _ was extremely tight. Marines in battle gear stood
guard and black fabric draped the perimeter to obstruct the view
from outside.
	   Survivors of the bombing honored their dead at a private
memorial service Sunday at Ambassador Patricia Bushnell's
residence.
	   A dozen Americans and 24 Kenyans inside the embassy died and
scores were missing.
	   Among the dead were Consul General Julian Bartley and his son,
Jay, a university student at the United States International
University in Nairobi. The body of the elder Bartley was identified
late Sunday.
	   Ten people died in the Tanzanian bombing, none of them
Americans, hospital officials said.
	   If Sunday was a day for mourning, Monday was for picking up the
pieces.
	   The bombing not only killed, maimed and bereaved. It also
displaced thousands of people from their workplaces.
	   The embassy was moving its operations into the U.S. Agency for
International Development building in a residential area. Hundreds
of people flown in to handle the investigation were setting up
shop.
	   The Kenyan government, meanwhile, had cordoned off four badly
damaged buildings near the embassy, including the 22-story bank
building.
	   Access to six more damaged buildings, including the headquarters
of the national railway, was being restricted, it said.
	   The Kenyan president's office said 4,877 people were injured in
Friday's blast; 560 were still hospitalized Sunday.
	   A U.S. C-141 cargo plane flew 15 badly injured people to
Ramstein Air Base in Germany Sunday and another evacuation flight
was planned for Monday.

Tajikistan fortifies border, amid reports of Taliban advance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Tajikistan, with the help of Russian troops, was
reinforcing its border with Afghanistan on Monday to guard against
any spillover of the turmoil in northern Afghanistan, news reports
said Monday.
	   Tajik government organizations have been put on alert, while
Tajik and Russian troops were taking unspecified ``urgent
measures'' to fortify the border, ITAR-Tass said. Russia has 25,000
troops stationed in Tajikistan to support the government and guard
the border.
	   The measures followed reports that the ruling Taliban movement
has captured the biggest city in northern Afghanistan,
Mazar-e-Sharif, which is just 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the
Tajik border.
	   Afghanistan's anti-Taliban alliance claimed to have pushed its
Islamic opponents out of the city, but the reports could not be
independently confirmed.
	   Tajikistan's secular government is wary of the fundamentalist
Taliban and is sympathetic to the ethnic Tajiks who make up much of
the opposition in northern Afghanistan.
	   ``These measures were necessitated by the escalation of armed
activities by Taliban formations and their advance to the border
with Tajikistan,'' Tajik Deputy Prime Minister Abdurakhmon Azimov
was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Azimov claimed that in some areas the Taliban have advanced to
within 20 to 40 kilometers (12 to 25 miles) from the Tajik border,
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The loss of Mazar-e-Sharif would be a severe blow to the
anti-Taliban opposition, backed into a dwindling corner of northern
Afghanistan, and a boost to the Taliban's four-year-old campaign to
impose their strict interpretation of Islamic rule on the entire
country.
	   Afghanistan borders three former Soviet republics _ Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
	   Russia fears the entrenchment of a radical Islamic state in
Afghanistan would bring an influx of refugees and arms into the
former Soviet republics of Central Asia.

Bus crash in Austria kills driver, injures 30
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LINZ, Austria (AP) _ A bus taking Austrians to work in Bavaria
drove off the road and crashed into a pear tree near the German
border early Monday, killing the driver and injuring 30 passengers.
	   The bus was rounding a slight curve between Hochburg and Ach,
about 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of Salzburg when it veered off
the road and into a rut that prevented the driver from steering
back on, police said.
	   The 59-year-old driver was killed instantly, while the injured
passengers were taken to hospitals on both sides of the border,
some with serious injuries.
	   The commuter workers were headed to a chemical plant in
Burghausen, the Austria Press Agency reported.

Katyusha rockets crash near Lebanese-Israeli border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas fired more than 20 Katyusha
rockets in south Lebanon early Monday, and many landed near
Lebanon's border with Israel, Lebanese security officials said.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties.
	   The rockets apparently were fired from a site close to Yater, a
Shiite Muslim village 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) north of the
frontier, the officials said.
	   The rocket barrage came after attacks late Sunday by Hezbollah
guerrillas on at least two outposts of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army militia in southeastern Lebanon. Details of the
attacks were not immediately available.
	   No casualties were reported in those attacks either, said the
officials. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Israel has maintained a self-styled ``security zone'' in
southern Lebanon since 1986 to try to protect against cross-border
guerrilla raids.
	   In Israel, Israeli radios said that three road-side bombs
exploded overnight as Israeli patrols were passing.
	   They said that a number of vehicles were slightly damaged and
that one Israeli soldier was treated for shock.
	   The Israeli army said that on Sunday, Hezbollah forces attempted
to attack an SLA post in southeastern Lebanon.
	   One of the guerrillas reached a guard post, and an Israeli
soldier fought him off until other troops arrived, the army said.
It said the guerrilla fled, leaving his weapons behind.
	   The Sunday attacks were claimed by the Shiite Muslim Amal
movement.
	   Israel responded with shell fire toward suspected guerrilla
hideouts. A 70-year-old Lebanese man was wounded when a mortar
shell crashed close to his house in Majdal Zoun, which is near
Yater.
	   The area around Yater often has been used by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrilla group as a launching pad for attacks on Israeli
troops and its allied militia.
	   Hezbollah has led the fight to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers
and 2,500 allied SLA militiamen from southern Lebanon

Spanish jobless claims down in July
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Jobless claims in Spain fell to 11.0
percent of the active population in July from 11.51 percent in
June, the Labor Ministry reported Monday.
	   At the end of July, some 1.79 million people had filed for
unemployment benefits, down 74,576 from around 1.86 million at the
end of June, the ministry said.
	   The ministry's figures, however, are less closely watched by
analysts and investors than another measure of Spanish unemployment
_ a quarterly survey of 64,000 households, compiled by the National
Statistics Institute.
	   The most recent household survey put the jobless rate at 18.9
percent over the second quarter of 1998, down 0.7 percentage points
from the first quarter.
	   The ministry's figure reflects only people who are entitled to
unemployment benefits, whereas the household survey includes data
on all categories of jobless Spaniards.

Australia adopts racial code, drug-testing policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Cricket Board (ACB)
adopted Monday a racial code and drug-testing policy that it hopes
will be adopted by other cricketing nations.
	   Australian Cricket Board chief executive Malcolm Speed said the
board would lobby the International Cricket Council (ICC) for the
introduction of codes dealing with racial and religious
vilification, and drug use.
	   Speed said Australia became the first cricketing nation to adopt
a racial and religious vilification policy and joined South Africa
and England by having a drugs policy.
	   He said both ACB initiatives would take effect from next month.
	   ``We'll be sending both documents to the ICC and telling the ICC
that at its next meeting, we will be moving to have these policies
adopted worldwide,'' Speed said.
	   Under the drug code, all first-class cricketers in Australia
will be subject to random tests for performance-enhancing drugs.
Social drugs such as marijuana have been excluded from the tests.
	   Speed said drug cheats faced a two-year ban from the sport and
tests would be held out of season as well as during competitions.
	   He said the overall number of tests a year has yet to be decided
under the code, based on the anti-doping policy of the Australian
Sports Commission.
	   Speed said he was unaware of any past cases of
performance-enhancing substances being used in cricket.
	   ``We want to be in a position to deal with it when and if it
arises,'' he said.
	   Under the racial and religious vilification code, players found
guilty of an offense can be fined or suspended, the punishment to
be determined by the ACB.
	   ``We don't see that cricket is a high-risk sport in regards to
racial or religious vilification,'' Speed said.
	   ``I don't know of any official complaint (in cricket) but there
is some anecdotal evidence that many years ago there were some
racist incidences.''
	   Speed said the ACB was not able to impose its policies on
international touring teams to Australia, but hoped the codes would
be adopted by all cricketing nations. (djp)

Thailand should close three banks, finance minister says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to move possible bank closures higher &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will close at least three of
15 commercial banks in a much-awaited financial sector shakeup
aimed at reviving the battered economy, the finance minister said
in an interview published Monday.
	   The bank closures should be announced Saturday as part of a
package of reforms following negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund on the latest installment of its dlrs 17.2 billion
bailout for the Thai economy.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda declined, in an interview
with the Bangkok Post, to single out any institution to be closed
but signaled that the government would not propose a plan to bail
out shareholders or bad management.
	   ``A bailout of shareholders, a bailout of bad management ... is
impossible,'' Tarrin was quoted as saying, but depositors,
creditors and borrowers would be fully protected.
	   Widely expected is the merger of three state-run banks _ Siam
City Bank, First Bangkok City Bank and Bangkok Metropolitan Bank.
	   The fourth state-run bank, Bangkok Bank of Commerce, may be put
up for sale to foreign investors.
	   Tarrin said the Thai economy should start to bottom out in the
first quarter of 1999 provided the government's efforts aren't
neutralized by outside developments.
	   Japan's sluggish economy and a devaluation of the Chinese
currency could prolong Thailand's crisis, Tarrin said. But whatever
happens internationally, the Thai government will have to move
forward with reforms.
	   Thailand's financial system all but collapsed in mid-1998
following political interference in the once independent central
bank, and massive uncontrolled lending and corruption in private
financial institutions.
	   The government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, which came to
power after the crisis erupted, has made financial restructuring a
major priority.
	   Tarrin deflected criticism by the political opposition that
Chuan's government was focusing on helping the rich at the expense
of the poor.
	   ``If we do not try to solve the liquidity problem facing
financial institutions, they will not be able to lend to the real
sector,'' he said. ``Then business will not function and workers as
well as the poor will suffer.''

Queensland tourism campaign targets Indians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Queensland Tourism Minister Bob Gibbs
on Monday announced a U.S. dlrs 120,000 (200,000 Australian dollar)
marketing campaign aimed at Indian tourists.
	   Gibbs said the campaign was the first of its type in Australia
targeting the Indian travel market.
	   ``This market has enormous potential for Queensland. Over the
last few years, visitation from India has grown annually by around
20 percent.
	   ``Australia can expect around 40,000 visitors from India this
year alone,'' he said.
	   Gibbs said the campaign would coincide with Qantas' new daily
services to Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, via Singapore.
	   ``Traditionally the Indian travel market has been attracted by
multi-destination holiday packages,'' he said.
	   ``Consumers can choose to visit two or three Australian
destinations: Sydney and the Gold Coast; Sydney and Cairns; or
Sydney, the Gold Coast and Cairns,'' he said.
	   Gibbs said the campaign would be run under the slogan: ``Rates
are way, way down, Down Under.''
	   He said the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corp. is targeting
India as one of three emerging markets with great potential for
Queensland.
	   The others are China and the Middle East.

10 hospitalized in Japan after drinking suspect green tea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police denying traces of cyanide in 2nd graf; new
comments from hospital in 5th graf &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos TOK102 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ten employees of a Japanese company were
hospitalized Monday when they complained of nausea, dizziness and
numbness after drinking tea made from a communal water heating pot,
officials said.
	   Police investigating Japan's latest poisoning scare found
initial indications of cyanide, but none showed up later in more
thorough tests of the water in the electric pot, said the Niigata
Prefectural Police in northwestern Japan.
	   So far, investigators have not identified what might have caused
the illnesses, said a police spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   An initial diagnosis by doctors pointed to something more
serious than the type of illness that might be caused by spoiled
food, said Niigata City General Hospital spokesman Akimi Takahashi.
	   ``It was apparent their symptoms were those of a poisonous
chemical,'' he said. Although doctors have not concluded what kind
of poison was used, they are ``treating the victims taking into
consideration all kinds of possibilities.''
	   The illnesses came just two weeks after four Japanese died from
eating curried rice laced with arsenic and cyanide. That case, the
latest incident to shake Japan's increasingly tenuous sense of
security, remains unsolved.
	   Niigata, on the Japan Sea coast, is 256 kilometers (159 miles)
northwest of Tokyo. The curry poisonings occurred in Wakayama, a
small coastal city 453 kilometers (283 miles) southwest of the
capital.
	   Word of the apparent poisoning topped midday television
newscasts in Japan and was reported as the lead story in evening
newspapers.
	   Emergency medical authorities received a call at 8:01 a.m.
Monday (2301 GMT Sunday) from a branch factory office of Xyence
Co., a wood preservative company, near Niigata, said Toshihide
Watanabe, a spokesman for the Niigata municipal fire department.
	   Ten of the 13 employees in the office were taken to local
hospitals after drinking the hot tea, Watanabe said.
	   Of the seven taken to Niigata City General Hospital, two had
pre-existing ailments such as asthma and were affected more
seriously than the others, the hospital spokesman said.
	   All seven were in ``stable'' condition, but continued to suffer
from headaches and numbness, he said.
	   Japan has become particularly sensitive to poisonings in the
wake of a March 1995 nerve gas attack on Tokyo subways masterminded
by a fringe religious cult. The gassing killed 12 people.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran holds Pakistan responsible for the
safety of 11 diplomats it says were captured by the Taliban Islamic
movement in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   ``We demand that Pakistan secure the release of the Islamic
Republic of Iran's diplomats promptly,'' the agency quoted Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as saying in a phone conversation
with his Pakistani counterpart, Sartaj Aziz.
	   The Taliban have denied they are holding any Iranian diplomats.
	   Forces of the hard-line Taliban blazed into the northern
opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif on Saturday, capturing the
last major Afghan city not in their hands.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to be the force behind the Taliban,
who accuse Iran of aiding an opposition coalition that was
headquartered in Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   In a separate dispatch, IRNA said that the Iranian Foreign
Ministry had received information indicating that the 11 diplomats
and an IRNA reporter, also believed detained in Mazar-e-Sharif,
were taken by the Taliban to a military air base in Shindand in
western Afghanistan.
	   The agency quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry official as
saying that a number of Iranian relief workers also had been seized
by the Taliban. The relief workers were taken to the southern city
of Kandahar, the agency said.
	   It said the information came from an anonymous caller who had
phoned the Iranian mission in Afghanistan's western Herat province.
	   Kharrazi said he rejected claims by Taliban commanders that
there was no one inside the Iranian consulate building in
Mazar-e-Sharif when it was raided by the Taliban Saturday.
	   ``The fact that the Taliban and Pakistani officials right after
the storming of the consulate assured the Iranian government of the
well being of its staff leaves no doubt that the diplomats are
being held by the militia,'' IRNA quoted Kharrazi as saying.
	   It quoted Aziz as saying that the Pakistani government had
mobilized its resources to learn about the fate of the Iranian
diplomats.

Relative of woman detained in Myanmar calls for top-level

 &UR; With BC-Myanmar-Arrests &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Negotiations for the release of an
Australian academic detained in Myanmar should be taken to the
highest level as quickly as possible, the woman's brother said
Monday.
	   Speaking at a demonstration outside Prime Minister John Howard's
Sydney office, Peter Vicary said details surrounding the detention
of his sister Alison at Yangon Airport on Sunday were sketchy.
	   Alison Vicary, 35, was one of 18 foreign activists understood to
have been detained in Yangon after handing out pamphlets calling on
the people of Myanmar, formerly called Burma, to remember a
massacre of opposition supporters 10 years ago.
	   Peter Vicary told reporters the group's actions had been
peaceful and his family wanted to secure the release of his sister,
an economics lecturer at Sydney's Macquarie University, as quickly
as possible.
	   So far, the family had had no contact with her and had no
details of her whereabouts or whether she had been charged with any
offense, he said.
	   Peter Vicary and members of several pro-democracy Myanmar
protest groups delivered a letter to Howard's office asking for his
intervention in the situation.
	   He said he also had contacted the office of Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer and was awaiting a response.
	   An Australian Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman said
Vicary might be deported shortly.
	   ``Burmese authorities have indicated that members of the group
detained may be deported in the near future,'' the spokesman said,
speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.
	   About 30 pro-democracy protesters gathered outside Howard's
office chanting slogans and holding banners.

`Outsiders' blamed for rumors of ethnic riot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot rumors that led Malaysians in
the capital to lock themselves indoors over the weekend were spread
by ``outsiders,'' officials said Monday.
	   Information Minister Information Mohamed Rahmat told reporters
that ``outsiders are purposely spreading lies to sabotage and
weaken the country.''
	   He accused rumor-mongers of abusing the Internet to spread the
fear of riots tied to the Aug. 15 deadline to deport Indonesian
immigrants without proper work papers.
	   The rumor, that Indonesians were amassing knives and machetes
and would use them against either the Chinese community or
immigration officials, had people so frightened that on Friday they
left work early, stocked up on milk and instant noodles and locked
themselves in their homes.
	   Thousands of Malaysians working in downtown Kuala Lumpur warned
one another Friday to avoid a seedy, red-light area of the city
called Chow Kit, where illegal Indonesian aliens were rumored to
have attacked police using machetes.
	   The rumors were so widespread that police set up a hot line to
deal with them, running the phone number on the front pages of
Saturday newspapers.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is livid and has vowed
to find and arrest the hearsay instigators.
	   ``We shall track down these people but all have gone into
hiding,'' he said. ``They are just cowards. If they are brave
enough, come out and say it openly.''
	   Mohamed said the rumors were spread via the Internet by people
envious of Malaysia's perseverance in the face of economic woes.
	   ``I won't point out who the culprits are but what shocked me
most is how rumors of disturbances in Chow Kit are widely
circulated in Johor Baharu,'' he said.
	   Johor Baharu is on the southern border with Singapore.
	   Mohamed said he was unsure whether the rumors had anything to do
with Malaysia's currently strained ties with Singapore.
	   The neighboring Southeast Asian countries have been locked in a
fierce debate for weeks over the shifting of a shared railroad
immigration and customs point.

Election Commission not ready for early vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's Election Commission
said Monday that it was not ready for a snap election, the national
news agency Bernama reported.
	   It quoted its chairman, Harun Din, as saying it needs between
four and five months to verify the electoral rolls before general
elections can be held.
	   ``However, the commission is prepared to conduct the polls if
the prime minister decides to dissolve Parliament earlier,''
Bernama reported Harun as saying.
	   New elections don't have to be called until the current
parliament expires in April 2000.
	   Analysts suggest the economy is set to worsen before then, and
that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is toying with the idea of
going to the voters ahead of schedule. They point to the frequency
of his visits to the nation's various states in recent weeks, and
his efforts to buttress his position that foreign speculators _ not
the government _ are to blame for the deteriorating economic
climate.
	   The government says the economy could contract by up to 2
percent this year, although private commentators say shrinkage of
up to 5 percent is in the cards.

Afghan Taliban says 30 Iranians captured in Mazar-e-Sharif
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious
militia controlled Mazar-e-Sharif Monday, where a spokesman said it
captured 30 Iranians accused of supplying weapons to the opposition
northern alliance that had held the key city.
	   There had been reports of fierce street battles in
Mazar-e-Sharif since Taliban fighters entered Saturday, with each
side claiming to have ousted the other from the city. But
independent sources who insisted on anonymity said the Taliban
controlled the city Monday and that it was calm. The sources
provided few other details.
	   The Taliban unleashed bombs and rockets on the city before
seizing it, and casualties were likely to be high. In addition,
opposition spokesman Masood Khalili accused the Sunni Muslim
Taliban of killing hundreds of civilians from the Shiite sect of
Islam.
	   The airport on the eastern edge of the city appeared to be still
contested, and alliance forces were reportedly regrouping at
Hayratan, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) east of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   The loss of Mazar-e-Sharif, some 300 kilometers (190 miles)
north of the Afghan capital Kabul, is a severe blow to an
opposition backed into a dwindling corner of northern Afghanistan.
The victory for the Taliban, whose name means ``students of
Islam,'' will likely boost their four-year-old campaign to impose
their strict interpretation of Islamic rule on the entire country.
	   The Taliban, who follow a strict version of Islam, control most
of Afghanistan, including the capital Kabul. In the parts of the
country they control, the Taliban have barred most women from work
and girls from school, banned music and ordered all men to wear
beards.
	   As the Taliban secured Mazar-e-Sharif Monday, Taliban spokesman
Abdul Manan Niayzi told The Associated Press they captured 30
Iranians accused of arming the northern alliance. He denied charges
from neighboring Iran that the Taliban were holding 11 Iranian
diplomats.
	   The 30 accused of supplying weapons ``are still alive. But I do
not know about the diplomats,'' Niayzi said. He said the diplomats
could still be hiding in Mazar-e-Sharif or may have retreated with
opposition forces south to Bamyan province.
	   The Iranian news agency reported Monday that Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi had telephoned his Pakistani counterpart to
demand the release of his diplomats. The news agency said Kharrazi
rejected Taliban claims that they found the Iranian consulate in
Mazar-e-Sharif empty.
	   Neighbors Iran and Pakistan are both accused of stoking the
Afghan civil war, the former by backing the northern alliance and
the latter by backing the Taliban.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ As hope of finding more survivors of the
embassy bombing in Nairobi dimmed, investigators focused Monday on
finding the architects of the terror at a crime scene guarded by
armed Marines and hidden from view by black fabric.
	   Nearly simultaneous blasts at the American embassies in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, were sophisticated
attacks and suspicion instantly turned to the usual suspects:
Islamic terrorists.
	   The explosions took a terrible toll: At least 200 dead in
Nairobi and nearly 5,000 injured; at least 10 dead in Dar es Salaam
and 74 injured.
	   The powerful blast in downtown Nairobi destroyed a building next
door to the embassy and damaged others blocks away. The damage in
Tanzania was far less because the embassy is in a residential area.
	   Israel army radio, in a report from Nairobi Monday, said
investigators suspect the bombers used the Czech-manufactured
Semtex, which is much more powerful than more traditional
explosives such as TNT.
	   The investigators, who were not identified, said use of the
plastic explosive, which is favored by the Irish Republican Army,
implies a big organization, or even a state, plotted the attack
because Semtex is not readily available, the radio report said.
	   But since the downfall of the Soviet bloc, Semtex has been much
more readily available on the international arms market.
	   On Monday morning, rescue teams were working to clear debris
from the badly damaged but still intact ground floor of the Ufundi
Cooperative building adjacent to the embassy which collapsed,
hoping to reach buried survivors.
	   Kenyan Red Cross workers said they are convinced there are two
women in that area, Rose and Jane.
	   ``Rose last spoke at 3 p.m. (1200 GMT) Sunday afternoon. Since
then, we've heard nothing. There's just no sound coming back. Jane
hasn't been heard of for much, much longer,'' said John Sparrow,
spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   ``This happened before, when Rose went quiet and then spoke
again. She may be asleep. She may be unconscious. So you live in
hope,'' he said.
	   On Sunday, Israeli rescuers found a mother and son in a building
near the Nairobi embassy. They were alive and well. But the
rescuers also brought out a dead woman.
	   And at the pile of concrete, steel and glass next door that once
housed a secretarial school, hopes of finding anyone alive were
slim. On Sunday and early Monday, only bodies were brought out.
	   ``There is no sign of life, but I believe in miracles,'' Farid
Abdul Kadir, a relief coordinator for the Kenyan Red Cross, said
Monday morning.

Iraqi media resume attack on chief U.N. inspector
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The daily Babil, which is published by
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son Odai, resumed its attacks Monday
on the chief U.N. weapons inspector, suggesting he profited from
prolonging the trade sanctions.
	   The paper said that Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special
Commission, aimed to ``turn off the light in order to make the
tunnel of sanctions darker.''
	   Iraq has been under U.N. trade sanctions _ which ban air travel
and the sale of its economic mainstay, oil _ since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said that the sanctions will not
be lifted until Butler and his teams certify that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, as called for in U.N.
resolutions following the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Iraq last week announced that it would no longer cooperate with
Butler on grounds he was working on behalf of the United States to
prolong the sanctions.
	   Babil noted that Iraq last week asked Butler to certify that
Iraq had eliminated its biological and chemical weapons as well as
long-range missiles. Butler responded that he did not have the
evidence to do so.
	   This, Babil said, exposed the efforts of Butler and his teams
``to keep sanctions in place to serve the American plans and ... to
continue receiving the huge salaries and privileges they get.''
	   It said that Iraq's stance had made ``the Arab and international
arena understand Iraq's views better than before.''
	   U.N. spokeswoman Janet Sullivan confirmed on Sunday that the
Special Commission has suspended new arms inspections in Iraq.
	   But Ms. Sullivan also said that long-term monitoring of
previously inspected sites was continuing. Iraq had said it would
not interfere with such monitoring.
	   In a further attempt to embarrass Butler, state-run Iraqi
television on Sunday aired its final installment of a videotape
made of Butler's meeting last week with Iraq's deputy prime
minister, Tariq Aziz.
	   Visitors to Hassan Ajmi Cafe, a well-known coffee shop in
downtown Baghdad, watched the program and said they supported the
government's actions.
	   Sadiq Chelaab, a 44-year-old teacher, said ``He (Butler) could
not say the truth. He has to go to Kuwait and the CIA before saying
anything.''
	   Iraq has long accused Kuwait of trying to prolong the sanctions
along with the United States and Britain.
	   Also at the cafe, poet Saad al-Timeemi wanted to know the cost
of continuing the inspections. The costs have been covered by a
money withheld from the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, which
allows Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to buy needed food and
medicine.
	   ``What could this money have done for the Iraqis living under
sanctions?'' he asked. ``They are making good money out of the
continuing inspections ... and we, the people, have to pay for
their business dealings.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices fell Monday for the sixth
consecutive trading day, hurt by continued weakness in banking
issues and another Japanese corporate failure. The stock market
woes lifted the U.S. dollar against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 202.75 points,
or 1.28 percent, closing at 15,626.42. The Nikkei index now has
fallen a total of 752.55 points in six trading days, including
Friday's slide of 47.05 points, or 0.30 percent.
	   Traders said bank issues lost 3.3 percent on worries that
legislation to stabilize Japan's ailing financial system may be
delayed because of resistance from opposition political parties in
Parliament to the governing party's proposals.
	   Market sentiment also worsened on news that Mita Industrial Co.,
a Japanese maker of copy machines, filed for court protection from
its creditors under the country's corporate rehabilitation law,
traders said.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi faced blistering criticism as he
fielded questions from opposition lawmakers in Parliament Monday
for the first time since becoming prime minister last month.
	   ``Without new policies there will be no reforms. We must
dissolve Parliament,'' Kansei Nakano, a member of Japan's largest
opposition party, the Democratic Party, said in the lower house
session.
	   Ignoring his demand, Obuchi replied that he would ``exert all
his energy'' to resolving the nation's economic problems.
	   Investors are worried that the Parliament may fail to pass
financial reform bills in the current special session ending Oct.
7, delaying solution to the bad loan problems, traders said.
	   ``The environment surrounding banks is becoming more severe,''
said Masatoshi Sato, manager of the investor information group at
Kankaku Securities.
	   Sato said the possible delay in solving the bad debt problem,
increasing corporate bankruptcies and the yen's weakening are all
hurting banking issues.
	   Among losers, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi fell 45 yen to 1,225 yen,
Sumitomo Bank shed 62 yen to 1,162 yen, and Long-Term Credit Bank
plunged 6 yen, or 12.2 percent, closing at 43 yen _ a record low.
	   LTCB shares fell after the London-based newspaper Financial
Times reported that the future of the alliance between LTCB and UBS
AG remains uncertain. UBS is the new bank formed from the merger of
Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section declined 18.21 points, or 1.49 percent, to 1,207.09.
It had slipped 1.79 points, or 0.15 percent, on Friday.
	   Trading was moderate, with an estimated 363 million shares
changing hands on the first section, down from Friday's 370
million. Declines outnumbered advances 1,014 to 152, with 101
issues unchanged.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 146.65 yen, up 1.11 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also higher than its New York rate of
146.13 yen late Friday. It ranged between 145.99 yen and 146.70 yen
in Monday's trading.
	   Traders said overseas players were buying dollars in the
afternoon after Tokyo stock prices fell.
	   ``The selling of Japanese bank stocks and the virtual collapse
of a leading copy machine maker are proof that the Japanese economy
is weak,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange
at ABN AMRO Bank.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.170 percent from Friday's close of 1.195 percent,
driving its price up to 112.00 yen from 111.82 yen last Friday.

Ex-president's son-in-law questioned over kidnappings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A military tribunal questioned a
senior general and son-in-law of former President Suharto on Monday
over the kidnappings of political activists.
	   Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto is a former commander of Indonesia's
special forces, which have been implicated in abductions of
Suharto's opponents since last year.
	   Prabowo's testimony to the tribunal, known as an ``honor
council,'' was given behind closed doors at the military's
headquarters in central Jakarta.
	   Officials did not comment on his appearance.
	   Last month, Prabowo said he was ready to take responsibility for
the kidnappings if it were proven his troops were responsible.
	   He has since been suspended from duty pending the investigation
by the tribunal of seven generals.
	   Human rights activists have accused top military brass of
ordering the abductions.
	   Under new, reform-minded President B.J. Habibie, the military
has pledged to pursue those implicated in human rights abuses.
	   Indonesia's military commander, Gen. Wiranto, has said the
tribunal will determine whether Prabowo, one other general and
another officer were involved.
	   He also said 10 lower-ranking soldiers arrested in the case will
be tried in a military court.
	   More than two dozen activists were allegedly kidnapped. At least
14 are still missing, according to human rights groups.
	   Those that have been released said they were abducted, tortured
and questioned about their political activities.
	   Prabowo is widely regarded as a rival of Wiranto.
	   The ambitious and brash Prabowo is a controversial figure whose
fast-rising career was sidelined after the sudden downfall of his
father-in-law.
	   Soon after Suharto resigned amid riots and student protests in
May, Wiranto transferred Prabowo from his powerful command to head
a military college.
	   A separate government team investigating May's riots is also
expected to question Prabowo on allegations of military involvement
in the violence, in which 1,200 people were killed and thousands of
building were looted, damaged or burned.

Canada replaces Indonesia as lender in Thai IMF bailout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Canada took Indonesia's place Monday as
a lender in the dlrs 17.2 billion credit line arranged for Thailand
by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Indonesia found itself unable to meet its commitment to a dlrs
500 million contribution when its own economy collapsed after the
Thai program was arranged last August.
	   Canadian Ambassador Bernard Giroux and Bank of Thailand Governor
Chatu Mongol Sonakul signed an agreement Monday at a ceremony
presided over by Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda.
	   The Thai credit line consists of dlrs 4 billion to come directly
from the IMF, dlrs 10.5 billion from bilateral pledges, and dlrs
2.7 billion from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   Tarrin said that out of the dlrs 500 million Canadian
contribution, dlrs 360 million can be drawn immediately.

AFC welcomes life ban on Hong Kong player
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Asian Football Confederation
on Monday welcomed the life ban against a Hong Kong soccer player
for conspiring to fix a World Cup qualifying match last year.
	   Chan Tsz-kong pleaded guilty and was sentenced last month to one
year in prison. The 26-year-old striker admitted to conspiring with
teammates to give up two goals in a World Cup qualifying match
between Hong Kong and Thailand last March in Bangkok. Hong Kong
lost the game 2-0.
	   Of a total 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 25,641) received from
a bookmaker, radio reported that Chan kept 80,000 Hong Kong dollars
(dlrs 10,256) and gave the rest to his co-conspirators.
	   AFC general secretary Peter Vellapan said Monday the life ban
and prison term would serve as a deterrent in the battle to rid the
game of corrupt players and officials.
	   He said that as soon as the AFC was officially informed of the
life ban, it would take steps to work with the world soccer group
FIFA to impose a worldwide ban against Chan.
	   ``We must send a clear signal to all those involved in the
business and competition that neither AFC nor FIFA will tolerate
such criminal acts,'' he said. ``The game is better off without
corrupt individuals.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Joint ventures between the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd and United Bank of Switzerland will be renamed to drop
reference to the troubled Japanese bank, officials said Monday.
	   However, the move will affect neither the structure and
management of the joint ventures nor their legal names, said a
spokesman for LTCB Warburg, who requested anonymity.
	   The investment bank joint venture between LTCB and UBS will now
be called Warburg Dillon Read, instead of LTCB Warburg. The asset
management alliance will be renamed UBS Brinson Asset Management
from LTCB UBS Brinson.
	   The companies decided to change the global brand names of their
joint ventures earlier this month to take advantage of names that
enjoy world-wide recognition, the LTCB Warburg spokesman said.
	   The brand name change has sparked speculation that the LTCB-UBS
alliance is in trouble. The Financial Times reported Monday that
UBS is thinking of buying out LTCB's portion of the joint ventures,
but didn't cite any sources.
	   LTCB was reported in June to be on the verge of collapse after
Moody's Investors Services downgraded its debt and its share prices
became almost worthless overnight.
	   LTCB later announced it was in talks to merge with Sumitomo
Trust Bank _ a move that was widely assumed to have been
coordinated as a virtual bailout for LTCB.
	   UBS is the new bank formed from the merger of Union Bank of
Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp. LTCB and Swiss Bank Corp. agreed
to launch joint ventures in investment banking and asset management
in July, 1997.

	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Queensland Tourism Minister Bob Gibbs
on Monday announced a U.S. dlrs 120,000 (200,000 Australian dollar)
marketing campaign aimed at Indian tourists.
	   Gibbs said the campaign was the first of its type in Australia
targeting the Indian travel market.
	   ``This market has enormous potential for Queensland. Over the
last few years, visitation from India has grown annually by around
20 percent.
	   ``Australia can expect around 40,000 visitors from India this
year alone,'' he said.
	   Gibbs said the campaign would coincide with Qantas' new daily
services to Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, via Singapore.
	   ``Traditionally the Indian travel market has been attracted by
multi-destination holiday packages,'' he said.
	   ``Consumers can choose to visit two or three Australian
destinations: Sydney and the Gold Coast; Sydney and Cairns; or
Sydney, the Gold Coast and Cairns,'' he said.
	   Gibbs said the campaign would be run under the slogan: ``Rates
are way, way down, Down Under.''
	   He said the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corp. is targeting
India as one of three emerging markets with great potential for
Queensland.
	   The others are China and the Middle East.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Management and union negotiators sat
down Monday for the first time in a week to try to settle a
three-week-old strike at Hyundai Motor Co. over layoffs.
	   But with both sides apparently holding fast to their positions
and little progress expected, the government was reported ready to
break up the strike with police force.
	   Hyundai Motor's 26,000-member union wants the nation's largest
automaker to take back 1,600 employees it fired July 31 because of
sharply falling domestic sales.
	   The company, which earlier got rid of 6,100 workers by offering
them enhanced early retirement packages, insists it has to reduce
its work force in line with slumping demand for its cars.
	   Hyundai Motor, a subsidiary of Hyundai group, South Korea's
second largest conglomerate, has been operating at 40 percent of
its annual capacity of 1.25 million cars.
	   The union proposed a reduction in working hours or a
work-sharing program to avoid layoffs, but the company rejected
that as a makeshift solution.
	   About 10,000 union workers rallied Monday at Hyundai Motor's
plants at Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Seoul,
where they have been picketing since July 20.
	   ___
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia faces its worst international
economic environment in decades as the recovery of its major Asian
trading partners lags behind forecasts, an Access Economics report
said Monday.
	   The respected independent economics forecaster said that while
strong domestic demand in early 1998 had buffered Australia against
external weakness, domestic demand had weakened.
	   ``Asia may cut Australian activity to a crawl by the first half
of 1999,'' said its June quarter five-year business outlook report.
	   The momentum in the economy was ``sufficient for job growth'' to
continue in 1998 and for output growth to exceed budget forecasts
for 1997-98 and 1998-99, the report said.
	   Access Economics said that the budget had assumed 1.75 percent
economic growth among Australia's major trading partners, but it
had cut its projection to 0.40 percent.
	   Downward pressure on the Australian dollar, domestic demand and
rising labor costs would add to higher prices next year with
underlying inflation expected to pass 3 percent, the report said.
	   ___
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will close at least three of
15 commercial banks in a much-awaited financial sector shakeup
aimed at reviving the battered economy, the finance minister said
in an interview published Monday.
	   The bank closures should be announced Saturday as part of a
package of reforms following negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund on the latest installment of its dlrs 17.2 billion
bailout for the Thai economy.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda declined, in an interview
with the Bangkok Post, to single out any institution to be closed
but signaled that the government would not propose a plan to bail
out shareholders or bad management.
	   ``A bailout of shareholders, a bailout of bad management ... is
impossible,'' Tarrin was quoted as saying, but depositors,
creditors and borrowers would be fully protected.
	   Widely expected is the merger of three state-run banks _ Siam
City Bank, First Bangkok City Bank and Bangkok Metropolitan Bank.
	   The fourth state-run bank, Bangkok Bank of Commerce, may be put
up for sale to foreign investors.
	   Tarrin said the Thai economy should start to bottom out in the
first quarter of 1999 provided the government's efforts aren't
neutralized by outside developments.

Prisoners in Hague tribunal jail planning uprising, doctor says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Prisoners held by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia have discussed plans for an
uprising following the death of a Serb suspect during his trial, a
Serb doctor said Monday.
	   Slobodan Ivanovic visited the tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, last week, shortly after the death of Milan Kovacevic,
a Bosnian Serb charged with genocide and crimes against humanity.
	   Kovacevic was reported to have died of a heart attack in his
prison cell. But Ivanovic said Kovacevic died slowly and painfully
from a ruptured aorta. He said Kovacevic appealed for help for five
hours, but guards failed to appear.
	   ``All prisoners, Serb, Croat and Muslim, banged their doors to
call for the guards. They pressed the alarm bells but there was no
response. When the prison cells were finally opened all the
prisoners rushed to help Kovacevic,'' Belgrade's Beta news agency
quoted Ivanovic as saying.
	   Ivanovic said Kovacevic's death had a bad effect on the
prisoners, most of whom are in deep depression.
	   ``What is more, an uprising had been planned and a general
strike,'' said Ivanovic.
	   The status of such plans since his visit on Aug. 1 wasn't clear.
	   The charges against Kovacevic, a former anesthesiologist and
Prijedor mayor, stemmed from alleged atrocities committed against
Muslims and Croats at three infamous prison camps in the Prijedor
region in northwestern Bosnia in 1992. He had pleaded innocent to
all charges.
	   The Yugoslav government has protested Kovacevic's death, saying
he was denied proper hospital treatment. The tribunal rejected the
accusation as unfounded.
	   U.N. troops in Bosnia arrested Kovacevic in July last year in
Prijedor. The town's authorities warned U.N. officials not to
attend the funeral, saying it could trigger unrest.

Hong Kong share prices close generally higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed
generally higher Monday after three consecutive sessions of sharp
declines.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 16.21 points, or 0.2 percent, closing at 7,034.62. On Friday,
the index had slumped 235.95 points.
	   Turnover fell to 3.429 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 439
million) from Friday's 5.28 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
676 million).
	   Brokers attributed the rise to a technical rebound following the
easing of speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar.
	   Alan Hutcheson, director of research at Pacific Challenge
Securities Ltd., said the easing of local interbank interest rates
helped stabilize the market. The overnight Hong Kong Interbank
Offered Rate was quoted at 6.50 percent, down from 7.75 percent
late Friday.
	   The index lost 12 percent last week on concerns about the
pressure on the Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged to the U.S.
currency, and China's ability to resist devaluing the yuan.
	   Among gainers, Cheung Kong rose 1 Hong Kong dollar to 30.90,
Hang Seng Bank rose 70 cents to 38.10, HSBC Holdings rose 50 cents
to 162.00, and Hutchison Whampoa also rose 50 cents to 33.10.

	   Ivanovic said Kovacevic's death had a bad effect on the
prisoners, most of whom reportedly suffer from depression.
	   ``What is more, an uprising had been planned and a general
strike,'' said Ivanovic.
	   The status of such plans since his visit on Aug. 1 wasn't clear.
	   The charges against Kovacevic, a former anesthesiologist and
Prijedor mayor, stemmed from alleged atrocities committed against
Muslims and Croats at three infamous prison camps in the Prijedor
region in northwestern Bosnia in 1992. He had pleaded innocent to
all charges.
	   The Yugoslav government has protested Kovacevic's death, saying
he was denied proper hospital treatment. The tribunal rejected the
accusation as unfounded.
	   U.N. troops in Bosnia arrested Kovacevic in July last year in
Prijedor. The town's authorities warned U.N. officials not to
attend the funeral, saying it could trigger unrest.

Prisoners in Hague tribunal jail planning uprising, doctor says

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tribunal press office saying nothing known about
uprising plan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Prisoners held by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia have discussed plans for an
uprising following the death of a Serb suspect during his trial, a
Serb doctor said Monday.
	   Slobodan Ivanovic visited the tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, last week, shortly after the death of Milan Kovacevic,
a Bosnian Serb charged with genocide and crimes against humanity.
	   Kovacevic was reported to have died of a heart attack in his
prison cell. But Ivanovic said Kovacevic died slowly and painfully
from a ruptured aorta. He said Kovacevic appealed for help for five
hours, but guards failed to appear.
	   ``All prisoners, Serb, Croat and Muslim, banged their doors to
call for the guards. They pressed the alarm bells but there was no
response. When the prison cells were finally opened all the
prisoners rushed to help Kovacevic,'' Belgrade's Beta news agency
quoted Ivanovic as saying.
	   Ivanovic said Kovacevic's death had a bad effect on the
prisoners, most of whom are in deep depression.
	   ``What is more, an uprising had been planned and a general
strike,'' said Ivanovic.
	   The status of such plans since his visit on Aug. 1 wasn't clear.
	   Asked about a potential uprising, a representative of the U.N.
tribunal press office who declined to be named said: ``Nothing is
known to us. ... If there are complaints, they are always dealt
with.'

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime signaled Monday
it was in no hurry to free 18 foreign pro-democracy activists who
were still being questioned in police custody a day after being
arrested for handing out anti-government leaflets.
	   The government displayed the leaflets, which urged Myanmar's
people to remember a nationwide uprising against military rule 10
years ago and to keep struggling, at a news conference where the
activists were accused of trying to incite unrest.
	   Those detained include six U.S. citizens from the Free Burma
Coalition and three Malaysians, three Indonesians, three Thais, two
Philippine nationals and an Australian from similar groups opposed
to the government of Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Embassies have said they are seeking access to their citizens
and are trying to negotiate their release, but government spokesman
Lt. Col. Hla Min gave no sign that their release was imminent.
	   ``They are being detained while investigations continue,'' Hla
Min said. ``They are being kept separately at two police guest
houses. No decision has been made yet about what legal action will
be taken against them.''
	   The guest houses are generally more comfortable than Myanmar's
jails and prisons. A British-Australian was freed Thursday three
months into a five-year term in the notorious Insein Prison, where
hundreds of political prisoners are kept, for handing out leaflets
on behalf of a rebel group.
	   Asked whether that case could serve as a guide, Hla Min said:
``We need to discourage these groups.''
	   Reporters were shown front-and-back photographs of the detainees
taken in detention, wearing T-shirts urging people to remember
8-8-88, representing the Aug. 8, 1988, uprising date.
	   Overseas opposition groups had anticipated that Saturday's
anniversary of the uprising could lead to new demonstrations. But
on that day, Myanmar was calm. Neither the government nor rebel
groups reported any unrest.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar since 1962. The 1988
demonstrations resulted in a change of leaders but eventually were
crushed by bullets and bayonets. An estimated 3,000 people died.
	   The foreigners distributed their leaflets Sunday, which was
otherwise calm, at different sites in Yangon. Twelve were arrested
downtown and six at the airport while trying to leave.
	   The Bangkok-based alliance of anti-government groups that sent
them into the country urged their immediate release.
	   Most of the activists were students, but there were also
professors, lawyers and a businessman. They ranged in age from 19
to 51. Ten were men and eight women.
	   ``They were well aware they might be arrested,'' said Debbie
Stothard, coordinator for the Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma,
one of the groups involved, though she denied arrest was a goal.
	   Stothard said the activists had operated in small groups to
avoid violating illegal assembly laws. She refused to confirm or
deny that all activists sent to Myanmar had been arrested.
	   The detainees have health concerns including asthma, migraines,
allergies to bee stings and penicillin, hearing problems and
intolerance to dairy products.
	   Official newspapers _ the only kind permitted _ carried a speech
by Gen. Tin Oo, one of the top four generals of the ruling State
Peace and Development Council, urging Myanmar's youths to
``annihilate'' dangers to the nation.
	   Tin Oo said traitors were ``trying to belittle the achievements
of the government, to cause misunderstanding and to induce
international pressure on the government.''
	   The general was referring to opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi,
winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, and her National League for
Democracy, landslide winner of parliamentary elections in 1990. The
military never allowed the parliament to meet.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, has recently stepped up pressure on the government
to open a dialogue with her and has set an Aug. 21 deadline for the
military to convene the parliament.
	   In Manila, Mercy Ferrer, representing one of the Philippine
groups involved, said the government should sit down and negotiate
with Suu Kyi's party.
	   ``Myanmar's junta is making their isolation worse,'' Ferrer
said. ``There is no way out, because all their moves are isolating
them.''

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Monday condemned the bombings of the

efforts in checking all kinds of terrorist acts,'' Tang said in
remarks published by the state-run Xinhua News Agency.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A military tribunal questioned a
senior general and son-in-law of former President Suharto for six
hours Monday over the kidnappings of political activists.
	   Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto is a former commander of Indonesia's
special forces, which have been implicated in abductions of
Suharto's opponents since last year.
	   Prabowo's testimony to the tribunal, known as an ``honor
council,'' was given behind closed doors at the military's
headquarters in central Jakarta.
	   Prabowo, who appeared in full uniform, left in a four-car convoy
without speaking to waiting reporters after his appearance.
	   Officials later declined to disclose the content of his
testimony, which is expected to continue Wednesday.
	   ``We are still investigating this case,'' said army chief of
staff Gen. Subagyo Hadisiswoyo, who heads the tribunal.
	   ``We want a fast investigation, but we do not want to be
rushed,'' he said.
	   Last week, Subagyo reportedly said earlier testimony from other
witnesses alleged that Prabowo, 46, bore the greatest
responsibility in the abductions.
	   Last month, Prabowo said he was ready to take responsibility for
the kidnappings if his troops were found guilty.
	   He has since been suspended from duty pending the investigation
by the tribunal of seven generals.
	   Human rights activists have accused top military brass of
ordering the abductions.
	   Under new, reform-minded President B.J. Habibie, the military
has pledged to pursue those implicated in human rights abuses.
	   Indonesia's military commander, Gen. Wiranto, has said the
tribunal will determine whether Prabowo, one other general and
another officer were involved.
	   He also said 10 lower-ranking soldiers arrested in the case will
be tried in a military court.
	   More than two dozen activists were allegedly kidnapped. At least
14 are still missing, according to human rights groups.
	   Those that have been released said they were abducted, tortured
and questioned about their political activities.
	   Prabowo is widely regarded as a rival of Wiranto.
	   The ambitious and brash Prabowo is a controversial figure whose
fast-rising career was sidelined after the sudden downfall of his
father-in-law.
	   Soon after Suharto resigned amid riots and student protests in
May, Wiranto transferred Prabowo from his powerful command to head
a military college.
	   A separate government team investigating May's riots is also
expected to question Prabowo on allegations of military involvement
in the violence, in which 1,200 people were killed and thousands of
building were looted, damaged or burned.

Police warn of possible extremist attacks in southern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Police stepped up security Monday
against possible terrorist attacks in the southern Philippines
following bomb explosions outside U.S. embassies in Nairobi and
Tanzania over the weekend.
	   Brig. Gen. Dominador Resos said police on Mindanao Island have
been alerted against possible terrorist actions and attacks on
foreigners, especially Americans, by a Muslim extremist group, the
Abu Sayyaf.
	   Resos said the Abu Sayyaf, which means ``Father of the
Executioner,'' may follow up attacks by suspected Islamic
terrorists in Africa.
	   On Saturday, bombs exploded in nearly simultaneous attacks on
U.S. embassies that left at least 200 people dead and about 5,000
injured in Nairobi and 10 people dead and 74 injured in Tanzania.
	   The Abu Sayyaf is the more militant of two Muslim rebel groups
fighting the government. The government has not officially started
peace talks with the Abu Sayyaf.
	   In 1995, the group was accused of killing 50 people and razing
the town center of Ipil in Zamboanga del Sur province.
	   The group also has been suspected of involvement in bombing
attacks. It announced its formation in 1991 by bombing the
missionary ship Doulos, killing a New Zealander and a Swede and
injuring 30 other missionaries.
	   The largest Muslim rebel group, the Moro National Liberation
Front, signed a peace pact with the government in 1996.

Philippine president decides not to stop first execution

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with human rights advocate saying Echegaray is
depressed, crying in jail in grafs 10-11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said Monday
he has decided not to pardon a convicted rapist who is likely to
become the first criminal executed in the Philippines since the
death penalty was restored in 1994.
	   Estrada said Leo Echegaray, a poor carpenter who twice raped his
10-year-old stepdaughter, did not commit his crime out of poverty.
	   ``I will not condone this,'' Estrada said in a radio interview.
``I am sad to say that this is my decision.''
	   Estrada, who won the May 11 elections on a pro-poor platform,
acknowledged that many of the more than 600 people who have been
sentenced to death are poor.
	   ``If he killed somebody because he needed food for his family or
he's going hungry, maybe I could forgive him,'' Estrada said. ``But
rape is an act of an animal and it should not be forgiven.''
	   He said Echegaray's execution would deter more rapes, a rampant
crime.
	   A lower court convicted Echegaray of raping his stepdaughter in
1994. In 1996, the Supreme Court upheld the decision.
	   In 1997, the highest court affirmed its earlier decision, saying
Echegaray ``must be permanently prevented'' from repeating his
crime. It later said he could be executed by lethal injection
between Feb. 27 and Aug. 27, 1998.
	   In February this year, however, it stopped a lower court from
fixing a specific date until the Supreme Court has ruled on a
petition by Echegaray's lawyers questioning the constitutionality
of execution by lethal injection.
	   Human rights advocate Maria Socorro Diokno said some priests who
visited Echegaray last week found him depressed and at one point
crying, worrying over his family's future once he is executed.
	   Diokno is secretary-general of the Free Legal Assistance Group,
an organization of lawyers providing legal help to Echegaray and
other death row convicts.
	   The 1987 constitution abolished the death penalty, but a law
that took effect in January 1994 restored it for 13 ``heinous
crimes'' including rape, murder and drug trafficking.
	   Opponents say many people sentenced to death are unable to
afford good lawyers, and that the crime rate has not declined
despite the restoration of capital punishment.
	   Proponents, however, say the penalty has not yet sent its
message to would-be criminals because no one has been executed
under the 1994 law.
	   The Supreme Court automatically reviews death sentences. The
president can stop executions by granting executive clemency or a
commutation of the sentence.

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTOWN, St. Kitts and Nevis (AP) _ With a lack of fanfare
entirely appropriate to their reserved ways, residents of the tiny
Caribbean island of Nevis staged a simple road rally for a mighty
goal: independence.
	   ``Do the right thing! Love Nevis!'' blared loudspeakers atop a
pickup truck that, with about 20 other vehicles, made the 25-mile
(40-kilometer) drive around the rocky island urging residents to
vote Monday to secede from Nevis' federation with St. Kitts.
	   Residents cheered ``Yes!'' from the porches of their clapboard
homes set amid the ruins of sugar plantations from the British
colonial era. Others gave the thumbs-up sign and waved at friends
in the caravan.
	   A two-thirds ``Yes'' vote in the referendum could make Nevis one
of the world's smallest nations with a population of 9,000. With
only 6,785 registered voters, results were expected late Monday.
	   ``The people of Nevis want to be in control of their affairs.
That is the issue at hand. There is no other issue,'' Nevis Premier
Vance Amory, the force behind the secessionist movement, told about
150 supporters at a Charlestown rally late Sunday.
	   Amory leads the Nevis Island Legislature, which handles local
affairs on this 36-square-mile (93 sq. kms) island and scheduled
the referendum for independence from St. Kitts, population 32,000.
	   Noting that Nevis already has limited autonomy, Amory dismissed
criticism that Nevis' size could put it at the mercy of the
shifting winds of global trade or, as some fear, global drug
trafficking cartels. Questions about federal police protection,
diplomatic links to international bodies like the United Nations,
and shared tax revenues with St. Kitts will be discussed after the
vote, he said.
	   Like Amory, many Nevisians complain that they are treated as
second-class citizens by larger St. Kitts, and they're committed to
going it alone.
	   ``You have to creep first before you walk. But one of these days
you're going to get there,'' said Edmund Gumbs, 35. ``Still, I
would like us to separate lovingly, with no violence.''
	   The secession threat alarmed the federal government based in St.
Kitts, which with Nevis won independence from Britain in 1983.
Prime Minister Denzil Douglas frets that no one has bothered to
discuss how to divide public property or handle customs,
immigration and territorial issues without unraveling the islands'
complex family, political and trade ties.
	   ``A veritable Pandora's box of problems would come cascading
down on the people of St. Kitts and Nevis,'' Douglas said in urging
a ``No'' vote. ``Let us not fight against the current of history.''
	   Caribbean and U.S. officials have echoed his sentiments, saying
privately that a breakaway Nevis could be vulnerable to drug
cartels, unable to pay international bills and become a liability
to a Caribbean trade bloc that is in the process of welcoming
impoverished Haiti.
	   But Amory _ who embarked on the secessionist drive in earnest in
1996 _ argues that while Nevis contributes 38 percent of the
Eastern Caribbean nation's dlrs 85 million budget, it receives only
21 percent.
	   Amory also argues that Nevis is better equipped than some former
Soviet states for independence, boasting a fledgling offshore
financial industry, a stable currency tied to the U.S. dollar and a
growing tourist industry.
	   ``Small is not an indication of capability,'' he said to polite
applause late Sunday. ``A number of large countries in the world
are a lot worse off.''

Heroin addicts in Canberra may get supervised shooting galleries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Special clinics may be established in
Australia's national capital to provide heroin addicts with a safe
place to inject the illegal drug, the territorial government's
health minister said Monday.
	   Sometimes known as ``shooting galleries,'' the clinics would
provide addicts with medical supervision and a clean environment to
use heroin, although the drug would remain illegal. Clinic users
would not be prosecuted.
	   The plan is the latest in a number of ``harm minimization''
proposals that some state and territorial governments have recently
considered to try to remove drug addicts from the streets.
	   Last year, local authorities in Canberra moved to set up a
heroin trial that would have allowed some registered addicts free
access to the drug, under a plan designed to wean them from it.
	   Conservative Prime Minister John Howard overruled that plan, and
announced instead a new national drugs strategy based on ``zero
tolerance.''
	   In February, a proposal to introduce special clinics was floated
in Australia's most heavily populated state, New South Wales, but
eventually rejected.
	   The proposal for Canberra was revived in a report by Professor
Peter Baume of the University of New South Wales.
	   ``We are looking at it very favorably,'' said Michael Moore, the
Australian Capital Territory's health minister. ``It is about
reaching out to users and making sure we can assist them.''
	   Baume said heroin users should not be made criminals because of
their addiction.
	   ``None of us want our kids exposed to drug use, but the fact is
they are,'' Baume said.
	   ``Some will float in and out of heroin use and our job is to
make sure that they will suffer as little harm as possible on the
way through.''

Prisoners in Hague tribunal jail planning uprising, doctor says

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Prisoners held by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia have discussed plans for
an uprising following the death of a Serb suspect during his trial,
a Serb doctor said Monday.
	   Slobodan Ivanovic visited the tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, last week, shortly after the death of Milan Kovacevic,
a Bosnian Serb charged with genocide and crimes against humanity.
	   Kovacevic was reported to have died of a heart attack in his
prison cell. But Ivanovic said Kovacevic died slowly and painfully
from a ruptured aorta. He said Kovacevic appealed for help for five
hours, but guards failed to appear.
	   ``All prisoners, Serb, Croat and Muslim, banged their doors to
call for the guards. They pressed the alarm bells but there was no
response. When the prison cells were finally opened all the
prisoners rushed to help Kovacevic,'' Belgrade's Beta news agency
quoted Ivanovic as saying.
	   Ivanovic said Kovacevic's death had a bad effect on the
prisoners, most of whom reportedly suffer from depression.
	   ``What is more, an uprising had been planned and a general
strike,'' said Ivanovic.
	   The status of such plans since his visit on Aug. 1 wasn't clear.
	   Asked about a potential uprising, a representative of the U.N.
tribunal press office who declined to be named said: ``Nothing is
known to us. ... If there are complaints, they are always dealt
with.'

Police seal off center of Seychelles capital in bomb scare

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ Police sealed off the center of the
Seychelles capital Monday following a bomb scare at the British
High Commission.
	   High Commissioner John Yapp said an anoymous caller telephoned
shortly before 11 a.m. (0700gmt) to say a bomb would go off 15
minutes later in the building.
	   Yapp said police were contacted immediately, and they evacuated
the building and an adjacent one that houses of offices of the
United States Consulate.
	   The bomb scare was believed to be a hoax carried out in the wake
of terrorist bombings of U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania Friday.
	   The British High Commission moved a few months ago to the third
floor of the new Oliaji Trade Center.
	   The building is acros the street from the Seychelles Supreme
Court which suffered minor damages earlier this year after a small
device exploded there.
	   In June, another small explosion partially destroyed a
controversial monument commemorating the anniversary of 1977 coup
that brought President France-Albert Rene to power.

Prime Minister Vajpayee criticizes U.S. denial of visa to Indian
</HEADLINE>
scientists &QL; 
 &UR; By RAMOLA TALWAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
complained Monday that the denial of visas to Indian nuclear
scientists by the United States and Britain was ``unjustified and
futile.''
	   ``It is not going to discourage the Indian scientists in pursuit
of research and development,'' Vajpayee said in a speech marking
the 50th anniversary of the Bhabha Atomic Research Center.
	   More than 75 Indian scientists working in U.S. laboratories on
fellowship and exchange programs were asked to leave by the Clinton
administration after India carried out five nuclear tests in May.
Four Indian nuclear scientists also were denied visas to attend
scientific meetings in the United States and Britain.
	   India, the prime minister said, was prepared to participate in a
nondiscriminatory treaty on nonproliferation and nuclear
disarmament. India says the existing treaties protect the arsenals
of the five recognized nuclear powers.
	   ``The key word is collective endeavor. A few nations are sitting
on huge stockpiles,'' he said. ``As a nation of one billion people,
India cannot be party to an unfair world order,'' Vajpayee said.
	   He referred to the growing power shortage in India and promised
to accelerate the long-stalled nuclear power program. ``In the last
seven years, only two nuclear power plants have gone critical,'' he
said.
	   India has a target of producing 20,000 mega watts of nuclear
power by the year 2020. At present, only 1,800 mega watts were
produced by India's 10 nuclear power reactors. ``The main challenge
is to provide cheap power and to increase electricity production,''
he said.

Philippine central bank raises key interest rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Central Bank announced
Monday it will raise its key overnight borrowing rate to 15 percent
from 13 percent in an effort to slow the peso's rapid depreciation.
	   The central bank also raised its overnight lending rate to 17
percent from 15 percent, also effective Tuesday.
	   The rise in overnight rates appeared to have an immediate
calming effect on the market, with many banks reducing their offer
rates for the dollar. Higher interest rates tend to make a currency
more attractive to investors.
	   Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said the decision to raise
the rates was taken in response to the peso's sharp depreciation.
	   Singson noted that from a closing rate of 42.70 pesos to the
U.S. dollar on Thursday, the peso had weakened to 43.49 pesos
Friday and 44.79 pesos in afternoon trading Monday.
	   ``Banks said the fall in the peso was caused in part by
speculation and some panic in the market,'' Singson said.
	   In contrast, ``it was observed that the other currencies in the
region, particularly the Thai baht, Indonesian rupiah and Malaysian
ringgit, have remained generally stable,'' Singson said.
	   Fears of a devaluation in the Chinese yuan and further declines
in the yen have exerted heavy pressure on the peso, triggering
heavy speculative dollar buying on concerns the local currency
would depreciate further.
	   After losing a costly battle to defend the peso from speculative
attack in July 1997, the central bank has avoided depleting its
foreign reserves to defend the peso by direct market intervention.
	   Instead, it has used interest rates to stabilize the peso in
volatile market conditions.
	   The central bank has said, however, it would be prepared to
intervene in cases of extreme volatility.
	   Earlier this year, it secured a dlrs 1.4 billion precautionary
loan arrangement with the International Monetary Fund to boost its
foreign reserves.
	   Foreign reserves at the end of June totaled dlrs 10.6 billion.

`Outsiders' blamed for rumors of ethnic riot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with source of rumors reportedly found &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Authorities said Monday they had
traced the source of riot rumors that led Malaysians in the capital
to lock themselves indoors over the weekend.
	   Home Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali told reporters that those who
started the rumors Friday would be arrested and detained under the
dreaded Internal Security Act, which provides for detention without
trial for up to two years.
	   ``We have to take the most stern action. We fear that with the
advent of (next month's) 16th Commonwealth Games, more rumors will
be floated,'' he told the national news agency Bernama. ``We're
warning (that) those trying to derail the Commonwealth Games are
also trying to sabotage the country and we'll resort to the
toughest action.''
	   Information Minister Information Mohamed Rahmat said earlier
Monday that ``outsiders are purposely spreading lies to sabotage
and weaken the country.''
	   He accused rumor-mongers of abusing the Internet to spread the
fear of riots tied to the Aug. 15 deadline to deport Indonesian
immigrants without proper work papers.
	   The rumor, that Indonesians were amassing knives and machetes
and would use them against either the Chinese community or
immigration officials, had people so frightened Friday that they
left work early, stocked up on milk and instant noodles and locked
themselves in their homes.
	   Thousands of Malaysians working in downtown Kuala Lumpur warned
one another Friday to avoid a seedy, red-light area of the city
called Chow Kit, where illegal Indonesian aliens were rumored to
have attacked police using machetes.
	   The rumors were so widespread that police set up a hot line to
deal with them, running the phone number on the front pages of
Saturday newspapers.
	   Mohamed said the rumors were spread via the Internet by people
envious of Malaysia's perseverance in the face of economic woes.
	   ``I won't point out who the culprits are but what shocked me
most is how rumors of disturbances in Chow Kit are widely
circulated in Johor Baharu,'' he said.
	   Johor Baharu is on the southern border with Singapore.
	   Mohamed said he was unsure whether the rumors had anything to do
with Malaysia's strained ties with Singapore.
	   The neighboring Southeast Asian countries have been locked in a
fierce debate for weeks over the shifting of a shared railroad
immigration and customs point.
	   Tajol Rosli said police had enlisted the cooperation of the
Malaysian Institute of Microelectronics Systems to verify the
origin of last Friday's rumors.
	   He declined to give details, but said the government would not
accept any excuse from so-called cyber rumor-mongers that they were
just playing a prank.
	   ``This is not a matter of just playing pranks or for fun, this
is a question of national security and racial harmony,'' Tajol
Rosli said.

Russia ready to send second firefighting planes to Greece

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix garble &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is ready to send a second firefighting
plane to Greece to help combat raging forest and brush fires _ even
while Russia itself is being scorched by blazes _ officials said
Monday.
	   ``Athens has turned to us with a request,'' Emergency Situations
Ministry spokeswoman Irina Andrianova said. ``We couldn't have
refused.''
	   More than 3,000 wildfires were reported in Greece in July alone.
They including blazes that raged on the edge of capital Athens for
four days, prompting authorities to declare a state of emergency.
	   Russia has one Ilyushin-76 plane assisting five French and
Italian aircraft in battling the blazes, and a second Ilyushin-76
is on stand-by, ready to fly from Moscow if the fires get worse,
Andrianova said.
	   Meanwhile in the Russian Far East, fires have consumed more than
172,000 hectares (425,000 acres) of forest this summer, and
firefighters have had few successes in battling the blazes.
	   However, the Emergency Situations Ministry did not intend to
send any Ilyushin planes to the Far East, Andrianova said. Several
smaller, locally based firefighting planes were involved in
fighting the flames, she said.

movement in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   ``We demand that Pakistan secure the release of the Islamic
Republic of Iran's diplomats promptly,'' the agency quoted Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as saying in a phone conversation
with his Pakistani counterpart, Sartaj Aziz.
	   The Taliban have denied they are holding any Iranian diplomats.
	   Forces of the hard-line Taliban blazed into the northern
opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif on Saturday, capturing the
last major Afghan city not in their hands.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to be the force behind the Taliban,
who accuse Iran of aiding an opposition coalition that was
headquartered in Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   In separate dispatches, IRNA said that the Iranian Foreign
Ministry had received information indicating that the 11 diplomats
and an IRNA reporter, also believed detained in Mazar-e-Sharif,
were taken by the Taliban to a military air base in Shindand in
western Afghanistan.
	   From there, they were transferred late Sunday to the city of
Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, the agency reported. It quoted
unnamed Foreign Ministry sources who said they believed the
diplomats were in good condition.
	   An unidentified Foreign Ministry official told IRNA that a
number of Iranian relief workers also had been seized by the
Taliban and taken to Kandahar.
	   The information came from an anonymous caller who had phoned the
Iranian mission in Afghanistan's western Herat province, IRNA said.
Its reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   Kharrazi said he rejected claims by Taliban commanders that
there was no one inside the Iranian consulate building in
Mazar-e-Sharif when it was raided by the Taliban Saturday.
	   ``The fact that the Taliban and Pakistani officials right after
the storming of the consulate assured the Iranian government of the
well being of its staff leaves no doubt that the diplomats are
being held by the militia,'' IRNA quoted Kharrazi as saying.
	   It quoted Aziz as saying that the Pakistani government had
mobilized its resources to learn about the fate of the Iranian
diplomats.

Asian stock markets pulled lower by yen's fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures for all markets &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower
Monday on fears of the sinking Japanese yen dragging down local
currencies.
	   Traders said a weaker Japanese currency or a delinking of Hong
Kong's currency from the U.S. dollar could trigger a new wave of
devaluations throughout Asia.
	   In late trading, the dollar was quoted at 146.65 yen, up 1.11
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also higher than its New York
rate of 146.13 yen late Friday.
	   Thailand's key stock index tumbled 3.7 percent as investors
continued to sell banking stocks. The Stock Exchange of Thailand
index slumped 9.24 points to 238.30.
	   Malaysian shares also plummeted, with the key index slumping 2.9
percent despite another cut in local interest rates.
	   Traders said investors were worried about whether Hong Kong
would be able to maintain its dollar peg, and whether China might
be tempted to devalue its yuan because of the weakening yen.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's benchmark Composite Index fell
10.77 points to 353.28.
	   In Taiwan, share prices were also sharply lower on worries over
the continuing depreciation of the currency, analysts said. The
Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed down
157.90 points, or 2.1 percent, at 7,372.12.
	   The Taiwan dollar was quoted at 34.730 to the U.S. dollar,
compared with Friday's finish of 34.600.
	   Tokyo stock prices fell for the sixth consecutive trading day,
hurt by continued weakness in banking issues and another Japanese
corporate failure.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 202.75 points,
or 1.28 percent, closing at 15,626.42. The Nikkei index now has
fallen a total of 752.55 points in six trading days, including
Friday's slide of 47.05 points, or 0.30 percent.
	   Traders said bank issues lost 3.3 percent on worries that
legislation to stabilize Japan's ailing financial system may be
delayed because of resistance from opposition political parties in
Parliament to the governing party's proposals.
	   Market sentiment also worsened on news that Mita Industrial Co.,
a Japanese maker of copy machines, filed for court protection from
its creditors.
	   Bucking the trend was the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where prices
closed generally higher after three consecutive sessions of sharp
declines.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, rose 16.21 points, or 0.2 percent, closing at 7,034.62.
On Friday, the index had slumped 235.95 points.
	   Brokers attributed the rise to a technical rebound following the
easing of speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar.
	   Financial markets in Singapore were closed for a national
holiday.
	   Elsewhere:
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, with brokers
saying investor caution and a rise in local short-term interest
rates weighed on the market. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 30.20
points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,000.98.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower, dragged down by the
uncertain situation in the regional currency market. The Philippine
Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks fell 21.06 points, or
1.5 percent, to 1,427.66.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower. The All Ordinaries
Index of slipped 1.6 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,597.4.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on continued worries over the
weakening yen and a possible devaluation of the Chinese yuan. The
Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 2.36 points, or 0.75
percent, to 311.95.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower for the ninth consecutive
session. The Composite Index fell 2.446 points, or 0.5 percent, to
421.167.

As hopes for survivors dim, focus turns to solving mystery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tapping in rubble &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos NAI101-121, DAR101-104
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ As hope of finding more survivors of the
embassy bombing in Nairobi dimmed, investigators focused Monday on
finding the architects of the terror at a crime scene guarded by
armed Marines and hidden from view by black fabric.
	   Nearly simultaneous blasts at the American embassies in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, were sophisticated
attacks and suspicion instantly turned to the usual suspects:
Islamic terrorists.
	   The explosions took a terrible toll: At least 200 dead in
Nairobi and nearly 5,000 injured; at least 10 dead in Dar es Salaam
and 74 injured.
	   The powerful blast in downtown Nairobi destroyed a building next
door to the embassy and damaged others blocks away. The damage in
Tanzania was far less because the embassy is in a residential area.
	   Israel army radio, in a report from Nairobi Monday, said
investigators suspect the bombers used the Czech-manufactured
Semtex, which is much more powerful than more traditional
explosives such as TNT.
	   The investigators, who were not identified, said use of the
plastic explosive, which is favored by the Irish Republican Army,
implies a big organization, or even a state, plotted the attack
because Semtex is not readily available, the radio report said.
	   But since the downfall of the Soviet bloc, Semtex has been much
more readily available on the international arms market.
	   On Monday morning, rescue teams were working to clear debris
from the badly damaged but still intact ground floor of the Ufundi
Cooperative building adjacent to the embassy which collapsed,
hoping to reach buried survivors.
	   Kenyan Red Cross workers said they are convinced there are two
women in that area, Rose and Jane.
	   ``Rose last spoke at 3 p.m. (1200 GMT) Sunday afternoon. Since
then, we've heard nothing. There's just no sound coming back. Jane
hasn't been heard of for much, much longer,'' said John Sparrow,
spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   ``This happened before, when Rose went quiet and then spoke
again. She may be asleep. She may be unconscious. So you live in
hope,'' he said.
	   Tired Israeli rescuers said they heard tapping inside the rubble
Monday morning, and said it spurred them on in their search for
Rose.

Nuclear reactor at Zaporizhya plant shuts down a day after restart
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A reactor automatically shut down Monday at
the Zaporizhya nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, one day
after the reactor had been repaired and restarted, officials said.
	   The reason for the shutdown of the No. 5 reactor was still being
determined, the state nuclear energy company Energoatom said. The
reactor had undergone lengthy scheduled repairs before it was
restarted on Sunday.
	   No radiation leaks or violations of safety rules were reported,
officials said.
	   A total of 14 accidents have occurred at the Zaporizhya plant in
the first seven months of 1998, more than at any other of Ukraine's
nuclear energy facilities, according to plant figures.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear plants accounted for 41.4 percent of the
former Soviet republic's electricity production in July, Energoatom
said.

FIFA confirms Poland escaped suspension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Poland escaped suspension by FIFA
with a last-minute move to comply with a deadline for the
reinstatement of suspended administrators, world soccer's governing
body said Monday.
	   Polish clubs and the national side faced a ban from all
international competitions starting Monday if the ban had been
imposed.
	   FIFA and UEFA, the European governing body, had threatened to
suspend Poland indefinitely if Polish soccer administrators
suspended in May were not reinstated by midnight Friday.
	   ``FIFA and UEFA will continue to study the situation within the
Polish Football Association,'' FIFA said in a brief statement.
	   Sports Minister Jacek Debski said Saturday he sent a fax to FIFA
15 minutes before the deadline informing it the suspensions had
been lifted.
	   The move came after the administrators agreed to an
investigation into allegations of mismanagement.
	   The administrators had previously claimed they were independent
of state controls and had refused to accept the sports ministry's
appointment of a control board supervisor to examine their records.
	   Debski said he now expects voluntary dismissal of Soccer
Federation President Marian Dziurowicz, which would open the way
for reforming Polish soccer.
	   On Saturday, five scheduled first division games were canceled
in protest of Dziurowicz's failure to quit immediately.
	   The soccer federation, which is to meet Wednesday, will decide
on Dziurowicz's dismissal, the federation says.
	   Poland's national team, which achieved successes in 1970s and
early 1980s, has not qualified for soccer's World Cup since 1982.
Debski blames administrators and soccer activists for corruption
among players and referees, lack of training facilities and
programs.
	   Polish club LKS Lodz can now look forward to a Champions League
qualifying match against Manchester United on Wednesday.

Aceh leaders call for prosecution for human rights abuses: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Muslim and community leaders in Aceh
have demanded the prosecution of Indonesian troops accused of human
rights abuses in the troubled northern province, a news report said
Monday.
	   Last Friday, Indonesian armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto
announced the immediate withdrawal of thousands of combat troops
from Aceh, where the military has been fighting Islamic separatists
for the past nine years.
	   Opponents of the military's presence accuse soldiers of
widespread human rights abuses, including arbitrary killing,
torture and rape of civilians.
	   There have also been unverified reports of mass graves of
victims allegedly executed by the military in Aceh, on the island
of Sumatra, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of
Jakarta.
	   ``Rapists, torturers and murderers must be brought to justice.
Houses must be rehabilitated. Orphans and widows must be
compensated,'' the official Antara news agency quoted Acehnese
women's group leader Syarifah Hanoum as saying.
	   Prominent Acehnese Muslim scholar Ibrahim Husein predicted that
security problems would die down after the combat troops leave.
	   He said most Acehnese remain loyal to the Indonesian republic
and that past claims by the military of rampant separatism were
exaggerated.
	   He said many local people had been falsely accused of
insurrection and had fled to the forests only to be hunted down by
soldiers.
	   ``The forest guerrillas will come back if they are guaranteed
freedom from false accusations and murder,'' said Husein.
	   In the past, the military insisted that Aceh was home to
hard-line Muslim militants who wanted to establish an Islamic
state.
	   Indonesia's armed forces are now the target of wide-ranging
accusations of human rights abuses committed across the nation
during the 32-year rule of former President Suharto.
	   During his authoritarian reign, Suharto cracked down hard on
separatist struggles in Aceh as well as in Irian Jaya, the western

FIFA confirms Poland escaped suspension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Poland escaped suspension by FIFA
with a last-minute move to comply with a deadline for the
reinstatement of suspended administrators, world soccer's governing
body said Monday.
	   Polish clubs and the national side could have been banned from
all international competitions starting Monday. FIFA and UEFA, the
European governing body, had threatened to suspend Poland
indefinitely if Polish soccer administrators suspended in May were
not reinstated by midnight Friday.
	   ``FIFA and UEFA will continue to study the situation within the
Polish Football Association,'' FIFA said in a brief statement.
	   Sports Minister Jacek Debski said Saturday he sent a fax to FIFA
15 minutes before the deadline informing it the suspensions had
been lifted.
	   The move came after the administrators agreed to an
investigation into allegations of mismanagement.
	   The administrators had previously claimed they were independent
of state controls and had refused to accept the sports ministry's
appointment of a control board supervisor to examine their records.
	   Debski said he now expects voluntary dismissal of Soccer
Federation President Marian Dziurowicz, which would open the way
for reforming Polish soccer.
	   On Saturday, five scheduled first division games were canceled
in protest of Dziurowicz's failure to quit immediately.
	   The soccer federation, which is to meet Wednesday, will decide
on Dziurowicz's dismissal, the federation says.
	   Poland's national team, which achieved successes in 1970s and
early 1980s, has not qualified for soccer's World Cup since 1982.
Debski blames administrators and soccer activists for corruption
among players and referees, lack of training facilities and
programs.
	   Polish club LKS Lodz can now look forward to a Champions League
qualifying match against Manchester United on Wednesday.

Bulgaria planning to cut VAT, phases out import tax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria is plannig to slash its
flat-rate value added tax by 2 percent to 20 percent next year, the
country's finance minister said Monday.
	   Muravei Radev said the government will cut income tax too, but
didn't specify to what extent.
	   In a related matter, the government decided Monday to phase out
as of the beginning of next year a 2 percent import tax currently
levied on all imports atop of other tariffs. The government reduced
this tax from 4 percent in July, citing improved balance of
payment.
	   The government is trying to encourage economic growth after
years of recession and fiscal austerity. The gross domestic product
is expected to grow by 4 percent this year, according to official
forecasts.
	   Bulgaria has reached a preliminary agreement with the
International Monetary Fund on a dlrs 800 million standby loan in
the next three years which is designed to support economic
recovery. The accord is expected to be finalized in September.
	   Bulgaria hopes to receive a total of 1.6 billion dollars in
loans from the IMF, World Bank and other international lenders in
the next three years which will enable it repay its dlrs 9 billion
foreign debt and invest in economy and infrastructure.

Nearly 40 injured when fire alarm sparks stampede
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A fire alarm sparked a stampede that
injured nearly 40 people at a factory that makes toys for some
McDonald's Happy Meals, hospital officials said Monday.
	   Doctors at the Hoa Khanh emergency center said 32 female workers
were admitted Saturday, with most being transferred later to the
nearby General Hospital in Danang. Eight were still receiving
treatment at the two facilities Monday.
	   The stampede started at the Keyhinge facility in central Danang
when nearly 1,000 workers on the second floor heard a fire alarm as
their plant appeared to be threatened by a blaze at the factory
next door.
	   It turned out that the other factory was burning rubbish.
	   Keyhinge Toys Vietnam Ltd. employs 3,500 workers. The local
union and the government have expressed concerns over working
conditions there.

Philippine president urges Communist party founder to come home for
</HEADLINE>
peace talks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada on Monday
urged the exiled founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines
to return home, saying the government and Marxist rebels can
overcome their differences.
	   Estrada has ordered government negotiators to work for a
resumption of peace talks with Communist and Muslim guerrillas
initiated by his predecessor, Fidel Ramos.
	   Talks with the rebel groups were suspended for several months
during the campaign for national elections in May, which Estrada
won overwhelmingly on a pro-poor platform.
	   Estrada said Communist Party founder Jose Maria Sison is welcome
to return to the Philippines to help the peace talks, adding that
both share a similar aim of uplifting the plight of millions of
poor Filipinos.
	   ``I'm inviting him to return home. There is nothing that we
couldn't agree on,'' Estrada said in a radio interview.
	   Sison has been living with other Communist rebel leaders in
exile in the Netherlands, where peace negotiations between the
group and the Manila government have proceeded sporadically since
1992. He has acted as a political consultant to the rebel
negotiating panel.
	   Estrada said an accord binding the two sides to respect human
rights, which was concluded by the rebels and the Manila government
early this year, needed to be discussed further.
	   The Communist insurgency began in 1969 and expanded rapidly
during the dictatorship of the late President Ferdinand Marcos. It
peaked in the mid-1980s and has since weakened because of battle
casualties, surrenders and factionalism.
	   The government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, now the
largest Muslim separatist rebel group, are scheduled to resume
peace talks next week.
	   Under Ramos, the Philippine government signed a peace pact with
the Moro National Liberation Front, once the largest Muslim rebel
group, ending a quarter-century separatist uprising that killed
more than 120,000 people in the southern Mindanao region.

England wins by 23 runs to take the series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ England scored its first five-test series
win since 1986 when the home side bowled out South Africa for 196
to win the fifth and deciding test by 23 runs at Headingley on
Monday.
	   England came back from 0-1 down in the series after losing the
second test at Lord's by 10 wickets to win the fourth and fifth
tests and claim the series 2-1.
	   South Africa, set a target of 219 to win the match and the
series, was bowled out for 195 runs in its second innings.
	   The match resumed Monday after a see-sawing four days with both
teams in the hunt for a series victory. South Africa needed 34 runs
and England needed two wickets _ it took England just 30 minutes to
win.
	   South Africa resumed at 185 for eight and added nine to its
total in five overs before Allan Donald edged a slower ball from
Angus Fraser to wicketkeeper Alec Stewart.
	   But it was local hero Darren Gough who ended the series when he
dimissed South Africa's No.11 batsman Makhaya Ntini.
	   Gough, trapped No.11 Makhaya Ntini leg before wicket to seal a
remarkable win and finished the innings with a career best 6-42.
Angus Fraser took 3-50.

Cambodian election officials close door to poll complaints
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Claiming that all allegations of
fraud have so far proven baseless, officials said Monday they will
stop looking into complaints about irregularities in last month's
parliamentary elections.
	   The move closes the door on complaints by Prince Norodom
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy that their parties lost to strongman Hun
Sen in the July 26 polls because of fraud. They have refused to
join any coalition government before their charges are addressed.
	   Spokesman Samraing Kamsan said the National Election Committee
has received more than 300 complaints from the opposition parties,
but ``found no fraud, only slight technical errors.''
	   For the past week, he said, election officials have been
painstakingly recounting ballots from seven of the country's 1,600
communes and found that ``there has been no cheating, no fraud at
all.''
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party emerged as the winner of the
parliamentary elections when long-delayed preliminary results were
announced last week. The party took a slight majority _ 64 seats _
in the 122-member National Assembly.
	   That falls short of the two-thirds needed to form a government,
and Hun Sen has been looking for partners. The prince's FUNCINPEC
party is slated to pick up 43 seats and the Sam Rainsy Party 15.
	   The two opposition parties are alleging widespread fraud in
voting and ballot counting and have threatened to boycott the new
National Assembly if their complaints are not properly
investigated, setting the stage for a possible political crisis.
	   Samraing Kamsan said Monday he was not impressed by the
complaints filed so far with the NEC, saying, ``There are a lot of
complaints, but no real evidence.''
	   Future complaints will have to be forwarded to the
Constitutional Council, the country's highest appeals body.
	   The election came a year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his
co-prime minister in a violent coup, shattering a tense dual
premiership formed after U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new elections would restore his legitimacy in
the eyes of the international community and lead to a resumption of
foreign aid. So far, foreign observers and the United Nations have
generally endorsed the election, despite widespread pre-vote
violence.
	   Critics accused Hun Sen of packing the National Election
Committee and other agencies with his supporters.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ As hope of finding more survivors of the
embassy bombing in Nairobi dimmed, investigators focused Monday on
finding the architects of the terror at a crime scene guarded by
armed Marines and hidden from view by black fabric. Nearly
simultaneous blasts at the American embassies in the Kenyan capital
and Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, were sophisticated
attacks and suspicion instantly turned to the usual suspects:
Islamic terrorists. The explosions took a terrible toll with at
least 200 dead in Nairobi and nearly 5,000 injured; at least 10
dead in Dar es Salaam and 74 injured. The powerful blast in
downtown Nairobi destroyed a building next door to the embassy and
damaged others blocks away. The damage in Tanzania was far less
because the embassy is in a residential area. (EMBASSY BOMBINGS)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Trucks filled with government troops
rumbled out of the capital Kinshasa on Monday on their way to
reinforce fighters in western Congo near the Atlantic coastline.
State-controlled radio said President Laurent Kabila had ordered
the reinforcements for a push to try to retake several small towns
in the west, including the oil town of Muanda. Rebel Tutsis have
captured strategic towns in both the west and in Congo's eastern
Kivu region as part of their week-old uprising against Kabila. On
Sunday, Kabila's government accused Uganda of sending soldiers and
tanks into Congo in support of the Tutsi rebellion. The government
also accused neighboring Rwanda, which it alleges instigated the
uprising, of executing Congolese army officers and rounding up
civilians in the region. The charges could not be independently
confirmed. (CONGO)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious
militia controlled Mazar-e-Sharif Monday, where a spokesman said it
captured 30 Iranians accused of supplying weapons to the opposition
northern alliance that had held the key city. Fierce street battles
have been reported in Mazar-e-Sharif since Taliban fighters entered
Saturday, with each side claiming to have ousted the other from the
city. But independent sources who insisted on anonymity said the
Taliban controlled the city Monday and that it was calm. The
sources provided few other details. The Taliban unleashed bombs and
rockets on the city before seizing it, and casualties were likely
to be high. In addition, opposition spokesman Masood Khalili
accused the Sunni Muslim Taliban of killing hundreds of civilians
from the Shiite sect of Islam. (AFGHANISTAN)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Criticizing the qualifications and ability of
Japan's new Cabinet, opposition lawmakers called Monday for new
elections and said that only a revolution in politics could end the
country's economic woes. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi faced
blistering criticism as he fielded questions on the floor of
Parliament for the first time since becoming prime minister last
month. Opinion polls have shown Obuchi's Cabinet to be one of the
least popular new governments in decades, with fewer than one-third
of voters expressing approval. Nowhere was the declining popularity
of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party more clear than in last
month's parliamentary elections, when a landslide victory by
opposition parties cost the LDP control of the upper house of
Japan's Parliament. As a result, Obuchi must win the support of
opposition lawmakers for his bills even to pass. The tone of
Monday's debate suggested he may face a tough time. (JAPAN-ECONOMIC
FIGHT)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Officials scaled down plans to dynamite dikes and
divert flood waters into vast tracts of farmland in central China
on Monday after the swollen Yangtze fell slightly. But urban areas
remained on high alert while the fourth flood crest this summer
roared past the industrial center of Wuhan, where residents stacked
more sandbags atop dikes to prevent them from collapsing. Flood
officials blasted dikes at Jianli County, about 90 miles (145
kilometers) upriver from Wuhan in central China's Hubei province,
on Sunday to divert flood waters and lower the river along its
middle and lower reaches. (CHINA-FLOODS)

move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower
Monday on fears of the sinking Japanese yen dragging down local
currencies. Traders said a weaker Japanese currency or a delinking
of Hong Kong's currency from the U.S. dollar could trigger a new
wave of devaluations throughout Asia. Thailand's key stock index
tumbled 3.7 percent as investors continued to sell banking stocks.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand index slumped 9.24 points to 238.30.
Elsewhere, shares also fell in Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan, New
Zealand, Australia, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines.
Prices closed generally higher in Hong Kong. Financial markets in
Singapore were closed for a national holiday. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Criticizing the qualifications and ability of
Japan's new Cabinet, opposition lawmakers called today for new
elections and said that only a revolution in politics could end the
country's economic woes. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi faced
blistering criticism as he fielded questions on the floor of
Parliament for the first time since becoming prime minister last
month. Obuchi rejected the demand, saying he would focus on fixing
the economy. Opinion polls have shown Obuchi's Cabinet to be one of

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will close at least three of
15 commercial banks in a much-awaited financial sector shakeup
aimed at reviving the battered economy, the finance minister said
in an interview published Monday. The bank closures should be
officially announced Saturday as part of a package of reforms
following negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on the
latest installment of its dlrs 17.2 billion bailout for the Thai
economy. Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda declined, in an
interview with the Bangkok Post, to single out any institution to
be closed. (THAILAND-ECONOMY)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Management and union negotiators sat
down Monday for the first time in a week to try to settle a
three-week-old strike at Hyundai Motor Co. over layoffs. But with
both sides apparently holding fast to their positions and little
progress expected, the government was reported ready to break up
the strike with police force. Hyundai Motor's 26,000-member union
wants the nation's largest automaker to take back 1,600 employees
it fired July 31 because of sharply falling domestic sales.
(SKOREA-HYUNDAI STRIKE)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Central Bank announced
Monday it will raise its key overnight borrowing rate to 15 percent
from 13 percent in an effort to slow the peso's rapid depreciation.
The central bank also raised its overnight lending rate to 17
percent from 15 percent, also effective Tuesday. The rise in
overnight rates appeared to have an immediate calming effect on the
market, with many banks reducing their offer rates for the dollar.
Higher interest rates tend to make a currency more attractive to
investors. (PHILIPPINES-INTEREST RATES)

UBS, LTCB joint ventures to drop name of struggling Japanese bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Joint ventures between the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd. and United Bank of Switzerland will be renamed to drop
reference to the troubled Japanese bank, officials said Monday.
	   However, the move will not affect the structure and management
of the joint ventures or their legal names, said a spokesman for
LTCB Warburg, who requested anonymity.
	   The investment bank joint venture between LTCB and UBS will now
be called Warburg Dillon Read, instead of LTCB Warburg. The asset
management alliance will be renamed UBS Brinson Asset Management
from LTCB UBS Brinson.
	   The companies decided to change the global brand names of their
joint ventures earlier this month to take advantage of names that
enjoy worldwide recognition, the LTCB Warburg spokesman said.
	   The brand name change has sparked speculation that the LTCB-UBS
alliance is in trouble. The Financial Times reported Monday that
UBS is thinking of buying out LTCB's portion of the joint ventures,
but didn't cite any sources.
	   LTCB was reported in June to be on the verge of collapse after
Moody's Investors Services downgraded its debt and its shares
became almost worthless overnight.
	   LTCB later announced it was in talks to merge with Sumitomo
Trust Bank _ a move that was widely assumed to have been
coordinated as a virtual bailout for LTCB. LTCB officials have
said, however, their bank is in no danger of failing.
	   UBS is the new bank formed from the merger of Union Bank of
Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp. LTCB and Swiss Bank Corp. agreed
in July 1997 to launch joint ventures in investment banking and
asset management.

Italian prosecutor summons outspoken Roma coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian prosecutor has summoned the coach of AS
Roma, Zdenek Zeman, to hear his allegations that a number of top
league Italian soccer players may use performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Zeman, a Czech, will meet Wednesday with prosecutor Raffaele
Guariniello in Turin, a day after questioning in Rome by officialos
of the Italian Olympic Committe.
	   Guariniello has been investigating doping in sports for several
years, as well as other health-related issues.
	   ``I'm at everyone's disposal for the good of soccer,'' Zeman was
quoted Monday as saying in Gazzetta dello Sport, the Italian sports
daily.
	   In interviews with several newspapers and the newsweekly
Espresso over the past days, Zeman said he was amazed by the quick
muscular development of some players such as Alessandro Del Piero
and Gianluca Vialli.
	   Zeman never mentioned doping substances openly. He always
referred to medicines.
	   Del Piero, a Juventus star, instructed his agent to sue for
libel.
	   Vialli, a former player of Juventus and currently Chelsea's
player-coach in the English Premier League, angrily said Zeman is a
``terrorist trying to destabilize the soccer world.''

German chancellor rules out coalition with opposition after
</HEADLINE>
election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Back from vacation ``with a cheerful
heart,'' Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday ruled out joining the
opposition Social Democrats in a coalition government after fall
elections, saying such speculation was only meant to confuse
voters.
	   ``There won't be a `grand coalition' with us,'' Kohl said before
the steering committee of his Christian Democratic Union held its
first meeting after the summer break.
	   Social Democratic chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder, who
has been leading Kohl in opinion polls, said last week that if
coalition talks with the ecology-minded Greens didn't pan out, he
would not hesitate to turn to the Christian Democrats.
	   Such a pairing of Germany's two main parties hasn't been tried
in Bonn since the 1960s, although it is not uncommon at the state
level.
	   But Kohl insisted the differences between his conservative party
and the traditionally leftist Social Democrats were too great for a
coalition to work.
	   Attempts by Schroeder to steer his party closer to a ``new
center'' with business-friendly policies and tough talk on law and
order ``are not believable,'' Kohl said.
	   Kohl said he was optimistic about his chances for winning a
record fifth term on Sept. 27 and was going ``into this decisive
battle with a cheerful heart.''
	   Asked whether he intended to serve the entire four year term, he
said, ``right now I first am going to win the election.''
	   A Social Democratic-Greens coalition has been leading in opinion
polls for months, but recent surveys show the government parties
gaining ground to make the race almost neck-and-neck.

	   LUDWIGSHAFE, Germany (AP) _ Two workers at a BASF polystyrene
plant were killed in an explosion Monday, a spokeswoman for the
chemical concern said.
	   The explosion occurred during repair work in the basement of the
plant that manufactures a form of polystyrene for insulation
boards, said BASF spokeswoman Anke Schmidt. A third worker was
under medical observation.
	   The cause of the blast was not immediately known.
	   Production at the polystyrene plant was halted immediately.
Schmidt said the explosion posed no threat to other areas of BASF's
Ludwigshafen 7.5-square-kilometer (3-square-mile) facility or to
area residents.
	   BASF is Germany's third-largest chemical group after Hoechst and
Bayer.

Soccer association woos Cruyff for national coach job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Soccer officials couldn't persuade
Johan Cruyff to become the new national coach, but at least they
could pick his brains for new ideas on the future of Dutch soccer.
	   The Royal Dutch Soccer Association (KNVB) said Monday that
Cruyff turned down their offer to succeed Guus Hiddink as the Dutch
team coach during a meeting in Barcelona last week.
	   KNVB spokesman Monique Kessels said it was already known that
Cruyff didn't want to pick up his coaching career again, but it was
still worth a try.
	   Cruyff, the most venerated Dutch soccer star, has already
coached Ajax Amsterdam and Spanish giant Barcelona. These days, he
works as a television soccer commentator.
	   He was also the country's favorite choice to become the new
national coach, according to a survey by market research company
NIPO published in July.
	   Hiddink, who guided the Netherlands to a fourth-place finish in
the World Cup finals in France this summer, has been hired by Real
Madrid.
	   Despite the rejection, KNVB officials used the four-hour meeting
to glean new ideas from Cruyff on Dutch soccer, ranging from
amateur levels to professional competitions.
	   Talent drain has been a big problem for Dutch soccer as top
players go abroad, attracted by higher salaries and tougher
competitions. Cruyff has often called on teams to give younger
Dutch players a chance instead of hiring lackluster foreign
players.
	   Kessels declined to say whether Cruyff will get involved in
other KNVB activities, adding another meeting has been scheduled
for this weekend. An advisory role may be a possibility, the
national daily De Telegraaf reported Monday.
	   For now, the national coach job is still open, but Kessels
declined to identify other candidates.
	   ``It will take some more time,'' she added.
	   Cruyff has thrown his support behind former Feyenoord and
Glasgow Celtic manager Wim Jansen, saying he is the ideal man to
follow Hiddink, according to De Telegraaf.

Police warn of possible extremist attacks in southern Philippines

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police providing additional security for U.S.
Embassy in Manila in new 2nd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Police stepped up security Monday
against possible terrorist attacks in the southern Philippines
following bomb explosions outside U.S. embassies in Nairobi and
Tanzania over the weekend.
	   In Manila, meanwhile, additional policemen and 24-hour police
patrol cars have been assigned to guard the seaside U.S. Embassy to
prevent any attacks by extremists, Manila Police Chief Virtus Gil
said. He said the move was only precautionary.
	   In the southern Philippines, Brig. Gen. Dominador Resos said
police on Mindanao Island have been alerted against possible
terrorist actions and attacks on foreigners, especially Americans,
by a Muslim extremist group, the Abu Sayyaf.
	   Resos said the Abu Sayyaf, which means ``Father of the
Executioner,'' may follow up attacks by suspected Islamic
terrorists in Africa.
	   On Saturday, bombs exploded in nearly simultaneous attacks on
U.S. embassies that left at least 200 people dead and about 5,000
injured in Nairobi and 10 people dead and 74 injured in Tanzania.
	   The Abu Sayyaf is the more militant of two Muslim rebel groups
fighting the government. The government has not officially started
peace talks with the Abu Sayyaf.
	   In 1995, the group was accused of killing 50 people and razing
the town center of Ipil in Zamboanga del Sur province.
	   The group also has been suspected of involvement in bombing
attacks. It announced its formation in 1991 by bombing the
missionary ship Doulos, killing a New Zealander and a Swede and
injuring 30 other missionaries.
	   The largest Muslim rebel group, the Moro National Liberation
Front, signed a peace pact with the government in 1996.

Philippine January-July car sales fall 53 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Sales of passenger cars in the
Philippines in this year's first seven months dropped 53 percent
from January-July last year to 22,943, an industry group said
Monday.
	   For the month of July alone, car makers sold only 2,932
vehicles, a 78 percent plunge from last year, the Chamber of
Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. said.
	   The group attributed the decline to a slowing of economic growth
caused by the year-old Asian currency crisis, and the resulting
tightening of credit.
	   It said it is considering lowering its car sales target for the
year, which now stands at 51,000. The industry sold 75,707
passenger cars last year.

Russian musicians, public pay final respects to Alfred Schnittke

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With musical performances and eulogies, Russian
artists paid tribute Monday to Alfred Schnittke, one of the leading
composers of this century who died a week ago.
	   Mstislav Rostropovich, a close friend of the composer, performed
a Bach suite on the cello during the funeral, and violinist Gidon
Kremer played a Schnittke composition. Poet Bella Akhmadulina and
theater director Yuri Lyubimov were among a dozen eulogists.
	   Gennady Rozhdestvensky, director of the conservatory, said
Schnittke ``had full faith in the strength of his art'' and
deserves a place in the pantheon of modern Russian music, alongside
Stravinsky, Rachmaninoff and Shostakovich.
	   ``Dear teacher, beloved master, loyal friend _ may the gates of
heaven open before you,'' Rozhdestvensky said.
	   Schnittke lay in an open coffin below the stage of the
conservatory's Great Hall, where many of his compositions were
performed. Large wreaths of flowers with streamers were lined up
behind the coffin, and a large portrait of the artist was on stage.
Below the bier, carnations, lilies, roses and other flowers were
piled high.
	   Russian Premier Sergei Kiriyenko joined musicians and other
friends of the composer who made up the ceremonial guard.
	   At his request, Schnittke was to be buried later Monday in
Moscow's Novodevichye Cemetery, the final resting place for many of
the country's cultural elite.
	   Schnittke lived most of his life in the Soviet Union but
emigrated to Germany, the land of his ancestors, in 1990. He died
on Aug. 3 in Hamburg after years of strokes that robbed him of the
ability to speak but left his creative abilities intact. He
continued to compose music throughout his illness, writing with
such an unsteady hand that his colleagues created a commission to
interpret the notes.
	   During the funeral, a chorus performed selections from a Russian
Orthodox liturgy, a song by Schnittke that evoked the extinguishing
of candles, one by one, and finally Schnittke's haunting Requiem,
accompanied by bells, organ and guitar.
	   After the service concluded, some 1,000 people who had attended
slowly filed by the coffin, many stopping to bow their heads before
moving on.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's tax police have convicted more than 600
people in the first half of 1998 for tax-related crimes that have
cost the country billions of rubles this year, a news report said
Monday.
	   Over 4,000 tax crimes were registered from January through June,
and the government had lost out on 5.4 billion rubles (dlrs 870
million), the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing the tax police
press service.
	   Russia's tangled legal code leaves plenty of room for tax
dodgers to maneuver. The government's inability to collect taxes is
one of the main reasons for chronic budget shortfalls.

Kosovo Albanian rebels try to retain last strongholds

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backed into a few remaining
strongholds, ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo fought Monday to
cling to territory in the face of a punishing Serb offensive.
	   With Western diplomats pushing them to agree to peace talks,
Kosovo Liberation Army fighters skirmished with Serbian forces
throughout the weekend and again on Monday.
	   Meanwhile, although one moderate KLA faction signaled its
readiness over the weekend for negotiations that could lead to the
province regaining autonomy from Serbia, prospects for talks
remained uncertain.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill arrived in Pristina on Monday to try
to push the peace process forward.
	   Reports from both warring sides Monday showed skirmishes still
continuing at several locations.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center said three KLA fighters were killed
Monday in a clash with Serb police in the village of Dura, about 40
kilometers (25 miles) south of Pristina. Authorities there said the
KLA attacked a police patrol and police fired back, killing three.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said one
Albanian was killed by a sniper in Suva Reka, about 40 kilometers
(25 miles) southwest of Pristina, early Monday.
	   The center also said an Albanian village in the Drenica area of
central Kosovo was under siege.
	   KIC said 400 civilians were being encircled by Serb forces in
Lausa village, which was one of the biggest KLA strongholds before
falling to Serb forces Aug. 2. Four civilians who managed to get
out of the village said two women and a man were killed during the
attack on Lausa.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook criticized the Serbs for
their recent attacks involving civilians. He said he was
particularly disturbed that the Serbs had set fire to crops in
Kosovo in recent days to try to ensure that villagers won't return.
	   ``The events of the last 10 days have been deeply disturbing and
have undoubtedly caused great hardship to many civilians throughout
Kosovo,'' Cook told BBC1 on Sunday.
	   Pressing for talks while holding out the threat of NATO
intervention, Western diplomats gave the warring sides a proposal
Friday and Saturday, outlining how autonomy might work in Kosovo.
	   ``This is not a war that either side can win,'' Cook said. ``The
only way this war can be ended is by both sides coming to the table
with an international presence and negotiating a satisfactory
constitutional political settlement.''
	   According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the Serb
offensive has forced 167,000 people from their homes within Kosovo
since the conflict exploded in February, with the total of
displaced 231,000 including those who fled the province.
	   Hundreds have been killed, with thousands of others remaining in
the woods and hills, many of them without food or water.
	   Serb warlord Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan, wrote to U.S.
President Clinton calling on him to help Serbia fight ``terrorism''
on its territory.
	   Arkan said America should not allow bombings similar to those in
Kenya and Tanzania happen anywhere else in the world.
	   ``Mr. President, don't let ... terrorism in this part of the
Balkans continue, in the Serb state which for centuries has been a
friend to your state,'' wrote Raznatovic, a notorious paramilitary
leader whose troops, known as the Tigers, fought in Bosnia and
Croatia.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Three Japanese fishing boat captains who were
detained by Russian authorities for fishing in disputed waters were
freed Monday after a month in captivity, a coast guard spokesman
said.
	   The fishermen were captured by the Russian border patrol on July
10 after they ventured into seas near Etorofu Island, part of the
southern Kuril Islands claimed by both Japan and Russia, said
Japanese coast guard spokesman Tomoki Jin.
	   Captains Keiji No, Masato Kobayashi and Kazuhiko Hamamatsu and
15 crew members were taken to Russian-held Kunashiri Island for
questioning. The crew members were released Aug. 1, Jin said.
	   The disputed islands at the southern end of the Kuril chain
between Russia's Far East and Japan's northern main island of
Hokkaido were seized by the Soviet army in the closing days of
World War II.
	   The territorial dispute has been the main stumbling block
preventing Japan and Russia from normalizing relations after the
end of the war.

 &UR; Bacher condemns umpiring
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ South African cricket boss Ali Bacher
condemned the standard of umpiring in the test series between South
Africa and England after the tourists slumped to a series defeat at
Headingley on Monday.
	   Bacher, who holds key positions on the International Cricket
Council, said South African captain Hanse Cronje could not speak
out against the umpiring due to the Code of Conduct but he urged
the team management to take up the issue.
	   The United Cricket Board of South Africa managing director said
he had conferred with former England chairman of selectors Ray
Illingworth and they agreed that the standard of umpiring in this
series was below par.
	   ``The captain's tongue is handcuffed,'' Bacher said. ``But I
have asked the team management to put down in writing what has been
perceived as a very bad umpiring series.''
	   ``We will handle it from there....there is obviously a problem
and it is not in the interest of cricket,'' he added.
	   South Africa, having outplayed England early in the series,
surrendered a 1-0 lead to lose the series 2-1, following a 23-run
defeat in the fifth and final test.
	   ``I have spoken to Ray Illingworth and (he said) in his
experience, every (questionable decision) in this series, is the
worst he has seen,'' Bacher said.
	   Bacher's outburst follows an impassioned plea from South African
coach Bob Woolmer, who called for an extension of duty for the
third umpire in tests following the string of contentious decisions
which marred the fourth test at Trent Bridge.
	   ``I am convinced three of our five wickets weren't out,'' Bacher
said, referring to three of the top five given in the South African
second innings.
	   The visitors, chasing 219 to win, collapsed dramatically to 27
for five, before Jonty Rhodes and Brian McMillan came together in a
117-run face saving stand.
	   The five-match series has been dogged by umpiring controversies.
	   Criticism of the umpires by South African fast bowler Allan
Donald, the leading wicket taker this series with 33 wickets,
landed him a 50 percent fine and one match suspended ban.
	   English umpire Merv Kitchen gave controversial decisions against
South African batsman Jacques Kallis and Rhodes before England
triumphed by eight wickets to level the series at Trent Bridge.
	   Bacher also condemned the ICC for its lack of foresight in
appointing Pakistan's umpire Javed Akhtar for the series decider.
	   ``How can the ICC appoint someone like Akhtar to make his first
appearance in a test in England in a crucial match like this?''
Bacher said.
	   Akhtar adjudged a total of eight batsmen out lbw _ two English
and six South Africans _ at least three in controversial
circumstances including Donald, South African opener Gehardus
Liebenberg and England opener Mike Atherton.
	   Bacher also said that Mickey Stewart, the former coach and
father of England captain Alec Stewart, told him he'd never seen so
many basic mistakes made in a test.

Man's best friend? Not for child workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police have rescued six girls who
worked for years without pay caring for a millionaire's dogs,
officials said Monday.
	   The girls, including an illegal immigrant from neighboring
Myanmar, range in age from 12 to 15 and were sent by their families
to the home of the millionaire to work as servants to repay various
debts.
	   An official of the Labor Ministry's division on women and child
labor said Monday that the girls were assigned to take care of
their employer's 30 dogs, many of them expensive imported breeds.
	   They bathed, brushed and walked the dogs daily, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The first floor of
the house was given over to the dogs, who lived in air-conditioned
rooms.
	   The girls had less luxurious accommodations, but there were no
allegations of physical mistreatment.
	   They told authorities that they were forbidden from going home
until the debts were repaid. None had ever received wages while
working at the house, from one to seven years.
	   The official said the owner, a retired police official, may be
charged with harboring an illegal alien but could escape punishment
for child labor violations, since there was no commercial aim.
	   Police said they were still investigating the case. The rescued
girls are staying at a government refuge.

Frenchman imprisoned pending trial on arson charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IGOUMENITSA, Greece (AP) _ A French man was ordered held in
custody Monday pending trial for allegedly attempting to start a
forest fire during Greece's worst outbreaks of wildfires.
	   Police arrested Alain de Fremont, 49, on Friday as he allegedly
tried to light a fire with gasoline near the village of Sivota in
northwestern Greece.
	   De Fremont, who has denied the charges, was ordered jailed on
the Ionian holiday island of Corfu. No trial date has been set by
the court in Igoumenitsa.
	   De Fremont has claimed he was only trying to burn papers and
rubbish, media reported.
	   The arrest comes as firefighters around the country brought
blazes under control in what officials have described as the worst
season for wildfires.
	   Forest and brush fires are common during Greece's hot and dry
summers. But this year in July alone, more than 3,000 wildfires
were reported compared with 2,800 for the entire summer season last
year, the government has said.
	   Arson is suspected in some of the blazes. In the past, property
owners have been accused of burning land to get around laws that
prohibit construction on wooded areas.
	   Five people, four of them firefighters, were killed last month
in fires near Athens.
	   Greece is receiving firefighting assistance from France, Italy,
Russia and Germany.

Two Chechens sentenced for spying for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An Islamic court in Chechnya has sentenced a man
and a woman to five years in prison for alleged collaboration with
Russia's security service, a news report said Monday.
	   Viskhan Meslayev and Irina Besagina, both Chechen residents,
were arrested Feb. 23 at a checkpoint on the border between
Chechnya and Russia's southern Stavropol region, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   A Chechen security official, Umar Ozniyev, said the two had
files on Chechen police officers, Russian police identification
cards, photo and video equipment and some unspecified ``secret
documents,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   Chechnya considers itself an independent state, and the two were
apparently tried for spying for a foreign country's secret service.
	   Chechnya and Russia remain at odds on many issues, including
Chechnya's political status. Moscow considers the territory to be
part of Russia.
	   However, Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) and Chechnya's
National Security Service signed an agreement last July, pledging
to join forces in fighting terrorism, kidnappings and other crimes
in the breakaway republic.

Notorious arrest decree to be repealed, Nigerian official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military ruler is expected
to abolish a decree used by the West African country's former
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha to arrest and imprison critics for long
periods without trial, an official said Monday.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar's government will announce later this
week the abolishment of the notorious law commonly known as `Decree
Two,' a senior government official told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity.
	   The law allows police and military to detain people for six
months without trial, a period that can be renewed indefinitely by
senior law enforcement officials. The law also prevents courts from
investigating and circumventing the detentions.
	   ``The military council decided to abolish the law in response to
the promise by the head of state to abrogate all existing
regulations that may inhibit the process of restoring democracy,''
the unnamed official said.
	   Abubakar has drawn cautious applause from opposition parties and
human rights groups since announcing his plan last month to hand
over the country's reigns of power to a civilian government by the
end of May 1999, following democratic elections.
	   The government has also released dozens of political prisoners
summarily jailed by Abacha.
	   At least two opposition groups have announced intentions to run
in the elections after the country's five government-sanctioned
parties _ believed puppets of Abacha _ were abolished.
	   Nigeria has been ruled by military regimes for all but 10 of the
38 years since independence from Britain.

Philippines' draft budget projects real spending up 3-4 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The new Philippine government is
proposing a budget of 568 billion pesos (dlrs 12.0 billion) for
1999, a 12 percent increase over the revised 1998 budget.
	   But with a projected inflation rate for 1999 of 8 to 9 percent,
government spending in real terms will only grow by 3 to 4 percent,
according to a draft budget summary obtained Monday by Dow Jones
Newswires.
	   Although striving to use the budget to ``spur investment
spending,'' the government plans to cut its budget deficit from a
revised target of 40 billion pesos (dlrs 909 million) this year to
18 billion pesos (dlrs 409 million) in 1999.
	   The draft budget summary was presented last week to the
Development Budget Coordination Committee, a Cabinet-level working
group, by a technical board consisting of experts from the
departments of budget, finance and economic planning.
	   The summary has not been made public. Once accepted by President
Joseph Estrada, the budget will be presented to Congress for
approval.
	   The budget focuses spending on health, education and social
welfare, as well as on agriculture and infrastructure. This is
consistent with Estrada's election campaign pledges.
	   The budget is based on the assumptions of a real growth in the
gross national product of 4 to 5 percent in 1999, a steady
Treasury-bill rate of 16 percent and Congress passing new tax
measures aimed at collecting an additional 14 billion pesos (dlrs
318 million) in taxes and duties.
	   Of the government's borrowing requirements, 57 percent will
depend on the domestic market, mostly long-term Treasury bonds.
	   However, questions have already been raised about the proposed
new tax measures and their ability to increase revenue. A tax
amnesty program aimed at bringing a large number of small
corporations and self-employed into the tax registers is expected
to bring in 7 billion pesos (dlrs 160 million).
	   But some experts doubt a tax amnesty, which has been announced
months in advance and is not followed by a threat of an effective
crackdown on those who don't comply, can succeed in bringing in any
substantial revenue gains.
	   A substantial portion of the proposed 14 billion pesos (dlrs 255
million) in revenue gains may also be annulled by a tax deduction
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu is considering for the funds
commercial banks set aside as bad-loan provisions. If implemented,
such tax deductions could cost the government 8 billion pesos (dlrs
182 million) annually in lost revenue.

French Cooperation Minister leaves for Sudan to fight famine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Cooperation Minister Charles Josselin
traveled Monday to Sudan to see what France could do to relieve the
famine in the southern part of the African country.
	   ``This visit responds to France's concern to participate in the
mobilization of the international community in the face of the
humanitarian drama in southern Sudan,'' said a statement issued by
the French Foreign Ministry.
	   During his two day trip to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan,
Josselin will study ways that France can respond to the needs
expressed by U.N. officials to fight the famine.
	   Last week, the international aid agency, CARE, said an estimated
70 to 80 people were dying a day in southern Sudan from famine
attributed to fighting in a 15-year-old civil war.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Laotian Prime Minister Sisavath
Keobounphanh arrived Monday for a three-day visit to Malaysia to
discuss means of overcoming the regional economic turmoil.
	   The visit is the first by a Laotian leader since that country
joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in July 1997.
	   Laos, a landlocked country in the center of the Indochinese
Peninsula, has also been hard hit by the Asian economic crisis.
	   Sisavath's visit is expected to focus on joint efforts to
overcome the economic downturn. The two countries were expected to
sign tourism and trade agreements, the government news agency
Bernama reported.
	   Sisavath, who was accompanied by a 12-member delegation of
senior officials, was given a red-carpet welcome at Parliament
Square by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who was to give a dinner
Monday evening for the Laotian leader.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Myanmar government says 18 foreigners will be held for
</HEADLINE>
investigation &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with diplomatic maneuvering, grafs 4-5, 11-12 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime signaled Monday
it was in no hurry to free 18 foreign pro-democracy activists who
were still being questioned in police custody a day after being
arrested for handing out anti-government leaflets.
	   The government displayed the leaflets, which urged Myanmar's
people to remember a nationwide uprising against military rule 10
years ago and to keep struggling, at a news conference where the
activists were accused of trying to incite unrest.
	   Those detained include six U.S. citizens from the Free Burma
Coalition and three Malaysians, three Indonesians, three Thais, two
Philippine nationals and an Australian from similar groups opposed
to the government of Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Government officials told diplomats that the detainees were
``being treated humanely,'' but visits to them had not yet been
allowed, said a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The officials stressed that the foreigners had been detained,
not arrested and formally charged, the diplomat said. Some were at
police headquarters, but were not being held in cells.
	   At the news conference, spokesman Lt. Col. Hla Min gave no sign
that freedom was imminent.
	   ``They are being detained while investigations continue,'' Hla
Min said. ``They are being kept separately at two police guest
houses. No decision has been made yet about what legal action will
be taken against them.''
	   The guest houses are generally more comfortable than Myanmar's
jails and prisons. A British-Australian was freed Thursday three
months into a five-year term in the notorious Insein Prison, where
hundreds of political prisoners are kept, for handing out leaflets
on behalf of a rebel group.
	   Asked whether that case could serve as a guide, Hla Min said:
``We need to discourage these groups.''
	   Reporters were shown front-and-back photographs of the detainees
taken in detention, wearing T-shirts urging people to remember
8-8-88, representing the Aug. 8, 1988, uprising date.
	   In Manila, Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon said his
ambassador had met Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the top ruling generals.
Negotiations for the safety and release of the Filipinos were under
way.
	   A U.S. spokeswoman said the embassy was giving ``the highest
priority'' to the health and well-being of the Americans and was
pressing for an early resolution to the case.
	   Overseas opposition groups had anticipated that Saturday's
anniversary of the uprising could lead to new demonstrations. But
on that day, Myanmar was calm. Neither the government nor rebel
groups reported any unrest.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar since 1962. The 1988
demonstrations resulted in a change of leaders but were eventually
crushed by bullets and bayonets. An estimated 3,000 people died.
	   The foreigners distributed their leaflets Sunday, which was
otherwise calm, at different sites in Yangon. Twelve were arrested
downtown and six at the airport while trying to leave.
	   The Bangkok-based alliance of anti-government groups that sent
them into the country urged their immediate release.
	   Most of the activists were students, but there were also
professors, lawyers and a businessman. They ranged in age from 19
to 51. Ten were men and eight women.
	   ``They were well aware they might be arrested,'' said Debbie
Stothard, coordinator for the Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma,
one of the groups involved, though she denied arrest was a goal.
	   The detainees have health concerns including asthma, migraines,
allergies to bee stings and penicillin, hearing problems and
intolerance to dairy products.
	   Official newspapers _ the only kind permitted _ carried a speech
by Gen. Tin Oo, one of the top four generals of the ruling State
Peace and Development Council, urging Myanmar's youths to
``annihilate'' dangers to the nation.
	   Tin Oo said that traitors were ``trying to belittle the
achievements of the government, to cause misunderstanding and to
induce international pressure on the government.''
	   The general was referring to opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi,
winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, and her National League for
Democracy, landslide winner of parliamentary elections in 1990. The
military never allowed the parliament to meet.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, has recently stepped up pressure on the government
to open a dialogue with her and has set an Aug. 21 deadline for the
military to convene the parliament.

Iran to set up labor camps for drug addicts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran plans to set up labor camps for drug
addicts, and prisoners currently jailed for drug offenses will be
moved to them, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Monday.
	   The agency said the camps would be ready by next March. It did
not say how many camps would be built or where they will be. It
also gave no figures for the number of jailed addicts or what kind
of medical treatment would be available for them.
	   IRNA quoted the country's judiciary chief, Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi, as saying that after the camps are sent up, drug addicts
detained by police would be sent there rather than to prisons.
	   In the late 1980s, when Iran faced a burgeoning drug addiction
problem after the 1980-88 war with Iraq, Iranian officials said
that hard labor camps would be set up for addicts. It is not known
if any were built.
	   Government officials have recently voiced concern about an
increasing drug problem in Iran.
	   An unidentified Education Ministry official told local
newspapers Saturday that drug use in Iranian high schools had
doubled in a year. He said that 100,000 students were believed to
be using illegal substances.
	   Last month, Mohammad Fallah, Iran's drugs czar, said that 1.2
million of Iran's 60 million people were drug abusers.
	   The drugs most heavily used in Iran are opium and hashish.
	   Iran passed a law more than a decade ago mandating the death
sentence for anyone caught dealing in drugs. But people detained
with small quantities for personal use generally have been jailed.
	   Scores of alleged drug smugglers and addicts were hanged under
the law, but the government stopped releasing information several
years ago about people executed for drug offenses.

Military repledges support for Indonesian president, constitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's powerful armed forces,
besieged by allegations of human rights abuses, repledged their
support for President B.J. Habibie and the nation's constitution
Monday.
	   The military ``will always support a president who gains power
in a constitutional way, whoever he is,'' said Defense Ministry
secretary-general Lt. Gen. Suyono.
	   Habibie, who has promised sweeping political and economic
reforms, has relied on the support of the military since he
replaced former autocratic leader Suharto as president on May 21.
	   Suharto ended 32 years in power following riots and protests
triggered by the worst economic crisis in decades. In line with the
constitution, he handed power over to Habibie, who had been his
vice president.
	   About 1,200 people were killed and more than 150 women were
reportedly raped in May's violence. Thousands of buildings were
looted and burned, many of them owned by the minority Chinese
community, which dominates Indonesia's economy.
	   Suyono made the comments to a group of indigenous Indonesian
business leaders, and also read a speech written by military
commander Gen. Wiranto.
	   In his speech, Wiranto said Indonesia was now safe for business.
	   ``The security and political stability has been recovered,''
Wiranto said in the text. ``So there should be no doubt about
Indonesia's situation at present.''
	   The speech made no reference to a long list of allegations
against the military concerning human rights abuses during
Suharto's rule.
	   Human rights organizations have accused troops of atrocities in
outlying provinces such as Aceh, East Timor and Irian Jaya, where
the military has attacked rebel movements.
	   The military is also currently investigating the alleged
involvement of senior officers in the abduction and torture earlier
this year of dozens of anti-Suharto activists.
	   On Monday, an armed forces tribunal questioned Suharto's
son-in-law, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a former commander of
Indonesia's special forces, about the abductions.
	   Ten lower-ranking soldiers who had been under his command have
been charged with the kidnappings and are to be tried in a military
court.
	   A separate government investigation is also looking into the
role the military played in May's violence.

EU opposes selling takeoff and landing slots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union competition Commissioner
Karel Van Miert said Monday he opposes a suggestion by British
authorities that British Airways and American Airlines sell any
take-off and landing time slots relinquished to gain regulatory
clearance for their alliance.
	   Van Miert said in a statement released to reporters that,
overall, Britain's director-general of the Office Of Fair Trading
was close to the EU's recommendations on the alliance.
	   He said, however, that the suggestion that slots could be sold
is unacceptable because it would favor established operators.
	   The Commission, the EU's executive arm, issued a preliminary
ruling in July demanding British Airways and American Airlines shed
267 pairs of weekly take-off and landing slots at Heathrow and
Gatwick airports as a condition for approval of their planned
transatlantic alliance.
	   The Commission's draft opinion is now being considered by the
British and American governments.
	   Van Miert's statement came after John Bridgeman,
director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, recommended on July
31 that the airlines be allowed to sell any slots they are forced
to cede.
	   ``Slots have a substantial monetary value,'' he said in a report
to the British Departmen of Trade and Industry. ``It would be
reasonable to allow the alliance to recoup that value on disposal -
just as companies required to dispose of assets as a condition for
merger approval are allowed to sell those assets. I consider that
the sale of slots would itself provide a natural and
pro-competitive method for allocating slots.''
	   The airlines have said they hope the alliance will be operating
by next year.

Report: Three killed in brawl and riot in Irian Jaya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Three people were killed and dozens
injured when mobs of indigenous New Guinea tribes people fought
with settlers from other parts of Indonesia, a report said Monday.
	   The brawl in Irian Jaya province started at a remote gold mine
Sunday and triggered a riot by thousands of people Monday in the
nearby coastal town of Nabire, about 3,450 kilometers (2,150 miles)
northeast of Jakarta.
	   A local government building as well as several market stalls and
shops were damaged and burned, the official Antara news agency
said.
	   Antara identified the dead as two Irianese men and a settler
from North Sulawesi province. All were gold prospectors.
	   Quoting military officers, Antara said the incident began Sunday
at the mining site, about 69 kilometers (43 miles) from Nabire, in
a dispute over a mining claim.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ As hope of finding more survivors of the
embassy bombing in Nairobi dimmed, investigators focused Monday on
finding the architects of the terror at a crime scene guarded by
armed Marines and hidden from view by black fabric.
	   Nearly simultaneous blasts at the American embassies in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, were sophisticated
attacks.
	   The explosions took a terrible toll: At least 200 dead in
Nairobi and nearly 5,000 injured; at least 10 dead in Dar es Salaam
and 74 injured.
	   The powerful blast in downtown Nairobi destroyed a building next
door to the embassy and damaged others blocks away. The damage in
Tanzania was far less because the embassy is in a residential area.
	   Israel army radio, in a report from Nairobi Monday, said
investigators suspect the bombers used the plastic explosive
Semtex.
	   On Monday morning, rescue teams were working to clear debris
from the badly damaged but still intact ground floor of the Ufundi
Cooperative House adjacent to the embassy, hoping to reach buried
survivors.
	   In Dar es Salaam, American medical examiners were releasing the
bodies of the 10 Tanzanians killed in the blast to their families.
	   As investigators probed the cause of the blast, U.S. Marines on
Monday sealed off the block around the embassy in Tanzania with
barbed wire and sandbags and took up positions on top of the
embassy building and around it.
	   In Nairobi, work at the bomb site was halted for a few minutes
Monday afternoon when stonework began falling off a nearby bank
building.
	   When work resumed, a bulldozer was brought in to clear the top
layer of rubble from the Ufundi building in hopes of reaching the
building's lower floors.
	   ``The feeling is that if there are surivors the most likely
place is the ground floor. It's still intact,'' said Red Cross
spokesman John Sparrow.
	   ``I don't think anybody will give up hope until they get in
there and see.''
	   Police meanwhile patrolled the area around the embassy urging
people to stay away from the area around seven damaged buildings
because of the risk of collapse.

Thai Airways denies Bangladesh bomb threat report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai Airways International denied
reports Monday that its office in Dhaka, Bangladesh, had received a
bomb threat.
	   The report followed warnings to the Thai Embassy in Dhaka of
reprisals against diplomats if Thailand extradites a fugitive coup
leader wanted in the assassination of Bangladesh's first president.
	   ``There has been no bomb threat or any other kind of threat,''
the airline said in a statement. ``Thai's office in Dhaka is still
operating normally during regular working hours.''
	   Security has been tightened for Thai diplomats in Bangladesh
since the two countries signed an extradition treaty in July that
will help send retired Maj. Bazlul Huda home from a Bangkok jail.
	   A trial is already going on in Dhaka of five of the 19 people
accused of assassinating the former president. Fourteen others,
including Huda, fled to other countries. If convicted, they could
be hanged.
	   The 19, most of them former military officers, were charged with
the 1975 killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina.
	   After Hasina came to power in 1996, Huda fled to Thailand, where
he was later arrested by police on charges of shoplifting.
	   Sheikh Mujib, his popular name in Bangladesh, was gunned down at
his Dhaka residence along with 19 family members. Hasina survived
as she was vacationing in Germany.

Rogue trader Nick Leeson has cancer operation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Imprisoned securities trader Nick Leeson is
recovering in a Singapore hospital after an operation to remove a
cancerous tumor from his colon, his lawyer said Monday.
	   Leeson, 31, has served more than 2 1/2 years of a 6 1/2-year
prison sentence in Singapore for fraud and forgery charges stemming
from the 1995 collapse of Barings Bank.
	   Surgeons at Changi General Hospital removed part of Leeson's
colon and part of his large intestine and believe the Sunday
operation went well, said Stephen Pollard, a lawyer with Leeson's
London-based law firm.
	   Leeson, whose cancer was diagnosed Aug. 5, was originally
scheduled for surgery on Tuesday. But the operation was moved ahead
to Sunday after Leeson complained about pain and sickness.
	   The cancer has spread to his lymph nodes and doctors are not yet
certain whether there will be further operations, Leeson's lawyers
said.
	   Pollard said Leeson was recuperating in the hospital. His
lawyers have submitted a plea to Singapore authorities to release
Leeson early on compassionate grounds. Under Singapore's law,
sentences can be commuted only by a direct pardon from the state's
president, Ong Teng Chong.
	   Barings, Britain's oldest merchant bank, collapsed after Leeson
made millions of dollars in unauthorized futures deals from his
base in Singapore. Barings went broke in February 1995 and was
taken over by the Dutch banking and insurance company, ING Group.

Yugoslavia is best of the rest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The best player on the best team missed
four shots in the closing minutes of a tight title game. And his
team still won.
	   It was that kind of World Basketball Championship.
	   Dejan Bodiroga's clumsiness in the clutch did not prevent
Yugoslavia from capturing a record fourth gold medal, nor did it
stop him from picking up tournament MVP honors.
	   But it does reflect the uneven level of play for much of the two
weeks, with only one NBA player _ the Dallas Mavericks' Chris
Anstey, a backup for ninth-place Australia here _ present because
of the league's labor dispute.
	   ``There are 12 MVPs on our team,'' Bodiroga said after scoring
11 points and grabbing 5 rebounds as Yugoslavia rallied to edge
Russia 64-62 Sunday night. ``I'm very happy that I was voted MVP
but the most important thing is that we won the world championship
and we are No. 1 in the world.''
	   With the world's top talent on vacation, Yugoslavia did show it
had the best of the rest.
	   Bodiroga, who plays for a club in Spain, led the way by
averaging team-highs of 14.7 points and 2.2 assists, plus 4.9
rebounds per game. Zeljko Rebraca, a 2.11-meter (6-foot-11) center
for Italian club Benetton Treviso, averaged 13.6 points, 9.1
rebounds and 2.6 blocks.
	   Bodiroga, 25, and Rebraca, 26, both could wind up in the NBA. In
Athens, they stepped into the void left by the absences of
Charlotte Hornets center Vlade Divac and the injured Predrag
Danilovic, a former NBA player.
	   ``We've had so many problems, and players who for one reason or
another are not with us,'' Yugoslav coach Zeljko Obradovic said.
``But we assembled a compact group that trained like crazy over the
last two months.''
	   His American counterpart, Rudy Tomjanovich, had even less time
to cobble together a roster drawn mainly from the Continental
Basketball Association and European leagues.
	   The U.S. squad couldn't defend the title won by Dream Team II,
but did take home the bronze by dominating Greece 84-61.
	   Four years ago, the United States routed Russia 137-91 for the
gold and won all eight of its games by an average of 40 points. Its
unsung successors finished 7-2, including wins over Spain and
quarterfinal foe Italy by a total of five points.
	   Tomjanovich said that at one juncture against Spain he
admonished his charges by barking, ``I could take five guys off the
street and play the same kind of game.''
	   Now the United States will have to go through qualifying for the
2000 Sydney Olympics. Only Yugoslavia, as world champion, and
Australia, as host, earn automatic invitations.
	   ``In life you set goals for yourself,'' said Jason Sasser, who
split last season between the CBA and Spain, ``and sometimes you
fall short. Third is better than last.''
	   Greece failed in its bid to capture its first world championship
medal, finishing fourth for the second consecutive tournament.
	   While the hosts played to packed houses every time out, almost
every other game until the closing weekend had only hundreds of
fans in the stands.
	   Other lowlights of the two weeks included the occasional power
outages at the arenas, attributed to the forest fires blazing on
the outskirts of Athens, and a positive doping test turned in by
Nigerian center Julius Nwosu, who was given a two-month ban by
FIBA, the sport's governing body.
	   Alberto Herreras, who led Spain to fifth place, topped all
players with a 17.9 scoring average.
	   The next world championships are in 2002 in Indianapolis.

Beating the heat, Gaza style: swimsuit dip still seen as daring

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ While the Palestinian lands suffer
through a sweltering heat wave, some women in the socially
conservative Gaza Strip are taking a radical step to keep cool.
	   They're swimming. In swimsuits.
	   But only at a pair of private clubs, with men firmly banished
from the premises. Elsewhere along Gaza's Mediterranean coastline,
women were continuing their usual practice of swimming only in
long, enveloping robes.
	   In Gaza, record temperatures of more than 90 degrees F (36 C)
combined with 85 percent humidity are making life miserable in
crowded towns and refugee camps. Health officials said 200 people
have been treated at hospitals for heat-related ailments.
	   ``Nobody can walk in the street during the day,'' said Sami
Khalefa, part of a long line of customers waiting to buy ice cream
and soft drinks. ``This heat wave is a punishment from God.''
	   ``The water is only way you can avoid the heat,'' said Wael
Bdear, a 21-year-old man from a seaside refugee camp, as he paddled
in the Mediterranean. ``I'm going to spend all day in the sea.''
	   The main Gaza City beach was packed with hundreds of families,
including women in flowing robes.
	   At the private Seagull tourist resort in Gaza, director Hiba
Hikmat said women in bathing suits were being allowed to swim
daily.
	   Before the heat wave, the resort was open to swimsuit-wearing
women only two days a week, but Hikmat said because there was only
one other private resort in Gaza where they can swim without robes,
it was decided to effectively turn the resort over to them.
	   Temperatures in Israel and the Palestinian lands have been
higher than normal for more than three weeks.
	   In southern Israel, a record 47 Celsius (118 F) for the day was
recorded Sunday. In Jerusalem, the temperature hovered at 41
Celsius (106 F).
	   In the West Bank town of Jericho, where temperatures soared past
40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), a Palstinian prisoner died in jail
from overheating, officials said Sunday.
	   At a farm in northern Israel, 60 chickens perished in the
scorching heat. Health ministry officials urged people to drink
plenty of water and stay in air-conditioned rooms if possible.

Yangtze River flood crest passes major city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Precede BEIJING &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with flood peak passing Wuhan without incident &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WUHAN, China (AP) _ A powerful Yangtze River flood peak passed
through the major industrial city of Wuhan without incident Monday,
but the misery of serious flooding continued elsewhere in central
China.
	   The Yangtze at Wuhan came within centimeters (inches) of
previous record highs, with water lapping at the tops of sandbagged
dikes, but it did not cause flooding in the city of 7 million
people, said a Wuhan city flood official who gave only his surname,
Liu.
	   ``Everything is normal but we're keeping our eye on the
situation,'' Liu said.
	   Downriver in Jiujiang, Jiangxi province, residents and soldiers
guarding weakened dikes prepared for a long, anxious night as the
crest barreled toward the city of 500,000 people.
	   ``The situation is already very dangerous. The crest is going to
test everything we've got,'' said a flood control official who gave
his surname, Xiong.
	   Serious breaches in the dike at Jiujiang have been filled, but
low-lying parts of the city remain flooded, said Xiong. The river
burst a 60 meter- (198 foot-) wide hole in a Jiujiang levee Friday,
state media said.
	   Floods from summer rains that fell heavier and earlier than
usual have killed more than 2,000 people nationwide, the government
says. The Yangtze has risen to levels not seen since 1954, when
floods killed some 30,000 people.
	   Some flood victims have been sheltering in lean-tos for more
than six weeks, raising concerns over the spread of contagious
diseases, along with dysentery, infections and psychological
stress.
	   The Yangtze is expected to remain at dangerously high levels for
weeks, and more rain was falling on the river's upper reaches in
southwest Sichuan province.
	   Torrential rains also have fallen in northeastern Heilongjiang
and Jilin provinces, raising the Nenjiang river to record levels,
the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   In the Yangtze's middle reaches, preparations were being
completed to deliberately flood farmland if necessary to lower the
river level and safeguard cities downstream, Xinhua said.
	   But facing strong opposition from farmers unwilling to see their
land and homes destroyed, officials who had originally evacuated
330,000 residents in the Jingjiang area in central China's Hubei
province scaled back the size of the area that might be flooded,
necessitating the removal of just 110,000 people, Xinhua said.
	   Authorities already have deliberately flooded other areas to
protect major levees, most recently on Sunday when officials
blasted dikes in Hubei's Jianli County to divert floodwaters and
lower the river by 10-25 centimeters (4-10 inches) along its middle
and lower reaches.
	   Meanwhile, an initial shipment of tents, plastic sheeting,
blankets and water containers donated by the United States was
expected to arrive in southern Hunan province, one of the worst hit
areas, aboard a U.S. Air Force cargo plane Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador
to China James Sasser announced.
	   Washington also contributed U.S. dlrs 250,000 to aid Red Cross
relief operations in China, Sasser said.
	   Collection boxes and a 24-hour hot line to receive contributions
for tents and food also were set up in Beijing, the official
Beijing Morning Post reported.

All passengers released after mysterious hijacking scare in Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After questioning dozens of passengers, police
have released all those who were on a commercial flight that was
feared hijacked when the crew found an anonymous note demanding
money, a report said Monday.
	   The crew discovered the note Sunday when the East Line aircraft
was en route to Moscow from the Siberian city of Tyumen. The note,
found in the plane's business class, warned of a bomb on board, and
demanded 621,000 rubles (dlrs 100,000) and onward passage to
another country.
	   But authorities were never able to determine who among the 97
passengers wrote the message. After the plane sat for four hours on
the tarmac at the Domodedovo airport, all of the passengers were
taken into the terminal building.
	   Police questioned dozens of passengers and took handwriting
samples from all of them except the children. But authorities were
unable to find a match with the note and by Monday, everyone had
been released, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   No bomb was found on the plane and no ransom was paid.
	   Airport security has worsened in Russia since the Soviet Union
fell apart in 1991. Hijackers have targeted domestic flights a
number of times, but in most cases have given up after negotiating
with authorities.

German economics minister wants even longer store hours
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Pointing to a survey that found most
Germans happy about being able to shop later, Economics Minister
Guenter Rexrodt said Monday he would like to see the store-closing
laws loosened even more.
	   A poll by the Ifo-Institute and Infratest found 55 percent of
Germans in favor of the longer shopping hours in effect since
November 1996 _ the first relaxation in 40 years.
	   Thirteen percent said they'd like to see stores open even later
than 8 p.m. during the week, and 25 percent wanted to be able to
shop on Saturdays longer than the current 4 p.m. closing time.
	   ``I'd be happy to take up any initiatives by businesses for
further liberalization,'' Rexrodt said.
	   The president of the main German retailers association, Hermann
Franzen, said over the weekend, however, that it would take at
least two more years before his members could discuss another
liberalization of store hours.
	   ``We're not living in America after all,'' he said.
	   The poll of 2,500 Germans over 14, conducted in June, did not
give a margin of error.

Russian oil exports up, but revenues down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian oil exports were up during the first half
of this year, but revenues decreased sharply in comparison with
last year because of a slump in world oil prices.
	   Russia exported 437.4 barrels (62.5 million metric tons) of
crude in the first six months of 1998, up 10 percent from the 396
barrels (56.6 million metric tons) for the same period last year,
Interfax news agency reported Monday, citing the State Customs
Committee.
	   But revenues fell 25 percent, down to dlrs 5.13 billion, the
report said.
	   World crude oil prices have been fluctuating between dlrs 13 to
dlrs 14 per barrel, down from dlrs 19 at the start of the year.

Thailand should close three banks, finance minister says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Tarrin clarifying that banks likely
to be merged, not closed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will lose some of its weaker
banks, possibly through mergers, in a much-awaited financial sector
shakeup aimed at reviving the battered economy, the finance
minister said Monday.
	   The bank measures should be announced Saturday as part of a
package of reforms following negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund on the latest installment of its dlrs 17.2 billion
bailout for the Thai economy.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda clarified remarks
attributed to him Monday in an interview with the Bangkok Post by
saying he did not mean that three banks would close, but rather
that the sector would be ``rationalized.''
	   ``The plan might bring smaller numbers of commercial banks,''
Tarrin told reporters. ``But the remaining banks will be the
stronger ones. How many of them will remain depends on the market
mechanism.''
	   Widely expected is the merger of three state-run banks _ Siam
City Bank, First Bangkok City Bank and Bangkok Metropolitan Bank.
	   The fourth state-run bank, Bangkok Bank of Commerce, may be put
up for sale to foreign investors, Tarrin told the Bangkok Post.
	   Tarrin told the Post that the Thai economy should start to
bottom out in the first quarter of 1999 provided the government's
efforts aren't neutralized by outside developments.
	   Japan's sluggish economy and a devaluation of the Chinese
currency could prolong Thailand's crisis, Tarrin told the
newspaper. But whatever happens internationally, the Thai
government will have to move forward with reforms.
	   Thailand's financial system all but collapsed in mid-1998
following political interference in the once independent central
bank, and massive uncontrolled lending and corruption in private
financial institutions.
	   The government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, which came to
power after the crisis erupted, has made financial restructuring a
major priority.

Employers: Hanson hurting jobs growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Almost one in three employers thinks
the rise of Pauline Hanson's right-wing populist One Nation party
will cost people jobs, a new survey has found.
	   The latest Morgan and Banks Job Index showed Monday that 31
percent of the 3,600 employers surveyed think One Nation will have
a negative impact on employment.
	   Only 2.2 percent of respondents think One Nation's popularity
will have a positive impact on jobs growth, the August-October
Index says.
	   In Queensland, where One Nation candidates already hold 11 seats
in the state parliament, 41.7 percent of employers thought Hanson's
party would have a negative impact on employment and 4.8 percent
thought it would be positive.
	   South Australia, where One Nation has high levels of support,
had the lowest level of employers who believed the party would be
bad for jobs growth _ 26.1 percent.
	   But only 3.6 percent thought One Nation could solve the nation's
unemployment woes.
	   Tony Abbott, the parliamentary secretary to Employment Minister
David Kemp, said the survey showed One Nation's professed concern
for the unemployed was doing those without jobs no good.
	   ``It's not surprising that One Nation should be bad for jobs,''
Abbott said.
	   ``After all, if overseas buyers feel negative about Australia,
they can readily turn to South America for coal, Brazil for iron
ore and America for farm produce.''
	   Simplistic notions about trade and immigration could easily turn
out to hurt the very people they were supposed to help, he said.
	   Hanson, a member of the federal parliament, has been criticized
widely as a racist. She has warned that Australia is becoming
``Asianized,'' opposes specific welfare benefits for Aborigines and
advocates economic protectionism.
	   Last month, Trade and Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said her
party's success is costing Australia investment and jobs.

England wins by 23 runs to take the series
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes: ADDS details and byline
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ England scored its first five-test series
victory since 1986, bowling out South Africa for 196 to win the
fifth and deciding test by 23 runs at Headingley on Monday.
	   England came back from 0-1 down in the series after losing the
second test at Lord's by 10 wickets to win the fourth and fifth
tests and claim the series 2-1.
	   South Africa, set a target of 219 to win the match and the
series, was bowled out for 195 runs in its second innings.
	   Both teams entered the final day in hunt of a series victory.
South Africa needed 34 runs and England needed two wickets _ it
took England just 30 minutes to win.
	   It was the first time an England side has come from behind to
take a series since David Gower's side won 2-1 in India in 1984-85.
	   South Africa resumed at 185 for eight and added nine to its
total in five overs before Allan Donald edged a slower ball from
Angus Fraser to wicketkeeper Alec Stewart.
	   Darren Gough ended the series when he dismissed South Africa's
No.11 batsman Makhaya Ntini.
	   Gough trapped Ntini leg before wicket to seal a remarkable win
and finished the innings with a career best 6-42. Angus Fraser took
3-50.
	   Shaun Pollock, who had carried South Africa's hopes into the
last day, was left unbeaten on 28.
	   It was Stewart's first series as captain since taking over from
Mike Atherton at the start of the summer.
	   ``South Africa are in the top three sides in the world and we
weren't in that top three, and that made the victory all the more
sweet,'' Stewart said. ``We have shown in this series that we can
compete with top sides like South Africa.''
	   Stewart said England was now looking forward to the Ashes series
in Australia later this year.
	   ``To beat the best in the world is a big challenge,'' Stewart
said. ``They (Australia) have been on top of us in five series, and
it's time we did something.''
	   South African skipper Hansie Cronje said his side was on track
until the fourth day at Old Trafford to win the series.
	   ``The pendulum swung their way and took a definite win away from
us,'' he said. ``Obviously, we are very disappointed.
	   ``We had high hopes after winning the second Test at Lord's and
did our best at Old Trafford but we didn't get the wickets. Then
things started to go wrong for us.
	   ``The Old Trafford Test was an opportunity for us to go 2-0 in
front and we had another opportunity at Trent Bridge to get a big
score and put England under pressure.''
	   Cronje refused to be drawn into a debate on the umpiring, but
said he would sit back and reflect on the series before submitting
a report to his board.
	   ``There are many ifs and buts but considering everything we were
probably a bit light in our first innings,'' he said. ``You do not
want to blame anyone and there are many turning points in a game
but when you get an opportunity you have to take it.''
	   Cronje said the defeat was a step backward for his team.
	   ``It's time we stood up and took responsibility,'' he said.
	   Donald, who is carrying an injury to his left heel, was given
the option of missing the one-day triangular involving England and
Sri Lanka.
	   ``Allan feels he's got some unfinished business, so want to be
part of the whole tour,'' Cronje added.
	   Donald, with 33 wickets (avge 19.78), was South Africa's
man-of-the series, while Atherton with 493 runs (avge 54.77) won
the honors for England.

Coast guard investigating parasailing death of British woman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Coast guard officers Monday were
investigating the weekend death of a British woman while she was
parasailing on the resort island of Zakinthos.
	   According to the Merchant Marine Ministry, which is responsible
for the coast guard, 40-year-old Sara-Elisabeth Gzaplincka died
instantly on Sunday when she hit the water at high speed.
	   Gzaplincka fell approximately 50 meters (164 feet) from the
parachute she wearing as it was being pulled by a speed boat.
Authorities are trying to determine how the woman got out of the
safety harness. There was no hometown available for Gzaplincka.
	   Zakinthos, in the Ioanian Sea, is 240 kilometers (145 miles)
west of Athens.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Exports from Egypt's duty free zones
increased by some 7 per cent this year due to incentives and
facilities provided by the government, a senior official said
Monday.
	   Ibrahim Fawzi, head of the State Investment Authority, said the
total value of exports from the zones totaled dlrs 228.6 million in
the first seven months ending in July, up from dlrs 214 million for
the same period last year.
	   About 12 per cent of the exports went to U.S. markets and 11 per
cent to Europe, Fawzi said in a statement.
	   He said the increase was due to considerable improvement in the
quality of the goods and competitive prices.
	   Last year, some dlrs 385 million worth of industrial goods were
exported from the zones, while the total Egyptian exports were dlrs
3.8 billion, only dlrs 1.4 billion of which were manufactured
goods.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Arab Real Estate Co. will be listed on the
Kuwait Stock Exchange by the end of the month _ raising the number
of firms that trade their stocks to 76, the company said Monday.

month, said Haidar al-Joma, general manager of the Arab Real Estate

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The U.S. government signed two grant
agreements of dlrs 54.3 to help increase economic opportunities in
Jordan, an embassy statement said.
	   The agreements bring the total of U.S. grants to Jordan to dlrs
124.8 million.
	   Under the first agreement, the United States would give Jordan
dlrs 50 million in cash transfers to reduce its international debt.
The cash transfer is designed to support ongoing economic
restructuring and reform and promoting investment, stimulating
trade, creating employment and increasing income.

USAID initiatives to increase already funded economic activities,
the embassy statement said.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices and turn over increased by
3.17 percent, or 5.53 points on the Amman Stock Exchange last
month, a report said Monday.
	   Brokers attributed the increase to huge local and foreign
investments in commercial banks.
	   The report reflected activity for 20 business days ending July
31.
	   Shares of commercial banks leading trading in the stock market
increased by 11.4 per cent and insurance sector by 1.14 percent.
But shares of industrial firms dropped by 12.8 percent and services
sector by 2.7 percent.
	   Turn over nudged up last month by 121.1 percent to 51.3 million
dinars (dlrs 72.2 million), the report said.
	   It said 16.9 million shares were traded during July, with an
increase of 23.4 percent from the previous month.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ The Central Bank has changed the official
exchange rate to 46 Syrian pounds to the dollar, Syria's state-run
news agency reported Sunday. The rate had been 45 pounds to the
dollar.
	   This is the third time the Central Bank has changed the exchange
rate in less than two years. The move is aimed at unifying the
exchange rate and stimulating Syrian exports.
	   It is also aimed at curbing black markets, the news agency
quoted a Central Bank official as saying.

Scandal rocks Taiwan's police force

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A former acting director of Taiwan's
police academy was arrested Monday for allegedly accepting millions
of dollars in bribes to rig examination results for would-be
cadets.
	   Authorities also held 43 other police officers for questioning
in connection with the bribery scandal, which has shaken Taiwan's
police force.
	   Kuo Chen-yuan, former acting director at the Central Police
University, was arrested while visiting a friend in Taipei, the
official Central News Agency reported.
	   Ting Yuan-chin, director of the National Police Administration,
said at a news conference that the damage caused by Kuo's case was
``very serious.''
	   University President Hsieh Ruey-chi told reporters that Kuo
allegedly leaked examination papers or ``entered the wrong results
in the computers'' during the two years he was acting director of
the university's computer center, beginning in 1996.
	   Kuo was removed from that post last month. University officials
became suspicious when several of those taking the exams had the
same answers to questions, and passed with 95 percent or higher
scores, Hsieh added.
	   The English-language China News said in a front-page story that
Kuo had accepted up to 25 million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs
714,000) from applicants.
	   It said officials at the university began receiving anonymous
reports of bribery before the entrance exams in mid-July for the
two-year college course. University officials had neglected to
carefully monitor the examinations due to lack of manpower, the
paper said.
	   The United Daily News said academy officials were also alerted
by applicants who failed the entrance exams, or by disgruntled
university students.
	   Taiwan's police and military have been virtually untouchable for
decades as the island's protectors against a possible armed
invasion from mainland China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade
province.
	   Minister of Interior Huang Chu-wen was quoted on Taiwan
Television as saying the government would ``weed out'' all those
suspected of colluding with Kuo, without indicating what their
penalties would be.

Conviction against former East German spy swapper lifted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Saying the former East German government was at
fault, not its negotiator, a federal court lifted the extortion
conviction of a former East German lawyer who arranged spectacular
spy and dissident swaps during the Cold War, judicial officials
said Monday.
	   As West Germany's key East German contact for humanitarian
issues, Wolfgang Vogel negotiated the swaps of over 150 spies from
more than two dozen nations, as well as release of nearly 34,000
East German political prisoners and the relocation to the West of
some 215,000 East Germans.
	   After the Berlin Wall fell, he and some of his associates were
tried on charges of having extorted cash and property from those
they helped move to the West.
	   Vogel, 72, was convicted of extortion in one trial, but cleared
in another after a judge ruled it could not be proven that he had
demanded payment for helping citizens to leave East Germany.
	   The case reached the Federal Court of Justice in Leipzig after
both prosecutors and Vogel's defense sought clarification of the
dueling rulings.
	   In throwing out the extortion conviction, the federal court
ruled that it was the former communist government _ not its
negotiators _ who was accountable for extorting payment for
permission to leave.
	   The court cited its own precedent-setting ruling issued in April
that cleared one of Vogel's associates of extortion charges for the
same reason.
	   The court, however, left untouched Vogel's conviction on perjury
and forgery charges, along with the 14-month suspended sentence for
perjury and 92,000 mark (dlrs 51,000) fine for forgery.
	   The decision was dated Aug. 5 but released only Monday.
	   During the long legal process, Vogel had supporters among U.S.
diplomats, church leaders and former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who
made a point of visiting Vogel while he was held in investigative
custody in the early 1990s.
	   Among the more spectacular cases that Vogel negotiated was the
the 1962 release of U-2 spy pilot Gary Powers, whose plane had been
shot down over the Soviet Union, and the trade of Soviet dissident
Natan Sharansky for several East Bloc spies in 1986.
	   But it was his efforts negotiating the relocation of ordinary
East Germans that led to the charges against him.

Russian Communist lawmaker's aide, four others shot to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An aide to a Communist lawmaker and four other
people were shot to death in an apartment in a Moscow suburb,
Russian media reported Monday.
	   The body of the 37-year-old aide, identified only by his last
name, Podchernyayev, was found Monday in the apartment in the town
of Khimki, the ITAR-Tass news agency and the ORT television station
reported. The owner of the apartment and three other guests had
also been fatally shot, the reports said.
	   An identification card showed Podchernyayev to be an aide to
Communist lawmaker Darya Mitina.
	   Another assistant to Mitina, Sergei Chesnokov, said the lawmaker
had about 700 aides and could not immediately confirm whether
Podchernyayev was one of them. Mitina was on vacation during
parliament's summer break, he said.
	   Many Russian lawmakers, especially the ultranationalists, have
hundreds of aides, who enjoy the perks and benefits that the
position offers. Shootings of lawmakers' aides have become common
and police have said that several of the victims had criminal
records.
	   No motive for the killing was given. Police found 30 used shells
from a Kalashnikov automatic rifle, a pistol and other firearms,
along with two permits to carry a gun, which had been issued to
Podchernyayev and one of the guests, the reports said.

Jordanian minister optimistic on expanding ties with Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Jordan's foreign minister said Monday at the
end of a three-day visit to Tehran that Jordan and Iran will work
to improve relations.
	   Foreign Minister Jawad Anani told reporters at the airport that
his talks with Iranian officials were fruitful, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   ``There are good grounds for the expansion of ties between Iran
and Jordan,'' the agency quoted him as saying.
	   Anani said the two countries agreed to more visits by officials
from both capitals.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said the talks were
``frank and sincere'' and laid the groundwork for improving ties,
IRNA said.
	   ``Naturally we have some difference of opinion on certain
issues, but we stressed the fact that given their common enemy, all
regional countries should get united,'' IRNA quoted Kharrazi as
saying.
	   Jordan and Iran broke diplomatic relations during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq War but resumed them after the conflict ended. The May
1997 election of moderate President Mohammad Khatami brought warmer
ties between Iran and Arab states, including Jordan.
	   However, Jordan and Iran still disagree about the Middle East
peace process. Jordan has signed a peace treaty with Israel; Iran
opposes any peace with the Jewish state.
	   Last November, Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan met with Khatami
during his visit to Tehran for a meeting of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference.

Opposition complains to U.N. over seats; investigations stop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with opposition urging U.N. chief to review
allocation of parliamentary seats &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Claiming that all the opposition's
allegations of fraud have so far proven baseless, officials said
Monday they will stop looking into complaints about irregularities
in last month's parliamentary elections.
	   Meanwhile, Cambodia's top opposition leaders, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, appealed to the United Nations, which has
cautiously endorsed the July 26 polls, to intervene on their
behalf.
	   Closing the door on election complaints deals a serious blow to
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, who are refusing invitations by victor
Hun Sen to join a coalition government until their charges are
addressed.
	   Spokesman Samraing Kamsan said the National Election Committee
has received more than 300 complaints from the opposition parties,
but ``found no fraud, only slight technical errors.''
	   For the past week, he said, election officials have been
painstakingly recounting ballots from seven of the country's 1,600
communes and found that ``there has been no cheating.''
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party emerged as the winner of the
elections when long-delayed preliminary results were announced last
week. The party took a slight majority _ 64 seats _ in the
122-member National Assembly.
	   That falls short of the two-thirds needed to form a government,
and Hun Sen has been looking for partners. The prince's FUNCINPEC
party is slated to pick up 43 seats and the Sam Rainsy Party 15.
	   The opposition is alleging fraud in voting and ballot counting
and has threatened to boycott the new National Assembly if their
complaints are not properly investigated, setting the stage for a
possible political crisis.
	   As their situation appeared to worsen, Ranariddh and Rainsy
wrote a letter Monday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan asking
that the United Nations help settle a dispute over seat
allocations.
	   The United Nations helped coordinate more than 500 international
observers to oversee the election.
	   ``Now we put our faith in the United Nations to do what is in
its power to help prevent a procedural manipulation that would
distort the will of the Cambodian people,'' they wrote.
	   The opposition leaders charge that the original formula for use
in allocating seats was quietly changed before election day. The
revised formula favors the CPP, which would have won 59 seats under
the original rules.
	   Samraing Kamsan brushed off allegations of wrongdoing Monday,
saying that the formula was never changed, just corrected.
	   He said that he was not impressed by any of the complaints filed
so far with the NEC, saying, ``There are a lot of complaints, but
no real evidence.''
	   Future complaints will have to be forwarded to the
Constitutional Council, the country's highest appeals body.
	   The election came a year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his
co-prime minister in a violent coup, shattering a tense dual
premiership formed after U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new elections would restore his legitimacy in
the eyes of the international community and lead to a resumption of
foreign aid.
	   So far, foreign observers and the United Nations have generally
endorsed the election, despite widespread pre-vote violence.
Critics accused Hun Sen of packing the National Election Committee
and other agencies with his supporters.

Kosovo Albanian rebels try to retain last strongholds

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backed into a few remaining
strongholds, ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence for the
Serbian province of Kosovo fought Monday to cling to territory in
the face of a punishing Serb offensive.
	   With Western diplomats pushing them to agree to peace talks,
Kosovo Liberation Army fighters skirmished with Serbian forces
throughout the weekend and again on Monday.
	   Meanwhile, although one moderate KLA faction signaled its
readiness over the weekend for negotiations that could lead to the
province regaining autonomy from Serbia, prospects for talks
remained uncertain.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill arrived in the provincial capital of
Pristina on Monday to try to push the peace process forward.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up roughly 90 percent of Kosovo's 2
million people, and the rebels are fighting for independence from
Serbia, the largest of the two republics that form Yugoslavia.
Reports from both warring sides Monday showed skirmishes continuing
at several locations.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center said three KLA fighters were killed
Monday in a clash with Serb police in the village of Dura, about 40
kilometers (25 miles) south of Pristina. Authorities there said the
KLA attacked a police patrol and police fired back, killing three.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said one
Albanian was killed by a sniper in Suva Reka, about 40 kilometers
(25 miles) southwest of Pristina, early Monday.
	   The center also said an Albanian village in the Drenica area of
central Kosovo was under siege. It said 400 civilians were being
encircled by Serb forces in Lausa village, which was one of the
biggest KLA strongholds before falling to Serb forces Aug. 2.
	   Four civilians who managed to get out of the village said two
women and a man were killed during the attack on Lausa.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook criticized the Serbs for
their recent attacks involving civilians. He said he was
particularly disturbed that the Serbs had set fire to crops in
Kosovo in recent days to try to ensure that villagers won't return.
	   ``The events of the last 10 days have been deeply disturbing and
have undoubtedly caused great hardship to many civilians throughout
Kosovo,'' Cook told the British Broadcasting Corp. on Sunday.
	   Pressing for talks while holding out the threat of NATO
intervention, Western diplomats gave the warring sides a proposal
Friday and Saturday, outlining how autonomy might work in Kosovo.
	   ``This is not a war that either side can win,'' Cook said. ``The
only way this war can be ended is by both sides coming to the table
with an international presence and negotiating a satisfactory
constitutional political settlement.''
	   According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the Serb
offensive has forced 167,000 people from their homes within Kosovo
since the conflict exploded in February, with the total of
displaced 231,000 including those who fled the province.
	   Hundreds have been killed, with thousands of others remaining in
the woods and hills, many of them without food or water.

Philippine president breaks promise to quit smoking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada, who vowed
to quit what he called his last vice _ cigarette smoking _ when he
became president, broke his pledge during a visit to the southern
Philippines over the weekend.
	   A photograph of Estrada puffing on a cigarette was printed on
the front page of the nationally circulated Philippine Daily
Inquirer in its Monday edition.
	   The paper said Estrada, who previously was vice president, was
relaxing after a hearty lunch in Cotabato City when he took out a
cigarette to smoke.
	   In May, Estrada said he would quit smoking when he lost the
``vice'' in his title and became president. Estrada was the runaway
winner of the May 11 presidential election against nine other
contenders.
	   ``If I cannot discipline myself, how can I discipline my
people?'' he said of his decision to quit.
	   Estrada, 61, a mustachioed ex-actor, admits to being a former
heavy-drinking womanizer and gambler, but says he has reformed. But
various people have reported that he continues to drink regularly
with friends.

Russian government allocates aid to farms hurt by drought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government will allocate 141 million rubles
(dlrs 23 million) as relief to the nation's farms hurt by a
crop-wrecking drought, according to orders signed by Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   The government expects to make up for the loss to its
cash-strapped budget through collections of land taxes and rent
payments, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Monday.
	   This year's drought badly hit Russia's grain yields, which are
expected to fall almost 20 million metric tons (22 million tons)
from last year, and total some 70 million metric tons (77 million
tons).

German chancellor rules out coalition with opposition after
</HEADLINE>
election &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Lafontaine reax, analyst predicting `grand
coalition' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Back from vacation ``with a cheerful
heart,'' Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday ruled out joining the
opposition Social Democrats in a coalition government after fall
elections, saying such speculation was only meant to confuse
voters.
	   ``There won't be a `grand coalition' with us,'' Kohl said before
the steering committee of his Christian Democratic Union held its
first meeting after the summer break.
	   Social Democratic chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder, who
has been leading Kohl in opinion polls, said last week that if
coalition talks with the ecology-minded Greens didn't pan out, he
would not hesitate to turn to the Christian Democrats.
	   Such a pairing of Germany's two main parties hasn't been tried
in Bonn since the 1960s, although it is not unheard of at the state
level.
	   But Kohl insisted the differences between his conservative party
and the traditionally leftist Social Democrats were too great for a
``grand coalition'' to work.
	   Attempts by Schroeder to steer his party closer to a ``new
center'' with business-friendly policies and tough talk on law and
order ``are not believable,'' Kohl said.
	   Social Democratic Party chairman Oskar Lafontaine countered by
saying Kohl's pre-election promises are not believable either,
adding that the voters would decide what form the next government
would take.
	   Kohl said he was optimistic about his chances for winning a
record fifth term on Sept. 27 and was going ``into this decisive
battle with a cheerful heart.''
	   Asked whether he intended to serve the entire four year term, he
said, ``right now I first am going to win the election.''
	   A Social Democratic-Greens coalition has been leading in opinion
polls for months, but recent surveys show the government parties
gaining ground to make the race almost neck-and-neck.
	   Lafontaine said a closing of the gap was to be expected, but
insisted that most Germans still want a change of government.
	   Juergen Falter, a noted political scientist and election analyst
at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, said his research shows
the Social Democrats' lead is less stable than it looks.
	   He told the Rhein-Zeitung daily that he thinks Schroeder will
have such a narrow margin after the election that to him, a ``grand
coalition'' will be preferable to a risky coalition with the
Greens.

British Airways earnings weathered damage from Asia, currencies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Airways PLC said quarterly earnings fell
by 34 percent to 145 million pounds (dlrs 240 million) but that its
results held up well amid problems from the Asian crisis and the
strong British pound.
	   British Airways said pre-tax profits for the three months ending
June 30 compared with earnings of 220 million pounds in the same
period a year earlier, when results were lifted by a one-time gain
of 129 million pounds from the sale of shares its former partner,
US Airways.
	   Disregarding that one-time gain, British Airways said its
profits had risen by 59 percent.
	   Revenues rose 3 percent to 2.29 billion pounds (dlrs 3.79
billion) for the April-June period _ the first quarter of British
Airways' fiscal year. The company reported revenues of 2.22 billion
pounds in the same period a year earlier.
	   Chief executive Bob Ayling called the earnings ``a good set of
results'' that came despite severe economic troubles in Asia, where
British Airways has scaled back some operations, and the high value
of sterling, which has hurt profits at virtually all British
multinationals.
	   British Airways said the unfavorable currency rates have enabled
rival carriers to compete more strongly for international travelers
making connections through Europe.
	   But the company said it got a break on its fuel bill, as oil
prices hit their lowest prices in a decade, and it reported
progress in its continuing efforts to cut costs.
	   ``As the airline market becomes more competitive we will
continue to improve efficiency to safeguard continuing improvements
in our products, our ground services and our people,'' Ayling said
in a statement.

	   CHARLESTOWN, St. Kitts and Nevis (AP) _ With a lack of fanfare
entirely appropriate to their reserved ways, residents of the tiny
island of Nevis trickled into voting stations Monday to decide
whether to make the Western hemisphere's smallest nation even
smaller.
	   ``I think we need it. It's time,'' Errol Libure said of the
referendum on whether to break up Nevis' federation with
neighboring St. Kitts.
	   If secessionists get the two-thirds vote needed, ``It's going to
be a big party tonight,'' said Trevor Browne, a 23-year-old mason
who voted at an old stone Methodist Church in the Caribbean
island's hilly parish of Gingerland.
	   With only 6,785 voters registered among the 9,000 islanders,
results were expected late Monday.
	   Defying international opinion _ decidedly against putting
another mini-state on the world map _ Amory and his supporters say
the time has come to secede from neighboring St. Kitts, population
32,000.

Spanish woman seeks 400,000 dollars in malpractice suit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CORDOBA, Spain (AP) _ A pregnant woman who lost her baby and her
reproductive organs due to a surgical error is suing Cordoba's
Health Department for 60 million pesetas (392,000 dollars), her
lawyer said Monday.
	   Jesus Perez Angulo said his client, Rafaela Martinez Ruiz, 39,
is also pressing charges against the hospital where she underwent
surgery in the southern city of Cordoba and against the doctors who
performed it.
	   She is accusing them of engaging in medical malpractice and
carrying out an unauthorized abortion.
	   Last August, Ruiz Martinez was admitted to the Reina Sofia
Hospital because of a uterine inflammation. At the time, she did
not know she was pregant, according to her lawyer.
	   Surgeons mistook her for another Rafaela Martinez Ruiz, aged 71,
who was in the hospital at the same time and scheduled for a
hysterectomy because she had uterine cancer. Because of the mixup,
the younger Martinez Ruiz lost her baby, ovaries and uterus.
	   ``She's been under psychiatric treatment since then'', Perez
Angulo said. ``We have been waiting for a year to start legal
proceedings as she had no courage to face this tragedy.''
	   He also said that as early as September a judge will question
Martinez Ruiz and the doctors who operated on her.
	   Meanwhile, the hospital is carrying out an internal
investigation and its director, Jose Maria Lastre, ruled out on
Monday the possibility of a computer error.

Restrictions on Suu Kyi nearing house arrest, opposition says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's party
claimed Monday that new security measures outside her home were a
form of harassment and amounted to house arrest.
	   The government withdrew its security detail Friday from the
opposition leader's lakeside compound at her request, but beefed up
its presence around her neighborhood.
	   On University Avenue where she lives, signs in place for the
past two years that have warned off non-residents were supplemented
with bamboo crossing barriers that require cars to stop.
	   The National League for Democracy issued a statement Monday
saying that cars leaving Suu Kyi's compound were being searched.
	   ``These measures amount to putting more restrictions on Daw Aung
San Suu Kyi and the conditions are like house arrest,'' the
statement said. Daw is an honorific.
	   In 1995, Suu Kyi was freed from six years of formal house
arrest, during which she was almost completely cut off from the
world.
	   In the past two years, she has again increasingly been confined
to her home, but is frequently allowed to leave for meetings and to
receive visitors _ though they are screened and most journalists
are barred. She is not allowed to speak publicly.
	   A government spokesman, Lt. Col. Hla Min, told reporters Monday
that Suu Kyi had visited an NLD official in the capital Sunday.
	   Suu Kyi is barred from leaving Yangon. Two weeks ago, she
engaged in a six-day standoff with authorities on a road outside
the capital, capturing renewed world attention in her decade-long
struggle to bring democracy to the country.

Police find tons of poisonous chemicals buried in central Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police have found about 180 metric tons (198 tons)
of poisonous pesticides in a washed-out river bank in central
Russia, a news agency reported Monday.
	   The DDT was found by chance after rushing waters in the Chulym
river in the Tomsk region, about 2900 kilometers (1,800 miles) east
of Moscow, uncovered the cache. Toxicity levels at the site were
hundreds of times higher than normal, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The report did not say whether the chemical had spread into the
river or affected the population.
	   According to local environmentalists, two local agricultural
enterprises secretly buried the DDT along the riverbank after the
chemical was outlawed because of its high toxicity 20 years ago,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   DDT, which accumulates in the fatty tissues of animals and
humans, is a cancer-causing agent that also disrupts the production
of hormones affecting reproduction and the immune system.

Iraqi allegedly drowns sister for violating Islamic law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ An Iraqi man accused of drowning his
sister because of an alleged pre-marital affair claims that Islamic
law obliged him to take her life, media said Monday.
	   Karouan Kadar, 26, was arrested Sunday in Corinth, about 80
kilometers (50 miles) west of Athens, after witnesses told
authorities he pushed his sister Kioskan, 30, into the sea
following an argument, police said.
	   Bystanders and police were unable to revive the woman, who
authorities said could not swim.
	   Kadar told police he killed his sister because she had been
violating the law of the Koran, the Muslim holy book, by conducting
sexual affairs in Germany, where she resided.
	   ``He continues to believe that he carried out a sacred duty,''
said Corinth police chief Yiannis Papadopoulos.
	   According to the Koran, a woman can be punished by death for an
conducting an adulterous affair, but only if there are four
witnesses to the event and if she is convicted by a religious
court.
	   But such a punishment is rarely imposed because of the
difficulties in finding witnesses.
	   Greek authorities said the two had been traveling overland from
Germany to Iraq, where their parents were allegedly waiting to kill
the woman as a punishment for her actions.
	   The woman attempted to escape be fleeing an Athens-bound train,
police said. Her brother pursued her when she left the train during
a stop at Corinth and allegedly pushed her into the sea in the port
of Agios Nikolas, knowing she could not swim, officials said.
	   Corinth police arrested Kadar after he boarded the train to
Athens. He fainted while in police custody after hearing he was
being charged with murder, and was treated at a hospital.
	   Kadar is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday.

15-year-old escapes jail and caning on drug charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A Malaysian court on Monday set
aside a five-year prison sentence and caning ordered for a
15-year-old boy convicted of drug possession, a news report said.
	   The boy was believed to the youngest person ever charged with
drug possession in Malaysia. He had pleaded guilty to possessing
6.6 grams (0.23 ounce) of heroin and morphine at his house last
Oct. 4, the national news agency Bernama reported.
	   On July 27, sessions Judge Mohamad K. Abdul Rahman sentenced the
boy, whose name was withheld by the court, to five years in prison
and 10 strokes of the cane under the Dangerous Drugs Act.
	   But High Court Justice K.C. Vohrah revised the ruling in his
chambers, instead ordering the boy detained in a reform school for
three years under the Juvenile Court Act.
	   The boy, who was working as a parking lot attendant prior to his
arrest, was charged together with his mother, a sweeper.
	   However, the Sessions Court acquitted the mother after the
prosecution offered no further evidence against her.

Mubarak orders 10 percent raise in conscripts' salary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak has ordered a 10
percent raise for army conscripts, who had received dlrs 13 to dlrs
14 a month, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Monday.
	   Conscripts who serve in the country's security forces also will
receive the raise, starting from August, the agency said.
	   The raise is the seventh ordered by Mubarak in seven years as
part of a plan to improve living conditions of the armed forces and
police, which make up a formidable presence in Egypt.
	   In February 1986, thousands of conscripts in the security forces
rebelled and burned down their camps in Cairo as part of demands
for better living conditions and higher salaries.
	   Egypt has 272,000 conscripts, who receive between 45 and 50
Egyptian pounds (dlrs 13 to dlrs 14) a month. They must serve
between and one and three years, depending on their education.
	   Military service is compulsory for most men over 18.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime signaled Monday
it was in no hurry to free 18 foreign pro-democracy activists who
were still being questioned in police custody a day after being
arrested for handing out anti-government leaflets.
	   The government displayed the leaflets, which urged Myanmar's
people to remember a nationwide uprising against military rule 10
years ago and to keep struggling, at a news conference where the
activists were accused of breaking the law and inciting unrest.
	   Those detained include six U.S. citizens from the Free Burma
Coalition and three Malaysians, three Indonesians, three Thais, two
Philippine nationals and an Australian from similar groups opposed
to the government of Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Government officials told diplomats that the detainees were
``being treated humanely,'' but no visits had yet been allowed,
said a diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The officials stressed that the foreigners had been detained,
not arrested and formally charged, the diplomat said.
	   That raised hopes they might be quickly deported, but at the
news conference, spokesman Lt. Col. Hla Min gave no sign freedom
was imminent.
	   ``They are being detained while investigations continue,'' Hla
Min said. ``They are being kept separately at two police guest
houses. No decision has been made yet about what legal action will
be taken against them.''
	   Last week, a British-Australian was freed three months into a
five-year term in the notorious Insein Prison, where hundreds of
political prisoners are kept, for handing out leaflets.
	   Asked whether that case could serve as a guide, Hla Min said:
``We need to discourage these groups.''
	   Reporters were shown front-and-back photographs of the detainees
taken in detention, wearing T-shirts urging people to remember
8-8-88, representing the Aug. 8, 1988, uprising date.
	   In Manila, Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon said his
ambassador had met Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the top ruling generals.
	   A U.S. spokeswoman said the embassy was giving ``the highest
priority'' to the health and well-being of the Americans and was
pressing for an early resolution to the case.
	   Overseas opposition groups had anticipated that Saturday's
anniversary of the uprising could lead to new demonstrations. But
Myanmar was calm. Neither the government nor rebel groups reported
any unrest.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar since 1962. The 1988
demonstrations resulted in a change of leaders but eventually were
crushed by bullets and bayonets. An estimated 3,000 people died.
	   The foreigners distributed their leaflets Sunday around Yangon.
Twelve were arrested downtown and six at the airport.
	   The Bangkok-based alliance of anti-government groups that sent
them into the country appealed to the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, of which Myanmar is a member, to secure the release
of the activists.
	   Most of the activists were students, but there were also
professors, lawyers and a businessman.
	   ``They were well aware they might be arrested,'' said Debbie
Stothard, coordinator for the Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma,
one of the groups involved. She denied arrest was a goal.
	   Stothard refused to confirm whether all activists sent to
Myanmar had been arrested.
	   The detainees have health concerns including asthma, migraines,
allergies to bee stings and penicillin, hearing problems and
intolerance to dairy products.
	   Official newspapers carried a speech by Gen. Tin Oo, a top
general in the ruling State Peace and Development Council, saying
traitors were ``trying ... to induce international pressure.''
	   The general was referring to opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi,
winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, and her National League for
Democracy, landslide winner of parliamentary elections in 1990. The
military never allowed the parliament to meet.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, has recently stepped up pressure on the government
to open a dialogue with her and has set an Aug. 21 deadline for the
military to convene the parliament.

Weather delays search for missing French Climbers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Bad weather has hampered search
efforts for two French mountaineers missing for about two weeks in
the Pakistani Himalayas, a police official said Monday.
	   The official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity from
Gilgit, about 220 kilometers (120 miles) north of Islamabad, said
it was doubtful Eric Escoffier and Pascale Bessieres could have
survived this long alone on the 8,047-meter (26,555-foot) Broad
Peak. He said search teams have made little progress because of the
weather.
	   Eric Escoffier and Pascale Bessieres were last seen 7,600 meters
(25,080 feet) up the mountain by a group of Polish climbers on July
29, Jean-Claude Marnier, vice president of the French
mountaineering federation, was quoted as saying over the weekend.
	   Escoffier was the better-known of the pair. In 1985, he became
the first solo French climber to reach the top of Pakistan's K2, at
8,613 meters (28,423 feet) the second highest mountain in the
world. Despite a 1987 car accident that left his left side
paralyzed, the 38-year-old Escoffier had pursued his dream of
climbing the 14 Himayalan peaks of at least 8,000 meters (26,400
feet).

Kosovo Albanian rebels try to retain last strongholds

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backed into a few remaining
strongholds, ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo fought Monday to
cling to territory in the face of a punishing Serb offensive.
	   With Western diplomats pushing them to agree to peace talks,
Kosovo Liberation Army fighters skirmished with Serbian forces in
western Kosovo. Ethnic Albanian sources said there was fierce
fighting around Djakovica and the strategic village of Junik, where
the KLA managed to hold its positions.
	   Meanwhile, although one moderate KLA faction signaled its
readiness over the weekend for negotiations that could lead to the
province regaining autonomy from Serbia, prospects for talks
remained uncertain.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill arrived in Pristina to try to push
the peace process forward.
	   ``I'm just here to see if I can help get a solution to this
terrible problem in Kosovo,'' Hill said after what he called a
``good discussion'' with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. He
plans other talks but would not say with whom.
	   Reports from both warring sides Monday showed skirmishes at
several locations.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center said three KLA fighters were killed
Monday in a clash with Serb police in the village of Dura, about 40
kilometers (25 miles) south of Pristina. Authorities there said the
KLA attacked a police patrol and police fired back.
	   Fighting also was reported to be intense along the
Djakovica-Decane road in the west, where Serb authorities said four
Serb policemen were killed on Sunday.
	   In close fighting Monday in the village of Erec, the ethnic
Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said, four Albanians were
killed and houses were burned, and the Serbs also suffered an
undetermined number of casualties.
	   In another village, Skivjan, Serb forces reportedly gave an
ultimatum to the fighters and residents to give up their weapons
and surrender.
	   The ethnic Albanian center claimed some 15,000 civilians were
displaced from the two villages as a result of the developments.
	   Elsewhere, the center said 400 civilians were being encircled by
Serb forces in Lausa village, which was one of the biggest KLA
strongholds before falling to Serb forces Aug. 2. Four civilians
who managed to get out of the village said two women and a man were
killed during the attack on Lausa.
	   According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the Serb
offensive has forced 167,000 people from their homes within Kosovo
since the conflict exploded in February, with the total of
displaced 231,000 including those who fled the province.
	   Hundreds have been killed, with thousands of others remaining in
the woods and hills, many of them without food or water.

Injured high jumper named `non-competing' captain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ High jumper Steve Smith, who suffered
a serious neck injury in training last month, was appointed Monday
as the non-competing men's captain for Britain at next week's
European Championships.
	   Smith, bronze medalist at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, was given
the captaincy after Roger Black, the original selection as captain,
pulled out of the championships when he failed to make the team in
the 400 meters.
	   It's the first time the British team has appointed a
non-competing captain.
	   Smith, who would have been one of the favorites for the gold
medal, injured his neck during a workout at his home track in
Liverpool and could be out of action for a year.
	   Distance runner Paula Radcliffe will captain the women's team
for the European Championships in Budapest, Aug. 18-23.

Laotian prime minister arrives for three-day visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Malaysian prime minister urging cooperation to
overcome economic crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad told his Laotian counterpart Monday that Southeast Asian
nations needed to work together more vigorously to overcome the
region's economic crisis.
	   At a dinner welcoming Laotian Prime Minister Sisavath
Keobounphanh, Mahathir said members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations could promote trade among themselves and make greater
use of local currencies.
	   In the year-old crisis, the currencies of some Asian nations
have fallen sharply in value against the U.S. dollar, making
purchases more expensive in dollar terms.
	   Mahathir said Laos and Malaysia shared almost identical views on
many issues of common concern and sought to make constructive
contributions by taking part in many international organizations.
	   Mahathir also said he was impressed with the role played by Laos
in transforming the Mekong sub-region into an area of shared growth
and affluence.
	   Sisavath arrived earlier Monday for a three-day visit to discuss
means of overcoming the regional economic turmoil.
	   The visit is the first by a Laotian leader since the country
joined ASEAN last July. ASEAN also includes Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
	   Laos, a land-locked country in the center of the Indochinese
peninsula, has also been hard hit by the Asian economic crisis.
	   Sisavath's visit is expected to focus on joint efforts to
overcome the economic downturn. The two countries were expected to
sign tourism and trade agreements, the government news agency
Bernama reported.
	   Sisavath, who was accompanied by a 12-member delegation of top
officials, was given a red-carpet welcome at Parliament Square by
Mahathir.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police in the Black Sea port of Varna
freed four women who said they were forced to work as prostitutes
after being abducted, a police official said Monday.
	   The three Bulgarian and one Ukrainian woman ``were found in an
apartment owned by an army officer, who was not arrested,'' said
Maj. Ventsislav Stoyanov, a police spokesman.
	   The Ukrainian woman, age 27, was found handcuffed to a bed.
	   One Bulgarian woman was 17, another was 25. No age was available
for the third woman.
	   Stoyanov wouldn't identify the officer, saying his involvement
was still being investigated.
	   The women ``had been abducted by unknown gunmen from different
parts of Bulgaria and handed over to two suspected pimps in Varna,
who are currently sought by the police,'' Stoyanov said.
	   Prostitution _ along with crime _ has soared in Bulgaria since
the fall of communism in 1989.
	   An anti-prostitution grassroots organization said last week that
some 10,000 Bulgarian women are believed to have been forced into
prostitution in Western Europe after being recruited with
fraudulent job offers by international underground groups.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Weary rescue workers heard tapping Monday
under the debris of a bombed building next to the U.S. Embassy,
raising hopes for finding another survivor. Police said they
arrested several suspects in a nearly simultaneous bombing in
Tanzania.
	   Almost simultaneous blasts at the American embassies in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, were sophisticated
attacks. Israel army radio, in a report from Nairobi, said
investigators suspect the bombers used the plastic explosive
Semtex.
	   In Dar es Salaam, assistant police commissioner Wilson Mwansasu
announced that several suspects had been arrested, the first major
breakthrough in the investigations in either country.
	   Mwansasu said they were ``connected to others,'' but refused to
elaborate.
	   The explosions took a terrible toll: At least 200 dead in
Nairobi and nearly 5,000 injured; at least 10 dead in Dar es Salaam
and 74 injured.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice
told CNN the death toll would have been far higher if the bombers
in Nairobi had achieved their goal _ getting into the embassy's
underground parking garage. The bomb exploded in a parking lot
behind the embassy.
	   The powerful blast in downtown Nairobi destroyed a building next
door to the embassy and damaged others blocks away. The damage in
Tanzania was far less because the embassy is in a residential area.
	   On Monday, rescue teams in Nairobi were working to clear debris
from the badly damaged but still intact ground floor of the Ufundi
Cooperative House adjacent to the embassy, hoping to reach buried
survivors.
	   Tired Israeli rescuers said they heard tapping inside the Ufundi
Monday morning, and said it spurred them on in their search for a
woman named Rose, who last spoke to rescue workers Sunday
afternoon.
	   Work at the bomb site was halted for a few minutes Monday
afternoon when stonework began falling off a nearby bank building.
When work resumed, a bulldozer was brought in to clear the top
layer of rubble in hopes of reaching the building's ground and
lower floors.
	   Kenyan Red Cross workers are convinced that Rose and another
woman named Jane were in the ruins of the Ufundi building. ``Jane
hasn't been heard of for much, much longer,'' said John Sparrow,
spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   ``I don't think anybody will give up hope until they get in
there and see,'' he said.
	   In Dar es Salaam, American medical examiners were releasing the
bodies of the 10 Tanzanians killed in the blast to their families.
	   The bodies of 11 Americans killed in the bombing began their
long, final journey home on Monday. They will arrive at Andrews Air
Force Base in Maryland Tuesday after a stop at Ramstein Air Force
Base in Germany.
	   As each flag-draped coffin was lifted gently into a U.S. Air
Force C-141 aircraft, Ambassador Prudence Bushnell raised her right
hand _ still bandaged from the injuries she suffered in the Friday
blast _ to her heart. Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana stood
at attention nearby.
	   The 12th victim, Jean Dalizu, who was married to a Kenyan, will
be buried in her adopted homeland.
	   As investigators probed the cause of the blast, U.S. Marines on
Monday sealed off the block around the embassy in Tanzania with
barbed wire and sandbags and took up positions on top of the
embassy building and around it.
	   At the bomb-out embassy, staffers tried to salvage what they
could from the rubble. It is ``heartbreaking,'' Ambassador Patricia
Bushnell said, to find that things survived, but not people.
	   Gerard Bradford, head of a disaster response team from the
United States, said his people were combing the building for the
nine Kenyan employees still missing.
	   ``There is hip-deep debris in a lot of those rooms,'' he said.
	   Wendy Auldridge and Joyce Reed were trying to rescue the mail
from the basement, a nod at the normal in a world fractured by
violence.
	   ``It's a small thing, but I think it will boost morale,'' Reed
said.
	   Sniffer dogs from the United States, France and Israel padded
over rubble, one with a cut nose from the sea of broken glass.
	   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned
Sunday that it could take a long time to find out who was behind
the attacks. She promised ``appropriate action'' against any
country or person found responsible.
	   The FBI and other U.S. agencies have sent teams to both Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam. If they can figure out what kind of explosives
were used and how, the FBI says it would be like finding the
bombers' ``fingerprints.''
	   The United States is a favorite target of militant Islamic
fundamentalists, such as the exiled Saudi financier Osama bin
Laden, one potential suspect.
	   It was not known who was behind the blasts. News media received
claims of responsibility in the name of the ``Islamic Army for the
Liberation of Holy Shrines'' and the ``Army for the Liberation of
Islamic Shrines.'' The claims could not be confirmed and may have
come from the same source.
	   Another favorite target _ Israel _ on Sunday offered the help of
Mossad and other intelligence agencies.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early signs were that the
attacks were the work of ``international terrorism centered on
Islamic fundamentalism.''
	   The Washington Post on Monday quoted an unidentified U.S.
Embassy official as saying the vehicle apparently containing the
bomb first drove to the embassy's main entrance but was sent by
guards to the rear, where the bomb exploded.
	   ``They saved people's lives by sending it around back,'' said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``If they hadn't
done that, I don't think I would be around today talking to you.''
	   The Post also reported that at least one hand grenade was used
to kill guards at the rear entrance. The main bomb exploded after
that attack, the newspaper said.
	   The Sunday Nation quoted a man who works for the environment
ministry, Ocheng Okwach, as saying he saw two men drive a yellow
pickup truck to the back of the embassy and jump out brandishing
machine-guns.
	   ``One man ran back into the vehicle as the other sprayed bullets
into the American Embassy,'' Okwach was quoted as saying.
	   It also quoted an unnamed security man as saying he'd seen three
people filming the embassy four days before the attack.
	   The Sunday Times of London, meanwhile, quoted Kenyan police
superintendent Mike Harries as saying witnesses saw a suicide
bomber drive a pickup truck into the car park behind the embassy
and sit there quietly until the blast.
	   Kenyans trying to go to work Monday had to deal with an obstacle
course. Traffic was diverted. Four badly damaged buildings were
cordoned off, and access to six others was restricted.
	   The Kenyan president's office said 4,877 people were injured in
Friday's blast; 560 were still hospitalized Sunday.

 &UR; AMS. Suspects arrested, bodies released as investigation gets
moving

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ In the first confirmed arrest of
suspects in the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa,
Tanzanian police said Monday they had detained several people in
connection with the embassy bombing in Dar es Salaam and were
checking on further suspects.
	   ``There were some suspects arrested, more than one, in different
parts of Dar es Salaam,'' said Asst. Police Commissioner Wilson
Mwansasu.
	   At the morgue of Muhimbili teaching hospital, grieving families
of the 10 Tanzanians killed in the Friday blast began receiving the
remains of the victims after U.S. investigators examined the bodies
and released them one by one.
	   More than 100 U.S. Marines, Federal Bureau of Investigation and
State Department officials and counter-terrorism experts have
arrived in the Tanzanian capital to begin their investigation into
the embassy bombing in which another 70 people were injured. Six
remain hospitalized.
	   All the dead were Tanzanian.
	   Mwansasu declined to give the number of identity of those
arrested, adding only that they were ``connected to others.''
	   ``We had to wait for so long ... for the investigators to review
the bodies to try to find those responsible, but we still believe
it was necessary and for a good cause,'' said Harun Mahundi,
Tanzania's former police inspector general, whose brother, Ramadani
Mahundi, was an embassy guard who was killed in the blast.
	   Police believe the bomb, which exploded just outside the embassy
near the main entrance and guard booth, could have been planted in
an embassy-owned tanker truck that delivered water to the building
because of the frequent shortages and water cut offs in the city on
the Indian Ocean.
	   The blast killed the guards in the booth and apparently slammed
the blue water tanker into the side of the embassy building.
	   The tanker's cab was reduced to a tangled mass of melted metal.
	   A surveillance camera at the roof on the far end of the building
still pointed Monday at the guard booth.
	   A U.S. diplomat, who spoke with reporters on condition of
anonymity Sunday, did not rule out that among evidence there may be
a videotape of the entire blast.
	   Ibrahim Pamba, a cousin of the dead guard Ramadani Mahundi, also
waited with his brother at the morgue.
	   He said he had been at the embassy Friday morning, just 10
minutes before the explosion.
	   ``If I had been a few minutes later, it could have been me,''
said Pamba, a chemist.
	   He said he saw the blue tanker on the Laibon Road just outside
the embassy as he left the building, maneuvering to turn.
	   ``There was nothing suspicious,'' said Pamba. ``The truck looked
ordinary. It was an ordinary day.''
	   The body of Mamadani Mahundi was the first to be released
Monday. Relatives quickly carried it to a nearby mosque for
cleansing.
	   Then, men sang as they carried the rough wooden casket to a
truck for transport to the countryside for a Muslim burial.
	   Several women wailed, and two others buried their heads in their
arms against the window of a van as they cried aloud. Another women
fell to the ground overwhelmed by grief.
	   Marine guards have sealed off the site of the embassy explosion
with multiple rows of barbed wire and stand guard behind sandbags,
their assault rifles pointing towards the road.
	   Burned vehicles and other debris were cleared from the area
overnight outside the sealed-off embassy, built in the 1960s by the
Israelis as their embassy in Dar es Salaam.
	   Former president Julius Nyerere, who visited the site Monday
escorted by charge d'affaires John Lange, said the sad and
senseless bombings in the two neighboring East African nations had
targetted Americans _ but Tanzanians, Kenyans and Americans had all
died.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ It came as a surprise to no one that
Kenya's police and firefighters arrived late to the scene when a
powerful explosion ripped through the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi's
bustling downtown business district.
	   And few were amazed when members of the paramilitary General
Service Unit started beating back the crowd _ volunteer rescuers
included _ with wooden clubs.
	   Residents of the Kenyan capital are wearily used to inept and
bribe-demanding police and brutal GSU troops _ and to a municipal
infrastructure that is crumbling into ruins and incapable of
responding to disasters like the one that struck on Friday.
	   But the city _ where exhausted office workers wait for hours in
the dark for packed, unsafe buses, fearing attacks by gangs of
muggers _ surprised itself with the sheer courage and
resourcefulness of its own long-suffering inhabitants.
	   They rushed in to help ferry the wounded, comfort the terrified
and dig furiously in the rubble to save those trapped by mounds of
debris.
	   Rattletrap cars and pickup trucks were commandeered to take the
wounded to the hospital. Doors left hanging on their hinges were
ripped off to serve as makeshift stretchers to carry the injured to
first aid stations set up by volunteer groups.
	   A woman doctor dressed in surgical blues, a white shower cap and
wearing sunglasses was eased down by soldiers as she picked her way
through the rubble of the crushed Ufundi House.
	   And teen-agers lay down on mats in central Uhuru (Freedom) Park,
bravely thrusting out their arms and clenching their fists to
donate blood.
	   ``I watched the horrible bomb blast from television, and I said
I wish I could help,'' said 16-year-old Pauline Wanjiku. ``I kept
my eyes wide open to make sure the blood was getting into the white
thing.''
	   There has been no shortage of disasters in Kenya this year.
	   In the past year, the country has been wracked by politically
inspired ethnic violence that has left several hundred dead.
	   Then the El Nino weather phenomenon brought heavy rains and
flooding to many parts of the county that bred disease, killed
livestock and rotted crops in the fields.
	   Portions of the main highway linking Nairobi and the port of
Mombasa were washed away several times. Repairs have been slow in
coming.
	   ``How ready are we for disasters?'' asked a headline in the
independent Daily Nation.
	   Police and firefighters find themselves with broken-down
vehicles or none at all, no gasoline to make them run and poor or
non-existent communications equipment.
	   But even when things were working better in Kenya, there were
too many conflicting authorities to permit a rapid and seamless
response to a major disaster.
	   There is no real disaster coordination, and even if a single
emergency number were available, many of the city's telephones are
constantly out of order because of broken down switching equipment
and stolen lines.
	   In this potentially wealthy country of educated, hard-working,
devout people corruption, in the words of economist John Githongo,
is gnawing away at the heart and infrastructure of the nation.
	   Even in religious services Sunday to mourn the dead, clergymen
railed against the ``national disease.''

Zimbabwe ministers, military experts in planned Congo task force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A team of foreign ministers and military
experts will later this week investigate Congo's allegations that
Rwanda has sent troops across its border, President Robert Mugabe
said.
	   ``If the committee concludes that the Congo has been invaded by
another country, the matter would then be dealt with immediately
within the context of the Organization of African Unity,'' Mugabe
said on Sunday.
	   The team _ comprising officials from Tanzania, Zambia, Namibia
and Zimbabwe _ would visit ``all the areas of fighting to establish
the facts,'' Mugabe said.
	   Mugabe said allegations that Uganda had sent troops against
Kabila would also be investigated.
	   The four countries were designated to seek a cease-fire at a
regional summit on Saturday in Victoria Falls that included
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, Rwanda's President Pasteur
Bizimungu and Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni.
	   Kabila claims that Rwanda has troops across the border to
sponsor a rebellion by ethnic Tutsi Congolese against his
government, and has threatened war against Rwanda.
	   Rwanda denies the charges.
	   Mugabe is chairman of the four-country committee of heads of
state formed at the summit.
	   Zimbabwe has been a major supplier of arms and equipment to
Kabila and recently sent a 10-member military delegation to Congo
to help Kabila plan the reorganization of his military forces.

	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Florence has become the latest Italian
city to crack down on tourists who lounge, picnic or nap at
artistic sites.
	   As of Monday, visitors can no longer sprawl out or eat on the
steps of Palazzo Vecchio, the 13th century palace in the heart of
Florence that dominates Piazza della Signoria.
	   Three years ago, Rome barred people from sleeping or eating on
the Spanish Steps, although they are still a popular gathering
place for tourists. Venice has banned picnics in vast St. Mark's
Square.

Colin McRae leaving Subaru for Ford
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRENTWOOD, England (AP) _ Colin McRae, the 1995 world rally
champion, is leaving the Subaru team at the end of the season to
drive for Ford in the 1999 championship.
	   The 30-year-old Scot and his co-driver, Nicky Grist, signed a
two-year contract with Ford, the team announced Monday. McRae will
partner Finland's Juha Kankkunen next season as Ford unveils its
new Focus World Rally Car.
	   McRae joined Subaru in 1992, winning the world driver's
championship three years later by capturing the season-ending RAC
Rally in Britain. He finished runner-up in the championship in 1996
and 1997.
	   McRae currently holds second place in the driver's standings
behind Spain's Carlos Sainz of Toyota with victories in Portugal,
Corsica and Greece.
	   McRae will make his debut for Ford at the Monte Carlo Rally next
January.

Queen honors poet laureate Ted Hughes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II has awarded the poet laureate,
Ted Hughes, one of the country's highest honors, Buckingham Palace
announced Monday.
	   Hughes, who has been poet laureate since 1984, was made a member
of the Order of Merit, one of the few honors the queen can bestow
without consulting the government.
	   Hughes, 68, won critical acclaim this year for ``Birthday
Letters'' a volume of poems chronicling his courtship and marriage
to American poet Sylvia Plath, who commited suicide in 1963 after
he left her for another woman.
	   Critics called it one of Hughes' best works and said it places
him alongside Blake, Keats and Auden in the poets' pantheon.
	   ``Tales of Ovid,'' Hughes' retelling of ``Metamorphosis,'' by
the 1st Century Latin poet Ovid, won more lavish praise and prizes
this year.
	   In his role as poet laureate, Hughes has written works for the
queen's 60th birthday and the Queen Mother Elizabeth's 90th
birthday. A collection of poems for official occasions was
published as ``Rain-Charm for the Duchy and other Laureate Poems.''
	   The Order of Merit was founded in 1902 as a special mark of
honor awarded by the soverign to individuals of exceptional
distinction, and membership is limited to the queen and 24 others.
There is no title, but members can writre the initials O.M., after
their names.
	   Other members include former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
actor John Gielgud and violinst Yehudi Menuhin. South Africa's
President Nelson Mandela is an honorary member.

Architect calls on Germany to OK Holocaust Memorial plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The U.S. architect who designed the leading model
for Germany's planned national Holocaust Memorial appealed Monday
for government officials to make their much-delayed decision about
whether it will be built.
	   While saying he didn't want to interfere in German politics,
Peter Eisenman said the memorial would be a very important symbol
for Germany.
	   ``It now has to move away from politics and gradually become
living memory,'' he told Inforadio in Berlin.
	   Eisenman's proposal for a labyrinthian field of stone pillars
resembling a cemetery was scaled down at the request of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and is believed to be the front-runner among three
remaining finalists.
	   Kohl has promised a decision before the Sept. 27 national
election.
	   But the opposition Social Democrats recently reopened the debate
by suggesting they would cancel the project if elected in favor of
such alternatives as better preserving the former concentration
camps.
	   Eisenman said he believed there was ``a huge difference''
between the actual concentration camps and a memorial.
	   He said he was attempting something completely new with his
design, originally created with American sculptor Richard Serra,
who withdrew from the project in June.
	   Eisenman described it as ``a place where one feels alone and
abandoned, a place without beginning and end, with no direction.
You can't even really photograph it because it avoids the picture.
The only thing you can do is experience and feel it.''

Japan's opposition takes aim at Obuchi over economy

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ New Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi had a rough debut
facing questions in Parliament Monday as opposition parties
clamored for fresh elections and accused his Cabinet of
incompetence to rescue Japan's economy.
	   Following its drubbing in upper house elections last month,
Obuchi's governing Liberal Democratic Party needs cooperation from
rival parties to pass key economic revival legislation.
	   But judging from the atmosphere on the floor Monday, that will
be no easy task.
	   ``What qualifications and ability does this new Cabinet have?''
said lawmaker Kansei Nakano, a member of Japan's largest opposition
party, the Democratic Party.
	   ``Without new policies there will be no reforms. We must
dissolve the Parliament,'' he said as several lawmakers broke into
applause.
	   In opinion polls, Obuchi's Cabinet has received less than 30
percent support. Japanese media have painted the new prime minister
as colorless and unimaginative.
	   After their gains in the July elections, the opposition parties
are smelling blood. Rather than striking deals, they are hitting
out at Obuchi's economic policies, saying they will be implemented
by the very people who brought on Japan's recession in the first
place.
	   The LDP has a majority in the more powerful lower house of
Parliament, but the opposition can block the passage of urgently
needed economic legislation in the upper house.
	   Obuchi tried to deflect calls for early lower house elections by
promising strong action to boost consumer confidence with tax cuts
and to clean up the bad loan mess plaguing Japan's banking system.
	   ``I will exert all my energy and take all possible steps ... to
grapple with the economic problems,'' said Obuchi, who fielded
questions in Parliament for the first time since his election as
premier on July 30.
	   The opposition directed its sharpest criticisms at new Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, a former prime minister who served as
finance chief once before, in 1986-1988.
	   One opposition lawmaker branded Miyazawa a ``war criminal'' for
having approved loose monetary policies during his tenure that
sparked an orgy of speculative land buying that resulted in a price
bubble.
	   When land prices crashed in the 1990s, banks were left burdened
with an estimated 76.7 trillion yen (dlrs 529 billion) in bad
loans, which economists now call the greatest single drag on
Japan's economy.
	   Obuchi is seeking to stimulate consumption with more than 6
trillion yen (dlrs 41 billion) worth of tax cuts and 10 trillion
yen (dlrs 69 billion) in public spending.
	   But the opposition has expressed skepticism, pointing out that
many of Obuchi's initiatives were written by Japan's powerful
bureaucrats, who have traditionally made policies to be
rubber-stamped by Parliament.
	   It was exactly such an arrangement, with its backroom
deal-making and lack of accountability, that led Japan into its
current morass, said Takenori Kanzaki, a lawmaker with the
opposition Heiwa Kaikaku group.
	   ``The LDP's tradition of collusion between politicians and
bureaucrats caused them to put off fixing (the economy's)
problems,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia reveled in its world
basketball championship Monday, with tens of thousands of people
welcoming the team back home from a victory that prompted
night-long, nationwide celebrations.
	   ``We did it for you!'' cried Aleksandar Djordjevic, the team
leader, holding up the winners' trophy to the jubilant crowd in
downtown Belgrade. ``You are the winners.''
	   The gathering at a central square, organized by the Yugoslav
government, came barely 15 hours after the 64-62 victory over
Russia in Sunday's final in Athens touched off jubilation across
the country. Djordjevic and his team came to the celebration
straight from the airport.
	   It is Yugoslavia's record fourth world basketball title. But for
Yugoslavs, worn down by years of economic malaise and international
isolation due to sanctions from the Bosnian war, the gold medal had
the impact of more than a sports victory.
	   ``It was good to see the Russians and Americans behind us,''
said one fan.
	   Headlines such as ``Yugoslavia, the world champion'' or ``The
champions'' written in huge letters covered the front pages of most
newspapers, pushing aside the grim daily report from Kosovo. State
television carried the players' return to Belgrade live.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic met with the players soon
afterward.
	   Belgrade police reported that some 20 people were lightly
injured and several shop windows and kiosks damaged during
all-night celebrations in the capital. Tens of thousands of fans
fired their guns in the air, threw firecrackers, sang and danced or
even played basketball late into the night in Belgrade.
	   Similar celebrations were reported all over the country. In
Kosovo, ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported that a
7-year-old child was injured by apparent celebratory fire.
	   Present-day Yugoslavia consists of Serbia and much smaller
Montenegro.

6,500 demonstrate for religious freedom in Germany

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ About 6,500 people demonstrated for
religious freedom Monday in central Frankfurt and called on Germany
to recognize the Church of Scientology as a religion.
	   The rally in front of the Old Opera was intended as the finale
to a so-called ``European marathon for religious freedom'' through
eight countries, organized by Los Angeles-based Scientology.
	   Joining the Scientologists were Eli Gampel, head of the central
community for Orthodox Judaism in Germany, and Mohammed Herzog,
chairman of the Islamic society of German-speaking Muslims.
	   Scientologists claim many of their 30,000 German members face
persecution and job discrimination.
	   Although Scientology won tax-exempt status as a church in the
United States in 1993, German officials maintain it is primarily an
economic enterprise, and have had it under surveillance as a
potential threat to democracy by domestic security agencies since
June 1997.

Dispute imperils one of Europe's tallest wooden buildings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A Catholic priest in northern Romania
is preventing restoration teams from starting work on an 18th
century wooden church, claiming it will destroy the building.
	   The disputed church is located in the tiny village of Surdesti
in the remote Maramures region some 425 kilometers (266 miles)
northwest of Bucharest and was built in 1721. It is still used by
Eastern Rite Catholics, state-run news agency Rompres reported
Monday.
	   Gheorghe Cozmuta, the priest of the church has refused to let a
delegation from the culture ministry into the building, claiming
that work needed to preserve its wood and repair its paintings
``will destroy the church,'' Rompres quoted him as saying.
	   The head of Romania's historical monuments argued that
restoration was needed to prevent the structure from falling into
complete disrepair. ``The priest should hold services and let the
restorers get on with their work,'' said Dan Nicolae by telephone.
	   Roughly 6,000 tourists visit the Surdesti church each year. It
is especially known for its 54-meter (178-foot) tall steeple, which
makes it one of Europe's tallest wooden buildings.
	   The European Commission has allocated 50,000 ECU (dlrs 55,500)
to restore wooden churches in the Maramures region and the Romanian
government has donated 790 million lei (dlrs 92,000), citing
buildings as an important part of Europe's cultural heritage.

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ The tiny oil-rich sultanate
of Brunei is committed to moderate Islam and would resist any
extremist strains, an official said Monday.
	   ``We are practicing a moderate form of Islam,'' said Sumadi
Sukami, the Brunei government's director of information.
	   Sumadi was reacting to recent allegations by an estranged
brother of the nation's ruler, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, that Brunei
was seeking aid from Iranian and Libyan advisers.
	   ``We have already categorically denied that,'' Sumadi said,
referring to last week's allegation conveyed by an unnamed
spokesman for Prince Jefri Bolkiah, who now lives in self-imposed
exile.
	   The spokesman reportedly quoted the prince as saying that
conservative forces backed by shadowy foreign advisers _ Iranian
and Libyan _ were tightening their grip on Brunei.
	   There were no Libyans in Brunei, Sumadi said, ``but we have good
relations with Iran.''
	   ``Brunei is a Muslim country that practices the Sunni form,'' he
added. Iranians are predominantly Shiites and 70 percent of
Brunei's 300,000 people are Sunni Muslims.
	   The family rift caused by a reported dlrs 16 billion loss by
Brunei's flagship private company, Amedeo, controlled by Jefri, was
in the background at a royal ceremony Monday to install Sultan
Hassanal's eldest son, Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah, as the future
ruler.
	   Last month, the sultan dismissed Jefri as chairman of the
powerful Brunei Investment Agency, which puts the sultanate's oil
riches into hotels, banks, businesses and U.S. Treasury bonds, and
as head of a huge telecommunications company.

Farmers block roads, railroad to protest wheat imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Angry farmers used tractors to block
border crossings between Romania and Hungary and stopped a train
Monday to protest wheat imports and the government's agriculture
policy, national radio reported.
	   ``They came with tractors and heavy farming equipment,'' Capt.
Floarea Dan of the Nadlac Police Department said by telephone.
	   Dozens of farmers gathered in the border towns of Nadlac and
Varsani, almost 500 kilometers (313 miles) northwest of the
capital, Bucharest. The towns are known as the ``grain gates''
between Hungary and Romania.
	   Other farmers stopped a train transporting flour and semolina
from Hungary at the Curtici railway crossing border, 425 kilometers
(266 miles) northwest of Bucharest.
	   Police did not say how many farmers took part in the protest,
but said tourist traffic was not affected.
	   Farmers demanded the government stop wheat imports and allow
them to protect Romanian wheat supplies. Romania was considered the
breadbasket of Europe before World War II.
	   The Romanian government, the main wheat purchaser, currently
pays lei 600 (7 cents) for 1 kilo (2.2 pounds) of wheat. Farmers
say they need at least twice that much to cover production costs.
	   Hungarian wheat is subsidized by the Hungarian government, and
is cheaper to purchase than that produced in Romania.
	   Although Romanian farmers produced a record 7.2 million metric
tons of wheat last year, it was not enough to cover demand.
	   ``The government has no strategy and its policy will make us
never sow wheat again,'' said Elena Spora, president of the
Agrostar Federation, an agricultural workers' union.
	   In a concession, the government agreed last month to raise the
Hungarian wheat import tax from 15 percent to 25 percent, and the
tax on flour from 15 percent to 45 percent until the end of the
year. The decision has yet to take effect.
	   It also gave farmers lei 200 billion (dlrs 23.1 million) to
cover transportation and storage costs for eight months.

Russia receives first installment of World Bank loan
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia received the first, dlrs 300 million
installment of a newly approved World Bank loan on Monday, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The dlrs 1.5 billion loan, which was approved last week, is part
of the dlrs 22.6 billion bailout that the International Monetary
Fund, the World Bank and the Japanese government negotiated with
Russia in July in an effort to boost the country's troubled
economy.
	   Lenders hope the bailout will restore investor confidence in
Russia, where markets have declined by 60 percent since the
beginning of the year, and buy some time for the months-old
government of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   The government's economic stabilization program, aimed at
raising tax revenues and cutting spending, went into effect on Aug.
1. The program is expected to raise more than $17 billion next
year.
	   The installments of the World Bank loan will increase as Russia
meets a series of benchmark reforms. These include measures to
increase tax collection, regulate the country's oil and gas
monopolies, promote development of the private sector and reform
the banking system.
	   Also Monday, the Finance Ministry announced that the government
was canceling its weekly treasury bill auction for the third
consecutive week because of poor demand for the paper. The ministry
had planned to offer 6 billion rubles' (dlrs 970 million) worth of
new bonds at the auction Wednesday.
	   The Finance Ministry canceled the two previous weekly auctions
because of poor market conditions, and also because it has found
cheaper funding.
	   A dlrs 4.8 billion loan disbursement from the International
Monetary Fund and dlrs 6.4 billion government bond (GKO) debt
conversion in late July have reduced the government's need to raise
new funds in recent weeks.
	   Russian markets were sharply lower Monday, partly on fears that
the sale Wednesday would only further burden the already saturated
bond market.
	   The Russian ruble closed slightly lower against the dollar,
eroded by general malaise worldwide and a sharp drop in Russian
bonds.

World Bank aid to Ukraine tied to IMF's approval of loan to the

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The World Bank will consider financing two
large projects in Ukraine as soon as the International Monetary
Fund resumes its aid to the former Soviet republic, the bank's
mission chief said Monday.
	   Edilberto Segura said the projects _ each worth dlrs 300 million
_ would support Ukraine's financial sector and business
development, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The IMF board of directors is expected to discuss a dlrs 2.5
billion loan to Ukraine at its meeting at the end of August.
	   Approval of the loan would signal resumption of the fund's aid
to Ukraine. It was suspended in March because of the country's
stalled reforms and excessive state spending.
	   An IMF mission that visited Kiev last month welcomed the
government's recent economic reform measures and said it would
recommend that the IMF approve the new three-year loan.
	   The World Bank suspended its aid to Ukraine soon after the IMF.
Bank officials said at the time that resumption of assistance was
conditioned on the IMF's decision to continue lending to Ukraine.
	   Segura, who heads the bank's mission in Kiev, said Ukraine may
receive dlrs 100 million for each of the projects immediately after
they are approved by the World Bank.
	   He added the World Bank may also provide dlrs 150 million for
development of agriculture if Ukraine sticks to a number of the
bank's requirements.
	   Ukraine has received more than dlrs 1 billion from the World
Bank since it became a member in 1992.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Weary rescue workers heard tapping Monday
under the debris of a bombed building next to the U.S. Embassy,
raising hopes for finding another survivor. Police said they
arrested several suspects in a nearly simultaneous bombing in
Tanzania.
	   Blasts within minutes of each other at the American embassies in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, were
sophisticated attacks. Israel army radio, in a report from Nairobi,
said investigators suspect the bombers used the plastic explosive
Semtex.
	   In Dar es Salaam, assistant police commissioner Wilson Mwansasu
announced that several suspects had been arrested, the first major
breakthrough in the investigations in either country.
	   Mwansasu said they were ``connected to others,'' but refused to
elaborate.
	   In Washington, however, a senior U.S. official called the
arrests ``a routine roundup'' and told reporters ``don't attach too
much importance to it.
	   Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice said
about a dozen people had been detained for questioning by Tanzanian
police.
	   The explosions took a terrible toll: At least 200 dead in
Nairobi and nearly 5,000 injured; at least 10 dead in Dar es Salaam
and 74 injured.
	   Rice told CNN the death toll would have been far higher if the
bombers in Nairobi had achieved their goal _ getting into the
embassy's underground parking garage. The bomb exploded in a
parking lot behind the embassy.

Tens of thousands welcome Yugoslav basketball team

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia reveled in its world
basketball championship Monday, with tens of thousands of people
welcoming the team back home from a victory that prompted
night-long, nationwide celebrations.
	   ``We did it for you!'' cried Aleksandar Djordjevic, the team
leader, holding up the winners' trophy to the jubilant crowd in
downtown Belgrade. ``You are the winners.''
	   The gathering at a central square, organized by the Yugoslav
government, came barely 15 hours after the 64-62 victory over
Russia in Sunday's final in Athens touched off jubilation across
the country. Djordjevic and his team came to the celebration
straight from the airport.
	   It is Yugoslavia's record fourth world basketball title. But for
Yugoslavs, worn down by years of economic malaise and international
isolation due to sanctions from the Bosnian war, the gold medal had
the impact of more than a sports victory.
	   ``It was good to see the Russians and Americans behind us,''
said one fan.
	   Headlines such as ``Yugoslavia, the world champion'' or ``The
champions'' written in huge letters covered the front pages of most
newspapers, pushing aside the grim daily report from the conflict
against ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern Kosovo province.
State television carried the players' return to Belgrade live.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic met with the players soon
afterward.
	   Belgrade police reported that some 20 people were lightly
injured and several shop windows and kiosks damaged during
all-night celebrations in the capital. Tens of thousands of fans
fired their guns in the air, threw firecrackers, sang and danced or
even played basketball late into the night in Belgrade.
	   Similar celebrations were reported all over the country. In
Kosovo, ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported that a
7-year-old child was injured by apparent celebratory fire.
	   Present-day Yugoslavia consists of Serbia and much smaller
Montenegro.

10 hospitalized in Japan after drinking suspect green tea

	   TOKYO (AP) _ In Japan's latest poisoning scare, police had few
clues Monday to what caused 10 company employees to suffer nausea
and numbness after drinking green tea made from a communal water
heating pot.
	   The 10 were sent to hospitals two weeks after four people died
from eating curry laced with cyanide and arsenic at a festival in
southwestern Japan.
	   A hospital spokesman said doctors suspected some kind of
poisonous chemical, but police were not immediately able to
determine what it was.
	   The case in Niigata, 256 kilometers (159 miles) northwest of
Tokyo, again shook Japan's cherished sense of security and was the
top item on Japanese television news broadcasts. Commentators
worried about copycat attacks in coming weeks.
	   Although Japan has one of the lowest crime rates in the world,
one unusual crime is often followed by a spate of similar incidents
in subsequent months.
	   Japan has become particularly sensitive to poisonings in the
wake of a March 1995 nerve gas attack on Tokyo subways masterminded
by a fringe religious cult. The gassing killed 12 people.
	   At 8:01 a.m. Monday (2301 GMT Sunday), emergency medical
authorities received a call from a branch factory office of Xyence
Co., a wood preservative company, near Niigata, said Toshihide
Watanabe, a spokesman for the Niigata municipal fire department.
	   Ten of the 13 employees in the office were taken to local
hospitals after drinking hot tea, Watanabe said.
	   Of the seven taken to Niigata City General Hospital, two had
pre-existing ailments such as asthma and were affected more
seriously than the others, the hospital spokesman said.
	   All seven were in ``stable'' condition, but continued to suffer
from headaches and numbness, he added.
	   Police found initial indications of cyanide, but none showed up
later in more thorough tests of the water in the electric pot, said
the Niigata Prefectural Police.
	   An initial diagnosis by doctors pointed to something more
serious than the type of illness that might be caused by spoiled
food, said Niigata City General Hospital spokesman Akimi Takahashi.
	   ``It was apparent their symptoms were those of a poisonous
chemical,'' he said. Although doctors have not concluded what kind
of poison was used, they are ``treating the victims taking into
consideration all kinds of possibilities.''

Off-field disputes settled before on-field action starts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Off-field disputes will take a backseat to
on-field action Tuesday when AEK Athens, Polonia Warszawa and Wilsa
Krakow take the field in second-round qualifying for the UEFA Cup.
	   AEK Athens, allowed to compete in the UEFA Cup only after taking
its case to a court of arbitration, will be the third Greek team in
three years to take on Hungarian club Ferencvaros.
	   AEK was suspended from the competition because it is owned by
the same company, British investment trust firm ENIC, as Czech club
Slavia Prague. Under UEFA rules, only one team under joint
ownership can enter the competition.
	   However, the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration of Sport last
month suspended the UEFA ruling for one year and reinstated AEK to
the competition.
	   AEK, which qualified directly to the second round, will be at
home to Ferencvaros. Slavia Prague, coming off a 5-0 defeat to
Banik Ostrava in the Czech League over the weekend, crosses the
border to Slovakia to take on Inter Bratislava _ its former rival
in the old Czechoslovakia League.
	   Another Greek club, PAOK Salonika, which ousted English champion
Arsenal from the tournament last season, faces a tough task against
Scottish powerhouse Glasgow Rangers at Ibrox.
	   Rangers, on a rebuilding program under new Dutch coach Dick
Advocaat after losing its Scottish League title for the first time
in a decade, is expected to call in former Fiorentina and
Manchester United winger Andrei Kanchelskis for the important
clash.
	   Rangers will be targeting Salonika's Kostas Frantzekos, who has
scored 34 goals in the last two seasons.
	   Advocaat, who has studied tapes of Salonika's last match against
Arsenal at Highbury, said defense would be crucial.
	   ``The most important factor is we must not lose a goal in the
home leg at Ibrox and must cash in on the five or six chances we're
bound to make against them,'' he said.
	   Polish clubs, caught in the middle of a wrangle between the
Polish government and Polish FA administrators, can put concerns
about the prospect of a FIFA-imposed international ban behind them
as they prepare for UEFA Cup clashes.
	   FIFA set a deadline of Aug. 7 for the Polish soccer
administrators and the government to resolve its domestic turmoil.
The ban loomed over clubs playing in the UEFA Cup until 15 minutes
before deadline, when the Polish government responded to the FIFA
requirements.
	   Wilsa Krakow, which thrashed Welsh minnow Newtown 7-0 in the
first round, will take on Turkey's Trabzonspor, while Polonia
Warszawa takes on Dinamo Moscow.
	   The agreement also opens the way for LKS Lodz to play English
Premier League giants Manchester United on Wednesday in the
Champions League.
	   For Croation side Hajduk Split, the match against Swedish club
Malmo will be a case of deja vu. Split eliminated the Swedish club
in the competition last year.
	   Split coach Ivan Katalinic is hoping that a record-breaking heat
wave affecting the south of the country will give his players an
edge. The Swedish players could encounter a 23-degree celcius
temperature increase.
	   ``It will be difficult for them to adapt to the drastic change
in climate in only two days. I admit we are favorites and I don't
back away from that,'' Katalinic said.
	   Katalinic will have all his players on disposal, while his
counterpart, Frans Thijssen, will be unable to field regular
midfielder Bjorn Enqvist due to accumulated yellow cards from last
season.
	   ``I'd be glad if we score a two goal winning margin as I think
it would be hard to gamble away such a difference in the return
leg,'' Katalinic said.
	   Yugoslav team Red Star, which opened its domestic league
campaign with a 4-0 win against Buducnost Podgorica last Friday,
will be out to repeat its winning form when it plays Russian team
Rotor Volgograd.
	   The team will be led by winger Perica Ognjenovic, who is
expected to leave Red Star for Real Madrid when the team drops out
of the UEFA Cup.
	   However, Adilson and Dos Santos _ Brazilians who signed for Red
Star in the off-season and who are currently ineligable for
international matches _ are expected to play in the next round if
Red Star advances past Rotor.
	   The second leg of the second round qualifiers will be played on
Aug. 25.

Bulgaria projects 4-5 percent annual growth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Bulgaria-Taxes, ADDS Radev quote, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's government said Monday the
country's economy will grow by between 4 percent and 5.1 percent
annually over the next three years as a result of stabilization,
tax reduction and international financial support.
	   In a draft of the 1999 budget, Minister of Finance Muravei Radev
said the country's gross domestic product will grow by 4 percent in
1999, by 4.8 percent in 2000 and by 5.1 percent in 2001.
	   The government envisages annual inflation of 7.4 percent in 1999
and slightly less in each of the next two years. Inflation soared
to 577 percent annually in 1997 due to an unprecedented political
and economic crisis under the previous government of ex-communists.
	   ``The budget forecast to 2001 reflects expectations of a very
stable economic environment and guaranteed external support, which
ensures high reliability of the projections,'' Radev told state
radio.
	   Bulgaria is planing to slash its flat-rate value added tax by 2
percent to 20 percent next year in hopes of encouraging investment,
Radev said.
	   He added the government will cut income tax too, but didn't
specify to what extent.
	   In a related matter, the government decided Monday to phase out
as of the beginning of next year a 2 percent import tax currently
levied on all imports atop of other tariffs. The government reduced
this tax from 4 percent in July, citing improved balance of
payment.
	   The government is trying to encourage economic growth after
years of recession and fiscal austerity. The gross domestic product
is expected to grow by 4 percent this year, according to official
forecasts.
	   Bulgaria has reached a preliminary agreement with the
International Monetary Fund on a dlrs 800 million standby loan in
the next three years which is designed to support economic
recovery. The accord is expected to be finalized in September.
	   Bulgaria hopes to receive a total of 1.6 billion dollars in
loans from the IMF, World Bank and other international lenders in
the next three years which will enable it repay its dlrs 9 billion
foreign debt and invest in economy and infrastructure.

Born of bitter experience, Israel team proves expertise in Nairobi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On Nov. 4, 1983, a bomb-laden truck swerved
into an Israeli army post in south Lebanon and exploded, collapsing
a building and killing 29 Israeli troops inside.
	   Out of such grim experience was born the Israeli military's
crack Search and Rescue Unit, made up of soldiers with specialized
cutting tools, doctors and sniffer dogs who could be mobilized
within hours to almost any corner of the earth.
	   Arriving the day after Friday's embassy bombing in Nairobi, the
Israeli unit went straight from the airport to the blast site and
plucked at least three survivors and 26 bodies from the rubble.
	   The unit's resume is impressive. It was sent to earthquakes in
the 1980s in Mexico City and Soviet Armenia, the 1992 bombing of
the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires and the 1994 Rwandan civil war.
	   ``Unfortunately, we have a lot of experience with this kind of
rescue, and we have probably the largest and most expert such team
in the world,'' said David Bar-Illan, top media adviser to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   As soon as he heard of the blast, Netanyahu reached for the
telephone and offered help to both U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
	   Israeli ties with Kenya have long been close. Israel used
Nairobi as a refueling stop and fallback base in the daring July
1976 Entebbe rescue, in which Israeli commandos freed hijacked
prisoners held by Palestinians in Uganda.
	   The Israeli rescuers, most of them reservists, have helped
polish Israel's image at a time when Netanyahu's government is
being criticized in some quarters for hardline policies that have
crippled the Arab-Israeli peace process.
	   ``The soldiers of the Israeli army have once again become the
public-relations representatives of the State of Israel, and their
contribution to Israel's world image is many times greater than yet
another series of speeches condemning terror,'' the daily newspaper
Maariv said in an editorial.
	   The Israeli team's ability to move fast and sleep rough is an
outgrowth of the country's military doctrine, one that relies on
citizen soldiers to drop what they're doing and be at their posts
within 24 hours in times of war.
	   Israeli media contrasted the working conditions of the Israelis,
who bedded down in sleeping bags, with those of American team
members who stayed in plush hotels. An Israeli official also said
that a one point, jumpy U.S. Marines guarding a safe pointed rifles
at a yellow-helmeted Israeli team and ordered the rescuers to stay
back.
	   For Israelis, the Nairobi operation was both a ``mitzva,'' a
good deed required of them by Jewish law, and a restorative that
renewed faith in Israel's abilities after a series of failures: a
commando operation gone wrong in Lebanon, the collision of two
troop carrying helicopters, a rash of air force crashes.
	   ``It's good for us and good for everybody. It shows that we are
for anybody who needs us, and we can really help them,'' said Ilan
Cytron, a 25-year-old law student who helped lead a mother and son
from the rubble.
	   Searching a high-rise office building wrecked by the blast,
Cytron walked into a shattered apartment on the 23rd floor and was
astounded to find two people alive.
	   ``We thought we would just find bodies. It was wonderful to see
them,'' said Cytron.
	   The 85-member rescue unit is headed by a reserve colonel, Udi
Ben Uri, 43, who manages a stone quarry in civilian life. He was
vacationing in Holland with his three children when he got the call
up notice.
	   ``It's a mitzva to save human beings, but we don't do it because
of that, or the publicity. We do it because that's what we are
trained to do. Our services are needed worldwide, and that's what
we do best,'' said Ben Uri.
	   Israel's rescue team has a number of specialized tools,
including inflatable pillows that are inserted into the rubble and
filled with air to raise it up. Microphones and sniffer dogs are
used to locate survivors.
	   ``It's not the machinery and the tools,'' said Liran Golan, a
reserve lieutenant who just returned from Nairobi. ``It's the basic
willingness to travel and help.''

Sea dinosaur fossil found high in Swiss Alps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Scientists in Switzerland have
discovered a fossilized sea dinosaur at 2,700 meters (8,850 feet)
above sea level, a professor at the University of Zurich said
Monday.
	   The remains of the dinosaur, some 50 centimeters (20 inches)
long, were found at the edge of the Ducan glacier, said Hans
Rieber, head of the university's Paleontological Institute.
	   The site, in the mountainous southeast corner of landlocked
Switzerland, has been systematically searched over the last year by
the university's specialists.
	   Remains of smaller predatory fish have also been found at the
Ducan site, Rieber said. The fossil of the larger dinosaur is being
examined to determine its precise species.
	   The dinosaur's remains were originally preserved in sludge which
had formed on the sea bed, he said.
	   When the Alps were formed some 9 million years ago, the seabed
was lifted up some 3,000 meters (9,850 feet) and fish remains
fossilized.

Spain unveils purification plant to clean up big toxic spill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ Spain's environment minister on Monday
inaugurated a hastily-built purifying plant to treat toxic mud
threatening one of Europe's most prized nature reserves.
	   The goal is to complete the cleanup in the area around Donana
National Park by the end of October, when authorities fear seasonal
rains could cause contaminated soil to seep into reserve.
	   Donana stretches over 75,000 hectares (185,000 acres) along
Spain's southwestern coast, providing shelter for millions of
migratory birds and housing threatened species such as lynx and
imperial eagle.
	   On April 25, a reservoir containing waste water at a nearby mine
burst, pouring an estimated 1.3 billion gallons of acidic liquid
into the Guadiamar River, which links up with the bigger
Guadalquivir before entering the Atlantic.
	   Makeshift dikes kept the liquid and mud from flowing into the
Donana reserve, but the tide of waste inundated the adjacent area
with mud containing traces of zinc, iron and other heavy metals.
Thousands of fish were killed in the spill.
	   Environment Minister Isabel Tocino said the new plant, built in
one month at a cost of 1.1 billion pesetas (dlrs 7.3 million),
would double the amount of contaminated water and mud that could be
treated each day.
	   For several weeks engineers have been treating 70,000 cubic
meters (91,550 cubic yards) of waste a day with a chemical that
neutralizes its acidity, then diverting the treated waste into the
Guadalquivir.
	   Tocino insisted that the late-October deadline for completing
the cleanup would be met.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ One of the worst heat waves in decades in
Cyprus killed 13 people Monday and forced hundreds to seek
treatment for heat exhaustion in packed hospital wards.
	   The deaths raised to 48 the number of people who have died since
Friday. More than 1,000 people, most of them elderly, have sought
medical treatment in recent days.
	   Temperatures hit 43 degrees C (110 F) inland _ the highest
recorded in 40 years. The temperatures are five degrees higher than
average for the beginning of August, said Andreas Philaniotis,
director of the Government Weather Bureau.
	   Philaniotis predicted the weather on the eastern Mediterranean
island would cool off within the next two days.
	   Many of the elderly stricken by the heat were living in
privately run nursing homes that lacked air conditioning, Health
Minister Christos Solomis said.
	   The heat wave has coincided with the peak tourist season, when
about 500,000 foreigners visit the island.
	   ``It's certainly very hot but as long as we can bathe in the
clear blue sea it's no big deal. We are enjoying our holiday but we
fell sorry for all those people who are suffering,'' said Christine
Brown, a young tourist from London.

Taliban says 30 Iranians captured in Mazar-e-Sharif

release, diplomats arriving in Pakistan on evacuation flight;
INCORPORATES Iran-Pakistan-Afghanistan. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious
militia controlled Mazar-e-Sharif Monday, and a spokesman said it
captured 30 Iranians accused of supplying weapons to opposition
forces that had held the key city just days before.
	   Fierce street battles had been reported in Mazar-e-Sharif, the
largest city in northern Afghanistan, since Taliban fighters
entered Saturday, with each side claiming to have ousted the other
from the city.
	   But independent sources who insisted on anonymity said the
Taliban controlled the city today, and that Mazar-e-Sharif was
calm. The sources provided few other details.
	   The Taliban unleashed bombs and rockets on the city, which is
190 miles (300 kilometers) north of the Afghan capital, Kabul,
before seizing it. Casualties were likely to be high.
	   Opposition spokesman Masood Khalili accused the Sunni Muslim
Taliban of killing hundreds of civilians from the Shiite sect of
Islam.
	   The airport on the eastern edge of Mazar-e-Sharif appeared to be
still contested, and forces from the opposition alliance were
reportedly regrouping at Hayratan, 40 miles (65 kilometers) to the
east.
	   The Taliban's victory in Mazar-e-Sharif will likely boost its
four-year campaign to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic
rule on the entire country. The Taliban now controls most of
Afghanistan, including Kabul. Taliban leaders have barred most
women from work and girls from school, banned music and ordered all
men to wear beards.
	   Taliban spokesman Abdul Manan Niayzi told The Associated Press
that 30 Iranians who armed the northern alliance had been captured
and were still alive.
	   He denied charges from neighboring Iran that the Taliban
captured 11 Iranian diplomats, and said the diplomats may be hiding
in Mazar-e-Sharif or may have retreated with opposition forces
south to Bamiyan province.
	   The Iranian news agency reported Monday that Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi telephoned his Pakistani counterpart to
demand the release of the diplomats. The news agency said a
reporter and an unknown number of relief workers from Iran also had
been seized by the Taliban. The press group demanded the reporter's
release in an open letter to Taliban officials.
	   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency also reported that
Kharrazi appealed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
intervene.
	   While the 11 Mazar-e-Sharif diplomats remained missing, nine
other Iranian diplomats from Afghanistan arrived Monday in the
Pakistani capital of Islamabad on a U.N. evacuation flight. They
refused to speak to reporters.
	   Iran and Pakistan are both accused of stoking the Afghan civil
war, Iran by backing the northern alliance and Pakistan by backing
the Taliban.

Israel raids guerrilla hideout after militiaman killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli air raid, Hezbollah bombing kills
pro-Israeli militiaman, CHANGES overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked a suspected
guerrilla hideout Monday in southern Lebanon after guerrillas
killed a pro-Israeli militiaman, security officials said.
	   At least two Israeli jets fired four missiles on the hills of
Masghara in the western Bekaa Valley, a region long used by
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas to launch attacks on Israeli
troops in southern Lebanon, the officials said.
	   Black smoke billowed from the area, but there was no immediate
word on casualties, said the Lebanese officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The raid came just hours after Hezbollah guerrillas killed an
Israeli-allied militiaman in a roadside bomb explosion on the edge
of the Israeli-occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah said in a statement that its fighters detonated a
roadside bomb on the outskirts of the Christian town of Jezzine as
a patrol of the South Lebanon Army militia passed by.
	   The security officials said one SLA militiaman was killed.
	   Earlier Monday, guerrillas fired more than 20 Katyusha rockets
in southern Lebanon, many of which landed near Lebanon's border
with Israel. There were no reports of casualties.
	   The rockets apparently were fired from a site close to Yater, a
Shiite Muslim village three kilometers (1.8 miles) north of the
frontier, the security officials said.
	   Israeli radio stations reported that three roadside bombs
exploded overnight as Israeli patrols were passing.
	   They said that several vehicles were slightly damaged and that
one Israeli soldier was treated for shock.
	   Hezbollah has led the fight to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers
and 2,500 allied SLA militiamen from southern Lebanon. Israel set
up the enclave in 1985 to try to protect against cross-border
guerrilla raids.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Weary rescue workers heard tapping Monday
under the debris of a bombed building next to the U.S. Embassy,
raising hopes for finding another survivor. Police said they
arrested several suspects in a nearly simultaneous bombing in
Tanzania.
	   Blasts within minutes of each other at the American embassies in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, were
sophisticated attacks. Israel army radio, in a report from Nairobi,
said investigators suspect the bombers used the plastic explosive
Semtex.
	   In possibly the first breakthrough in the investigations in
either country, Assistant Police Commissioner Wilson Mwansasu
announced that ``there were some suspects arrested ... in different
parts of Dar es Salaam.''
	   Mwansasu said they were ``connected to others,'' but refused to
elaborate.
	   In Washington, however, Assistant Secretary of State for African
Affairs Susan Rice said about a dozen people had been detained for
questioning in ``a routine roundup'' and told reporters ``don't
attach too much importance to it.''
	   Mwansasu refused to comment on Rice's remarks or the
nationalities of those arrested.
	   Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Sudanese and Iraqi citizens were among those detained. There was no
immediate explanation of why the American officials referred to
detentions when the Tanzanians spoke of arrests.
	   The Daily Mail newspaper in Dar es Salaam reported Monday that
an Arab man was arrested Saturday trying to cross the border into
Kenya. The paper said the man boarded a flight from Dar es Salaam
to Kilimanjaro Airport after Friday's bombing, checked into a guest
house in nearby Arusha, and spent the rest of the day praying at a
local mosque.
	   Police in Dar es Salaam said they could not confirm this arrest.
	   The explosions took a terrible toll: At least 200 dead in
Nairobi and nearly 5,000 injured; at least 10 dead in Dar es Salaam
and 74 injured.
	   Rice told CNN the death toll would have been far higher if the
bombers in Nairobi had achieved their goal _ getting into the
embassy's underground parking garage. The bomb exploded in a
parking lot behind the embassy.
	   The powerful blast in downtown Nairobi destroyed a building next
door to the embassy and damaged others blocks away. The damage in
Tanzania was far less because the embassy is in a residential area.
	   On Monday, rescue teams in Nairobi were working to clear debris
from the badly damaged but still intact ground floor of the Ufundi
Cooperative House adjacent to the embassy, hoping to reach buried
survivors.
	   Tired Israeli rescuers said they heard tapping inside the Ufundi
Monday morning, and said it spurred them on in their search for a
woman named Rose, who last spoke to rescue workers Sunday
afternoon.
	   Work at the bomb site was halted for a few minutes Monday
afternoon when stonework began falling off a nearby bank building.
When work resumed, a bulldozer was brought in to clear the top
layer of rubble in hopes of reaching the building's ground and
lower floors.
	   Kenyan Red Cross workers are convinced that Rose and another
woman named Jane were in the ruins of the Ufundi building. ``Jane
hasn't been heard of for much, much longer,'' said John Sparrow,
spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   ``I don't think anybody will give up hope until they get in
there and see,'' he said.
	   In Dar es Salaam, American medical examiners were releasing the
bodies of the 10 Tanzanians killed in the blast to their families.
	   The bodies of 11 Americans killed in the bombing began their
long, final journey home on Monday. They will arrive at Andrews Air
Force Base in Maryland Tuesday after a stop at Ramstein Air Force
Base in Germany.
	   As each flag-draped coffin was lifted gently into a U.S. Air
Force C-141 aircraft, Ambassador Bushnell raised her right hand _
still bandaged from the injuries she suffered in the Friday blast _
to her heart. Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana stood at
attention nearby.
	   The 12th victim, Jean Dalizu, who was married to a Kenyan, will
be buried in her adopted homeland.
	   As investigators probed the cause of the blast, U.S. Marines on
Monday sealed off the block around the embassy in Tanzania with
barbed wire and sandbags and took up positions on top of the
embassy building and around it.
	   At the bomb-out embassy, staffers tried to salvage what they
could from the rubble. It is ``heartbreaking,'' Bushnell said, to
find that things survived, but not people.
	   Gerard Bradford, head of a disaster response team from the
United States, said his people were combing the building for the
nine Kenyan employees still missing.
	   ``There is hip-deep debris in a lot of those rooms,'' he said.
	   Wendy Auldridge and Joyce Reed were trying to rescue the mail
from the basement, a nod at the normal in a world fractured by
violence.
	   ``It's a small thing, but I think it will boost morale,'' Reed
said.
	   Sniffer dogs from the United States, France and Israel padded
over rubble, one with a cut nose from the sea of broken glass.
	   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned
Sunday that it could take a long time to find out who was behind
the attacks. She promised ``appropriate action'' against any
country or person found responsible.
	   The FBI and other U.S. agencies have sent teams to both Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam. If they can figure out what kind of explosives
were used and how, the FBI says it would be like finding the
bombers' ``fingerprints.''
	   The United States is a favorite target of militant Islamic
fundamentalists, such as the exiled Saudi financier Osama bin
Laden, one potential suspect.
	   It was not known who was behind the blasts. News media received
claims of responsibility in the name of the ``Islamic Army for the
Liberation of Holy Shrines'' and the ``Army for the Liberation of
Islamic Shrines.'' The claims could not be confirmed and may have
come from the same source.
	   Another favorite target _ Israel _ on Sunday offered the help of
Mossad and other intelligence agencies.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early signs were that the
attacks were the work of ``international terrorism centered on
Islamic fundamentalism.''
	   The Washington Post on Monday quoted an unidentified U.S.
Embassy official as saying the vehicle apparently containing the
bomb first drove to the embassy's main entrance but was sent by
guards to the rear, where the bomb exploded.
	   ``They saved people's lives by sending it around back,'' said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``If they hadn't
done that, I don't think I would be around today talking to you.''
	   The Post also reported that at least one hand grenade was used
to kill guards at the rear entrance. The main bomb exploded after
that attack, the newspaper said.
	   The Sunday Nation quoted a man who works for the environment
ministry, Ocheng Okwach, as saying he saw two men drive a yellow
pickup truck to the back of the embassy and jump out brandishing
machine-guns.
	   ``One man ran back into the vehicle as the other sprayed bullets
into the American Embassy,'' Okwach was quoted as saying.
	   It also quoted an unnamed security man as saying he'd seen three
people filming the embassy four days before the attack.
	   The Sunday Times of London, meanwhile, quoted Kenyan police
superintendent Mike Harries as saying witnesses saw a suicide
bomber drive a pickup truck into the car park behind the embassy
and sit there quietly until the blast.
	   Kenyans trying to go to work Monday had to deal with an obstacle
course. Traffic was diverted. Four badly damaged buildings were
cordoned off, and access to six others was restricted.
	   The Kenyan president's office said 4,877 people were injured in
Friday's blast; 560 were still hospitalized Sunday.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With musical performances and eulogies, Russian
artists paid tribute Monday to Alfred Schnittke, one of the leading
composers of this century, who died a week ago.
	   Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, a close friend of the composer,
violinist Gidon Kremer and other musicians performed on the stage
of the Moscow Conservatory of Music. Poet Bella Akhmadulina and
theater director Yuri Lyubimov were among a dozen friends who spoke
of Schnittke, whom one eulogist, movie director Andrei
Khrzhanovsky, called ``one of the last genuine members of the
Russian intelligentsia.''
	   Gennady Rozhdestvensky, director of the conservatory, said
Schnittke ``had full faith in the strength of his art'' and
deserves a place in the pantheon of modern Russian music, alongside
Stravinsky, Rachmaninoff and Shostakovich.
	   ``Dear teacher, beloved master, loyal friend _ may the gates of
heaven open before you,'' Rozhdestvensky said.
	   Schnittke lay in an open coffin below the stage of the
conservatory's Great Hall, where many of his compositions were
performed over the decades. Large wreaths of flowers with streamers
were lined up behind the coffin, and a large portrait of the artist
was on stage. Below the bier, carnations, lilies, roses and other
flowers were piled high.
	   Russian Premier Sergei Kiriyenko joined musicians and other
friends of the composer who made up the ceremonial guard at the
conservatory. After the civil funeral, Schnittke was brought to a
Russian Orthodox Church for religious rites.
	   At his request, Schnittke was buried in Moscow's Novodevichye
Cemetery, the final resting place for many of the nation's
luminaries.
	   Schnittke lived most of his life in the Soviet Union but
emigrated to Germany, the land of his ancestors, in 1990. He died
on Aug. 3 in Hamburg after years of strokes that robbed him of the
ability to speak but left his creative abilities intact. He
continued to compose music throughout his illness, writing with
such an unsteady hand that his colleagues created a commission to
interpret the notes.
	   During the conservatory ceremony, a chorus performed selections
from a Russian Orthodox liturgy, a song by Schnittke that evoked
the extinguishing of candles, one by one, and finally Schnittke's
haunting Requiem, accompanied by bells, organ and guitar.
	   After the service concluded, some 1,000 people who had attended
slowly filed by the coffin, many stopping to bow their heads before
moving on.

15 hurt in collision of two trains in western Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRIER, Germany (AP) _ A collision between two trains Monday left
15 people injured, two seriously, in western Germany near the
Luxemburg border.
	   A commuter train with about 70 people onboard heading from
Cologne to Saarbruecken crashed into a work train at the station in
Densborn at almost 100 kph (62 mph), rail spokesman Gerd Felser
said.
	   Two workers on the work train were flown to a hospital with
serious injuries. Eleven people on the other train and two people
waiting at the station were also hurt, although not seriously.
	   The work train's cargo of concrete slabs was strewn across the
tracks, causing service to be suspended for about an hour on the
line.
	   Late Friday, a 23-year-old man was killed instantly when his car
was hit by a high-speed train in Peine. The man apparently had
driven around a road barrier and onto the tracks as the train
approached. The stretch of railway between Hanover and Braunschweig
was closed for several hours.

Villagers, hunting groups clash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Villagers in western Romania are
clashing with the local tourist trade, claiming wild game intended
to draw foreign hunters are destroying crops and eating farm
animals.
	   ``The hogs came from the hills in flocks of 30 or 40 and
destroyed our crops in the fields,'' Lazar Faur, a member of the
local council in Petris, said Monday by telephone.
	   Villager Petru Dobrita said foxes had eaten nine of his 10
ducks.
	   The people from Petris, 400 kilometers (250 miles) northwest of
Bucharest, complained that a local hunting association and forest
rangers are protecting the wild hogs, deer and foxes in order to
attract foreign hunting parties.
	   The area is well-known to German hunters who come to the area
every year. They pay dlrs 300 for every hunting day and between
dlrs 300 to 1,000 for each hog shot, said Alexandru Marta from
Ocolul Silvic, a local forest association.
	   He added that they can shoot up to 20 hogs in one day.
	   The hunting season for hogs started this month and runs through
February.

Mink set free to wreak havoc among wildlife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Thousands of mink released from a fur farm by
animal liberation activists were enjoying their first taste of
freedom _ and of the local wildlife _ on Monday.
	   The Animal Liberation Front confirmed that activists smashed
cages and cut wire at a fur farm near Ringwood, 100 miles (160 kms)
southwest of London, on Saturday.
	   Hampshire police said 700 mink had been accounted for, but at
least 2,000 more were at large, and they were being sighted up to 5
miles (8kms) from the farm.
	   Bruce Berry, owner of the nearby New Forest Owl Sanctuary, said
three birds _ a kestrel, a tawny owl and a barn owl, had so far
been killed by freed mink. He said he had recruited volunteers to
shoot any mink they encountered.
	   ``They are not fussy about what they eat _ birds, eggs, small
mammals, fish, anything,'' said Howard Taylor, who patrols the New
Forest national park near the farm where the mink were raised.
Wetlands in the park are home to threatened bird species like the
Dartford warbler and Montagu's harrier.
	   ``They (mink) can climb a tree like a squirrel and dive in a
stream like an otter. They are an efficient killing machine and our
native species are not used to having to cope with them.
	   ``Whoever let these animals out, if they think of themselves as
environmental warriors they should have thought of the
environmental consequences of releasing such a vicious predator
into such a delicate ecosystem,'' Taylor said.
	   Mink are not native to Britain, though others are known to be
living wild after escaping from farms.
	   Rob Dazely, regional manager from the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said the organization was ``not
crazy about minks being kept on mink farms.''
	   However, Dazely said, ``releasing them into the wild is totally
irresponsible.
	   ``Many will starve to death and others will be shot or killed on
the roads. But some will survive and breed and the effect on the
local ecology will be incalculable. Releasing them in this way is
not fair on the minks or other species.''
	   Animal Liberation Front spokesman Robin Webb acknowledged that
many of the mink would be killed, ``but at least they will have had
a taste of freedom.
	   ``And some will survive and be able to live their lives in a
natural way. If they had remained all would have been killed in a
particularly barbaric way simply to make fur coats,'' Webb said.
	   Berry, at the owl sanctuary, said the birds killed by the mink
were due to be released in the wild.
	   ``They were fit and healthy and had been inspected by the vet,
and now they are dead because of these senseless people.
	   ``I have not met anyone who has got a word of compassion for
these people. They are mindless,'' Berry said.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious
militia controlled Mazar-e-Sharif Monday, and a spokesman said it
captured 30 Iranians accused of supplying weapons to opposition
forces that had held the key city just days before.
	   Fierce street battles had been reported in Mazar-e-Sharif, the
largest city in northern Afghanistan, since Taliban fighters
entered Saturday, with each side claiming to have ousted the other
from the city.
	   But independent sources who insisted on anonymity said the
Taliban controlled the city Monday, and that Mazar-e-Sharif was
calm. The sources provided few other details.

Albania accuses Serb helicopters of violating their airspace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania claimed Monday that Serb military
helicopters had flown over its border during the previous two days,
and called such violations dangerous and unwarranted.
	   In a statement, the foreign ministry also denied Serbia's
accusations that it harbors military camps where ethnic Albanian
fighters from neighboring Kosovo undergo training to fight Serbs in
their province.
	   ``Such incidents are escalating the situation,'' the ministry
said of the alleged border violations. ``If Belgrade wants to apply
a such conflicted policy ... the responsibility and consequences of
this conflict will be only Belgrade's.''
	   According to officials, one helicopter flew over northern
Albania on Saturday and two others on Sunday, both in the Has
region. No further details were reported.
	   In denying it supports any KLA military camps in Albania, the
ministry said: ``Serbian authorities do not understand or do not
want to understand that is their military policy of ethnic
cleansing pushing the Kosovars to defend their homes and their
land.''
	   However, the statement reiterated, Albania is doing everything
it can to halt weapons smuggling in the north, along the border
with Kosovo.
	   ``With their accusations, the Serbs want to hide their
provocations through the incidents at the Albanian border'' the
statement said.

Russia receives first installment of World Bank loan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stocks dropping sharply, background. Trims. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia received the first, dlrs 300 million
installment of a newly approved World Bank loan on Monday, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The dlrs 1.5 billion loan, which was approved last week, is part
of the dlrs 22.6 billion bailout that the International Monetary
Fund, the World Bank and the Japanese government negotiated with
Russia in July in an effort to boost the country's troubled
economy.
	   Lenders hope the bailout will restore investor confidence in
Russia, where markets have declined by 60 percent since the
beginning of the year, and buy some time for the months-old
government of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   But Russian stocks dropped sharply again Monday, amid worries
that the economy is too feeble to withstand another round of
selling in world markets.
	   The Russian Trading System Index sank 9.0 percent in all, to
close at 120.91 points, down from 132.86 points Friday. Volume fell
to dlrs 15 million from dlrs 22.7 million Friday.
	   Traders said weakness in Asian markets Monday was the immediate
reason for some selling. The slide intensified towards the end of
the trading session, when it became clear that the U.S. market
would again open lower.
	   The Russian market fell steadily last week despite the massive,
IMF-led bailout. The Central Bank reported a sharp drop in foreign
exchange reserves last week, indicating that investors are
continuing to flee.
	   Investors are beginning to fear that even with the larger
lending announced by the IMF, Russia cannot support the ruble if
sentiment does not improve.
	   The installments of the World Bank loan are to increase as
Russia meets a series of benchmark reforms. These include measures
to increase tax collection, regulate the country's oil and gas
monopolies, promote development of the private sector and reform
the banking system.
	   Also Monday, the Finance Ministry announced that the government
was canceling its weekly treasury bill auction for the third
consecutive week because of poor demand for the paper. The ministry
had planned to offer 6 billion rubles' (dlrs 970 million) worth of
new bonds at the auction Wednesday.
	   The Finance Ministry canceled the two previous weekly auctions
because of poor market conditions, and also because it has found
cheaper funding.
	   A dlrs 4.8 billion loan disbursement from the International
Monetary Fund and dlrs 6.4 billion government bond (GKO) debt
conversion in late July have reduced the government's need to raise
new funds in recent weeks.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backed into a few remaining
strongholds, ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence for the
Serbian province of Kosovo fought Monday to cling to territory in
the face of a punishing Serb offensive.
	   With Western diplomats pushing them to agree to peace talks,
Kosovo Liberation Army fighters skirmished with Serbian forces in
western Kosovo. Ethnic Albanian sources said there was fierce
fighting around Djakovica and the strategic village of Junik, where
the KLA managed to hold its positions.
	   Meanwhile, although one moderate KLA faction signaled its
readiness over the weekend for negotiations that could lead to the
province regaining autonomy from Serbia, prospects for talks
remained uncertain.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill arrived in the provincial capital of
Pristina on Monday to try to push the peace process forward.
	   ``I'm just here to see if I can help get a solution to this
terrible problem in Kosovo,'' Hill said after what he called a
``good discussion'' with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. He
plans other talks but would not say with whom.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up roughly 90 percent of Kosovo's 2
million people, and the rebels are fighting for independence from
Serbia, the largest of the two republics that form Yugoslavia.
Reports from both warring sides Monday showed skirmishes at several
locations.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center said three KLA fighters were killed
Monday in a clash with Serb police in the village of Dura, about 40
kilometers (25 miles) south of Pristina. Authorities there said the
KLA attacked a police patrol and police fired back.
	   Intense fighting also was reported along the Djakovica-Decane
road in the west, where Serb authorities said four Serb policemen
were killed on Sunday.
	   In close fighting Monday in the village of Erec, the ethnic
Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said, four Albanians were
killed and houses were burned, and the Serbs also suffered an
undetermined number of casualties.
	   In another village, Skivjan, Serb forces reportedly gave an
ultimatum to the fighters and residents to give up their weapons
and surrender.
	   The ethnic Albanian center claimed some 15,000 civilians were
displaced from the two villages as a result of the developments.
	   Elsewhere, the center said 400 civilians were being encircled by
Serb forces in Lausa village, which was one of the biggest KLA
strongholds before falling to Serb forces Aug. 2. Four civilians
who managed to get out of the village said two women and a man were
killed during the attack on Lausa.
	   According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the Serb
offensive has forced 167,000 people from their homes within Kosovo
since the conflict exploded in February, with the total of
displaced 231,000 including those who fled the province.
	   Hundreds have been killed, with thousands of others remaining in
the woods and hills, many of them without food or water.

Jonathan Edwards `relieved' after missing chance at dlrs 1 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Most athletes would be disappointed at missing out
on a chance of winning a dlrs 1 million.
	   Not British long jumper Jonathan Edwards. He said he's actually
relieved.
	   Edwards, the world record-holder in the long jump, fouled on all
three of his attempts Saturday at the Golden League meet in Monte
Carlo.
	   It was his first defeat in 12 competitions this summer and
knocked Edwards out of the running for the dlrs 1 million jackpot
for any athlete who completes the IAAF's Golden League series
undefeated.
	   Edwards had been bothered by an ankle injury going into the
Monte Carlo meet. British newspapers had run stories wondering why
he would compete and risk further injury before next week's
European Championships in Budapest.
	   Edwards, the son of a minister, is a devout Christian who once
refused to compete on Sundays. He showed no signs of regret, only
relief, after his failure in Monte Carlo.
	   ``As a Christian I was a little upset at recent comments that I
was motivated purely by money,'' Edwards was quoted as saying in
Monday's British newspapers. ``Obviously the thought of losing out
on the million dollars did cross my mind after going out of the
competition, but I am really not that bothered.''
	   Edwards has reportedly earned around dlrs 1.5 million from the
sport since breaking the world record in 1985.
	   ``I had become a little worried that people viewed me as someone
who was chasing money and that upset me because of the teaching
that the love of money is the root of evil,'' he said.
	   ``In some sense the loss here is a relief because the
accusations cannot be leveled at me any more. I'm not just trying
to put a brave face on things. I really feel happy about it. Money
is not my motivation.''
	   Edwards was one of eight athletes still in contention for the
dlrs 1 million going into the Monte Carlo meet. The number dropped
to five after defeats for Edwards, Svetlana Masterkova (1,500
meters) and Frankie Fredericks (100 meters).
	   Still in the chase are Marion Jones (100), Charity Opara (400),
Hicham El Guerrouj (mile/1,500), Haile Gebrselassie (3,000/5,000)
and Bryan Bronson (400 hurdles).
	   The Golden League series continues Wednesday in Zurich.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Trucks filled with government troops
rumbled out of the capital Kinshasa on Monday on their way to
reinforce fighters in western Congo near the Atlantic coastline.
	   State-controlled radio said President Laurent Kabila had ordered
the reinforcements for a push to try and retake several small towns
in the west, including the oil town of Muanda.
	   Rebel Tutsis have captured strategic towns in both the west,
about 250 kilometers (150 miles) southwest of Kinshasa, and in
Congo's eastern Kivu region as part of their week-old uprising
against Kabila.
	   A United Nations delegation has arrived in Kinshasa to meet with
government leaders and discuss the country's ongoing conflict,
state-controlled Voice of the People radio reported Monday.
	   The team, which arrived late Sunday, was due to meet with
President Laurent Kabila among other officials, the radio said
without giving details.
	   Kabila's government made new accusations against Uganda on
Sunday of sending soldiers and tanks into Congo in support of the
Tutsi rebellion.

Former Newcastle chairman wants his old club in European Super
</HEADLINE>
League

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Former Newcastle chairman Sir John
Hall on Monday said he wants his former club to be part of the
proposed European Super League soccer competition.
	   And he said the league was inevitable because ``money talks.''
	   Hall said the Super League could commence within two or three
years but he was concerned, after Manchester United, Arsenal and
Dutch giant Ajax had admitted being involved in talks with
competition organizers, that admittance would be by invitation
only.
	   ``I'm certain the Super League is coming...and Newcastle has got
to be there,'' Hall said. ``That is why we pushed so hard to get
(Newcastle) United back up there as a major force in the game.
	   ``(Super League) will come because money talks. But the most
important thing is that we still look after our domestic game.''
	   Hall steered Newcastle out of obscurity and into Premiership
contention when he took over six years ago. He retired last year
but then took over again for a brief stint this year when two
directors quit.
	   ``My suspicion is that the Super League looks like being a
closed shop for the first six or seven years until it has become
established,'' he said.
	   British newspapers reports have said a 32-team Super League
could could kick off in the year 2000 and involve mid-week matches
between Europe's elite clubs such as Inter and AC Milan, Juventus,
Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Ajax.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ In the first confirmed arrest of
suspects in the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa,
Tanzanian police said Monday they had detained several people in
connection with the embassy bombing in Dar es Salaam and were
checking on further suspects.
	   ``There were some suspects arrested, more than one, in different
parts of Dar es Salaam,'' said Asst. Police Commissioner Wilson
Mwansasu.
	   But in Washington, a senior U.S. official called the arrests ``a
routine roundup.''
	   Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice told reporters ``don't
attach too much importance to it.''
	   Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Sudanese and Iraqi citizens were among those detained for
questioning, which he said was hoped would result in useful leads.
	   At the morgue of Muhimbili teaching hospital, grieving families
of the 10 Tanzanians killed in the Friday blast began receiving the
remains of the victims after U.S. investigators examined the bodies
and released them one by one.
	   More than 100 U.S. Marines, Federal Bureau of Investigation and
State Department officials and counter-terrorism experts have
arrived in the Tanzanian capital to begin their investigation into
the embassy bombing in which another 70 people were injured. Six
remain hospitalized.
	   All the dead were Tanzanian.
	   Mwansasu declined to give the number of identity of those
arrested, adding only that they were ``connected to others.''
	   ``We had to wait for so long ... for the investigators to review
the bodies to try to find those responsible, but we still believe
it was necessary and for a good cause,'' said Harun Mahundi,
Tanzania's former police inspector general, whose brother, Ramadani
Mahundi, was an embassy guard who was killed in the blast.
	   Police believe the bomb, which exploded just outside the embassy
near the main entrance and guard booth, could have been planted in
an embassy-owned tanker truck that delivered water to the building
because of the frequent shortages and water cut offs in the city on
the Indian Ocean.
	   The blast killed the guards in the booth and apparently slammed
the blue water tanker into the side of the embassy building.
	   The tanker's cab was reduced to a tangled mass of melted metal.
	   A surveillance camera at the roof on the far end of the building
still pointed Monday at the guard booth.
	   A U.S. diplomat, who spoke with reporters on condition of
anonymity Sunday, did not rule out that among evidence there may be
a videotape of the entire blast.
	   Ibrahim Pamba, a cousin of the dead guard Ramadani Mahundi, also
waited with his brother at the morgue.
	   He said he had been at the embassy Friday morning, just 10
minutes before the explosion.
	   ``If I had been a few minutes later, it could have been me,''
said Pamba, a chemist.
	   He said he saw the blue tanker on the Laibon Road just outside
the embassy as he left the building, maneuvering to turn.
	   ``There was nothing suspicious,'' said Pamba. ``The truck looked
ordinary. It was an ordinary day.''
	   The body of Mamadani Mahundi was the first to be released
Monday. Relatives quickly carried it to a nearby mosque for
cleansing.
	   Then, men sang as they carried the rough wooden casket to a
truck for transport to the countryside for a Muslim burial.
	   Several women wailed, and two others buried their heads in their
arms against the window of a van as they cried aloud. Another women
fell to the ground overwhelmed by grief.
	   Marine guards have sealed off the site of the embassy explosion
with multiple rows of barbed wire and stand guard behind sandbags,
their assault rifles pointing towards the road.
	   Burned vehicles and other debris were cleared from the area
overnight outside the sealed-off embassy, built in the 1960s by the
Israelis as their embassy in Dar es Salaam.
	   Former president Julius Nyerere, who visited the site Monday
escorted by charge d'affaires John Lange, said the sad and
senseless bombings in the two neighboring East African nations had
targetted Americans _ but Tanzanians, Kenyans and Americans had all
died.

Born of bitter experience, Israel team proves expertise in Nairobi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY190 &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On Nov. 4, 1983, a bomb-laden truck swerved
into an Israeli army post in southern Lebanon and exploded,
collapsing a building and killing 29 Israeli troops inside.
	   Out of such grim experience was born the Israeli military's
crack Search and Rescue Unit, made up of soldiers, doctors and
sniffer dogs who could be mobilized within hours to almost any
corner of the earth.
	   Arriving the day after Friday's embassy bombing in the Kenyan
capital of Nairobi, the Israeli unit went straight from the airport
to the blast site and plucked at least three survivors and 26
bodies from the rubble.
	   The unit's resume is impressive. It was sent to search for
survivors of earthquakes in the 1980s in Mexico City and the
then-Soviet republic of Armenia, the 1992 bombing of the Israeli
embassy in Buenos Aires and the 1994 Rwandan civil war.
	   ``Unfortunately, we have a lot of experience with this kind of
rescue, and we have probably the largest and most expert such team
in the world,'' said David Bar-Illan, top media adviser to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   As soon as he heard of the blast, Netanyahu called U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi to
offer help.
	   Israeli ties with Kenya have long been close. Israel used
Nairobi as a refueling stop and fallback base in the daring July
1976 Entebbe rescue, in which Israeli commandos freed hijacked
prisoners held by Palestinians in Uganda.
	   The Israeli rescuers, most of them reservists, have helped
polish Israel's image at a time when Netanyahu's government is
being criticized in some quarters for hard-line policies that have
crippled the Arab-Israeli peace process.
	   ``The soldiers of the Israeli army have once again become the
public-relations representatives of the State of Israel, and their
contribution to Israel's world image is many times greater than yet
another series of speeches condemning terror,'' the daily newspaper
Maariv said in an editorial.
	   The Israeli team's ability to move fast and sleep rough is an
outgrowth of the country's military doctrine, one that relies on
citizen soldiers to drop what they're doing and be at their posts
within 24 hours in times of war.
	   Israeli media contrasted the working conditions of the Israelis,
who bedded down in sleeping bags, with those of American team
members who stayed in plush hotels. An Israeli official also said
that at one point, jumpy U.S. Marines guarding a safe pointed
rifles at a yellow-helmeted Israeli team and ordered the rescuers
to stay back.
	   For Israelis, the Nairobi operation was both a ``mitzva,'' a
good deed required of them by Jewish law, and a way to renew faith
in Israel's abilities after a series of failures: a commando
operation gone wrong in Lebanon, the collision of two troop
carrying helicopters, a rash of air force crashes.
	   ``It's good for us and good for everybody. It shows that we are
for anybody who needs us, and we can really help them,'' said Ilan
Cytron, a 25-year-old law student who helped lead a mother and son
from the rubble.
	   Searching a high-rise office building wrecked by the blast,
Cytron walked into a shattered apartment on the 23rd floor and was
astounded to find two people alive.
	   ``We thought we would just find bodies. It was wonderful to see
them,'' he said.
	   The 85-member rescue unit is headed by a reserve colonel, Udi
Ben Uri, 43, who manages a stone quarry in civilian life. He was
vacationing in Holland with his three children when he got the call
to go to Nairobi.
	   ``It's a mitzva to save human beings, but we don't do it because
of that, or the publicity. We do it because that's what we are
trained to do. Our services are needed worldwide, and that's what
we do best,'' said Ben Uri.
	   Israel's rescue team has a number of specialized tools,
including inflatable pillows that are inserted into the rubble and
filled with air to raise it. Microphones and sniffer dogs are used
to locate survivors.
	   ``It's not the machinery and the tools,'' said Liran Golan, a
reserve lieutenant who just returned from Nairobi. ``It's the basic
willingness to travel and help.''

Fire forces evacuation of houses on British base
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A fire fanned by strong winds off the sea
forced the evacuation Monday of 80 houses on a British base in
southwestern Cyprus, officials said.
	   No one was injured, but houses, stores and vehicles belonging to
British servicemen were damaged, Cypriot police said.
	   About 300 servicemen and a Royal Air Force helicopter along with
four Cypriot fire engines fought the blaze at the British base of
Episkopi, said Mervyn Wynne Jones, a base spokesman.
	   Eighty houses were evacuated, mainly as a precaution. But the
fire did cause smoke damage to some of the houses, he said.
	   Britain retained two sovereign base areas on the island when
Cyprus gained its independence from British colonial rule in 1960.
Both are on the southern coast. About 4,000 people, including
servicemen's families, live on the Episkopi base.
	   Cyprus has recorded some of the hottest temperatures this month
in more than 40 years. Police said strong winds off the eastern
Mediterranean Sea fed the flames.

Moscow train station evacuated after bomb threat

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One of Moscow's eight railway stations was
evacuated on Monday evening after an anonymous caller claimed a
bomb had been planted there, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Police and sniffer dogs were sent to the Kazan railway station
to search for explosives.
	   Earlier in the day, what appeared to be a grenade was discovered
in a Moscow furniture store. Police had received a telephone tip
about an explosive device, which security forces found hidden in a
milk container placed in the store, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The security forces destroyed the device, and are now trying to
determine whether it was an explosive or a fake.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The elegant fountains of Paris became swimming
pools for the day, and sweating tourists lined up at museums
wearing Napoleon-like hats made of city maps.
	   But, really, ice cubes in the red wine?
	   After one of the wettest summers on record, temperatures soared
to 38 degrees Celsius (100 Fahrenheit) in the French capital on
Monday, and even higher elsewhere in France.
	   The heat wave extended across Europe, prompting British
bookmakers to slash odds from 20-1 to 16-1 for bets that
temperatures in Britain would hit a record-breaking 38 Celsius
before the end of the summer.
	   In Paris, office workers and tourists stripped down and splashed
around in fountains by the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre museum.
Others sought respite in shady parks, where space was at a premium.
	   People hawking cold refreshments on street corners were doing a
roaring trade.
	   At the Le President cafe, waiters were seen putting ice cubes in
red wine, flirting with the sacrilegious.
	   Susan Bentham, a 21-year-old tourist from Lancaster, England,
danced on a hot pavement after emerging from the fountain next to
the giant pyramid by the Louvre.
	   ``We were going to go into the Louvre, but we saw the queue so
decided to rest here,'' she said. ``Standing in the water is better
than standing in the hot queue.''
	   Suzanne Deme, an 18-year-old from Senegal, lay in the shade
nearby with a bottle of water.
	   ``With this heat you can't do anything. The sun, it beats down
and gives you a headache.''
	   On Sunday, when Paris temperatures reached 36 Celsius (97
Farenheit), 6,000 people flocked to L'Aquaboulevard, an acquatic
park in southern Paris, queuing for up to four hours to get in.
Similar crowds were expected early in the week.
	   In Holland, the heat sent 50,000 people to packed beaches along
the North Sea coast Monday, triggering a 136-kilometer (85-mile)
traffic jam.
	   In northern Spain, authorities warned tourists against
dehydration.
	   And kids in Basel, Switzerland, narrowly missed getting the day
off.
	   A local law allows suspension of classes when temperatures reach
21 Celsius (70 Fahrenheit) with high humidity. Monday morning's
temperature was 20 degrees.
	   In Paris and other major French cities, heat is increasingly
being accompanied by pollution.
	   With very little wind, an early-morning smog shrouded the Eiffel
Tower, and authorities warned asthma-sufferers and the elderly not
to venture out for too long.
	   Police urged motorists to leave their vehicles at home and take
public transport, or just drive slowly.
	   Weather forecasts say the heat wave will last a few more days
before dropping to more moderate levels.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The flag-shrouded coffins of 11 Americans
killed in the worst terrorist attack on a U.S. Embassy were
solemnly loaded onto a military aircraft Monday to begin their
final journey home.
	   The 12th American victim, Jean Dalizu, who was married to a
Kenyan, will be buried in her adopted homeland.
	   The explosion Friday killed at least 186 people, including the
12 Americans plus 33 Kenyans who worked at the embassy, and injured
nearly 5,000. A nearly simultaneous attack on the U.S. Embassy in
neighboring Tanzania killed at least 10, all Africans.
	   The bombers have have not been identified.
	   As each aluminum coffin was lifted into the U.S. Air Force C-141
aircraft, U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell covered her heart with
her right hand _ still bandaged from the injuries she suffered in
the blast.
	   U.S. Marine Brig. Gen. Stephen Johnson, Kenyan Foreign Minister
Bonaya Godana and his assistant stood at attention nearby. U.S.
troops saluted farewell.
	   U.S. Marine and Navy honor guards carried 10 of the coffins, and
a special Marine unit carried the remains of fallen comrade Sgt.
Jesse N. Aliganga of Tallahassee, Fla.
	   American and Kenyan flags fluttered in a soft breeze sweet with
the perfume of grass and acacia trees. The airport was silent but
for a distant rumbling airplane engine.
	   The most senior American diplomat killed was Consul General
Julian Bartley, who died with his 20-year-old son Jay.
	   ``He had an ability to help people understand that he was there
to help. He was known for that throughout his career,'' U.S.
Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said of the elder Bartley.
	   Watching the coffins file past, Scharf said he was struck by the
enormity of the tragedy.
	   ``I think of the Kenyan secretary who worked in my office,''
Scharf said. ``I think of the young sergeant that lived above me
... someone who loved Kenya and the person that many of us would go
to when we wanted to know what to do in Kenya.''
	   ``Those people are gone. We've suffered a terrible loss.''
	   Scharf said the bombing of the Nairobi embassy was the worse
attack on a U.S. Embassy since the early 1980s.
	   In 1984, a car-bomb attack on the U.S. Embassy annex in east
Beirut killed 16 people, including two Americans. A year earlier, a
suicide car bomber destroyed the U.S. Embassy, killing 62 people,
including 17 Americans.
	   The deadliest attack on Americans was the suicide truck bombing
by Shiites of a U.S. Marine base, killing 241 American servicemen
in 1983.
	   The bodies of the Americans killed in Nairobi were to be flown
to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland via Ramstein Air Force Base
in Germany where a memorial service was planned.

Two shot in government-opposition dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Violence has escalated in Lesotho in a
dispute over charges that May's elections were rigged, with reports
of four shootings in clashes between opposition and government
supporters.
	   Two opposition supporters were shot by the driver of a car they
were trying to stop, said Lesotho Police commissioner Bolutu
Makoaba.
	   ``His car's windscreen was broken,'' Makoaba said. ``He reacted
by taking out his gun and fired on the crowd, injuring two
people.''
	   A spokeswoman for an alliance of eight opposition groups, Monica
Mopedi, claimed earlier Monday that two women were wounded by
gunfire in the Maseru suburb of Motimtoso, which was dominated by
supporters of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy.
	   The extent of the victims' injuries was not known.
	   The current dispute centers on May's elections, when the LCD won
all but one of the Parliamentary seats. Three main opposition
parties failed in their attempt to get the courts to postpone the
elections after they claimed irregularities in voter registration.
	   The main opposition group, the Basotho National Party, won all
parliamentary seats in the 1993 election. It ruled until last year,
when former Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle broke away and formed the
LCD, taking most members of Parliament with him.
	   On Monday, the opposition charged that police had prevented an
opposition supporter, Moletsane Monayake, from presenting
statistics proving the election fraud charges to South African
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who arrived Monday to start mediating
the dispute.
	   Monayake's party affiliation was not known.
	   Thousands of protesters have camped outside King Letsie III's
palace since last Tuesday, demanding that the king dissolve the
government and call for new elections, although under the 1993
constitution, the hereditary monarch has no legislative or
executive power.
	   A group of about 150 stick-wielding protesters ensured that many
shops and other businesses in the central city remained closed
Monday.
	   Police used water cannons and rubber bullets last week to
scatter demonstrators who blocked Parliament. A heavy police and
military presence was reported on Monday.
	   The tiny mountain kingdom of 2 million is plagued by a long
history of political upheaval that has seen power pass back and
forth between military and elected governments, and the royal
family take opposite sides in the struggles.

Annan says Angolan leaders must demonstrate commitment to peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned
Monday that the United Nations could pull out of Angola if the
country's political leaders don't do their bit for peace.
	   ``When we determine that our presence is not making any
difference the Security Council may consider withdrawal, but I
don't think we are there yet,'' Annan in reference to Angola.
	   Annan called on political leaders in the vast Southwest African
nation to have the ``courage and determination'' to relaunch their
stymied peace process.
	   Thee U.N Secretary-General was speaking in Lisbon after meeting
with Foreign Minister Jaime Gama to discuss peace making efforts in
Angola, East Timor and Guinea-Bissau _ all former Portuguese
colonies.
	   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi _
leader of the former rebel movement UNITA _ recently promised a
U.N. special envoy that they would stop delaying implementation of
a U.N.-brokered 1994 deal that established peace after two decades
of civil war.
	   The two leaders have made and broken similar promises before.
	   ``For the time being the U.N. is going to stay and work with the
leaders,'' Annan said without specifying how far U.N. patience
would stretch.
	   Personnel in the U.N. peacekeeping force in Angola currently
totals 728.
	   Annan also referred to the hopes raised by Indonesia's offer to
negotiate special autonomy status for the disputed territory of
East Timor in recent U.N.-brokered talks with Portugal.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after intervening in a
civil war that broke out during the last days of Portuguese
colonial rule. The United Nations still considers Portugal the
administering power.
	   ``It is important that Timorese representatives participate in
the negotiations, above all given the fact that (Indonesian
President Jusuf) Habibie has already promised to release political
prisoners and is withdrawing troops,'' Annan said.
	   Annan arrived in Portugal last Friday to attend a U.N-sponsored
international conference on youth policy.
	   On Tuesday, he is to meet with former Portuguese president Mario
Soares who heads the Independent World Oceans Commission on the
Oceans. The commission, launched in Japan in 1995, is due to
present a report to the U.N. this year.
	   The two diplomats are also expected to discuss Soares' recent
U.N. mission to Algeria to investigate the massacres and bombings
that have killed an estimated 75,000 people since 1992.
	   Annan is due to leave Portugal on Tuesday for vacation in his
native Ghana.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ In the first confirmed arrest of
suspects in the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa,
Tanzanian police said Monday they had detained several people in
connection with the embassy bombing in Dar es Salaam and were
checking on further suspects.
	   ``There were some suspects arrested, more than one, in different
parts of Dar es Salaam,'' said Asst. Police Commissioner Wilson
Mwansasu.
	   But in Washington, a senior U.S. official called the arrests ``a
routine roundup.''
	   Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice told reporters ``don't
attach too much importance to it.''
	   Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Sudanese and Iraqi citizens were among those detained for
questioning, which he said was hoped would result in useful leads.
	   At the morgue of Muhimbili teaching hospital, grieving families
of the 10 Tanzanians killed in the Friday blast began receiving the
remains of the victims after U.S. investigators examined the bodies
and released them one by one.
	   More than 100 U.S. Marines, Federal Bureau of Investigation and
State Department officials and counter-terrorism experts have
arrived in the Tanzanian capital to begin their investigation into
the embassy bombing in which another 70 people were injured. Six
remain hospitalized.
	   All the dead were Tanzanian.
	   Mwansasu declined to give the number of identity of those
arrested, adding only that they were ``connected to others.''
	   ``We had to wait for so long ... for the investigators to review
the bodies to try to find those responsible, but we still believe
it was necessary and for a good cause,'' said Harun Mahundi,
Tanzania's former police inspector general, whose brother, Ramadani
Mahundi, was an embassy guard who was killed in the blast.
	   Police believe the bomb, which exploded just outside the embassy
near the main entrance and guard booth, could have been planted in
an embassy-owned tanker truck that delivered water to the building
because of the frequent shortages and water cut offs in the city on
the Indian Ocean.
	   The blast killed the guards in the booth and apparently slammed
the blue water tanker into the side of the embassy building.
	   The tanker's cab was reduced to a tangled mass of melted metal.
	   A surveillance camera at the roof on the far end of the building
still pointed Monday at the guard booth.
	   A U.S. diplomat, who spoke with reporters on condition of
anonymity Sunday, did not rule out that among evidence there may be
a videotape of the entire blast.
	   Ibrahim Pamba, a cousin of the dead guard Ramadani Mahundi, also
waited with his brother at the morgue.
	   He said he had been at the embassy Friday morning, just 10
minutes before the explosion.
	   ``If I had been a few minutes later, it could have been me,''
said Pamba, a chemist.
	   He said he saw the blue tanker on the Laibon Road just outside
the embassy as he left the building, maneuvering to turn.
	   ``There was nothing suspicious,'' said Pamba. ``The truck looked
ordinary. It was an ordinary day.''
	   The body of Ramadani Mahundi was the first to be released
Monday. Relatives quickly carried it to a nearby mosque for
cleansing.
	   Then, men sang as they carried the rough wooden casket to a
truck for transport to the countryside for a Muslim burial.
	   Several women wailed, and two others buried their heads in their
arms against the window of a van as they cried aloud. Another women
fell to the ground overwhelmed by grief.
	   Marine guards have sealed off the site of the embassy explosion
with multiple rows of barbed wire and stand guard behind sandbags,
their assault rifles pointing towards the road.
	   Burned vehicles and other debris were cleared from the area
overnight outside the sealed-off embassy, built in the 1960s by the
Israelis as their embassy in Dar es Salaam.
	   Former president Julius Nyerere, who visited the site Monday
escorted by charge d'affaires John Lange, said the sad and
senseless bombings in the two neighboring East African nations had
targetted Americans _ but Tanzanians, Kenyans and Americans had all
died.

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Two Liberian warlords-turned-preachers
took to the radio airwaves to confess to ghoulish crimes committed
during the country's seven-year civil war and proselytize for a new
struggle _ Christian evangelism.
	   Former rebel commander Joshua Milton Blahyi and Paul Tolbert,
appeared together on Monrovia radio station KISS-FM on Sunday to
call for national reconciliation.
	   Blahyi, who often fought battles while stripped nude, was a
commander loyal to rebel leader George Boley, while Tolbert led
forces under President Charles Taylor.
	   Taylor traded his rebel's gun for the politician's platform in
1996 and won national elections last July.
	   Blahyi related to radio listeners how he had killed civilians
indiscriminately and slain children to feed a grisly Satanic ritual
to protect him from enemy bullets in battle.
	   ``Through the power of charms, I used to challenge and deflect
rockets and bullets on the battle front,'' Blahyi said. ``But I
soon realized that such power could not carry me through.''
	   Blayhi said the mother of one of his victims had forgiven him
and now regularly visits him in his home.
	   Tolbert said he regretted his crimes and had turned his life
over to God to become a ``correction fluid'' to change the lives of
others.
	   Since fighting subsided in 1996, both Blahyi and Tolbert have
started Christian evangelist ministries that have drawn large
crowds throughout this battle-scarred country.
	   -----
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Over previous objections from Parliament,
President Yoweri Museveni enlarged his cabinet to include posts for
an additional two ministers and 13 junior ministers, Radio Uganda
said Monday.
	   The cabinet now includes 19 full ministers and 42 junior
ministers who will handle issues such as ethics and integrity and
primary health.
	   Ruhakana Rugunda, formerly deputy minister for regional
cooperation, became minister in charge of the presidency.
	   Parliament dropped its objections to the enlarged cabinet after
meeting with Museveni.
	   Museveni's brother, Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, turned down an
unspecified cabinet-level job for fear the appointment would be
interpreted as nepotism.
	   ------
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Nigerian-led West African
peacekeepers have begun guarding the streets around the U.S.
Embassy in Sierra Leone in the wake of two embassy bombings Friday
in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
	   Lt. Col. Gariel Oheime, a spokesman for the West African force
known as ECOMOG, said Monday that troop reinforcements had been
deployed outside the embassy to ``comfort U.S. Embassy diplomats
after the two disasters.''
	   A private security firm normally handles security at the
embassy.
	   Officials at the embassy were not immediately available for
comment and an embassy employee who declined to be named said the
situation outside the building was ``tense.''
	   -------
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Dozens of rebel fighters have
straggled into a military base in Sierra Leone's capital as the
recently reinstalled government agreed to extend the deadline of an
offer of food and medical supplies to surrendering troops.
	   Several hundred rebels have laid down their weapons in recent
months. The government had offered in July to deal less harshly
with renegades who surrendered by Aug. 8.
	   Septimus Kai Kai, a spokesman for President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah,
told journalists on Sunday that the government would continue to
``accept surrenders'' and would treat each of the prisoners under
international guidelines.
	   Citing military intelligence reports, Kai Kai said more rebels
were expected to surrender in the near future.
	   The United Nations has congratulated Kabbah's government for
offering amnesty to child soldiers from all combatant groups. The
government returned to power in March after a Nigerian-led West
African force ousted junta troops led by Lt. Col. Johnny Paul
Koroma.
	   ------
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Police on Monday shot and arrested a
suspect in the grisly murder and immolation of four people at a
farm house in the Western Cape Province.
	   The man, who was not named by police, allegedly killed the
farmer's wife and three friends in a hostage drama on Sunday
morning.
	   The gunman overpowered the farm couple, Ria and Tommy
Heathfield, early Sunday, then took hostage four friends who came
to pick them up for church, as well as a church minister and a
parishioner who came by to check on their absence after church.
	   The four victims were shot, doused with gasoline and set alight,
police said. They included Mrs. Heathfield and three friends.
	   The killings brought to nearly 80 the number of farm residents
murdered since January.
	   Conservative, mostly white politicians charge that the
government of President Nelson Mandela isn't concerned enough about
the victims because of their color.

Supreme Court upholds judgment against jailed Russian mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Supreme Court on Monday upheld the prison
sentence against the disqualified mayor of Russia's third largest
city, squelching his chances to compete in new elections scheduled
next month.
	   Andrei Klimentyev, a prominent entrepreneur, was elected mayor
of Nizhny Novgorod in March. Election officials invalidated his
victory after President Boris Yeltsin expressed concern about the
balloting results.
	   Klimentyev was convicted in May on charges of forging documents,
embezzling part of a government loan to a local shipbuilding plant,
and appropriating a large share of the plant's stock. He was
sentenced to six years in prison.
	   Nevertheless, his campaign workers collected enough signatures
to get him registered for the new elections in September. The
court's ruling has disqualified him from the race.

Langer says he won't play at PGA championship in Seattle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANHAUSEN, Germany (AP) _ German golfer Bernhard Langer, who
complained of stomach problems at last week's German Open, said
Monday he would skip the PGA Championship in Seattle due to a
strained neck.
	   ``I felt the pain immediately upon getting up,'' Langer said.
	   Langer, five-time winner at the German Open, finished in 13th

Militiamen fire at ship trying to dock in Mogadishu port
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Attempts to re-open the air and sea
ports in the war-torn Somali capital suffered another setback
Monday when opponents of the plan fired on a ship trying to dock in
the Indian Ocean port, witnesses said.
	   Militiamen fired anti-tank mortars at the ship before faction
leader Muse Sudi Yalahow warned publicly that airplanes and ships
attempting to use the air and sea ports would be fired on.
	   It was impossible to ascertain the nationality of the ship or
whether it was hit before returning to open sea, the witnesses said
on condition of anonymity.
	   Yalahow, Hassan Osman Ali, also known as Atto, and Gen. Mohamed
Sheik Osman, are opposed to the new unified administration for the
war-torn capital.
	   A week ago, South Mogadishu warlord Hussein Mohamed Aidid, Ali
Mahdi Mohamed, who controls northern part of the city, and another
faction leader, Mohamed Qanyare Afrah, agreed on the plan for a
joint administration.
	   On Monday, they declared the airport and seaport open for
business. Both have been closed since the departure of U.N.
peacekeepers in 1995 when Ali Mahdi and his then-ally Atto sheleed
both to keep them from falling in the hands of the late Mohamed
Farah Aidid, Hussein's father. Both are in south Mogadishu in
neighborhoods under Aidid's control.
	   Yalahow warned his opponents against setting up militia bases in
north Mogadishu, where he relocated from the southern half of the
capital.
	   The warning followed reports that leaders of the new
administration had mobilized their militias as a police force to
pacify Mogadishu.
	   Meanwhile, the 16 self-proclaimed district commissioners from
the region around Mogadishu met Monday and pledged support for the
new administration.
	   ``We will support whoever is bringing us peace and life,'' said
spokesman Mohamed Abdulle Guled. ``We need no more fighting, but
we'll be forced to fight against anyone seen as a threat to the
stability of the capital.''
	   Somalia has had no central government since Ali Mahdi and
Mohamed Farah Aidid joined forces to oust dictator Mohamed Siad
Barre in 1991, then turned on each other. The country then
disintegrated into warring clan-based fiefdoms.

Tamils urge U.N. human rights chief to probe alleged mass graves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo GEV101-102 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Thousands of Tamils demonstrated outside the
United Nations' European headquarters Monday in support of a call
for an international probe of alleged mass graves in Sri Lanka.
	   Protestors wearing head bandages splashed with red waved banners
and gave out leaflets bearing slogans including ``Stop the genocide
of Tamils'' and ``Recognize Tamil struggle for freedom.''
	   In a letter, protest organizers have urged U.N. human rights
commissioner Mary Robinson to investigate the alleged burial by Sri
Lankan security forces of several hundred bodies in the country's
Jaffna peninsula.
	   As many as 500 Tamil civilians have disappeared in the northern
peninsula, the Tamil heartland, since the military drove
anti-government rebels to nearby jungles and took control in May
1996.
	   The rebels are fighting for an independent homeland for the
Tamil minority, accusing the majority Sinhalese of widespread
discrimination in education and jobs. At least 54,000 people have
been killed since fighting started in 1983.
	   In their letter to the U.N. human rights sub-commission
responsible for monitoring countries' protection of minorities,
officials of the French branch of the Tamil Center for Human Rights
claim the country's human rights situation is deteriorating and say
an investigation is urgently needed.
	   U.N. human rights spokesman Jose Diaz said the sub-commission
would need more evidence for an inquiry to be considered.
	   It would also have to be approved by the full U.N. Commission on
Human Rights, which meets in Geneva in the spring.
	   The demonstration was organized by the International Federation
of Tamils and timed to coincide with a U.N. human rights meeting
currently in session.
	   Organizers estimated a crowd of up to 10,000 people gathered on
the square in front of the U.N. building to listen to speeches by
activists. Although the protest was peaceful, police mounted a
security operation to prevent protesters entering the United
Nations' grounds.
	   ``The international community has to recognize that the genocide
is going on and has to be stopped,'' said Ponrajah Anton,
coordinating secretary for the International Federation of Tamils.
	   The Sri Lankan government has ordered an inquiry into the
allegations of mass graves after human rights groups and Tamil
political parties said it would be a test of President Chandrika
Kumaratunga's commitment to protect the minorities.
	   The military has said it is ready to help in the investigation.

King Hussein accepts resignation of water minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein accepted Monday the
resignation of Jordan's water and irrigation minister, who was
blamed for polluted drinking water in parts of the capital.
	   Residents of the upscale suburbs of western Amman have
complained that water flowing out of taps for three weeks has an
odor and contains worms and larvae.
	   The government denied the water was contaminated. But water
experts have said studies showed that some drinking water contained
worms, which could be dangerous to health.
	   The king requested that Mohamed Saleh Hourani, the minister of
energy and mineral resources, immediately begin handling the duties
of the outgoing minister, Munther Haddadin.

Volkswagen optimistic on averting strike at Mexican plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen AG said Monday it is
confident it can avert a strike at its Puebla, Mexico plant in the
next couple of days by reaching an agreement with unions.
	   Workers in Puebla, VW's only production site for its hot-selling
New Beetle, threatened Friday to go on strike unless their wages
were raised, VW spokesman Kurt Rippholz said.
	   ``We are in talks with the workers' unions in Mexico and we are
confident that we will solve the problem,'' he said.
	   Rippholz said production had not yet been affected, but VW's
share price has been hit by the conflict. It tumbled 5.8 percent
Monday to 152.95 marks (dlrs 86.41).

British scientists identify 13th meteorite from Mars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A meteorite discovered in the Sahara Desert was
positively identified Monday as originating from Mars, British
scientists said.
	   The 4.8 pounds (2.2 kilogram) rock is only the 13th meteorite _
out of 20,000 found worldwide _ proven to be from the red planet.
	   Meteorite experts hope this latest discovery, called Lucky 13,
will tell scientists more about environmental conditions on Mars
and aid in the search for evidence of life on the planet.
	   ``This is another piece in the jigsaw puzzle,'' said Colin
Pillinger, a space scientist at the Planetary Sciences Research
Institute at Open University in Milton Keynes, 50 miles (80
kilometers) northwest of London. ``And this particular meteorite is
exciting because it seems to be from a different formation and
possibly a different age than the others.''
	   The meteorite's age is not yet known. But Pillinger said it left
Mars at least a million years ago, when a comet or asteroid smashed
into the planet's surface. After drifting through space, the
meteorite eventually crashed onto Earth where it probably lay
undiscovered in the Saharan desert for 40,000 years, Pillinger
said.
	   He does not know who found the rock or when, but Pillinger said
it is owned by a private citizen. That makes it the first of the 13
meteorites in private hands. Six of the others are owned by the
U.S. government, and six by museums. The last Mars meteorite was
found in 1994 in Antarctica.
	   Scientists at the planetary institute learned of the
grapefruit-sized meteorite last week when they were given a small
sample to test for authenticity.
	   Pillinger described the tests, using laser technology to isolate
oxygen isotopes, as being a ``genetic test for rocks.'' The results
confirmed the rock did originate on Mars. Now the sample held by
the British scientists will be subjected to a series of
experiments.
	   ``Clearly we won't ever be looking for any advanced forms of
life,'' said Ian Wright, a meteorite researcher in Britain. ``But
in the microscopic record there could be a rich variety of
things.''
	   In 1996, NASA scientists stunned the world when another Mars
meteorite was hailed as containing evidence of life. NASA said they
had discovered the fossilized remains of tiny, bacteria-like
animals that may have once thrived on Mars. But since their
announcement, their theory has remained unproven.

Mediators fail to resolve Peru, Ecuador standoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ International mediators have failed to resolve
a standoff between Peruvian and Ecuadorean troops in a stretch of
disputed territory near where the Andean neighbors fought a brief
war in 1995.
	   But representatives of the United States, Brazil, Chile and
Argentina _ who met in Ecuador's capital, Quito, on Sunday to try
to broker a deal _ said they would try again.
	   ``The dialogue is not broken,'' said Hugo de Zela Martinez,
spokesman for the Peruvian delegation.
	   Peru is willing to resume the talks with Ecuador's new
president, Jamil Mahuad, who took office Monday, a Peruvian Foreign
Ministry communique said.
	   On Sunday, Mahuad asked former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to
help mediate the conflict. Carter, who is in the United States, has
not said if he will accept the offer.
	   The latest flareup in the long-running dispute between Peru and
Ecuador over 49 miles (79 kilometers) of unmarked border began
Thursday, when Peru charged that Ecuadorean troops had entered its
territory. Ecuador denies it.
	   Peru and Ecuador fought brief border wars in 1941, 1981 and
1995, but had appeared set to negotiate a resolution to the
dispute.
	   Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said the troops had met
``face-to-face'' about 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) inside Peruvian
territory in a mountainous jungle region called the Cordillera del
Condor. The area is 560 miles (900 kilometers) north of Lima,
Peru's capital, and 12 miles (20 kilometers) south of a
demilitarized zone where the two countries fought briefly in 1995.
	   About 20 U.S. military observers are stationed in the
demilitarized area.

LaFontaine to retire on doctor's advice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Advised by his doctor to stop playing hockey
following a sixth concussion, Pat LaFontaine of the New York
Rangers will retire Tuesday.
	   The 33-year-old center sustained his latest concussion March 16,
ending his only season with the National Hockey League team.
Neurologist Jim Kelly told him he was at risk for more concussions
and suggested he retire.
	   The announcement will come at Madison Square Garden.
	   LaFontaine played 15 seasons in the NHL with the New York
Islanders, Buffalo Sabres and the Rangers, finishing with 468
goals, 545 assists and 1,013 points. He also played on the 1984 and
1998 U.S. Olympic teams and the 1996 World Cup team.
	   Severely injured when he was checked by Pittsburgh's Francois
Leroux, LaFontaine played just 13 games in the 1996-97 season and
was urged to retire then by the Sabres. He resisted and was traded
to the Rangers, scoring 23 goals and 39 assists in 67 games and
finishing as the team's second highest scorer.
	   He finishes his career second only to Joey Mullen in goals by
U.S.-born players. Mullen had 502 goals.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Rolling Stones may be one of rock-'n-roll's
hardiest bands, but their Russian fans _ who've waited 31 years for
a visit _ are hardier.
	   ``Better late than never,'' Keith Richards quipped at a news
conference Monday.
	   The four middle-aged rockers play their first Russian concert in
Moscow's Luzhniki sports stadium on Tuesday, three decades after
they first applied for permission.
	   The problem, band leader Mick Jagger explained at the news
conference, was ``entirely political.''
	   In 1967, the Soviets sent officials to watch the Stones play a
concert in Warsaw, which the band hoped would win them permission
to play in Moscow.
	   But unlike the Polish fans, the Soviets didn't like what they
saw.
	   ``They thought the show was so awful, so decadent, that they
said this show would never happen in Moscow,'' Jagger said.
	   ``Anyway, things have changed,'' he added. ``We're thankful to
be here at last.''
	   The long-lived rock stars are 11 months into their long-lived
``Bridges to Babylon'' tour, which will include 90 concerts in 20
countries.
	   Jagger said he's not sure what to expect from Russian
concert-goers, who tend to be more reserved than rock fans in the
West.
	   ``Every country is different,'' he said. ``I expect them to be
different, but how much different I don't know.''
	   The band may see about 80,000 Russians at the concert, but its
members unlikely to see much of the country. A scheduled walk
around Red Square was cut to about one minute when the band was
mobbed by a crowd.
	   But somehow, drummer Charlie Watts seems to have managed to meet
enough Russian women to be impressed with their attributes.
	   ``Charlie says they've all got onion tops,'' joked band member
Ron Woods.

Taliban confiscate residents' weapons after taking northern city

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Tightening its hold on the last major
city that had been outside its control, Afghanistan's Taliban
militia confiscated weapons Monday from residents of
Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Iran, meanwhile, demanded to know what happened to 11 Iranian
diplomats the Taliban allegedly seized when it entered
Mazar-e-Sharif, 190 miles (300 kilometers) north of Kabul. Iran
insisted Pakistan was responsible for their safety.
	   Iran and Pakistan, Afghanistan's neighbors to the west and east,
are both accused of stoking the Afghan civil war, Iran by backing
the northern alliance and Pakistan by backing the Taliban.
	   Since the Taliban entered Mazar-e-Sharif on Saturday behind a
barrage of bombs and rockets, each side claims to have ousted the
other. Independent sources who insisted on anonymity said the
Taliban controlled the city Monday and Mazar-e-Sharif was calm. The
sources provided few other details.
	   In May, the Taliban retreated from Mazar-e-Sharif after street
battles killed hundreds of its soldiers. As many as 2,000 Taliban
prisoners reportedly were later massacred.
	   If they can hold it, a Taliban victory in Mazar-e-Sharif will
boost the militia's four-year campaign to impose a strict
interpretation of Islamic rule on the entire country. The Taliban,
whose name means ``students of Islam,'' now control most of
Afghanistan, including the capital Kabul. Taliban leaders have
barred most women from work and girls from school, banned music and
ordered all men to wear beards.
	   Taliban radio reported military advances Monday in Kapisa
province, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Kabul and near
the last main opposition stronghold in the Panjshir Valley. The
report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Taliban spokesman Abdul Manan Niayzi said Monday that 30
Iranians accused of arming the northern alliance had been captured
and were still alive. But he denied charges that 11 Iranian
diplomats were being held, saying they may be hiding in
Mazar-e-Sharif or may have retreated with opposition forces south
to Bamiyan province.
	   Although the Taliban closed the Iranian Embassy in Kabul last
year, Iranian diplomats continued working in opposition-held areas
like Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi telephoned his Pakistani
counterpart to demand the release of the diplomats and appealed to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to intervene.
	   IRNA also said one of its reporters and an unknown number of
relief workers from Iran had been seized by the Taliban.
	   While the 11 Mazar-e-Sharif diplomats remained missing, nine
other Iranian diplomats from Afghanistan arrived in the Pakistani
capital of Islamabad on Monday on a U.N. evacuation flight.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Prosecutors asked a court Monday to indict 21 people
suspected of belonging to a militant Algerian Islamic group accused
of plotting terrorist attacks at the World Cup soccer tournament in
France.
	   The suspects, 20 North Africans and one Italian, were arrested
in various Italian cities the day the World Cup began June 10, and
have been in jail since. The month-long soccer tournament came off
without any terrorist incidents.
	   Nearly 100 people were arrested in Italy, France, Germany,
Belgium and Switzerland on suspicion of plotting terrorist attacks
in the weeks leading up to the soccer event.
	   Investigators contend the 21 suspects have ties with the Armed
Islamic Group, the most radical organization trying to overthrow
Algeria's government, and have helped terrorists fleeing their
countries by providing them with false documents and lodging in
Europe, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
	   Italian police found a manual on how to assemble a bomb and
documents with the Armed Islamic Group logo in the suspects'
hide-outs, the agency said.
	   The Armed Islamic Group, known by its French initials GIA, was
among the militant groups formed in Algeria _ a former French
colony _ after the military regime canceled 1992 legislative
elections that Muslim fundamentalists were poised to win. At least
75,000 people have died in the insurgency.

Kabila battles to retake towns seized by rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with offensives launched in east and west;
government says fighting near Bukavu. ADDS Ugandan denial of
involvement in Congo. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Deploying additional troops from
Kinshasa, Congo has launched twin offensives in the east and west
where Tutsi rebels have captured several key towns, the information
minister said Monday.
	   Congo vowed not only to retake its lost territory, but also to
march all the way to the Rwanda capital, Information Minister
Didier Mumengi told reporters.
	   ``We have been reinforcing our positions and know that we will
take the war as far as Kigali,'' Mumengi said of the Rwandan
capital.
	   He said fighting in the eastern Kivu region centered around the
area surrounding the city of Bukavu near the Rwandan border. Trucks
filled with government troops, meanwhile, rumbled out of Kinshasa
on Monday on their way to reinforce fighters in western Congo near
the Atlantic coastline.
	   State-controlled radio said President Laurent Kabila had ordered
the reinforcements for a push to retake several small towns in the
west, including the oil town of Muanda.
	   Rebel Tutsis have captured strategic towns in both the west,
about 250 kilometers (150 miles) southwest of Kinshasa, and to the
east in Kivu as part of their week-old uprising against Kabila.
	   The government says Rwanda instigated the rebellion and is
fighting alongside Tutsi rebels. On Sunday, Mumengi also accused
Uganda of sending soldiers and tanks into Congo in support of the
Tutsi fighters.
	   Rwanda has repeatedly denied the charge, but warns it will hit
back if attacked and says it is contemplating a preemptive strike
against Congo.
	   Uganda on Monday dismissed Kabila's charges.
	   An adviser to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who refused to
be named, said the allegations were ``childish and wide of the
mark.''
	   ``We have said very clearly there are no columns of any kind
marching anywhere in Congo,'' he said. ``Anyone can play these
childish games, throwing darts at everyone in the region.''
	   Yet Mumengi on Sunday said two columns of Ugandan forces,
including tanks and trucks filled with soldiers, had invaded Congo.
	   He also accused Rwanda of executing captured Congolese officers
and of rounding up civilians in the Kivu region.
	   The charges could not be independently confirmed.
	   Tutsi gunmen with close ties to Rwanda launched an offensive a
week ago in Kivu, vowing to topple Kabila's 14-month-old regime.
Within the first few days of their uprising, the rebels captured
several key cities near the Rwandan border, including Goma and
Bukavu.
	   Congo's government, meanwhile, appears to be gearing up for a
protracted fight, recruiting militia fighters in Kinshasa.
	   Weekend talks in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, showed little sign of
easing tensions between the feuding neighbors, but a United Nations
team arrived in Kinshasa late Sunday in hopes of convincing all
sides to stand down their forces.
	   Rwanda's President Pasteur Bizimungu says Kabila is using the
Tutsi uprising as a pretext to attack Rwanda and distract attention
from domestic threats to his rule. He said Rwanda had evidence that
Kabila's forces had been training former Hutu soldiers and
militiamen in the southern city of Kamina, and have plans to use
them against Rwanda.
	   The rebellious Rwandan soldiers and Congolese Tutsi fighters _
including the ethnic Banyamulenge _ backed Kabila last year in his
ouster of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, but they have since grown
disaffected. The Banyamulenge have close ethnic ties with the
Rwandan Tutsis.

Annan says Angolan leaders must demonstrate commitment to peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RESENDING to fix category coding &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned
Monday that the United Nations could pull out of Angola if the
country's political leaders don't do their bit for peace.
	   ``When we determine that our presence is not making any
difference the Security Council may consider withdrawal, but I
don't think we are there yet,'' Annan in reference to Angola.
	   Annan called on political leaders in the vast Southwest African
nation to have the ``courage and determination'' to relaunch their
stymied peace process.
	   Thee U.N Secretary-General was speaking in Lisbon after meeting
with Foreign Minister Jaime Gama to discuss peace making efforts in
Angola, East Timor and Guinea-Bissau _ all former Portuguese
colonies.
	   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi _
leader of the former rebel movement UNITA _ recently promised a
U.N. special envoy that they would stop delaying implementation of
a U.N.-brokered 1994 deal that established peace after two decades
of civil war.
	   The two leaders have made and broken similar promises before.
	   ``For the time being the U.N. is going to stay and work with the
leaders,'' Annan said without specifying how far U.N. patience
would stretch.
	   Personnel in the U.N. peacekeeping force in Angola currently
totals 728.
	   Annan also referred to the hopes raised by Indonesia's offer to
negotiate special autonomy status for the disputed territory of
East Timor in recent U.N.-brokered talks with Portugal.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after intervening in a
civil war that broke out during the last days of Portuguese
colonial rule. The United Nations still considers Portugal the
administering power.
	   ``It is important that Timorese representatives participate in
the negotiations, above all given the fact that (Indonesian
President Jusuf) Habibie has already promised to release political
prisoners and is withdrawing troops,'' Annan said.
	   Annan arrived in Portugal last Friday to attend a U.N-sponsored
international conference on youth policy.
	   On Tuesday, he is to meet with former Portuguese president Mario
Soares who heads the Independent World Oceans Commission on the
Oceans. The commission, launched in Japan in 1995, is due to
present a report to the U.N. this year.
	   The two diplomats are also expected to discuss Soares' recent
U.N. mission to Algeria to investigate the massacres and bombings
that have killed an estimated 75,000 people since 1992.
	   Annan is due to leave Portugal on Tuesday for vacation in his
native Ghana.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The elegant fountains of Paris became swimming
pools for the day, and sweating tourists lined up at museums
wearing Napoleon-like hats made of city maps.
	   But, really, ice cubes in the red wine?
	   After one of the wettest summers on record, temperatures soared
to 38 degrees Celsius (100 Fahrenheit) in the French capital on
Monday, and even higher elsewhere in France.
	   The heat wave extended across Europe, prompting British
bookmakers to slash odds from 20-1 to 16-1 for bets that
temperatures in Britain would hit a record-breaking 38 Celsius
before the end of the summer.
	   In Paris, office workers and tourists stripped down and splashed
around in fountains by the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre museum.
Others sought respite in shady parks, where space was at a premium.
	   People hawking cold refreshments on street corners were doing a
roaring trade, as were shops selling air conditioners _ still a
rarity in France, and Europe in general. At the Darty store in
central Paris, not one overhead fan was left.
	   At the Le President cafe, waiters were seen putting ice cubes in
red wine, flirting with the sacrilegious.
	   Susan Bentham, a 21-year-old tourist from Lancaster, England,
danced on a hot pavement after emerging from the fountain next to
the giant pyramid by the Louvre.
	   ``We were going to go into the Louvre, but we saw the queue so
decided to rest here,'' she said. ``Standing in the water is better
than standing in the hot queue.''
	   Suzanne Deme, an 18-year-old from Senegal, lay in the shade
nearby with a bottle of water.
	   ``With this heat you can't do anything. The sun, it beats down
and gives you a headache.''
	   On Sunday, when Paris temperatures reached 36 Celsius (97
Farenheit), 6,000 people flocked to L'Aquaboulevard, an acquatic
park in southern Paris, queuing for up to four hours to get in.
Similar crowds were expected early in the week.
	   In Holland, the heat sent 50,000 people to packed beaches along
the North Sea coast Monday, triggering a 136-kilometer (85-mile)
traffic jam.
	   In Austria, a chemical tanker exploded Sunday in Linz due to
over-exposure to the heat. In eastern Europe, a heat wave has
reportedly claimed at least 20 lives in Romania, buckled streetcar
tracks in Hungary and smashed temperature records throughout the
region.

Annan says Angolan leaders must demonstrate commitment to peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned
Monday that the United Nations could pull out of Angola if the
country's political leaders don't do their bit for peace.
	   ``When we determine that our presence is not making any
difference the Security Council may consider withdrawal, but I
don't think we are there yet,'' Annan said, referring to Angola.
	   Annan called on political leaders in the vast southwest African
nation to have the ``courage and determination'' to relaunch their
stymied peace process.
	   The U.N chief was speaking in Lisbon after meeting with Foreign
Minister Jaime Gama to discuss peace efforts in Angola, East Timor
and Guinea-Bissau _ all former Portuguese colonies.
	   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi _
leader of the former rebel movement UNITA _ recently promised a
U.N. special envoy that they would stop delaying implementation of
a U.N.-brokered 1994 deal that established peace after two decades
of civil war.
	   The two leaders have made and broken similar promises before.
	   ``For the time being the U.N. is going to stay and work with the
leaders,'' Annan said.
	   Personnel in the U.N. peacekeeping force in Angola currently
totals 728.
	   Annan also referred to the hopes raised by Indonesia's offer to
negotiate special autonomy status for the disputed territory of
East Timor in recent U.N.-brokered talks with Portugal.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after intervening in a
civil war that broke out during the last days of Portuguese
colonial rule. The United Nations still considers Portugal the
administering power.
	   ``It is important that Timorese representatives participate in
the negotiations, above all given the fact that (Indonesian
President B.J.) Habibie has already promised to release political
prisoners and is withdrawing troops,'' Annan said.
	   Annan arrived in Portugal last Friday to attend a U.N-sponsored
international conference on youth policy. He was due to leave
Tuesday for vacation in his native Ghana.
	   On Tuesday, he was to meet with former Portuguese president
Mario Soares, who heads the Independent World Oceans Commission on
the Oceans. The commission, launched in Japan in 1995, is due to
present a report to the U.N. this year.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Weary rescue workers heard tapping Monday
under the debris of a bombed building next to the U.S. Embassy,
raising hopes for finding another survivor. Police said they
arrested several suspects in a nearly simultaneous bombing in
Tanzania.
	   Blasts within minutes of each other at the American embassies in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, were
sophisticated attacks. Israel army radio, in a report from Nairobi,
said investigators suspect the bombers used the plastic explosive
Semtex.
	   In possibly the first breakthrough in the investigations in
either country, Assistant Police Commissioner Wilson Mwansasu
announced that ``there were some suspects arrested ... in different
parts of Dar es Salaam.''
	   Mwansasu said they were ``connected to others,'' but refused to
elaborate.
	   In Washington, however, Assistant Secretary of State for African
Affairs Susan Rice said about a dozen people had been detained for
questioning in ``a routine roundup'' and told reporters ``don't
attach too much importance to it.''
	   Mwansasu refused to comment on Rice's remarks or the
nationalities of those arrested.
	   Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Sudanese and Iraqi citizens were among those detained. There was no
immediate explanation of why the American officials referred to
detentions when the Tanzanians spoke of arrests.
	   The Daily Mail newspaper in Dar es Salaam reported Monday that
an Arab man was arrested Saturday trying to cross the border into
Kenya. The paper said the man boarded a flight from Dar es Salaam
to Kilimanjaro Airport after Friday's bombing, checked into a guest
house in nearby Arusha, and spent the rest of the day praying at a
local mosque.
	   Police in Dar es Salaam said they could not confirm this arrest.
	   The explosions took a terrible toll: At least 192 dead in
Nairobi and nearly 5,000 injured; at least 10 dead in Dar es Salaam
and 74 injured.
	   The U.S. Embassy said through Sunday that the official Kenyan
toll did not include the American dead. U.S. Embassy spokesman
Chris Scharf said Monday the official Kenyan toll now includes the
American dead.
	   A U.S. diplomat in Dar es Salaam, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Monday there would possibly be an 11th victim, a
Tanzanian.
	   Rice told CNN the death toll would have been far higher if the
bombers in Nairobi had achieved their goal _ getting into the
embassy's underground parking garage. The bomb exploded in a
parking lot behind the embassy.
	   The powerful blast in downtown Nairobi destroyed a building next
door to the embassy and damaged others blocks away. The damage in
Tanzania was far less because the embassy is in a residential area.
	   On Monday, rescue teams in Nairobi were working to clear debris
from the badly damaged but still intact ground floor of the Ufundi
Cooperative House adjacent to the embassy, hoping to reach buried
survivors.
	   Tired Israeli rescuers said they heard tapping inside the Ufundi
Monday morning, and said it spurred them on in their search for a
woman named Rose, who last spoke to rescue workers Sunday
afternoon.
	   Work at the bomb site was halted for a few minutes Monday
afternoon when stonework began falling off a nearby bank building.
When work resumed, a bulldozer was brought in to clear the top
layer of rubble in hopes of reaching the building's ground and
lower floors.
	   Kenyan Red Cross workers are convinced that Rose and another
woman named Jane were in the ruins of the Ufundi building. ``Jane
hasn't been heard of for much, much longer,'' said John Sparrow,
spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   ``I don't think anybody will give up hope until they get in
there and see,'' he said.
	   In Dar es Salaam, American medical examiners were releasing the
bodies of the 10 Tanzanians killed in the blast to their families.
	   The bodies of 11 Americans killed in the bombing began their
long, final journey home on Monday. They will arrive at Andrews Air
Force Base in Maryland Tuesday after a stop at Ramstein Air Force
Base in Germany.
	   As each flag-draped coffin was lifted gently into a U.S. Air
Force C-141 aircraft, Ambassador Bushnell raised her right hand _
still bandaged from the injuries she suffered in the Friday blast _
to her heart. Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana stood at
attention nearby.
	   The 12th victim, Jean Dalizu, who was married to a Kenyan, will
be buried in her adopted homeland.
	   As investigators probed the cause of the blast, U.S. Marines on
Monday sealed off the block around the embassy in Tanzania with
barbed wire and sandbags and took up positions on top of the
embassy building and around it.
	   At the bomb-out embassy, staffers tried to salvage what they
could from the rubble. It is ``heartbreaking,'' Bushnell said, to
find that things survived, but not people.
	   Gerard Bradford, head of a disaster response team from the
United States, said his people were combing the building for the
nine Kenyan employees still missing.
	   ``There is hip-deep debris in a lot of those rooms,'' he said.
	   Wendy Auldridge and Joyce Reed were trying to rescue the mail
from the basement, a nod at the normal in a world fractured by
violence.
	   ``It's a small thing, but I think it will boost morale,'' Reed
said.
	   Sniffer dogs from the United States, France and Israel padded
over rubble, one with a cut nose from the sea of broken glass.
	   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned
Sunday that it could take a long time to find out who was behind
the attacks. She promised ``appropriate action'' against any
country or person found responsible.
	   The FBI and other U.S. agencies have sent teams to both Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam. If they can figure out what kind of explosives
were used and how, the FBI says it would be like finding the
bombers' ``fingerprints.''
	   The United States is a favorite target of militant Islamic
fundamentalists, such as the exiled Saudi financier Osama bin
Laden, one potential suspect.
	   It was not known who was behind the blasts. News media received
claims of responsibility in the name of the ``Islamic Army for the
Liberation of Holy Shrines'' and the ``Army for the Liberation of
Islamic Shrines.'' The claims could not be confirmed and may have
come from the same source.
	   Another favorite target _ Israel _ on Sunday offered the help of
Mossad and other intelligence agencies.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early signs were that the
attacks were the work of ``international terrorism centered on
Islamic fundamentalism.''
	   The Washington Post on Monday quoted an unidentified U.S.
Embassy official as saying the vehicle apparently containing the
bomb first drove to the embassy's main entrance but was sent by
guards to the rear, where the bomb exploded.
	   ``They saved people's lives by sending it around back,'' said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``If they hadn't
done that, I don't think I would be around today talking to you.''
	   The Post also reported that at least one hand grenade was used
to kill guards at the rear entrance. The main bomb exploded after
that attack, the newspaper said.
	   The Sunday Nation quoted a man who works for the environment
ministry, Ocheng Okwach, as saying he saw two men drive a yellow
pickup truck to the back of the embassy and jump out brandishing
machine-guns.
	   ``One man ran back into the vehicle as the other sprayed bullets
into the American Embassy,'' Okwach was quoted as saying.
	   It also quoted an unnamed security man as saying he'd seen three
people filming the embassy four days before the attack.
	   The Sunday Times of London, meanwhile, quoted Kenyan police
superintendent Mike Harries as saying witnesses saw a suicide
bomber drive a pickup truck into the car park behind the embassy
and sit there quietly until the blast.
	   Kenyans trying to go to work Monday had to deal with an obstacle
course. Traffic was diverted. Four badly damaged buildings were
cordoned off, and access to six others was restricted.
	   The Kenyan president's office said 4,877 people were injured in
Friday's blast; 542 were still hospitalized Monday, 24 in critical
condition.

Uganda denies Congolese charges of supporting rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more comments from rebel spokesman in grafs 9-11.

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A Ugandan official on Monday denied
charges from Congolese leaders that his country was supporting
Congo's Tutsi-led rebels with tanks and troops.
	   An adviser to President Yoweri Museveni, who refused to be
named, said the allegation by Congolese President Laurent Kabila
and his minister of information, Didier Mumengi, were ``childish
and wide of the mark.''
	   ``We have said very clearly there are no columns of any kind
marching anywhere in Congo,'' he said. ``Anyone can play these
childish games, throwing darts at everyone in the region.''
	   ``We categorically deny any involvement,'' he said.
	   Last week, the Congolese officials accused both Rwanda and
Uganda of invading Congo and fighting alongside the rebel forces
led by ethnic Tutsis.
	   The rebels, who have close ties both countries, were holding the
eastern towns of Uvira, Bukavu and Goma, as well as towns in the
far west of what was once Zaire.
	   In Goma, center of rebellion that toppled former dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko and installed Laurent Kabila as president in May 1996, a
rebel spokesman again denied any involvement by either Rwandans or
Ugandans.
	   Sylvain Mbuchi told The Associated Press Television the rebel
movement was nationwide and sought to topple Kabila from power
because he had failed to provide leadership and curb corruption,
and instead promoted his ethnic kin, Baluba from the southern
Katanga province, in power.
	   ``First we get rid of Kabila. Then the politicians meet and
decide what to do with the country,'' he said. ``We cannot go on
with the president who is monopolizing all the power.''
	   Mbuchi also denied Congolese allegations that the rebels were
killing their opponents.
	   ``We're not killing anyone. Why kill people? We're not Kabila,''
he said.
	   Despite its denials of involvement, the Rwandan government is
believed to be instrumental in providing some soldiers and
logistics to the rebels, who consist of ethnic Tutsis and their
Congolese allies.
	   In Kampala, the presidential advisor said the Congolese troops
had cooperated with Ugandan forces in operations against the
Ugandan rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces.
	   The rebels, believed to be hiding in thick forests of the
Rwenzori Mountains on the Ugandan-Congolese border, have killed
hundreds of Ugandans since 1996. They claim to be fighting against
Museveni, but most of their victims are civilians.
	   Museveni's advisor said he had no evidence as yet that the ADF
rebels had sided with the remnants of the Congolese troops in the
area.
	   He also said the rebels were known to have links with the former
Hutu soldiers and militiamen who had been launching attacks from
northeastern Congo inside Rwanda.
	   They are responsible for the 1994 Hutu government-organized
genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically
moderate Hutus. The killings ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power
in July 1994, forcing the Hutu fighters into exile.

Russian security service officer alleges Israeli informers
</HEADLINE>
uncovered &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A high-ranking regional security service officer
said Monday that his agency had uncovered a network of foreign
spies working under cover of an Israeli office maintaining contacts
with Jews in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, a news
agency reported.
	   Sergei Savchenkov, deputy head of the Federal Security Service
branch in Omsk, Siberia, said that the network had been uncovered
last year when a Russian defense plant worker admitted trading
information on the so-called Black Eagle tank to Israel's Nativ
agency, which has offices in Russia and Ukraine.
	   Nativ has been involved in ``an extremely perfidious operation
of secret services staged on Russia's territory,'' the ITAR-Tass
news agency quoted Savchenkov as saying.
	   A secretive unit run through the office of the Israeli prime
minister, Nativ was once responsible for gathering information in
the former Soviet Union, Israeli media have reported.
	   In March, reports surfaced in the Israeli daily Haaretz that the
heads of Israel's Mossad and Shin Bet intelligence agencies had
called for the closing of Nativ after a government watchdog said
the agency had squandered public funds, operated without
supervision and was waging a turf war with the other intelligence
organizations.
	   Other Israeli officials told the subcommittee that Nativ was
causing damage by maintaining unauthorized contacts with
politicians in the former Soviet Union and getting involved in
political issues, according to Haaretz.
	   Following the subcommittee report, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu appointed a committee to look into Nativ's
activities.

Tajikistan fortifies border amid reports of Taliban advance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 3rd graf with Russian border guard chief saying
patrols have been strengthened, in 6th graf with four Central Asian
nations considering joint action, TRIMS. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Tajikistan, with the help of Russian troops, was
reinforcing its border with Afghanistan on Monday to guard against
any spillover of the turmoil in northern Afghanistan, news reports
said Monday.
	   The Tajik government has been put on alert, and Tajik and
Russian troops were taking ``urgent measures'' to fortify the
border, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Russia has 25,000 troops stationed in Tajikistan to support the
government and guard the border, and patrols have been
strengthened, border guard chief Nikolai Reznichenko told the
Interfax news agency.
	   The measures followed reports that the ruling Taliban movement
has captured the biggest city in northern Afghanistan,
Mazar-e-Sharif, which is just 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the
Tajik border.
	   Afghanistan's anti-Taliban alliance claimed to have pushed its
Islamic opponents out of the city, but the reports could not be
independently confirmed.
	   Leaders of four ex-Soviet republics in Central Asia are
considering joint action to guard against any Taliban incursion
into their territories, Kazakstan Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart
Tokayev told Interfax.
	   Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakstan _ which border on
Afghanistan _ as well as nearby Kyrgyzstan,
	   have secular governments that are wary of the fundamentalist
Taliban and sympathetic to the opposition in northern Afghanistan.
	   Tajik Deputy Prime Minister Abdurakhmon Azimov told ITAR-Tass
that in some areas the Taliban have advanced to within 20 to 40
kilometers (12 to 25 miles) from the Tajik border.
	   The loss of Mazar-e-Sharif would be a severe blow to the
anti-Taliban opposition, backed into a dwindling corner of northern
Afghanistan, and a boost to the Taliban's four-year-old campaign to
impose their strict interpretation of Islamic rule on the entire
country.
	   Russia fears the entrenchment of a radical Islamic state in
Afghanistan would bring an influx of refugees and arms into the
former Soviet republics of Central Asia.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met
Monday with Serb and ethnic Albanian leaders, continuing
painstaking efforts to broker peace negotiations for war-torn
Kosovo province.
	   Hill, who for weeks has been trying to get ethnic Albanians to
unite in a negotiating team, met separately with pacifist ethnic
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and leading politician Mehmet
Hajrizi, who has close contacts with secessionist ethnic Albanian
rebels.
	   After meeting with Hill, Hajrizi said no substantial progress
had been made toward starting talks, but that he was in daily
telephone contact with rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Hill also met with Yugoslav Vice-Premier Nikola Sainovic.
	   ``I'm just here to see if I can help get a solution to this
terrible problem,'' Hill said after what he called a ``good
discussion'' with Rugova.
	   For five months, Serb troops have been fighting the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which seeks independence from the Serb republic
that dominates Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs in the
province 9-to-1.
	   While a heavy Serb offensive against the rebels apparently has
tapered off, sporadic clashes continued Monday in villages around
the province, with KLA rebels fighting to regain or hold positions.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources claimed fierce fighting around Djakovica
and the strategic western village of Junik, near the Albanian
border, where the KLA managed to hold its positions.
	   Serb officials said three KLA fighters were killed in a clash
with Serb police in the village of Dura, about 40 kilometers (25
miles) south of Pristina. Authorities there said the KLA attacked a
police patrol and police fired back.
	   Fighting also was reported to be intense along the
Djakovica-Decane road in the west, where Serb authorities said four
Serb policemen were killed on Sunday.
	   The Rugova-allied Kosovo Information Center also claimed close
fighting in the village of Erec, with four Albanians killed, houses
burned. Serbs suffered an undetermined number of casualties.
	   In another village, Skivjan, Serb forces reportedly gave an
ultimatum to the fighters and residents to give up their weapons
and surrender.
	   The ethnic Albanian center claimed some 15,000 civilians were
displaced from the two villages as a result of the developments.
	   According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the Serb
offensive has forced 167,000 people from their homes within Kosovo
since the conflict exploded in February, with the total of
displaced 231,000 including those who fled the province.
	   Hundreds have been killed, with thousands of others remaining in
the woods and hills, many of them without food or water.

Born of bitter experience, Israel team proves expertise in Nairobi

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A bomb-laden truck swerved into an Israeli army
post in south Lebanon and exploded 15 years ago, collapsing a
building and killing 29 Israeli soldiers inside.
	   Out of such grim experience was born the Israeli military's
crack Search and Rescue Unit, made up of soldiers, doctors and
sniffer dogs.
	   The team honed a reputation for readiness to rush to the rescue
to almost any corner of the earth _ and proved it anew at the scene
of the Nairobi bombing.
	   Arriving the day after Friday's embassy bombing in Nairobi, the
Israeli unit went straight from the airport to the blast site and
plucked at least three survivors and 26 bodies from the rubble.
	   The unit's resume is impressive. It was sent to search for
survivors of earthquakes in the 1980s in Mexico City and in the
then-Soviet republic of Armenia, the 1992 bombing of the Israeli
Embassy in Buenos Aires and the 1994 Rwandan civil war.
	   For the Israeli rescuers, most of them reservists, the Nairobi
operation was a ``mitzvah,'' a good deed required by Jewish law.
	   ``It's good for us and good for everybody. It shows that we are
for anybody who needs us, and we can really help them,'' said Ilan
Cytron, a 25-year-old law student who helped lead a mother and son
from the rubble Sunday.
	   But the unit doesn't allow its good deeds to speak for
themselves. The army is savvy about courting the media, inviting
journalists to travel with the team, handing out photos and
videotapes of rescuers and dropping its normal reluctance to allow
interviews with soldiers involved in an ongoing operation.
	   The rescuers may help polish Israel's image at a time when Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is being criticized in
some quarters for hard-line policies that have crippled the
Arab-Israeli peace process.
	   As soon as he heard of the blast, Netanyahu offered help to both
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
	   Israeli ties with Kenya have long been close. Israel used
Nairobi as a refueling stop and fallback base in the daring July
1976 Entebbe rescue, in which Israeli commandos freed hijacked
prisoners held by Palestinians in Uganda.
	   The Israeli team's ability to move fast and sleep rough is an
outgrowth of the country's military doctrine, one that relies on
citizen soldiers to drop what they're doing and be at their posts
within 24 hours.
	   The 85-member rescue unit is headed by a reserve colonel, Udi
Ben Uri, 43, who manages a stone quarry in civilian life. He was
vacationing in Holland with his three children when he got the call
to go to Nairobi.
	   ``It's a mitzvah to save human beings, but we don't do it
because of that, or the publicity. We do it because that's what we
are trained to do. Our services are needed worldwide, and that's
what we do best,'' Ben Uri said.
	   The rescuers use a number of specialized tools, including
inflatable pillows that are inserted into the rubble and filled
with air to raise it up.
	   ``It's not the machinery and the tools,'' said Liran Golan, a
reserve lieutenant who just returned from Nairobi. ``It's the basic
willingness to travel and help.''

Israel raids guerrilla hideout after militiaman killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Israeli air raid, Hezbollah bombing
kills pro-Israeli militiaman. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked a suspected
guerrilla hideout Monday in southern Lebanon after guerrillas
killed a pro-Israeli militiaman, security officials said.
	   At least two Israeli jets fired four missiles on the hills of
Masghara in the western Bekaa Valley, a region long used by
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas to launch attacks on Israeli
troops in southern Lebanon, the officials said.
	   Black smoke billowed from the area, but there was no immediate
word on casualties, said the Lebanese officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The raid came just hours after Hezbollah guerrillas killed an
Israeli-allied militiaman in a roadside bomb explosion on the edge
of the Israeli-occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah said in a statement that its fighters detonated a
roadside bomb on the outskirts of the Christian town of Jezzine as
a patrol of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia passed
by.
	   The security officials said one SLA militiaman was killed.
	   Hezbollah has led the fight to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers
and 2,500 allied SLA militiamen from southern Lebanon. Israel set
up the enclave in 1985 to try to protect against cross-border
guerrilla raids.
	   Earlier Monday, guerrillas fired more than 20 Katyusha rockets
in southern Lebanon, many of which landed near Lebanon's border
with Israel. No casualties were reported.
	   The rockets apparently were fired from a site close to Yater, a
Shiite Muslim village near the frontier, the security officials
said.
	   Israeli radio stations reported that three roadside bombs
exploded overnight as Israeli patrols were passing.
	   They said that several vehicles were slightly damaged and that
one Israeli soldier was treated for shock.

Russian official: Russia, China to cooperate in weapons design
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and China will work together on designing
weapons, a high-ranking Russian military official said Monday,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Col.-Gen. Valery Manilov, deputy chief of the Russian General
Staff, led a delegation to China in July. He told ITAR-Tass that
the two countries had agreed to shift their focus from arms exports
to cooperative military research and development.
	   During the visit, the two sides also agreed that more Chinese
army officers would be trained in Russian academies.

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ One of the worst heat waves in decades in
Cyprus killed 13 people Monday and forced hundreds to seek
treatment for heat exhaustion in packed hospital wards.
	   The deaths raised to 48 the number of people killed since
Friday. More than 1,000 people, most of them elderly, have sought
medical treatment in recent days.
	   Temperatures hit 43 degrees Celisius (110 Fahrenheit) inland _
the highest recorded in 40 years. The temperatures are five degrees
higher than average for the beginning of August, said Andreas
Philaniotis, director of the Government Weather Bureau.
	   Philaniotis predicted the weather on the eastern Mediterranean
island would cool off in the next two days.
	   Many of the elderly stricken by the heat were living in
privately run nursing homes that lacked air conditioning, Health
Minister Christos Solomis said.
	   The heat wave has coincided with the peak tourist season, when
about 500,000 foreigners visit the island.

Arming and ready to fight, Kinshasa prepares for battle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Fingers on triggers, soldiers roam along
Kinshasa's rutted June 30th Boulevard. A clattering tank pushes
down a side street and troop trucks rumble past.
	   Blocks away on a dirt patch in front of the city's main stadium,
thousands of young men and women howl for blood and offer to fight.
	   ``The people must arm themselves to repel the aggressors,''
President Laurent Kabila says in slow, deliberate words.
	   Caught up in a war of guns and words against Tutsi rebels and
their alleged Rwandan and Ugandan allies, Kinshasa is arming for
battle.
	   Kabila, a former rebel leader who came to power in May 1997,
says the latest week-old rebellion in the eastern Kivu region and
Congo's west is the work of Rwanda and more recently Uganda.
	   Although both countries insist they have nothing to do with the
revolt, Kabila's nationalist rhetoric broadcast repeatedly on state
radio and television is striking a chord with Kinshasa's
disenchanted population.
	   ``Those people want the entire Congo to be their colony, they
want to dominate central Africa,'' Kabila says in a radio
broadcast. ``A defense force to be called the People's Self Defense
force will be set up and weapons will be distributed.''
	   Over the weekend, as many as five thousand men and women
enlisted in militia units and the army with a vow to defend
Kinshasa.
	   Dancing and chanting slogans against the Tutsis, a mob of
would-be recruits pledge to take the war to Rwanda.
	   Brewing enmities with Rwanda are fueling support for Kabila's
new war, despite widespread resentment toward his regime _ which
many critics say has done little to help the people of Congo
through his 14 months in power.
	   The move, part propaganda to whip up support against Rwanda and
part defensive pragmatism, comes as Kabila struggles to regroup his
military.
	   Before the rebellion, Rwandan troops who earlier had been in
support of Kabila formed the corps of Congo's elite forces. Kabila
ordered them out of the country without explanation late last
month.
	   Congo's former chief army commander, Rwandan James Kabari, was
fired by Kabila and now appears to be leading the rebellion.
	   With many of his loyalist troops leaving Kinshasa and heading to
the front lines in the east and west, Kinshasa's defense may be
left to the paramilitary police and the public.
	   Kabila says his forces have launched counteroffensives near the
eastern city of Bukavu and the western oil port of Muanda.
	   In Kinshasa, more and more civilians are pledging to take up
arms. Some already have, wielding machete knives and toting AK-47
assault rifles.
	   ``I'm ready to fight for Congo,'' says Patience Yowa, a
soft-spoken government bureaucrat.
	   A protocol officer in the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yowa
believes Kinshasa residents will defend their city to the death.
	   ``I want to see the day when we plant our flag on Rwandan
soil,'' she said with a smile, while hanging laundry out to dry in
her yard.
	   Kabila's call to arms, however, could turn Kinshasa into a
dangerous place.
	   Arms and poverty, an opposition politician says, are a volatile
combination.
	   Despite pledges of economic renewal after years of
``kleptocracy'' and decay under dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, Kinshasa
and the whole of Congo remains a dramatically poor country.
	   The vast majority of young men are jobless. Those who do have
work say they support Kabila's war only because they believe Rwanda
is invading their country.
	   ``If it's the Rwandans who are doing this, then if we must all
die to stop them, we will all die,'' says Alomo Aron a
self-employed carpenter.

	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ At least 10 suspected militants and three
Indian soldiers were killed in fighting Monday in troubled Kashmir,
where a general strike imposed by a pro-separatist group shut down
offices, shops and businesses.
	   The All Party Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella group of
separatist organizations, called the strike after the death of a
top militant commander, Burhanuddin Hijazi of the Hizbul
Mujahideen, on Sunday. Cars, buses and trucks stayed off the roads.
	   The Hurriyat accused the police of executing Hijazi while he was
in custody. Police claimed the guerrilla commander was killed in a
battle when they raided his hide-out in Srinagar, the summer
capital of Jammu-Kashmir state.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, which is
divided between them. Militants in the Indian-controlled part of
the territory want to secede or unite with Muslim Pakistan. The
Indian part of Kashmir is the country's only state with an Islamic
majority.
	   Brigadier A.K. Chopra, an army spokesman, said 10 suspected
militants and three soldiers were killed in fierce clashes in two
villages in the Kashmir Valley on Monday. Four of the militants
were Pakistani nationals, he said, and at least 20 houses were
destroyed in the firing.
	   In Anantnag in northwestern Kashmir, four people were killed and
20 injured when the bus they were traveling in was caught in cross
fire between security troops and militants, police said. But
survivors said government soldiers shot at them because they were
mistaken for militants.
	   Two among the injured are reported to be in critical condition.
	   In another incident outside Srinagar, unidentified gunmen shot
dead three people, one of them a six-month old infant, police said.
	   An army major was killed near Zojila pass, 130 kilometers (80
miles) northeast of Srinagar, while trying to defuse an improvised
explosive device planted by suspected militants, Chopra said.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Deploying additional troops from
Kinshasa, Congo has launched twin offensives in the east and west
where Tutsi rebels have captured several key towns, the information
minister said Monday.
	   Congo vowed not only to retake its lost territory, but also to
march all the way to the Rwanda capital, Information Minister
Didier Mumengi told reporters.
	   ``We have been reinforcing our positions and know that we will
take the war as far as Kigali,'' Mumengi said of the Rwandan
capital.
	   He said fighting in the eastern Kivu region centered around the
area surrounding the city of Bukavu near the Rwandan border. Trucks
filled with government troops, meanwhile, rumbled out of Kinshasa
on Monday on their way to reinforce fighters in western Congo near
the Atlantic coastline.
	   State-controlled radio said President Laurent Kabila had ordered
the reinforcements for a push to retake several small towns in the
west, including the oil town of Muanda.
	   Rebel Tutsis have captured strategic towns in both the west,
about 250 kilometers (150 miles) southwest of Kinshasa, and to the
east in Kivu as part of their week-old uprising against Kabila.
	   The government says Rwanda instigated the rebellion and is
fighting alongside Tutsi rebels. On Sunday, Mumengi also accused
Uganda of sending soldiers and tanks into Congo in support of the
Tutsi fighters.
	   Rwanda has repeatedly denied the charge, but warns it will hit
back if attacked and says it is contemplating a preemptive strike
against Congo.
	   Uganda on Monday dismissed Kabila's charges.
	   An adviser to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who refused to
be named, said the allegations were ``childish and wide of the
mark.''
	   ``We have said very clearly there are no columns of any kind
marching anywhere in Congo,'' he said. ``Anyone can play these
childish games, throwing darts at everyone in the region.''
	   Yet Mumengi on Sunday said two columns of Ugandan forces,
including tanks and trucks filled with soldiers, had invaded Congo.
	   He also accused Rwanda of executing captured Congolese officers
and of rounding up civilians in the Kivu region.
	   The charges could not be independently confirmed.
	   Tutsi gunmen with close ties to Rwanda launched an offensive a
week ago in Kivu, vowing to topple Kabila's 14-month-old regime.
Within the first few days of their uprising, the rebels captured
several key cities near the Rwandan border, including Goma and
Bukavu.
	   Congo's government, meanwhile, appears to be gearing up for a
protracted fight, recruiting militia fighters in Kinshasa.
	   Weekend talks in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, showed little sign of
easing tensions between the feuding neighbors, but a team of
officials from the Organization of African Unity arrived in
Kinshasa late Sunday in hopes of convincing all sides to stand down
their forces.
	   ``The war is not finished but it is more calm now,'' said OAU
representative Mamadou Bah. ``I'm in Kinshasa now but I have to go
on to Kampala, Kigali and Dar es Salaam for further talks.''

Belarus' Lukashenko scouts out housing for evicted diplomats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko
went hunting on Monday for appropriate housing for the foreign
ambassadors he evicted from their diplomatic residences earlier
this summer.
	   His scouting mission turned up 20 places, state radio reported.
It said that if the ambassadors refuse Lukashenko's picks, they'll
have to go house-hunting on their own.
	   Lukashenko's government told ambassadors in June that they would
have to leave their diplomatic compound on the outskirts of Minsk
so that urgent repairs could be made to the water and sewage
systems.
	   The ambassadors countered that under the Vienna Convention on
diplomatic relations, Belarus has no right to force them out for
any reason.
	   Lukashenko then claimed that the compound, located down the
street from his own home, was part of the presidential residence.
	   Ambassadors from several countries, including the United States,
were recalled to their home capitals for consultations to protest.
The European Union and nearly a dozen other countries have imposed
travel restrictions on Belarusian officials over the housing
dispute.

2,000 new cases of tuberculosis in prisons this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two thousand prison inmates have contracted
tuberculosis so far this year, fueling the growth of one of
Russia's most pressing public health problems, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Monday.
	   The number of TB patients in prisons has increased by 60 percent
over the past three years, and now stands at 76,000, ITAR-Tass
said, citing prison authorities.
	   Three international health organizations appealed to President
Boris Yeltsin last week to step up the fight against the spread of
drug-resistant tuberculosis. Their letter noted that as many as 40
percent of TB cases in Russian prisons involved drug-resistant
strains of the disease.
	   The tuberculosis bacteria is airborne and must be treated by
antibiotics for up to six months. If a patient fails to complete
the treatment course, the bacteria can develop resistance to the
drug and people infected later will have a harder time overcoming
it.

Italian prosecutor summons outspoken Roma coach

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Juventus suing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian prosecutor has summoned the coach of AS
Roma, Zdenek Zeman, to hear his allegations that a number of top
league Italian soccer players may use performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Zeman, a Czech, will meet Wednesday with prosecutor Raffaele
Guariniello in Turin, a day after questioning in Rome by officials
of the Italian Olympic Committee.
	   Guariniello has been investigating doping in sports for several
years, as well as other health-related issues.
	   ``I'm at everyone's disposal for the good of soccer,'' Zeman was
quoted Monday as saying in Gazzetta dello Sport, the Italian sports
daily.
	   In interviews with several newspapers and the newsweekly
Espresso over the past days, Zeman said he was amazed by the quick
muscular development of some players such as Alessandro Del Piero
and Gianluca Vialli.
	   Zeman never mentioned doping substances openly. He always
referred to medicines.
	   Del Piero, a Juventus star, instructed his agent to sue for
libel. Juventus president, Vittorio Chiusano, announced later
Monday that the team would also sue Zemen to ``safeguard the
reputation of Juventus and that of its coaches and players.''
	   Vialli, a former player of Juventus and currently Chelsea's
player-coach in the English Premier League, angrily said Zeman is a
``terrorist trying to destabilize the soccer world.''

Thousands join Benazir Bhutto in protest against dam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Thousands of people drove their cars
alongside Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto on Monday as
she protested against plans to build a dam she says would
disproportionately benefit one of Pakistan's four provinces.
	   Thousands set out from different parts of Pakistan to join
Bhutto for an anti-government rally scheduled later Monday at
Ubauro, a Sindh province town on the border with Punjab province
about 700 kilometers (about 400 miles) south of the capital,
Islamabad.
	   Bhutto and other opposition politicians have said the dam and
hydroelectric project on the Indus River would benefit the northern
province of Punjab at the expense of Pakistan's three other
provinces.
	   Punjab is home to 60 percent of the country's 140 million people
and the home province of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
	   ``We are not against Punjab, but against a clique ruling the
country,'' Khurshid Shah, a leader of Bhutto's Pakistan People's
Party, said as her procession started in Ghotki, a village 550
kilometers (341 miles) north of the Sindh capital of Karachi.
	   In another anti-dam procession Monday in North West Frontier
Province, dozens of men fired protest shots with Kalashnikov rifles
in the direction of Punjab province from Attock bridge on the
border of the two provinces _ some 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of
Islamabad. At least two protesters were critically wounded when hit
by stray bullets.
	   The dam is expected to flood hundreds of acres (hectares) of
farm land in Northwest Frontier Province. In Sindh province,
farmers fear their water supply will dry up, and Balochistan,
Pakistan's fourth province, has joined the protests to show its
support of the other smaller provinces.
	   The dam was first proposed in 1953, but successive governments
delayed construction in because of strong opposition. Sharif
announced in June his government would go ahead, but later said he
would not build the dam before building national consensus.
	   Sharif says the dam will generate much-needed electricity and
irrigate dry land.

Turkish consortium gets Turkmen electricity export rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Turkish consortium has won the rights to export
Turkmenistan's excess electricity, a news agency reported Monday.
	   The consortium, known by the acronym CTFA, plans to carry
electricity to Turkey, Iran and Pakistan, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   Turkmenistan has some 7 billion surplus kilowatt-hours of
electricity each year. At present, only neighboring Kazakstan is
buying electricity from Turkmenistan, and it needs only 1 billion
kilowatt-hours annually, ITAR-Tass said.
	   CTFA will accelerate construction of a 320-kilometer (200-mile)
power line from Nebitdag, Turkmenistan, to Ali-Abad, Iran. Next
year, Iran and Turkey will start building power lines to link the
countries' energy systems.
	   CTFA will also build a power line from Turkmenistan to Pakistan,
via Afghanistan, the news agency reported.

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTOWN, St. Kitts and Nevis (AP) _ Defying international
pleas, residents of the seven-mile-long (11-kilometer-long)
Carribean island of Nevis voted Monday on whether to create the
smallest nation in the Western hemisphere.
	   Many said they would follow Premier Vance Amory's advice to ``do
the right thing'' so that Nevisians can take their ``place in the
sun, in the international community.''
	   ``It's going to be a big party'' on the mountainous patch of
green if secessionists win, said mason Trevor Browne, 23, after
voting at the octagon-shaped Methodist Church built in Gingerland
village in 1830 by British colonizers.
	   When the islands became independent in 1983, Nevis, population
9,000, reluctantly joined in a federation with neighboring St.
Kitts, population 32,000. But Nevisians insisted on a
constitutional clause allowing them to break away.
	   After years of complaining they are treated like second-class
citizens by the federal government on St. Kitts, they are invoking
that right with a referendum that needs a two-thirds majority to
pass.
	   Amory, the force behind the independence drive, urged citizens
to ignore nay-sayers who warned the tiny island cannot sustain
itself in a global economy.
	   ``Small is not an indication of capability,'' Amory insisted at
a rally Sunday night, noting Nevis runs most of its own affairs
already.
	   ``Nevis is not ready for secession,'' countered opposition
leader Joseph Parry of the Nevis Reform Movement. ``The people
aren't ready, neither economically nor politically nor
psychologically.''
	   St. Kitts and Nevis, with a combined population of 41,000, is
already the smallest nation in the Western hemisphere. The prospect
of another micro-state didn't encourage Caribbean officials, who
privately said the island could find itself at the mercy of global
drug cartels with far greater resources.
	   The United States has urged secessionists to reconsider.
	   Even as people were voting, the Commonwealth of Britain and its
former colonies appealed to them to think again. ``In my view,
secession would have a damaging effect both on the prospects for
Nevis and for the region as a whole,'' Commonwealth
Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku said in a statement.

Rios back atop ATP rankings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marcelo Rios took over the No. 1 ranking on the
ATP tour from Pete Sampras for the second time this year Monday.
	   Rios regained the top spot when Sampras lost to Andre Agassi in
the quarterfinals at the du Maurier Open last week. Sampras needed
to win that event to maintain his ranking.
	   In March, Rios became the first South American to reach No. 1
since the computerized rankings started in 1973. The 22-year-old
Chilean, who has yet to win a Grand Slam tournament, ended Sampras'
102-week reign at the top.
	   But Rios injured an elbow the next week and lost the top ranking
to Sampras when he pulled out of the Monte Carlo Open in April.
	   Before Rios reached No. 1, the highest-ranked South American was
Argentina's Guillermo Vilas, who was No. 2 in 1975.

Bangladesh border police to keep Indian Bengalis from entering
</HEADLINE>
Bangladesh &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh has ordered it border police
to stop Bengali speaking Indians from entering its territory, an
official said Monday.
	   The order was passed following reports that India's Maharashtra
state planned to deport Bengali speakers who could not prove their
Indian citizenship, on the charge that they were illegal migrants
from Bangladesh.
	   Many poor Bangladeshis cross into India to look for jobs.
	   Official in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, said border guards
would push back any person or group entering the country without
valid travel documents.
	   Bangladesh shares a 4,000-kilometer (2,500-mile) border with
India guarded by 600 border posts.

State radio reports second massacre in Angola in three weeks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ More than 150 people have been killed near
the northeastern town of Caombo in the second massacre in the area
in three weeks, Angolan state radio reported Monday.
	   The radio said the massacre close to Caombo, 250 miles (400
kilometers east of Luanda), took place on Saturday and was the work
of the former rebel movement UNITA.
	   No other details were given and independent confirmation of the
report was not immediately possible.
	   UNITA was blamed for a massacre at the nearby town of Bula on
July 21 in which at least 100 people were killed. A United Nations
team found there was no conclusive evidence to identify the
attackers.
	   The latest massacre is likely to further fuel fears that Angola
is on the brink of relapsing into war.
	   About 500,000 people died in a civil war between UNITA and
government troops that broke out immediately after independence
from Portugal in 1976. It raged for nearly two decades before a
U.N.-brokered accord established a fragile peace in 1994.
	   UNITA, which denied responsibility for the Bula massacre, has
long been criticized for stalling on the accord. Last week,
however, it promised a special U.N. envoy that it would relaunch
the faltering peace process.
	   The government of President Eduardo Dos Santos also promised the
envoy to halt a hostile propaganda campaign against UNITA.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rescuers buoyed by the sound of tapping
Monday heaved pieces of rubble aside in a desperate effort to get
to survivors of the U.S. Embassy bombing. Police investigating the
twin bombing at the embassy in Tanzania detained several people.
	   As U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced a dlrs 2
million reward for information leading to the conviction of ``the
cowards that committed this act,'' the hunt for the terrorists and
the search for victims intensified.
	   Eleven Americans who had come to Kenya in peace began their last
journey home in coffins Monday. A 12th American, married to a
Kenyan, will be buried in her adopted homeland.
	   But the vast majority of the more than 200 dead and nearly 5,000
injured in both bombings were Kenyans. An overwhelming sense of
stunned grief gripped this east African country, and over and over
again Kenyans asked, why here?
	   In the first confirmed detentions in either country, Assistant
Police Commissioner Wilson Mwansasu announced that ``there were
some suspects arrested ... in different parts of Dar es Salaam.''
The suspects were ``connected to others,'' he said, but refused to
elaborate.
	   In Washington, however, the State Department downplayed the
significance of the arrests.
	   Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice said
about a dozen people had been detained for questioning in ``a
routine roundup'' and told reporters ``don't attach too much
importance to it.''
	   Mwansasu refused to identify the nationalities of those
arrested. But another U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Sudanese and Iraqi citizens were among those
detained.
	   The Daily Mail newspaper in Dar es Salaam reported Monday that
an Arab man was arrested Saturday at the Tanzanian border crossing
at Namanga, where he was trying to cross into Kenya. The paper said
the man boarded a domestic flight from Dar es Salaam to Kilimanjaro
Airport after Friday's bombing, checked into a guest house in
nearby Arusha, and spent the rest of the day praying at a local
mosque.
	   The United States is a favorite target of militant Islamic
fundamentalists, such as the exiled Saudi financier Osama bin
Laden, one potential suspect.
	   It was not known who was behind the blasts. News media received
claims of responsibility in the name of the ``Islamic Army for the
Liberation of Holy Shrines'' and the ``Army for the Liberation of
Islamic Shrines.'' The claims could not be confirmed and may have
come from the same source.
	   U.S., Kenyan and Tanzanian investigators were maintaining a very
low profile.
	   ``We will not confirm or deny the existence of evidence in this
criminal inquiry,'' said an American diplomat in Dar es Salaam, who
briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
	   Israel army radio, in a report from Nairobi, said investigators
suspect the bombers used the plastic explosive Semtex.
	   Army Maj. Gen. George Agoi, who is in charge of Kenyan
operation, said he had not discussions with the Americans.
	   ``The Americans are here handling their side and we are handling
our side,'' he said.
	   The powerful blast in the busy business district of downtown
Nairobi destroyed a building next door to the embassy and damaged
others blocks away. The damage in Tanzania was far less because the
embassy is in a residential area.
	   When asked whether the rescue effort might have destroyed
evidence at the bombing site in Nairobi, U.S. officials said it was
inevitable because of the rescue effort.
	   ``Obviously the first priority is finding people alive and then
to recover bodies,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf. ``I
think that you find that dilemma anywhere.''
	   On Monday, three cranes and two bulldozers lifted chunks of
rubble from the collapsed Ufundi Cooperative House next to the
embassy, where weary Israeli rescuers said they heard tapping in
the morning.
	   ``There is an unseen frenzy on the rubble,'' said Nina Galbe,
spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross. ``As
long as there is the slightest chance of any person being found
alive, every moment up there is precious. We can't stop until the
last stone is unturned.''
	   The Israelis said the tapping spurred them on in their search
for a woman named Rose, who last spoke to rescue workers Sunday
afternoon. Another woman named Jane hasn't been heard from for much
longer.
	   Titus Ngwele, Red Cross coordinator at the scene, said the
Israelis sank a microphone late Monday afternoon to check whether
Rose was breathing.
	   ``They weren't sure whether she was or not. She hasn't spoken
today. But they're still working to get her out and still hoping
that she's alive,'' he said.
	   Three days after the bombing, however, the only victims being
pulled out of the rubble were dead.
	   By late Monday evening, the Red Cross had taken 16 bodies to the
central morgue, Galbe said.
	   More than 300 students from the University of Nairobi held a
candlelight vigil in front of the bombed embassy Monday night,
singing, ``When the Saints go Marching In'' and ``Hakuna Mungu Kama
Wewe,'' a Swahili song meaning ``There Is No Other God Like You.''
Many carried roses and palm fronds.
	   ``We are mourning our fellow Kenyans killed in the blast,'' said
Harris Ojenge, who is studying to be a teacher.
	   According to the latest Kenyan government figures, 192 people
died in the Nairobi bombing, including 12 Americans, and 4,877 were
injured; 542 were still hospitalized Monday, 24 in critical
condition.
	   Rice, the U.S. assistant secretary of state, told CNN the death
toll would have been far higher if the bombers in Nairobi had
achieved their goal _ getting into the embassy's underground
parking garage. The bomb exploded in a parking lot behind the
embassy.
	   In Dar es Salaam, nine Tanzanians and one Kenyan died in the
bombing and 74 people were injured. The U.S. diplomat said Monday
there would possibly be an 11th victim, a Tanzanian.
	   At the morgue of Muhimbili teaching hospital, grieving families
began receiving the remains of the victims after U.S. investigators
examined the bodies and released them one by one.
	   ``We had to wait for so long ... for the investigators to review
the bodies to try to find those responsible, but we still believe
it was necessary and for a good cause,'' said Harun Mahundi,
Tanzania's former police inspector general. His brother, Ramadani
Mahundi, an embassy guard, was killed in the blast.
	   There were tears at the morgue and tears at Nairobi airport as
the bodies of the 11 Americans left Kenya.
	   As each aluminum coffin was lifted into the military transport
plane, U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell covered her heart with her
right hand _ still bandaged from the injuries she suffered in the
blast.
	   U.S. troops saluted farewell as American and Kenyan flags
fluttered in a soft breeze sweet with the perfume of grass and
acacia trees.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A bomb-laden truck swerved into an Israeli army
post in south Lebanon and exploded 15 years ago, collapsing a
building and killing 29 Israeli soldiers inside.
	   Out of such grim experience was born the Israeli military's
crack Search and Rescue Unit, made up of soldiers, doctors and
sniffer dogs.
	   The team honed a reputation for readiness to rush to the rescue
to almost any corner of the earth _ and proved it anew at the scene
of the Nairobi bombing.
	   Arriving the day after Friday's embassy bombing in Nairobi, the
Israeli unit went straight from the airport to the blast site and
plucked at least three survivors and 26 bodies from the rubble.
	   The unit's resume is impressive. It was sent to search for
survivors of earthquakes in the 1980s in Mexico City and in the
then-Soviet republic of Armenia, the 1992 bombing of the Israeli
Embassy in Buenos Aires and the 1994 Rwandan civil war.
	   For the Israeli rescuers, most of them reservists, the Nairobi
operation was a ``mitzvah,'' a good deed required by Jewish law.
	   ``It's good for us and good for everybody. It shows that we are
for anybody who needs us, and we can really help them,'' said Ilan
Cytron, a 25-year-old law student who helped lead a mother and son
from the rubble Sunday.
	   But the unit doesn't allow its good deeds to speak for
themselves. The army is savvy about courting the media, handing out
photos and videotapes of rescuers and dropping its normal
reluctance to allow interviews with soldiers involved in an ongoing
operation.
	    &UR; The rescuers may ... pickup para 9 pvs.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ More than 150 people have been killed near
the northeastern town of Caombo, the second massacre in the area in
three weeks, Angolan state radio reported Monday.
	   The radio said Saturday's massacre close to Caombo, 250 miles

Report: Netanyahu, opposition inching closer to coalition deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
reportedly inching closer to a deal that would bring Israel's main
opposition party into his government, a move which could help move
the Mideast peace process forward.
	   Israel TV reported that Netanyahu has held four secret meetings
recently with Labor party leader Ehud Barak to hammer out the
details of an alliance which would leave out the far-right and
religious parties that dominate Netanyahu's government now.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said the two men have
discussed the possibility of a unity government in meetings but
that talks were not conclusive.
	   ``They didn't reach any final agreement,'' Bushinsly told The
Associated Press. Barak would not comment on the reports.
	   Israel TV said any deal is contingent on Netanyahu carrying out
a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank, a
commitment the Israeli leader made to the Palestinians in a
previous peace accord.
	   Netanyahu and Barak battle each other publicly over internal
policy and the peace process but the two men have a long shared
history and are said to maintain a good relationship in private.
	   Israel TV said Barak would serve as deputy prime minister and
defense minister under Netanyahu and Labor would be secured six or
seven ministerial positions, including a slot for former prime
minister Shimon Peres, who narrowly lost to Netanyahu in 1996.
	   But senior Labor leaders such as Yossi Beilin, who
unsuccessfully challenged Barak for the party leadership, said such
a unity government between the country's two main parties was
unlikely under Netanyahu.
	   ``Bibi is undoubtedly the worst prime minister Israel has ever
had, and a national unity government is still a Netanyahu
government,'' Beilin said, referring to the premier by his
nickname.
	   Netanyahu's current coalition government is made up of several
small but powerful parties with strong religious or far-right views
and Netanyahu has found himself caught between their demands and
Israeli commitments to go advance the peace process with the
Palestinians.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rebel gunmen leading a charge to oust
President Laurent Kabila attacked the small village of Yumbi, just
40 kilometers (24 miles) south of the capital of Kinshasa,
state-controlled television reported Monday.
	   Few details of the battle were provided, but National
Radio-Television said several Congolese troops were wounded and a
number of Tutsi rebels were killed.
	   The scale of the fighting was unclear, but rebel forces withdrew
after the fight, the broadcast said, quoting civilians from the
area.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   The nearby fighting comes as Congo moved to deploy additional
troops to reinforce twin offensives in the east and west of the
country, where Tutsi rebels have captured several key towns, the
information minister said Monday.

Fire forces evacuation of houses on British base

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with fire contained &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A fire fanned by strong winds off the sea
forced the evacuation Monday of 80 houses on a British base in
southwestern Cyprus, officials said.
	   The fire was contained after burning for about 12 hours, the
Cyprus fire brigade said.
	   No one was injured, but houses, stores and vehicles belonging to
British servicemen were damaged, Cypriot police said.
	   About 300 servicemen and a Royal Air Force helicopter along with
four Cypriot fire engines fought the blaze at the British base of
Episkopi, said Mervyn Wynne Jones, a base spokesman.
	   Eighty houses were evacuated, mainly as a precaution. But the
fire did cause smoke damage to some of the houses, he said.
	   Britain retained two sovereign base areas on the island when
Cyprus gained its independence from British colonial rule in 1960.
Both are on the southern coast. About 4,000 people, including
servicemen's families, live on the Episkopi base.
	   Cyprus has recorded some of the hottest temperatures this month
in more than 40 years. Police said strong winds off the eastern
Mediterranean Sea fed the flames.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sammy Ng'ang'a took stock.
	   In the blackness, he could see nothing but knew his left leg was
pinned _ broken, it later turned out.
	   Blood poured down his face from deep gashes on his forehead and
tongue. Some teeth were missing.
	   He patted his pockets. Nothing but some matches.
	   He fired one up and looked around.
	   Only moments before, the 48-year-old scrap metal dealer had been
visiting a friend next door to the American Embassy in downtown
Nairobi. Then everything exploded.
	   Now he was trapped in a small clearing near a stairwell at the
edge of a gaping hole. A wire cable dangled nearby.
	   The clearing was no more than 4 feet high and a few feet across.
The match's flicker didn't reach to the bottom of the hole.
	   Ng'ang'a freed his leg and grabbed the cable to haul himself
away from the hole. Then he rolled his coat into a pillow and
drifted off to sleep, never doubting help would come.
	   When it did, in the form of a crack Israeli rescue team calling
out for anyone alive, he was startled to hear another voice nearby:
a woman's.
	   ``Amesema nini?'' she asked in Swahili. ``What did he say?''
	   ``They are trying to save us,'' he told her.
	   Ng'ang'a spent 36 hours trapped in the rubble, but he never lost
hope. And he did his best to see that the woman still known to the
world only as Rose didn't either.
	   He was perfect for the job. A cheerful stoic, Ng'ang'a came
across as the plucky kind of fellow who takes what life dishes out
without whimpering. He accepts _ and survives.
	   When he realized his plight, Ng'ang'a said, his thoughts turned
to stories he'd read about people trapped for days in collapsed
buildings.
	   By his reckoning, he said, his rescuers were early.
	   ``I was expecting to wait two or three days,'' he said from his
hospital bed Monday as the search for the now-silent Rose grew more
desperate.
	   Crews last heard Rose speak at 3 p.m. Sunday, but tapping was
heard inside the wreckage early Monday, raising hopes that she and
another woman identified by the Red Cross as Jane might still be
found alive.
	   Friday morning, Ng'ang'a had dropped by the Ufundi Cooperative
House to see a business associate. The friend's office was on the
ground floor, perhaps 60 feet (20 meters) from the embassy across a
parking lot.
	   Around 10:30 a.m. they heard a boom. People rushed to the
windowed corridor facing the embassy to see what had happened.
	   They heard what sounded like a short burst of machine-gun fire.
Seconds later the world around them blew up.
	   At least a dozen people were in front of Ng'ang'a and took the
force of the blast. ``I was lucky,'' he said. ``I was not hit
directly.''
	   But he was trapped, bleeding and alone. By the time he heard the
first voices, Ng'ang'a had lost all track of time _ an hour seemed
like days. It was Saturday.
	   ``Is anybody alive?'' someone called.
	   Ng'ang'a first thought he was dreaming. Then he cried out:
``Yes! Yes! Yes!''
	   ``What's your name?'' they shouted.
	   They heard me, he thought.
	   ``Ng'ang'a!''
	   Over and over they called his name and he replied to help them
find him.
	   That's when Rose first spoke.
	   She wanted water, Ng'ang'a said, and she was frantic to get out.
She asked to be the first one rescued.
	   But Rose and Jane were trapped in a much more difficult section
of wreckage. The Israelis could reach Ng'ang'a; they couldn't reach
the women.
	   Ng'ang'a tried to reassure Rose: ``If I go, I said, they will
come next for you.''
	   Hours went by as the Israelis tunneled through the wrecked
four-story building.
	   The work was painstaking. One wrong move and the rubble could
collapse further, crushing the survivors.
	   Ng'ang'a couldn't tell how far away Rose was from him. They
didn't talk about their injuries. What little conversation he
recalled took place with the rescuers.
	   Suddenly, they broke through to Ng'ang'a's burrow. Rescuer Gil
Wiener stretched out his hand. Not yet.
	   The Israelis kept at it. Drilling, digging, gently nudging
debris aside as the hours ticked by.
	   Finally, twisting through the rubble, they hauled him out
Saturday night to a waiting ambulance, almost exactly 36 hours
after the bombing.
	   Unlike many of his countrymen, Ng'ang'a isn't a religious man _
or a superstitious one. He said he had no premonitions of disaster
and didn't pray during his ordeal.
	   He had simply waited in calm confidence for help to come. He
hoped Rose could do the same.
	   As he called out his farewell, he realized he knew nothing about
her _ not even her last name. Dozens of Kenyans were still missing
Monday, and no one had come forward to claim Rose, or to say who
she is.
	   ``I told her: I'm gone,'' he said. ``And they are coming for you
next.''

Government apology isn't enough, Samis say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Swedish government's apology to its
indigenous Sami people is welcome but not enough, a group of Sami
activists said Monday.
	   In response to the apology, made by Agriculture Minister Annika
Aahnberg over the weekend, the activists sent her a letter calling
for Sami autonomy with their own local government and county
council.
	   The Samis, traditionally reindeer-herding people who prefer that
name to the former Lapps, are spread out across Europe's far
northern reaches including Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia.
About 17,000 live in Sweden.
	   Aahnberg on Saturday said ``The Swedish colonialization of the
northern parts of our land gave us access to natural resources, but
at the price of forcing the Samis from their region.''
	   ``It must be seen as positive that Aahnberg and the government
apologized ... That is at least an opening,'' said Tomas Cramer,
spokesman for a group of Samis who held a small demonstration in
Stockholm on Monday.
	   But Cramer added that ``the government must go further and admit
that the (Sami reindeer) pastures are theirs in the full juridicial
sense,'' the Swedish news agency TT said.

World Fair accounts chief arrested for alleged massive financial
</HEADLINE>
fraud

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The chief accountant at the Expo '98
World Fair has been arrested on suspicion of stealing millions of
dollars from the organization, the fair's organizers announced
Monday.
	   Joao Caldeira allegedly stole ``hundreds of millions of
escudos'' (millions of dollars), Expo administrator Antonio Mega
Ferreira told state television RTP. The government promised to get
to the bottom of the allegations that led to Caldeira's arrest on
Saturday, RTP said.
	   Expo '98 _ the century's final and largest world's fair _ was
expected to produce a revenue of 343 billion escudos (dlrs 2
billion).
	   Attendance figures for the fair, which began May 22 and winds up
Sept. 30, are way below expectations. Organizers had predicted some
100,000 visitors a day, but less than half that amount passed
through the fair's turnstiles during the first two months.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kenyan husband of American Fulbright scholar
among dead &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Abdurahman Abdalla was days away
from moving to the United States with his American wife when the
terrorist bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania destroyed their
future.
	   Susan Hirsh, an associate professor of anthropology at Ohio
Wesleyan University in Denver, Ohio, was a Fulbright professor in
Tanzania. She was in the embassy cashing a check at 10:39 (0739gmt)
Friday morning.
	   Abdalla, a Kenyan who had just been granted an immigrant visa,
was waiting outside for his wife.
	   The bomb exploded beside him.
	   ``On the 18th of August, they planned to leave to move to the
United States,'' charge d'affaires John Lange said Monday. ``And on
the 7th of August, he died in front of our embassy.''
	   Abdalla was one of 10 people killed in the blast. U.S. officials
said the nine others were Tanzanians, all embassy employees. None
were Americans.
	   They said it was possible an 11th person had been killed.
	   Tanzanian police said Monday they had arrested several suspects
in the bombing.
	   ``There were some suspects arrested, more than one, in different
parts of Dar es Salaam,'' said Assistant Police Commissioner Wilson
Mwansasu.
	   He declined to give the number or identity of the suspects,
adding only that those arrested ``are connected to others.''
	   Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice downplayed the
detentions Monday as ``routine roundups,'' and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright offered a dlrs 2 million reward for information
leading to the arrest and prosecution of those reponsible for the
bombings in Dar es Salaam and at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi,
Kenya.
	   More than 100 American officials, including FBI agents and
counter-terrorism experts, began probing Friday's bombing that also
wounded over 70 people.
	   On Monday families of the dead collected their relatives'
bodies.
	   ``We had to wait for so long ... for the investigators to review
the body to try to find those responsible, but we still believe it
was necessary and for a good cause,'' said Harun Mahundi,
Tanzania's former police inspector general. His brother, Ramadani
Mahundi, an embassy guard, was killed in the blast.
	   Police believe the bomb was planted in a blue tanker truck that
regularly delivered water to the embassy. It was about to enter the
compound when it exploded. The cab is a tangle of melted metal.
	   A surveillance camera on an embassy wall underneath the roof was
still pointed at the guard booth at the main entrance that bore the
brunt of the explosion.
	   A U.S. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
camera was operating at the time of the blast. But he would not say
whether images had been captured on videotape or were simply
monitored in real time by security officers.
	   Ibrahim Pamba, who had been at the embassy 10 minutes before the
blast, said he saw the blue tanker trunk maneuvering to turn on the
road just outside the embassy as he left the building.
	   ``There was nothing suspicious,'' said Pamba. ``The truck looked
ordinary. It was an ordinary day.''
	   U. S. Marines sealed off the road in front of the embassy and
strung barbed wire around the perimeter. They mounted guard behind
sand bags and trained their assault rifles on everything outside.
	   Former president Julius Nyerere, who visted the bombing site
Monday escorted by Lange, said the sad and senseless bombings had
targeted Americans _ but Tanzanians, Kenyans and Americans had all
died.

Martinez wins one for Latin America

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Dennis Martinez figured if he stuck around
long enough, the wins would come.
	   They did.
	   On Sunday night, he became U.S. Major League Baseball's
winningest Latin American pitcher, surpassing Juan Marichal with
244 career victories.
	   ``I never had any doubt,'' said Martinez, at 43 the oldest
player in the majors. ``I knew something was going to happen sooner
or later.''
	   The milestone came in the Atlanta Braves' 7-5 victory over the
San Francisco Giants.
	   Now the 22-year veteran from Nicaragua would like to speak with
Marichal, a former Giant who saw many of his wins come in the same
windy ballpark where Martinez reached his milestone.
	   ``It would be nice to hear from him,'' Martinez said. ``I would
do the same thing down the line if somebody breaks the record
again.''
	   Then a phone rang in the clubhouse.
	   ``That may be him right there,'' Martinez cracked.
	   Martinez (3-4) almost didn't get his chance for the record. He
was cut early last season by Seattle after going 1-5 with a 7.75
ERA. But he pitched well in the Puerto Rico winter league, earning
an invitation to spring training with the Braves.
	   ``I'm grateful I've been able to play as long as I've been
playing,'' he said.
	   Marvin Benard, a Nicaraguan who plays for the Giants, was proud
of his countryman.
	   ``I wish he had gone somewhere else to win. But I'm happy for
him, there's no use lying about it,'' Benard said. ``He means an
awful lot to the Nicaraguan people. Only six of us have made it to
the big leagues and he was the first. They don't call him `El
Presidente' for nothing.''
	   Teammate Ozzie Guillen said it was accomplishment for all Latin
Americans.
	   ``I know Dennis and I know his family, and I know what this
means to him. I know what this means to Latin America,'' Guillen
said. ``I think it's extra special to win it in this ballpark,
where Marichal had so much of his career.''
	   Barry Bonds, who hit two home runs and drove in four runs for
San Francisco on Sunday night, also was impressed.
	   ``I don't want to talk about the homers. We lost,'' Bonds said.
``But I'm happy for Dennis Martinez.''
	   Martinez tied Marichal on June 2 when he shut out Milwaukee 9-0.
In a career with Baltimore, Montreal, Cleveland, Seattle and
Atlanta, Martinez has a 244-191 record. The four-time All-Star
pitched a perfect game for the Expos in 1991 against Los Angeles.
	   Marichal went 243-142 during a 16-year Hall of Fame career from
1960-1975. The Dominican won 238 games in 14 years with San
Francisco.
	   Marichal's jersey is retired and hangs on the right field wall
at the former Candlestick Park.
	   ``This is only a record,'' Martinez said. ``It has nothing to do
with who was better.''

Sea dinosaur fossil found high in Swiss Alps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Scientists in Switzerland have
discovered a fossilized sea dinosaur at 2,700 meters (8,850 feet)
above sea level, a professor at the University of Zurich said
Monday.
	   The remains of the dinosaur, some 50 centimeters (20 inches)
long, were found at the edge of the Ducan glacier, said Hans
Rieber, head of the university's Paleontological Institute.
	   The site, in the mountainous southeast corner of landlocked
Switzerland, has been systematically searched over the last year by
the university's specialists.
	   Remains of smaller predatory fish have also been found at the
Ducan site, Rieber said. The fossil of the larger dinosaur is being
examined to determine its species.
	   The dinosaur's remains were originally preserved in sludge which
had formed on the sea bed, he said.
	   When the Alps were formed some 9 million years ago, the seabed
was lifted up some 3,000 meters (9,850 feet) and fish remains
fossilized.

Kosovo Albanian rebels fight to retain last strongholds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATE with new reports of fighting, casualties, comment from
U.S. envoy
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backed into a few remaining
strongholds, ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo fought Monday to
cling to territory in the face of a punishing Serb offensive.
	   With Western diplomats pushing them to agree to peace talks,
Kosovo Liberation Army fighters skirmished with Serbian forces
throughout the weekend and Monday. Ethnic Albanian sources reported
fierce fighting around Djakovica and the strategic village of
Junik, where the KLA managed to hold its positions.
	   Although one moderate KLA faction signaled its readiness for
negotiations that could lead to the province regaining autonomy
from Serbia, prospects for talks remained uncertain.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill arrived in Pristina, capital of
Kosovo, Monday to try to push the peace process forward.
	   Hill said he had a ``good discussion'' with ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova, and planned other talks, but he would not
say with whom.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
	   Both sides reported skirmishes continuing Monday at several
locations.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center said three KLA fighters were killed
Monday in a clash with Serb police in the village of Dura, about 25
miles (40 kilometers) south of Pristina. Authorities there said the
KLA attacked a police patrol and police fired back, killing three.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said one
Albanian was killed Monday by a sniper in Suva Reka, about 25 miles
(40 kilometers) southwest of Pristina.
	   Intense fighting was also reported along the road connecting
Djakovica and Decane in the west, where Serb authorities said four
Serb policemen were killed on Sunday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said four Albanians were killed
and houses were burned in the village of Erec, and the Serbs also
suffered an undetermined number of casualties.
	   In the village of Skivjan, it said Serb forces gave an ultimatum
to fighters and residents to give up their weapons and surrender.
	   About 15,000 civilians have been displaced from the two
villages, it said.
	   Elsewhere, about 400 civilians were being encircled by Serb
forces in the village of Lausa, one of the KLA's biggest
strongholds until it fell to Serb forces Aug. 2. Four civilians who
managed to get out of the village said two women and a man were
killed during the attack, the Kosovo Information Center said.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook criticized the Serbs for
their recent attacks involving civilians, particularly the fires
set by Serb forces to crops in Kosovo to try to ensure villagers
won't return.
	   Pressing for talks while holding out the threat of NATO
intervention, Western diplomats gave the warring sides a proposal
outlining how autonomy might work in Kosovo.
	   ``This is not a war that either side can win,'' Cook said. ``The
only way this war can be ended is by both sides coming to the table
with an international presence and negotiating a satisfactory
constitutional political settlement.''
	   According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the Serb
offensive has forced 167,000 people from their homes in Kosovo
since the conflict exploded in February, with a total of 231,000
displaced, including those who fled the province.
	   Hundreds have been killed, with thousands of others remaining in
the woods and hills, many without food or water.

Annan to Iraqis: show `common sense' and cooperate with review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent a
message Monday to the Iraqis asking them to exercise ``common
sense'' and cooperate in a comprehensive review of weapons
inspections and sanctions.
	   Iraqi diplomats continued to insist that sanctions must be
lifted before Iraq cooperates again with inspectors, but they also
said they would welcome a Russian proposal to formally commend the
Iraqis for fulfilling some Security Council demands.
	   In Lisbon, Portugal, where he is on an official visit, Annan
told the state news agency Lusa that he was sending his special
envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, with a message that the United Nations
would treat the Iraqis with ``fairness'' _ but that they needed to
show ``common sense.''
	   Shah was due to leave from Lisbon on Tuesday.
	   Iraq has been under U.N. trade sanctions _ which ban air travel
and most sales of its economic mainstay, oil _ since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said that the sanctions will not
be lifted until inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction, as called for in U.N. resolutions
following the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Annan proposed a comprehensive review of the weapons inspections
and the debilitating sanctions last week, after Iraq suspended its
cooperation with the weapons inspectors on the grounds that they
were working on behalf of the United States to prolong the
sanctions.
	   The Security Council declared the suspension of cooperation
``totally unacceptable.''
	   That left the status of the inspections unclear, although
regular monitoring via sensors and closed-circuit video continues.
Australian Richard Butler, the U.N.'s chief weapons inspector, has
yet to order his staff out on inspections.
	   Iraq's Charge d'Affaires at the United Nations, Said Hasan, said
the Iraqis believed the inspectors had a political agenda.
	   ``They are not doing disarmament work,'' he said of the
inspectors. ``They are doing the political work'' of the United
States.
	   Hasan said Shah, an Indian, would be welcomed by Tariq Aziz, the
Iraqi deputy prime minister who shut down inspections last week
when Butler refused to certify that Iraq has destroyed all its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Annan, who has counted out lifting sanctions for now wants the
review to show the Iraqis a ``light at the end of the sanctions
tunnel,'' but he has yet to explain how.
	   Russia's deputy ambassador, Yuriy Fedotov, has suggested that
the Security Council formally commend Iraq for closing its nuclear
file and nearly closing its missile file.
	   Hasan said Iraq would welcome such an initiative, although he
would not say whether it would prompt Iraq to allow inspections to
resume.
	   U.S. and British diplomats _ who have adopted a wait-and-see
approach to Annan's message to Iraq _ have dismissed similar
proposals in the past, saying they would be rewarding Iraq for
doing little.
	   Fedotov said Russia _ which has pending financial interests in
Iraq _ did not want sanctions lifted immediately, noting Butler's
considerable concerns about Iraq's chemical and biological
capabilities.

Fire guts Bahrain shopping center, apartments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ A fire gutted a shopping center Monday in
the capital Manama, sending about a dozen residents of apartments
above the stores fleeing.
	   No injuries were reported. Firemen quickly arrived by the dozen
to put out the fire at the Naqi Center in the busy, central market
area of Manama where buildings are separated only by narrow alleys.
	   An hour after the fire began at 9:30 p.m. (1830gmt), thick black
clouds of smoke could still be seen pouring from the two-story
building.
	   Witnesses said a series of blasts were heard after the blaze
started in the shopping center, which houses several electronic and
clothes stores.
	   Government officials would not immediately comment on the fire
or its cause. But Manama and particularly the old market area have
witnesses numerous arson attacks blamed on Shiite Muslim activists
campaigning for political and social reforms.
	   Last month, about 50 anti-government Shiite activists started
fires and hurled stones at people, shops and cars, causing panic
and forcing business to come to a standstill in the market area.
	   More than 40 people have been killed in the campaign of violence
that began in December 1994.
	   Shiites form a slight majority of Bahrain's 400,000 citizens,
but the Gulf state is ruled by the Al Khalifa family, which belongs
to the mainstream Sunni sect of Islam.

Environmental groups accuse Costa Rica of stripping forests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ Environmental groups accused the
Costa Rican government on Monday of allowing extensive logging in
rain forests along the Pacific Coast.
	   The groups, which include Costa Rican organizations and the
international group Greenpeace, accused the vice-minister of the
environment, Carlos Rodriguez, of being uncooperative during a
meeting Sunday aboard the Greenpeace boat Rainbow Warrior.
	   They said Rodriguez refused to ban logging on the Osa Peninsula,
200 miles (350 kms) south of the capital, San Jose. ``We're
disappointed,'' said Cecilia Solano, leader of a Costa Rican
environmental group.
	   The groups want a ban on logging on the peninsula, one of the
country's most important rain forests but also a major center of
operations for major international logging companies.
	   Rodriguez said he couldn't declare a ban on logging because that
would ``condemn to poverty the small peasants who live off of that
activity.'' He offered instead to spend just under dlrs 1 million
to improve conservation efforts.
	   Solano said that wasn't enough, and that the threat of poverty
isn't an excuse because ``when the forest is gone, we'll all be
looking for another job.''
	   The Costa Rican government claims that its efforts have reversed
deforestation in the country, but environmental groups accuse the
government of doctoring its numbers and say primary forests are
disappearing because of heavy logging.

Mexican bishop says pope should cancel trip if Chiapas isn't
</HEADLINE>
peaceful &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ The bishop of this
mountain city in southern Chiapas state is urging Pope John Paul II
to cancel his trip to Mexico in January unless an Indian rebellion
here is settled first.
	   Roman Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz said the pope's trip provides
a ``remote but not non-existent'' opportunity to resolve the
uprising by the Zapatista National Liberation Army, a guerrilla
group that demands greater rights for Mexico's poor Indians.
	   Peace talks with the group have been stalled for two years,
while gunmen linked to either side have targeted sympathizers of
the other.
	   ``If there isn't a more or less peaceful situation in the
country, a visit by the holy father wouldn't be appropriate,
because it could appear to be an approval of the lack of respect
for human dignity,'' Ruiz said in an interview Sunday night.
	   The pope has announced plans to visit Mexico on Jan. 22-25.
Those don't include a trip to Chiapas state.
	   Ruiz said the government appeared to be trying to wrap up loose
ends before the pope's trip: ``If someone comes to your house to
visit, you'll at least sweep, won't you?''
	   In June, Ruiz ended his efforts to mediate a resolution to the
conflict, claiming there was growing government ``aggression''
against his church. The mediation commission he led also disbanded.

Several suspects detained as rescuers race to find survivors

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rescuers buoyed by the sound of tapping
Monday heaved pieces of rubble aside in a desperate effort to get
to survivors of the U.S. Embassy bombing. Police investigating the
twin bombing at the embassy in Tanzania detained several people.
	   As U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced a dlrs 2
million reward for information leading to the conviction of ``the
cowards that committed this act,'' the hunt for the terrorists and
the search for victims intensified.
	   According to a preview of Tuesday's edition of the East African
Standard, Kenyan security guards in the rear parking lot at the
U.S. Embassy in Nairobi engaged five Arab-looking men in a brief
argument and physical confrontation that resulted in a shootout
moments before the bomb exploded.
	   Joash Okindo, one of the guards who survived the attack, was
quoted as saying the men threw a grenade. The paper said Okindo was
interviewed before being flown to the U.S. military base at
Ramstein, Germany for treatment.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said
an unnamed Kenyan guard reported that the bombers threw a grenade
at him after he refused to let them pass through the gate. The
guard told investigators he ran from the terrorists just before the
truck exploded, Foley said.
	   U.S. investigators haven't been able to confirm the account, but
find his account plausible, Foley said.
	   The bombers had apparently sought to get into the U.S. embassy's
underground parking garage, a site from which the bomb could have
been even more devastating to the embassy.
	   Eleven Americans who had come to Kenya in peace began their last
journey home in coffins Monday. A 12th American, married to a
Kenyan, will be buried in her adopted homeland.
	   But the vast majority of the more than 200 dead and nearly 5,000
injured in both bombings were Kenyans. An overwhelming sense of
stunned grief gripped this east African country, and over and over
again Kenyans asked, why here?
	   In the first confirmed detentions in either country, Assistant
Police Commissioner Wilson Mwansasu announced that ``there were
some suspects arrested ... in different parts of Dar es Salaam.''
The suspects were ``connected to others,'' he said, but refused to
elaborate.
	   In Washington, however, the State Department downplayed the
significance of the arrests.
	   Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice said
about a dozen people had been detained for questioning in ``a
routine roundup'' and told reporters ``don't attach too much
importance to it.''
	   Mwansasu refused to identify the nationalities of those
arrested. But another U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Sudanese and Iraqi citizens were among those
detained.
	   The United States is a favorite target of militant Islamic
fundamentalists, such as the exiled Saudi financier Osama bin
Laden, one potential suspect.
	   It was not known who was behind the blasts. News media received
claims of responsibility in the name of the ``Islamic Army for the
Liberation of Holy Shrines'' and the ``Army for the Liberation of
Islamic Shrines.'' The claims could not be confirmed and may have
come from the same source.
	   U.S., Kenyan and Tanzanian investigators were maintaining a very
low profile.
	   ``We will not confirm or deny the existence of evidence in this
criminal inquiry,'' said an American diplomat in Dar es Salaam, who
briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
	   Israel army radio, in a report from Nairobi, said investigators
suspect the bombers used the plastic explosive Semtex.
	   The powerful blast in the busy business district of downtown
Nairobi destroyed a building next door to the embassy and damaged
others blocks away. The damage in Tanzania was far less because the
embassy is in a residential area.
	   U.S. officials said it was inevitable that evidence might have
been destroyed at the bombing site in Nairobi because of the rescue
effort.
	   ``Obviously the first priority is finding people alive and then
to recover bodies,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf. ``I
think that you find that dilemma anywhere.''
	   On Monday, three cranes and two bulldozers lifted chunks of
rubble from the collapsed Ufundi Cooperative House next to the
embassy, where weary Israeli rescuers said they heard tapping in
the morning.
	   ``There is an unseen frenzy on the rubble,'' said Nina Galbe,
spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross. ``As
long as there is the slightest chance of any person being found
alive, every moment up there is precious. We can't stop until the
last stone is unturned.''
	   The Israelis said the tapping spurred them on in their search
for a woman named Rose, who last spoke to rescue workers Sunday
afternoon. Another woman named Jane hasn't been heard from for much
longer.
	   Titus Ngwele, Red Cross coordinator at the scene, said the
Israelis sank a microphone late Monday afternoon to check whether
Rose was breathing.
	   ``They weren't sure whether she was or not. She hasn't spoken
today. But they're still working to get her out and still hoping
that she's alive,'' he said.
	   Three days after the bombing, however, the only victims being
pulled out of the rubble were dead.
	   By late Monday evening, the Red Cross had taken 16 bodies to the
central morgue, Galbe said.
	   More than 300 students from the University of Nairobi held a
candlelight vigil in front of the bombed embassy Monday night,
singing, ``When the Saints go Marching In'' and ``Hakuna Mungu Kama
Wewe,'' a Swahili song meaning ``There Is No Other God Like You.''
Many carried roses and palm fronds.
	   ``We are mourning our fellow Kenyans killed in the blast,'' said
Harris Ojenge, who is studying to be a teacher.
	   According to the latest Kenyan government figures, 192 people
died in the Nairobi bombing, including 12 Americans, and 4,877 were
injured; 542 were still hospitalized Monday, 24 in critical
condition.
	   In Dar es Salaam, nine Tanzanians and one Kenyan died in the
bombing and 74 people were injured. The U.S. diplomat said Monday
there would possibly be an 11th victim, a Tanzanian.
	   At the morgue of Muhimbili teaching hospital, grieving families
began receiving the remains of the victims after U.S. investigators
examined the bodies and released them one by one.
	   ``We had to wait for so long ... for the investigators to review
the bodies to try to find those responsible, but we still believe
it was necessary and for a good cause,'' said Harun Mahundi,
Tanzania's former police inspector general. His brother, Ramadani
Mahundi, an embassy guard, was killed in the blast.
	   There were tears at the morgue and tears at Nairobi airport as
the bodies of the 11 Americans left Kenya.
	   As each aluminum coffin was lifted into the military transport
plane, U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell covered her heart with her
right hand _ still bandaged from the injuries she suffered in the
blast.
	   U.S. troops saluted farewell as American and Kenyan flags
fluttered in a soft breeze sweet with the perfume of grass and
acacia trees.

Conviction against former East German spy swapper lifted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Vogel; minor editing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Saying the former East German government was at
fault, not its negotiator, a federal court lifted the extortion
conviction of an east German lawyer who arranged spectacular spy
and dissident swaps during the Cold War, judicial officials said
Monday.
	   Wolfgang Vogel negotiated the swaps of over 150 spies from more
than two dozen nations, as well as release of nearly 34,000 East
German political prisoners and the relocation to the West of some
215,000 East Germans.
	   After the Berlin Wall fell, he and some of his associates were
tried on charges of having extorted cash and property from those
they helped move to the West.
	   Vogel, 72, was convicted of extortion in one trial, but cleared
in another after a judge ruled it could not be proven that he had
demanded payment for helping citizens to leave East Germany.
	   The case reached the Federal Court of Justice in Leipzig after
both prosecutors and Vogel's defense sought clarification of the
dueling rulings.
	   In throwing out the extortion conviction, the federal court
ruled that it was the former communist government _ not its
negotiators _ who was accountable for extorting payment for
permission to leave.
	   The court cited its own precedent-setting ruling issued in April
that cleared one of Vogel's associates of extortion charges for the
same reason.
	   The court, however, left untouched Vogel's conviction on perjury
and forgery charges, along with the 14-month suspended sentence for
perjury and 92,000 mark (dlrs 51,000) fine for forgery.
	   The decision was dated Aug. 5 but released only Monday.
	   Vogel, retired now and living in Bavaria, blamed ``overzealous
prosecutors'' for his convictions and told German television he
could live with the new ruling.
	   During the long legal process, Vogel had supporters among U.S.
diplomats, church leaders and former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who
made a point of visiting Vogel while he was held in investigative
custody in the early 1990s.
	   Among the more spectacular cases that Vogel negotiated was the
the 1962 release of U-2 spy pilot Gary Powers, whose plane had been
shot down over the Soviet Union, and the trade of Soviet dissident
Natan Sharansky for several East Bloc spies in 1986.
	   But it was his efforts negotiating the relocation of ordinary
East Germans that led to the charges against him.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by Carter Center spokesman in 7th graf
 &UR; Mediators fail to resolve Peru, Ecuador standoff &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ International mediators failed to resolve a
military standoff between Peruvian and Ecuadorean troops in a
stretch of disputed territory where the Andean neighbors fought a
brief war in 1995.
	   But representatives of the United States, Brazil, Chile and
Argentina _ who met in Ecuador's capital Quito Sunday night to try
to broker a deal _ said they would try again.
	   ``The dialogue is not broken,'' said Hugo de Zela Martinez,
spokesman for the Peruvian delegation.
	   Peru is willing to resume the talks after Ecuador's new
president, Jamil Mahuad, takes office Monday, a foreign ministry
communique said.
	   Peru rejected a proposed plan to separate the forces because it
would have left Ecuadorean troops in Peruvian territory, Zela said.
	   After receiving a congratulatory phone call from former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter on Sunday, Mahuad suggested he participate
in the talks because of his experience in mediating conflicts.
	   ``I don't anticipate that happening,'' said Robert Pastor,
spokesman for the Atlanta-based Carter Center run by the former
president, in a telephone interview. ``It was never discussed
during the telephone call.''
	   The U.S. delegation on Monday was joined by U.S. Acting
Assistant Secretary for Inter American Affairs Peter Romero.
	   The latest flare up of the long-running dispute between Peru and
Ecuador over 49 miles (78 kms) of unmarked border began Thursday
when Peru charged that Ecuadorean troops had entered its territory
in a ``clear provocation.''
	   Peru and Ecuador have fought brief border wars in 1941, 1981 and
1995, and had appeared set to negotiate a resolution to the
dispute.
	   News of the alleged incursion _ which Ecuador has denied _
caused President Alberto Fujimori to cancel trips to Colombia and
Ecuador in order to meet with his top generals.
	   Fujimori later said the troops had met ``face-to-face'' some 1.7
miles (2.8 kms) within Peruvian territory in a mountainous jungle
region called the Cordillera del Condor, 560 miles (900 kms) north
of Lima.
	   The area is 12 miles (20 kms) south of a demilitarized zone
where the two countries fought a brief, undeclared war in 1995.
	   About 20 U.S. military observers are stationed in the
demilitarized area.

8,000 evacuated from British Columbia town as fire rages nearby
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALMON ARM, British Columbia (AP) _ About 400 firefighters
battled a forest fire Monday that prompted the evacuation of about
8,000 people from this town in south-central British Columbia.
	   Completed early Monday, it was believed to be the largest
fire-related evacuation ever in the province, involving more than
half of Salmon Arm's residents.
	   The province's premier, Premier Glen Clark, declared a state of
emergency for the town and surrounding district late Sunday, giving
authorities sweeping powers to order people out.
	   ``The size of the evacuation was larger than we've ever done in
British Columbia,'' Clark said. ``Trying to do that in the space of
an hour would clearly have been a crisis.''
	   Under the emergency, provincial parks normally reserved for
daytime visitors could be used by evacuees as campgrounds. Other
evacuees plan to stay with friends and relatives in the area.
	   Countering the 20-square-mile (5,000-hectare) fire were 300
civilian firefighters, 100 soldiers and a fleet of water-bombing
helicopters and planes.
	   Salmon Arm city streets were largely deserted by Monday except
for emergency workers. Police said they would not forcibly remove
remaining homeowners unless they impeded firefighting efforts.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with inauguration of president in 4th graf. Edits
 &UR; Ecuador's new president takes power amid recession, talk of war &QL; 
 &UR; By CARLOS CISTERNAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Elected president on a promise to end
Ecuador's chronic political instability, Jamil Mahuad took office
Monday facing an economy in trouble and rumblings of war with
neighboring Peru.
	   The Harvard-educated lawyer's inauguration ends 18 months of
chaotic interim government that followed the removal of eccentric
former President Abdala Bucaram from office by Congress for
``mental incapacity.''
	   Congress named its own president, Fabian Alarcon, as his interim
replacement.
	   Monday's inauguration of the divorced father-of-two took place
in Congress and was attended by the presidents of Bolivia, Costa
Rica, Venezuela and Colombia, as well as the Prince of Spain.
	   Mahuad, 49, used a successful six-year stint as mayor of the
capital Quito to launch his presidential campaign and narrowly beat
populist banana tycoon Alvaro Noboa in a July 12 presidential
runoff.
	   As Quito's mayor, Mahuad became one of Ecuador's most popular
political figures with a reputation as an honest, effective
administrator.
	   He inherits an economy battered by massive El Nino-driven floods
and mudslides, a ballooning budget deficit and a sharp drop in the
price of its main export, oil.
	   Calling Ecuador's economic situation ``dramatic,'' he has
promised to cut spending and improve tax collection to balance its
books.
	   ``My first priority is to rebuild the Pacific coast region,
which is the focus of this country's development and was hit hard
by El Nino,'' Mahuad said.
	   He must also deal with a tense standoff with neighboring Peru,
which last week charged Ecuadorean troops had entered its territory
in a disputed region where the countries fought a brief war in
early 1995.
	   As tension escalated, Peru's President Alberto Fujimori canceled
a trip to Ecuador to attend Mahuad's inauguration and met with his
generals.
	   The Andean nations have fought wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over
49 miles (78 kms) of unmarked border amid a mountainous jungle.
	   Representatives from the United States, Brazil, Chile and
Argentina are trying to broker a deal to avoid a another war.
	   Ecuador's political and business elites had rallied behind
Mahuad, who has a master's degree in public administration from
Harvard University, as the best hope for stabilizing Ecuador's
carnival-like politics.
	   The final days of Bucaram's short-lived government were plagued
by protests and allegations of corruption. Many Ecuadoreans felt
his clownish antics and populism had undermined their 19-year-old
democracy.
	   The eccentric Bucaram, called ``El Loco'' or ``The Crazy One,''
recorded a rock music record, sang at wild campaign rallies
accompanied by scantily clad dancing girls and dubbed himself the
``scourge of the oligarchy.''
	   Mahuad's term in office ends in January 2003.

Former Brazilian national team coach says he will sue Romario
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Mario Zagallo, the soccer coach
who led Brazil to the finals in this year's World Cup, plans to sue
Flamengo striker Romario, claiming a picture of the coach displayed
in the player's nightclub is defamatory.
	   In the bathroom stall of the club, scheduled to open this month,
Zagallo is seen sitting on a toilet bowl. On the next stall, his
assistant, Zico, is depicted holding a roll of toilet paper.
	   Romario, who was cut from the national team just days before the
World Cup, because of a leg injury, has long had a rocky
relationship with Zagallo.
	   When pictures of the stalls first appeared in the local press,
Romario said he had not known about the paintings and said he would
have them removed if Zagallo asked.
	   Zagallo instead told the Globo Esporte television show on Monday
he would sue for defamation of character and unauthorized use of
his image, among other things.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mahuad's comments and description of ceremony in
 &UR; Ecuador's new president takes power amid recession, talk of war &QL; 
 &UR; By CARLOS CISTERNAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Elected president on a promise to end
Ecuador's chronic political instability, Jamil Mahuad took office
Monday facing an economy in trouble and rumblings of war with
neighboring Peru.
	   The Harvard-educated lawyer's inauguration ends 18 months of
chaotic interim government that followed the removal of eccentric
former President Abdala Bucaram from office by Congress for
``mental incapacity.''
	   Congress named its own president, Fabian Alarcon, as his interim
replacement.
	   Monday's inauguration of the divorced father-of-two took place
in Congress and was attended by the presidents of Bolivia, Costa
Rica, Venezuela and Colombia, as well as the Prince of Spain.
	   Congress' President Juan Jose Pons placed the yellow, red and
blue sash across Mahuad's chest in front of a cheering gallery.
	   ``Today I've become president of a country hit by all kinds of
disasters, El Nino, internal and international decomposition, and
rampant corruption,'' Mahuad said. ``I've been elected to prevent
this country from sinking.''
	   Mahuad, 49, used a successful six-year stint as mayor of the
capital Quito to launch his presidential campaign and narrowly beat
populist banana tycoon Alvaro Noboa in a July 12 presidential
runoff.
	   As Quito's mayor, Mahuad became one of Ecuador's most popular
political figures with a reputation as an honest, effective
administrator.
	   He inherits an economy battered by massive El Nino-driven floods
and mudslides, a ballooning budget deficit and a sharp drop in the
price of its main export, oil.
	   Calling Ecuador's economic situation ``dramatic,'' he has
promised to cut spending and improve tax collection to balance its
books.
	   ``My first priority is to rebuild the Pacific coast region,
which is the focus of this country's development and was hit hard
by El Nino,'' Mahuad said.
	   He must also deal with a tense standoff with neighboring Peru,
which last week charged Ecuadorean troops had entered its territory
in a disputed region where the countries fought a brief war in
early 1995.
	   The Andean nations have fought wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over
49 miles (78 kms) of unmarked border amid a mountainous jungle.
	   Representatives from the United States, Brazil, Chile and
Argentina are trying to broker a deal to avoid a another war.
	   In his speech, Mahuad extended an olive branch to Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori, offering to meet him to negotiate an
end to the crisis.
	   ``For the future of our peoples, we will reach a peace,'' he
said.
	   Ecuador's political and business elites had rallied behind
Mahuad, who has a master's degree in public administration from
Harvard University, as the best hope for stabilizing Ecuador's
carnival-like politics.
	   The final days of Bucaram's short-lived government were plagued
by protests and allegations of corruption. Many Ecuadoreans felt
his clownish antics and populism had undermined their 19-year-old
democracy.
	   The eccentric Bucaram, called ``El Loco'' or ``The Crazy One,''
recorded a rock music record, sang at wild campaign rallies
accompanied by scantily clad dancing girls and dubbed himself the
``scourge of the oligarchy.''
	   Mahuad's term in office ends in January 2003.

Ninth-seeded Alex Corretja survives three-set tiebreaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERRY KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Alex Corretja's first-round match Monday at
the ATP Championship was no trip to the beach, although that's
where the Spaniard has been spending time lately.
	   Corretja, playing his first hardcourt match since March _ and
his first match of any kind after a three-week vacation _ needed
three sets and more than 2 1/2 hours to outlast Alex O'Brien 6-3,
6-7 (3-7), 7-6 (9-7).
	   ``It was good because it was good for my physical condition and
my mental game because after like 20 days off, it is always
difficult to make a comeback,'' Corretja said.
	   ``But today, for me, it was my first match, so I was hungry to
be on the court and hungry to play tennis.''
	   Corretja, ranked 12th in the ATP Tour rankings released Monday,
said he was invigorated by his vacation in Barcelona.
	   ``I was just having some fun and just trying to go to the beach
and to the pool,'' Corretja said. ``Right now I feel fresh again.''
	   O'Brien, who has never been ranked higher than 30th, was happy
to have pressed Corretja to a third-set tiebreaker.
	   ``I did a lot of positive things. I thought it was a good day
because I put a lot of pressure on him,'' O'Brien said. ``I'm my
biggest enemy ... today I didn't defeat myself.''
	   As one of the Mercedes Super 9 tournaments, the dlrs 2.45
million Great American Insurance ATP Championship has a spectacular
field. Of the top 10 players on tour, only sixth-ranked Greg
Rusedski, sidelined by an injury, is absent.
	   Pete Sampras is the defending champion and No. 1 seed. Marcelo
Rios, who took over the tour's top ranking from Sampras on Monday,
is seeded No. 2.
	   The tournament lost one seeded player Monday when Jeff Tarango
defeated 13th-seeded Alberto Berasategui of Spain 7-5, 6-2.
	   In other matches involving seeded players, No. 12 Albert Costa
of Spain beat Sebastian Grosjean of France 1-6, 6-4, 6-1 and No.16
Cedric Pioline of France beat Ramone Delgado of Paraguay 7-6, 6-3.
	   In other afternoon matches, Vince Spadea beat Justin Gimelstob
3-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-2; Jan-Michael Gambill beat Olivier Delaitre of
France 6-1, 6-3; Tommy Haas of Germany beat Jim Courier 7-6 (7-3),
7-6 (7-5); and Guillaume Raoux of France defeated Wolfgang Schranz
of Austria 7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 6-4.
	   Also, Magnus Larsson of Sweden beat Gianluca Pozzi of Italy 6-4,
7-5; Thomas Johansson of Sweden beat Wayne Black of Zimbabwe 7-6
(7-3), 7-5; and Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands beat countryman
Sjeng Schalken 1-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-2).

Recchi gets National Hockey League record arbitration deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Mark Recchi of the Montreal Canadiens received
the highest arbitration award in National Hockey League history
Monday, getting a one-year deal worth dlrs 4.5 million.
	   The right wing, who had been seeking dlrs 24 million over four
years from the team, will become an unrestricted free agent after
the season unless the two sides finally agree to a long-term deal.
	   Recchi becomes the highest-paid player in Montreal history,
surpassing team captain Vincent Damphousse, who signed a one-year
deal worth dlrs 3.275 million on July 31. Damphousse will also
become an unrestricted free agent after the 1998-99 season.
	   Recchi, who had 32 goals and 42 assists last season, made dlrs
2.75 million last season in the fifth year of a deal originally
signed with Philadelphia. The contract contained an option for a
sixth year at roughly the same salary, but there was also a clause
allowing Recchi to negotiate a new deal or go to arbitration after
five years.
	   General manager Rejean Houle was unable to sign Recchi to a
long-term deal despite a last-ditch attempt before Friday's
arbitration hearing.
	   Houle still has plenty of work ahead of him this month. Other
restricted free agents remaining to be signed include defensemen
Vladimir Malakhov and Patrice Brisebois, and forwards Saku Koivu,
Brian Savage and Martin Rucinsky.
	   Recchi was acquired from the Flyers in February 1995 with a
third-round draft pick in exchange for John LeClair, Gilbert Dionne
and Eric Desjardins.
	   In 710 career games, the 30-year-old Recchi has 317 goals and
472 assists.

Man-made factors may have worsened Yangtze floods

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Seeking to stop the kind of flooding ravaging
China, the government is spending dlrs 24.5 billion and resettling
more than a million people to build Three Gorges Dam, the world's
largest hydroelectric project.
	   But critics of the dam in central Hubei province say the
structure, to be completed in 2009, could possibly increase
flooding and might share the blame for the current disaster.
	   Heavy, sustained downpours have caused the Yangtze River to
swell to its highest level since 1954, and floods nationwide have
killed more than 2,000 people and made millions more homeless.
	   Meanwhile, the industrial city of Wuhan survived the flooding
unscathed Monday. Authorities _ fearful that the city of 7 million
people might be overwhelmed by high waters _ a day earlier
destroyed dikes upstream. The action diverted water and lowered the
Yangtze.
	   The ``flood crest passed smoothly,'' said a city official who
would give only his surname, Liu. ``Everything is normal but we're
keeping our eye on the situation.''
	   Elsewhere, with more rains falling on the Yangtze's upper
reaches, the river is expected to sustain dangerously high levels
for weeks.
	   Downstream in Jiujiang, southeast China, residents and soldiers
guarding dikes weakened by the weeks of flooding prepared for a
long, anxious night as the flood crest barreled toward the city of
500,000 people.
	   The flooding has been exacerbated in recent years by
deforestation and dikes that have hemmed the river in and
eliminated natural wetlands that normally would absorb flood
waters.
	   Silt from increased runoff has raised the stream bed, forcing
communities along the river to depend on dikes for protection from
floods.
	   But residents and cash-strapped local governments have badly
neglected the dikes, the official Xinhua News Agency said in a
special report. Levees, many of them built in the 1950s, have
eroded or have been undermined by burrowing pests.
	   ``The decay of aged dikes and a lack of funding for repairs
create serious flood threats each year when the water rises,'' the
Xinhua report said.
	   The neglect may have been encouraged by government promises that
the Three Gorges Dam will store floodwaters and protect residents
along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze.
	   The 1.5-mile-long (2 kms) dam will inundate a 370-mile (600 kms)
stretch of land along the Yangtze, forcing 1.3 million people to
move.
	   Dam critics charge it will do little to control the floods
because many of the Yangtze's tributaries flow into the river
downstream of the dam site, where flooding could continue.
	   The project's multibillion budget should have been used to
repair levees, said journalist and dam critic Dai Qing. Smaller
dams throughout the Yangtze River system would have been just as
effective with much less cost and impact on the environment, she
says.
	   ``China is building gigantic projects ... while neglecting its
existing flood management system,'' said Philip Williams, president
of the Berkeley, California-based International Rivers Network.

Sahalee presents a new kind of test at PGA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ The tee shot hugged the branches down
the left side before gently fading into the fairway on Sahalee
Country Club's closing hole. That's where the fun began Monday for
Colin Montgomerie.
	   The PGA Championship, as is the case with most major golf
championships, puts a premium on driving accuracy. But at Sahalee,
just being in the fairway isn't always enough.
	   Montgomerie folded his arms and squinted as he surveyed the
final 200 yards (182 meters) to the 18th green, his eyes locked
onto a 50-foot (15-meter) cedar just behind a 100-foot (30-meter)
Douglas fir, both guarding the left quarter of the green.
	   His first shot curved into the thick of the cedar and dropped
down into heavy, 4-inch (10-cm) rough. His second shot followed the
same path, only this time it ricocheted across the fairway some 50
yards (46 meters) short of the green.
	   By this time, Montgomerie had already dropped a third ball. This
one stopped 15 feet (4 1/2 meters) short of the hole, drawing
applause from a small gallery and a sigh of surrender from the
Scotsman.
	   ``It's a lovely course,'' Montgomerie said. ``It's a beautiful
place to play and a beautiful test of golf.''
	   Then he gazed back at the 18th fairway and smiled.
	   ``The trees get in the way too often,'' he said. ``That's the
only problem. From above, I'm sure it looks like you can only walk
single-file down the fairways.''
	   Trees figure to be the primary problem confronting the strongest
field at the last major championship of the year.
	   Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara will try to
become the first player since Ben Hogan to win three majors in a
year, and Davis Love III will try to become the first back-to-back
PGA champion since it went to stroke play in 1958.
	   Sahalee will also give the 20-somethings one last chance to win
a major after they took three of the four in 1997.
	   For all of them, Sahalee presents a new kind of challenge.
	   The PGA Championship returns to Washington state for the first
time since Bob Hamilton's stunning 1-up victory over Byron Nelson
in 1944. The PGA Tour stopped coming to Seattle in 1966, three
years before Ted Robinson carved Sahalee out of a forest of trees
next to Lake Sammamish.
	   ``Guys who don't do well, or even guys who do well, always find
something they don't like about a course,'' said Fred Couples, who
learned the game on Seattle's public courses. ``But I don't know
what's not to like about this.''
	   Not many dared guess what kind of score will win the Wanamaker
Trophy, if only because not many have an idea what to expect.
Couples occasionally plays Sahalee when he's in town, although the
rough is not as punishing or the greens as table-top quick.
	   ``I remember shooting a lot of 74s and 75s,'' he said. ``I hope
I can shoot a 74 or 75 one day this week, because that's not going
to be too bad.''
	   Sahalee plays to a par 70 at 6,906 yards (6,284-meter), which is
relatively short until you consider the 480-yard (436-meter) sixth
hole and the 475-yard (432-meter) 18th, both of which are converted
par 5s.
	   ``Short is relative,'' Payne Stewart said. ``I hit driver and
2-iron into 18, and driver, 4-iron into another par 4. Is that
short?''
	   The last two majors have been won at even par _ O'Meara at Royal
Birkdale and U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen at The Olympic Club.
Sahalee is sure to give up its share of birdies, especially with
two par 5s that can be reached in two.
	   ``It's hard to compare this with anything,'' said Bill Glasson,
playing his first major of the year because of elbow surgery.
``It's a nice change of pace from the typical TPC courses we play
with bunkers and water. This is a natural wonder, not a
manufactured one.''
	   But the beauty of Sahalee is also its greatest menace.
	   The trees meet players on the first tee and follow them around
until they are finished. If the massive firs and cedars aren't
daunting enough, the fairways are no wider than a three-car garage
in some spots.
	   ``It's tight enough with only the trees,'' said British Open
runner-up Brian Watts. ``I walked off one fairway that was only 24
yards. You can't be off line anywhere.''
	   And while it's easy to be swept up in Sahalee's charm, just wait
for a tee shot to get buried in the clumpy rough, or an approach to
get swatted out of the sky by one of the towering trees.
	   ``We all realize there's a tournament to be won,'' said
England's Lee Westwood. ``There's no time to stop and look
around.''

If lockout lasts, NBA to refund season ticket money with interest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The National Basketball Association sent out a
strong signal Monday that the lockout could last for months,
announcing that season ticket payments will be refunded with
interest if the work stoppage forces the cancelation of games.
	   Also Monday, the league gave the National Labor Relations Board
its official response to the complaint filed last month by the
players union, alleging the NBA committed an unfair labor practice
by imposing a lockout before reaching an impasse in negotiations.
	   In Atlanta, union director Billy Hunter held a briefing for some
of the locked out players, and attendees included Kevin Garnett and
Stephon Marbury of the Timberwolves.
	   No new bargaining talks are scheduled. The last formal session
ended abruptly last Thursday when owners walked out of the room
after hearing the players' latest proposal.
	   ``Regrettably, after last week's negotiating session there seems
to be a greater likelihood that the season may not start on time,''
deputy commissioner Russ Granik said in a news release announcing
the refund policy.
	   Season ticket holders, most of whom already have paid for their
seats for the 1998-99 season, will receive 6 percent interest on
their money if regular-season games, which are due to begin Nov. 3,
are canceled because of the lockout. Refunds would be made at the
end of each month.
	   ``Season ticket holders make substantial financial commitments
to our teams and we think they should be treated fairly in the
unfortunate event that games are missed,'' Granik said. ``A refund
policy that includes interest is the right thing to do in this
instance.
	   Holders of single-game tickets will be entitled to a refund or a
rain check.
	   Refund policies for holders of luxury suites, club seats and
other premium seats will be determined on a team-by-team basis, the
NBA said.
	   On the NLRB front, the next move will be made by Daniel
Silverman, regional director of the New York office, who must
determine if the players' complaint has merit. He would then report
to the full board in Washington, which would decide if the agency
should ask a federal judge to issue an injunction restoring the old
work rules that expired at midnight June 30 when the old collective
bargaining agreement elapsed.

	   RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany (AP) _ The flag-shrouded coffins of
11 Americans killed in the worst terrorist attack on a U.S. Embassy
arrived early Tuesday in Germany, the first stop on their final
journey home.
	   A lone drummer kept time as eight-man teams from the U.S. Army,
Air Force and Marines, all wearing dress uniforms and white gloves,
carried the coffins from the C141 cargo plane one by one and
brought them to waiting vans.
	   A military color guard holding flags stood at attention, eight
on either side of the ramp, along with a rifle corps.
	   The coffins were to be kept at the nearby U.S. hospital in
Landstuhl until U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrives
to bring them home.
	   The explosion Friday in Nairobi, Kenya, killed at least 192
people, including 12 Americans and 33 Kenyans who worked at the
embassy, and injured almost 5,000 others. The 12th American victim,
Jean Dalizu, who was married to a Kenyan, will be buried in her
adopted homeland.
	   A nearly simultaneous attack on the U.S. Embassy in neighboring
Tanzania killed at least 10 people, all Africans.
	   Gen. John Jumper, commander of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe,
and charge d'affaires Michael Polt of the U.S. Embassy in Bonn
attended the somber ceremony, which began about 1:15 a.m. (2315 GMT
Monday). Flags at Ramstein Air Base were lowered to half-staff.
	   Albright planned to fly to Germany on Wednesday to meet with
some of the wounded who arrived last weekend for treatment at
Landstuhl hospital. She will accompany the bodies of those killed
to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Thursday, officials at
Ramstein said.
	   The coffins were loaded onto the Starlifter in Nairobi on Monday
as U.S. troops saluted farewell. A special Marine unit carried the
remains of a fallen comrade, Sgt. Jesse N. Aliganga of Tallahassee,
Florida.
	   The most senior American diplomat killed was Consul General
Julian Bartley, who died with his 20-year-old son Jay.
	   ``He had an ability to help people understand that he was there
to help. He was known for that throughout his career,'' U.S.
Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said of the elder Bartley.
	   Watching the coffins file past, Scharf said he was struck by the
enormity of the tragedy.
	   ``I think of the Kenyan secretary who worked in my office,''
Scharf said. ``I think of the young sergeant that lived above me
... someone who loved Kenya and the person that many of us would go
to when we wanted to know what to do in Kenya.''
	   ``Those people are gone. We've suffered a terrible loss.''

Yasser Arafat arrives in South Africa under tight security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived in South Africa for a state visit late Monday amid tight
security. It is his first visit since South Africa and Arafat's
autonomous government established diplomatic ties in 1995.
	   During his three-day visit, Arafat is expected to brief
President Nelson Mandela on the Middle East peace process and
discuss relations with South Africa.
	   Officials from the former ruling party of apartheid, the
National Party, are scheduled to meet Arafat on Tuesday, said a
party spokesman, Reiner Schoeman.
	   Schoeman said Arafat's rejection of violence to obtain political
objectives had made it ``necessary for all those seeking peace in
the Middle East to support all moves toward that goal.''
	   Arafat is expected to address Parliament, the South African
Institute of International Affairs and receive South Africa's
highest award _ the Order of Good Hope _ during his visit.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rescuers buoyed by the sound of tapping
Monday heaved pieces of rubble aside in a desperate effort to get
to survivors of the Kenyan U.S. Embassy bombing. Meanwhile, police
investigating the bombing at the embassy in Tanzania detained
several people. As U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
announced a dlrs 2 million reward for information leading to the
conviction of ``the cowards that committed this act,'' the hunt for
the terrorists and the search for victims intensified. According to
a preview of Tuesday's edition of the East African Standard, Kenyan
security guards in the rear parking lot at the U.S. Embassy in
Nairobi argued and exchanged fire with five men moments before the
bomb exploded. (EMBASSY-BOMBINGS)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rebel gunmen leading a charge to oust
President Laurent Kabila attacked the small village of Yumbi, just
40 kilometers (24 miles) south of the capital of Kinshasa,
state-controlled television reported Monday. Few details of the
battle were provided, but National Radio-Television said several
Congolese troops were wounded and a number of Tutsi rebels were
killed. The scale of the fighting was unclear, but rebel forces
withdrew after the fight, the broadcast said, quoting civilians
from the area. (CONGO)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's northern alliance
claimed to have pushed its Islamic opponents out of Mazar-e-Sharif
on Sunday, a day after the Taliban religious militia claimed to
have captured the north's biggest city. The Taliban had said
Mazar-e-Sharif was calm Sunday. Reports on the situation in the
city 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of the Afghan capital could
not immediately be independently confirmed. Indian-based Afghan
Ambassador Masood Khalili, who has remained loyal to the president
the Taliban ousted from the capital two years ago, claimed
Mazar-e-Sharif residents ``rose and took up arms and fought along
with government soldiers'' to push the Taliban out. Khalili said
Taliban casualties were heavy, but had no details or information on
alliance casualties. (AFGHANISTAN)
	   WUHAN, China (AP) _ A powerful Yangtze River flood peak passed
through the major industrial city of Wuhan without incident Monday,
but the misery of serious flooding continued elsewhere in central
China. The Yangtze at Wuhan came within centimeters (inches) of
previous record highs, with water lapping at the tops of sandbagged
dikes, but it did not cause flooding in the city of 7 million
people, said a Wuhan city flood official who gave only his surname.
Downriver in Jiujiang, Jiangxi province, residents and soldiers
guarding weakened dikes prepared for a long, anxious night as the
crest barreled toward the city of 500,000 people. (CHINA-FLOODS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backed into a few remaining
strongholds, ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo fought Monday to
cling to territory in the face of a punishing Serb offensive. With
Western diplomats pushing them to agree to peace talks, Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters skirmished with Serbian forces throughout
the weekend and Monday. Ethnic Albanian sources reported fierce
fighting around Djakovica and the strategic village of Junik, where
the KLA managed to hold its positions. Although one moderate KLA
faction signaled its readiness for negotiations that could lead to
the province regaining autonomy from Serbia, prospects for talks
remained uncertain. U.S. envoy Christopher Hill arrived in
Pristina, capital of Kosovo, Monday to try to push the peace
process forward. (YUGOSLAVIA- KOSOVO)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks pulled back slightly Monday, halting a
modest three-session recovery from the steep downturn of recent
weeks. The Dow Jones industrial average finished 23.17 points _ or
0.2 percent _ lower at 8,574.85 despite overcoming an early
54-point drop and gaining as much as 37 points during the
afternoon. Most popular indexes also suffered minor losses, with a
fairly solid showing by the blue chips masking a weak day for
smaller-company shares. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar rose against the yen Monday but its
gains were limited by fears of intervention by Japanese financial
authorities. The dollar fell against the German mark during
lackluster trading punctuated by the Bank of Canada's intervention
to prop up its faltering currency and the fall of the Mexican peso
to a low for the year. In late New York trading, the dollar was
quoted at 146.15 Japanese yen, up from 146.13 late Friday. The U.S.
currency also was changing hands at 1.7759 German marks, down from
1.7792. (US-DOLLAR)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia received the first, dlrs 300 million
installment of a newly approved World Bank loan on Monday, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The dlrs 1.5 billion loan, which
was approved last week, is part of the dlrs 22.6 billion bailout
that the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the
Japanese government negotiated with Russia in July in an effort to
boost the country's troubled economy. Lenders hope the bailout will
restore investor confidence in Russia, where markets have declined
by 60 percent since the beginning of the year, and buy some time
for the months-old government of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.
But Russian stocks dropped sharply again Monday, amid worries that
the economy is too feeble to withstand another round of selling in
world markets. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Airways PLC said quarterly earnings fell
by 34 percent to 145 million pounds (dlrs 240 million) but that its
results held up well amid problems from the Asian crisis and the
strong British pound. British Airways said pre-tax profits for the
three months ending June 30 compared with earnings of 220 million
pounds in the same period a year earlier, when results were lifted
by a one-time gain of 129 million pounds from the sale of shares
its former partner, US Airways. Disregarding that one-time gain,
British Airways said its profits had risen by 59 percent. Revenues
rose 3 percent to 2.29 billion pounds (dlrs 3.79 billion) for the
April-June period _ the first quarter of British Airways' fiscal
year. The company reported revenues of 2.22 billion pounds in the
same period a year earlier. (EARNS-BRITISH AIRWAYS)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will lose some of its weaker
banks, possibly through mergers, in a much-awaited financial sector
shakeup aimed at reviving the battered economy, the finance
minister said Monday. The bank measures should be announced
Saturday as part of a package of reforms following negotiations
with the International Monetary Fund on the latest installment of
its dlrs 17.2 billion bailout for the Thai economy. Finance
Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda clarified remarks attributed to him
Monday in an interview with the Bangkok Post by saying he did not
mean that three banks would close, but rather that the sector would
be ``rationalized.'' (THAILAND-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ WorldCom Inc. should not be allowed to merge
with MCI unless U.S. regulators receive assurances that the new
company will serve residential telephone customers, a consumer
group asserted Monday. The Consumers Union urged the Federal
Communications Commission, which is reviewing the deal, to reject
the merger if such a legally enforceable commitment is not made.
FCC clearance is the last major regulatory hurdle to the completion
of the dlrs 37 billion takeover _ one of America's biggest mergers.
The Justice Department and European regulators have approved the
deal. The FCC is expected to decide on the merger either later this
summer. (US-MCI-WORLDCOM)

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A small, rented airplane went down in the
jungle of northern Guatemala, killing four people and injuring two,
aviation officials said Monday.
	   Land owner Jose Humberto Sanchez Meneses rented the plane in the
northern city of Coban on Saturday to take friends and relatives to
his ranch in northern Guatemala, where roads often are almost
unpassable, the Civil Aviation department said in a statement.
	   The Cessna plane went down 65 miles (110 kms) north of Guatemala
City, in jungle so dense it took rescuers seven hours to reach the
site.
	   Sanchez Meneses, who was piloting the plane, was killed in the
crash, as was his 4-year-old nephew Alejandro Sanchez Palacios; a
Spanish friend, Miren Martinez Saez del Bur, 23; and a worker who
wasn't identified.
	   Sanchez's brother, Humberto Sanchez Meneses, and sister-in-law,
Mexican citizen Rosa Maria Sanchez de Sanchez, were injured. It
wasn't known how badly.
	   Officials were investigating the cause of the crash.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A group of Sandinistas attacked a
group of former Contras who took over a piece of their land, police
said Monday. Four former Contras were killed and six were wounded
in the shootout.
	   The right-wing, U.S.-backed Contras fought the leftist
Sandinista government in a bloody 1980s war. The two sides agreed
to peace accords that resulted in the Sandinistas' electoral defeat
in 1990.
	   But hostilities remain between the groups, and the latest
manifestation was a shootout Saturday in the village of Las
Plazuelas, 90 miles (150 kms) northeast of the Nicaraguan capital,
Managua.
	   About 200 peasants from a Sandinista cooperative, armed with
assault weapons, shotguns, pistols and hand grenades, tried to
unseat about 70 former Contras who had taken over a part of their
land.
	   Four former Contras were killed and six were wounded, police
said Monday.
	   ___
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ Hundreds of coca leaf farmers began a
march Monday from the country's coca leaf producing region to La
Paz to protest against government eradication of illegal coca
fields.
	   Interior Minister Guido Nayar said the march was funded by
cocaine traffickers but said the government will not interfere
unless there is violence.
	   March organizers say they expected thousands of farmers along
the way to join the march which began in Villa Tunari, 484 miles
(780 kms) from La Paz.
	   About 150,000 farmers depend on coca leaf cultivation for their
livelihood.
	   The Bolivian Government is paying farmers dlrs 2,500 per hectare
(2.47 acres) of old coca plants destroyed voluntarily by farmers.
New coca fields are considered illegal and destroyed without
compensation.
	   Coca leaf is grown in the Andean foothills of Bolivia and Peru.
Most of it is processed into cocaine. Coca leaf has been used for
centuries in Andean countries as a tea and for medicinal and
religious purposes.

Government to allow residents to return to one evacuated town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OLD TOWNE, Montserrat (AP) _ Scientists said Monday they believe
a volcano that has ravaged the Caribbean island of Montserrat is
settling down, and they gave residents permission to return to one
evacuated town.
	   Scientists at the Montserrat Volcano Observatory said the
Soufriere Hills Volcano has not spewed new lava since March 3 and
has not had a violent eruption since January.
	   ``The volcano is no longer erupting, in that there is no longer
lava moving to the earth's surface,'' said Stephen Sparks, chief
scientist at the observatory. ``That looks to be encouraging, at
least for the short term.''
	   On Monday, the government announced residents could return to
Salem, a town on the western coast that was evacuated one year ago,
as soon as work crews finish removing heaps of ash and rinsing the
gray power off buildings. The area includes about 800 homes and Old
Towne, site of the island's last hotel.
	   The cleanup could take from several weeks to three months, said
Richard Aspin, spokesman for Montserrat's Emergency Department.
Scientists also want to install equipment to monitor ash levels
before residents return.
	   ``People are ready to go home,'' Aspin said. ``A lot of people
have been pre-empting this decision and going back to clean up _
there's been optimism for about three months.''
	   A massive rock slide at the volcano's summit on July 3 shook
some of those hopes, but Sparks said the slides were caused by
collapses inside the volcano's fragile dome, not by new eruptions.
	   ``You'll have that kind of activity as the volcano cools, and
because of that the south of the island is still a dangerous
place,'' Sparks said. ``Eventually things will stabilize,
vegetation will take root, and the danger will diminish.''

Governing party supporters riot in town awarded to opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MERIDA, Mexico (AP) _ Members of Mexico's governing party,
infuriated by a court decision giving a mayoral race to an
opposition party, rioted in the town of Tekit and looted the town
hall, the newspaper El Diario de Yucatan reported Monday.
	   Supporters of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, had
been angered when the federal electoral court overruled state
officials and determined that the opposition National Action Party
won a close race there in May elections.
	   Police told El Diario that two PRI members, apparently drunk,
threw bottles and stones Monday evening at the city hall police
station in the town of 8,000 people, some 30 miles (48 kilometers)
southeast of Merida.
	   When police chased them, they fled to the home of the former PRI
mayoral candidate, Francisco Suarez Pina.
	   Police said ``a rain'' of bottles came at them from Suarez
Pina's house and they arrested the politician, taking him to jail.
	   About 20 PRI members, led by relatives of Suarez Pina, raided
the jail and freed the man, who _ according to witnesses _ returned
home and passed out beers to his liberators.
	   Shortly afterward, a group of PRI members returned to the city
hall, looting food stored there for aid programs and setting fire
to furniture and papers, even the national flag from the mayor's
office, El Diario reported.
	   Scores of state and local anti-riot police arrived to quell the
disturbance. Several people, including local police, were injured.
	   On Monday, Gov. Victor Cervera Pacheco, a member of the PRI,
expressed regret at the incidents and called for settling
differences within the law, the government's Notimex news agency
reported.

Japan downgrades economic assessment amid weak consumer spending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Economic Planning Agency downgraded its
assessment of the country's overall economy Tuesday to reflect
vanishing hopes for a recovery in personal consumption.
	   In its monthly report for August, the agency said that flagging
consumer confidence amid rising unemployment has made the overall
economy ``sluggish,'' with economic conditions increasingly severe.
	   The latest appraisal represented a ``slight downgrade of the
nuance'' from ``stagnant,'' an expression the agency had used since
February, said Takafusa Shioya, deputy director-general of the EPA.
	   Shioya, briefing reporters on the report, said the latest
assessment was meant to reflect the fact that hopes for a recovery
in personal spending have disappeared for the time being.
	   The downgrade comes as consumers have become reluctant to spend
while Japan struggles with its worst recession since the end of
World War II.
	   In its August report, the EPA struck the words ``although there
are some signs of recovery'' from its description of personal
spending, saying instead that the decline in real wages is making
people increasingly less inclined to spend money.
	   The EPA also introduced a more detailed description of the
problems confronting the country's labor market, noting that an
increasing number of workers are being forced from their jobs,
illustrating the results of corporate restructuring efforts and the
growing number of business failures.
	   ``Mainly as a result of the increasing number of involuntarily
unemployed, the jobless rate has reached unprecedented levels,''
the latest report said.
	   Japan's jobless rate vaulted to a record high 4.3 percent in
June from the previous high of 4.1 percent in both April and May.
	   Some EPA officials stressed, however, that despite the downgrade
in the assessment of the economy, there was no danger that the
bottom could fall out from under it.
	   ``The agency didn't downgrade the assessment greatly,'' said
Takashi Omori, director of the national research division at the
EPA's research bureau.
	   ``We aren't in a situation where the economy will continuously
slide lower,'' he said.
	   The EPA characterized the economy as sluggish for 20 months
starting in January 1993, and the current conditions in the economy
are ``on the same level or more severe'' than that period, Omori
said.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Two senior army commanders are being
investigated for possible ties to rightist militias suspected of
killing alleged guerrilla sympathizers, authorities said Monday.
	   One of the two officers presides over military forces in and
around the northern oil-refining city of Barrancabermeja, 165 miles
(265 kilometers) northeast of Bogota, site of a May massacre by a
right-wing death squad in which 32 people were killed.
	   Human rights groups have long accused the army of actively
supporting militias that have committed dozens of massacres in an
indirect means of combating leftist rebels.
	   Chief Prosecutor Alfonso Gomez Mendez, without offering
specifics, said the two officers would be questioned.
	   Gen. Fernando Millan, commander of the army's 5th Brigade based
in Barrancabermeja, and Gen. Rito Alejo del Rio, former army
commander for the volatile Uraba region where a paramilitary
campaign has created thousands of refugees over the past two years.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A week after leftist rebels destroyed a
major anti-narcotics base, the chief of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration plans to travel to Colombia to offer beleaguered
security forces moral support.
	   Thomas Constantine plans to arrive Wednesday.
	   At least nine soldiers and police were killed and 127 captured
in the assault by rebels who overran the joint police-military base
at Miraflores, 275 miles (440 kilometers) south of Bogota, said
U.S. embassy spokesman Robert Schmidt.
	   The Aug. 4 assault was one of dozens of attacks by rebels of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, who killed as many
as 143 police and soldiers in one of the largest offensives in the
rebels 34 years fighting the government.
	   The base, used for aerial fumigation of coca crops, was in the
heart of Colombia's southern plains, where the bulk of the
cocaine-producing plant is grown and guerrillas hold sway.
	   ``The FARC is heavily involved in protecting, transporting, and
in some places operating drug labs,'' charged White House drug
policy director Barry McCaffrey Friday while in Bogota for the
swearing-in of President Andres Pastrana.
	   McCaffrey pledged to help rebuild the Miraflores base, Colombian
police said.
	   The guerrillas growing military prowess and links to the drug
trade have increased support among U.S. lawmakers and generals for
stepped up military and anti-narcotics aid.

11 Americans killed in embassy bombing begin journey home

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The flag-shrouded coffins of 11 Americans
killed in the worst terror attack on a U.S. Embassy were solemnly
loaded onto a military aircraft Monday to begin their final journey
home.
	   The 12th American victim, Jean Dalizu, who was married to a
Kenyan, will be buried in her adopted homeland.
	   The explosion Friday killed at least 192 people, including the
12 Americans and 33 Kenyans who worked at the embassy, and injured
almost 5,000 others. A nearly simultaneous attack on the U.S.
Embassy in neighboring Tanzania killed at least 10 people, all
Africans.
	   The Kenyan death toll was lowered Monday from 200 because of a
double counting error between Kenyan and U.S. Embassy officials.
	   The bodies were to be flown to Andrews Air Force Base in
Maryland via Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany, where they arrived
early Tuesday.
	   A military color guard holding flags stood at attention, eight
on either side of a ramp, as the coffins were carried to waiting
vans. They will be kept at the nearby U.S. hospital in Landstuhl
until they're flown home Wednesday.
	   In Nairobi before the journey began, the aluminum coffins were
lifted one by one onto the U.S. Air Force C-141 aircraft. U.S.
Ambassador Prudence Bushnell covered her heart with her right hand
_ still bandaged from the injuries she suffered in the blast.
	   Marine Brig. Gen. Stephen Johnson, Kenyan Foreign Minister
Bonaya Godana and his assistant stood at attention nearby. U.S.
troops saluted farewell.
	   Marine and Navy honor guards carried 10 of the coffins, and a
special Marine unit carried the remains of fallen comrade Sgt.
Jesse N. Aliganga of Tallahassee, Florida.
	   American and Kenyan flags fluttered in a soft breeze sweet with
the perfume of grass and acacia trees. The airport was silent but
for a distant rumbling airplane engine.
	   The most senior American diplomat killed was Consul General
Julian Bartley, who died with his 20-year-old son Jay.
	   ``He had an ability to help people understand that he was there
to help. He was known for that throughout his career,'' U.S.
Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said of the consul general.
	   Watching the coffins file past, Scharf said he was struck by the
enormity of the tragedy.
	   ``I think of the Kenyan secretary who worked in my office,'' he
said. ``I think of the young sergeant that lived above me ... Those
people are gone. We've suffered a terrible loss.''

Geese fly away for this PGA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM COUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ The Sahalee Country Club has called
out the hounds to get rid of a pesky group of Canadian geese before
the PGA Championship begins.
	   Well, make that one hound, an 80-pound (36-kilogram) male of
Airedale mix named Fergus.
	   When the geese see Fergus coming, they can't leave fast enough.
The problem is they won't stay away.
	   ``They were ... all over the place,'' golf course superintendent
Tom Wolff said Monday. ``On the fairways, on the greens, in the
lakes. They make a mess. If you mow the grass without first
cleaning up, it's even a bigger mess.''
	   So Wolff hired Carey Concannon, of Mercer Island, to come to the
course with her dog last week to chase the birds _ about 20 of them
_ away.
	   ``The dog doesn't hurt them,'' Wolff said. ``But the geese think
the dog is a predator, like a coyote, and doesn't want any part of
him.''
	   There were no geese on the course Saturday and Sunday, but six
of them were back Monday. Wolff put in another call to Concannon
and Fergus.
	   ``These geese are smart,'' Concannon said. ``They seem to sense
when the dog isn't going to be around. We hope we can convince them
not to be by the time the tournament starts.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LANGER OUT &LR; : Germany's Bernhard Langer, who complained of
stomach problems at last week's German Open, is skipping the PGA
Championship due to a strained neck.
	   ``I felt the pain immediately upon getting up,'' Langer said.
	   Langer, five-time winner at the German Open, finished in 13th
place Sunday at this year's event.
	   The PGA announced that Jim Carter, Clark Dennis and Robert
Damron were added to the field after Darren Clarke, Bruce Lietzke
and Mark McNulty withdrew.
	   Clarke returned home to be with his wife and the couple's new
baby. Lietzke reported he may have a hernia problem. McNulty didn't
want to play because of an elbow injury.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HOME BOY RETURNS: &LR;  Fred Couples, a native of Seattle, practiced
at Sahalee Monday and said he can't wait to make his return a
permanent one.
	   ``I was lucky to grow up in Seattle,'' said Couples, 38, who now
lives in Dallas.
	   ``I've lived in a lot of cities in my life, but Seattle is my
home. I don't know of a prettier spot than this. I live in Dallas,
but it isn't my home. It's just a spot in the central part of the
country to make my travel easier.''
	   Couples learned to play golf at the Jefferson Park Golf Course
on Seattle's Beacon Hill. The past four years, he has held the Fred
Couples Invitational in the Seattle area, a two-day unofficial
tournament.
	   ``I'll probably be back in Seattle even before I retire from
golf,'' he said. ``In a few years.''
	   With 14 tour victories and dlrs 10 million plus in career
earnings, Couples is rated the state of Washington's greatest
golfer ever. He won the Masters in 1992 and trails only Greg Norman
and Tom Kite on the tour's all-time earnings list.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GLASSON'S BACK: &LR;  For everyone but Mark O'Meara and Lee Janzen,
the PGA Championship is the last chance to win a major. For Bill
Glasson, it's his only chance in another season slowed by injury.
	   Glasson, a seven-time winner on the PGA Tour, was eligible for
all four majors for the first time since 1995. But he had to skip
the Masters and U.S. Open because his elbow had not recovered from
surgery, and he withdrew from the British Open.
	   ``I didn't want to miss this one,'' he said Monday.
	   Glasson has had more surgeries than PGA victories _ two on his
elbow, four on his sinus, four on his knees, one for his lip and
another for his forearm.
	   He played in Atlanta in May and tied for fifth, but then ``my
arm went to Jello'' and he missed two more months. He returned to
the CVS Charity Classic last month and tied for seventh.
	   ``I'm healthier than I've been in a long time,'' said Glasson,
who estimates his left elbow strength at 80 percent. ``This is my
start.''
	   It's a slow start, at that. Glasson plans to play only nine
holes a day until the tournament begins Thursday.
	   ``I don't want to push it,'' he said. ``1999 is going to be my
push year.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; PGA RETURNS: &LR;  The Seattle area has been without a PGA tour
event since Homero Blancas won the Greater Seattle-Everett Classic
at the Everett Country Club in 1966.
	   After that season, the tournament left the region for good,
ending a six-year run.
	   This is the second major in Washington's history. The first was
the 1944 PGA Championship in Spokane that was won by Bob Hamilton.

Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela take gold in taekwondo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARACAIBO, Venezuela (AP) _ Mexico, Cuba and Venezuela took the
gold medals in the taekwondo competition Monday at the Central
American and Caribbean Games.
	   Mexico's Luis Pantoja won the competition in the 62-67 kilos
category and Nelson Saenz of Cuba was the winner in the heavyweight
division of 84 kilos. In women's competition, Venezuela's Nohemar
Leal took the gold in the 55-59 kilos category.
	   In archery, Mexico and Cuba took all four gold medals. Mexico's
Maria Santa Cruz barely edged out her sister Carmen in the 70 meter
compost competition with 328 points. Milena Ferro of Cuba took the
gold in the 70 meter Olympic Shot competition with 308 points.
	   In the men's division, Mexico's Juan Carlos Manjarrez took first
in the 90 meters compost competition with 327 points. Cuba's Juan
Carlos Stevens won the gold in the 90 meter Olympic Shot with 291
points.
	   The gold medal Mexico won Sunday night in the women's 4X200
swimming relay was annulled Monday because only four countries had
participated. Cuba pulled out at the last minute following the
departure of three of its members during training in Puerto Rico.
At least five teams are required to make a competition valid.
	   In another blow to Mexico's team, game officials cancelled the
synchronized swimming and diving competitions. Both are Mexican
strengths.
	   Venezuelan cyclist Daniela Larreal also got disappointing news
when officials said they could not recognize her record time of
12.13 seconds in a preliminary heat of the 200 meter competition
because they did not have an electronic clock operating.
	   The clock is still in the process of being installed.
	   In the women's softball, the Dutch Antilles beat the Bahamas
5-0, boosting their record in the tournament to 1-1. Norinda de la
Cruz blasted a home run to left field.

Tokyo stocks open lower, dollar slips
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices fell early Tuesday led by
banking shares on concern the government could have trouble winning
passage of key banking reform bills. The dollar slipped against the
yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 81.56 yen,
or 0.52 percent, to 15,544.86 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
The average posted its sixth straight decline, dropping 202.75
points, or 1.28 percent, the day before.
	   The U.S. dollar bought 146.47 yen, down 0.18 yen from late
Monday but above its New York rate of 146.15 yen overnight.
	   Opposition lawmakers speaking in Parliament on Monday demanded
incoming Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi change his plans for helping
the banking industry rid itself of some 76.7 trillion yen (dlrs 525
billion) in bad loans.
	   While Obuchi's finance minister has opposed shutting down weaker
banks for fear of upsetting public confidence, his opponents seek
tougher measures.
	   And with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party holding less than a
majority in Parliament's upper house, Obuchi must compromise to get
legislation passed.
	   Concerns that weaker institutions may be forced to close helped
drive down shares of troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.,
which saw shares tumble to as low as 37 yen, down 6 yen from
Monday's close.
	   Share prices below 100 yen are traditionally seen as a warning
sign of a company's imminent demise. Sumitomo Trust and Banking
Corp. announced in June that it was considering a merger with the
debt-plagued bank.
	   Bank shares also dropped as investors fretted special
inspections of banks ending next month by financial authorities
will reveal most to be in worse shape than the banks have admitted.
	   With banks one of the biggest components of the Tokyo stock
market ``the cool situation will continue,'' said Tsuyoshi
Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities Ltd.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section declined 8.13 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,198.96.
It had fallen 18.21 points, or 1.49 percent, on Monday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.155 percent from Monday's close of 1.170, driving
its price up to 112.10 yen from 112.00.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomatic efforts to return ethnic
Albanian and Serb leaders to the negotiating table are inching
forward, despite sporadic clashes in Kosovo province.
	   While U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with Serb and ethnic
Albanian leaders in Pristina Monday, clashes were reported
elsewhere in the Yugoslav province, particularly in areas still
held by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Hill has been mediating between pacifist ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova and leading politician Mehmet Hajrizi, who has close
contacts with secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels, in hopes of
getting the Albanians to rally behind one leader.
	   Hill also met with Yugoslav Vice-Premier Nikola Sainovic.
	   For five months, Serb troops have been fighting the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which seeks independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic of Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs in the
province 9-to-1.
	   But the Albanians remain largely divided between those loyal to
Rugova, and those who support the militants.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources claimed fierce fighting around Djakovica
and the strategic western village of Junik, near the Albanian
border, where the KLA managed to hold its positions.
	   Serb officials said three KLA fighters were killed in a clash
with Serb police in the village of Dura, about 40 kilometers (25
miles) south of Pristina. Authorities there said the KLA attacked a
police patrol and police fired back.
	   The Rugova-allied Kosovo Information Center also claimed close
fighting in the village of Erec, with four Albanians killed and
houses burned. Serbs suffered an undetermined number of casualties.
	   The center also reported several villages were under siege in
the Decane area close to the Albanian border.
	   In another village, Skivjan, Serb forces reportedly gave an
ultimatum to the fighters and residents to give up their weapons
and surrender.

Indians fight to save gold-rich Amazon paradise

<TEXT>
	   EL DORADO, Venezuela (AP) _ The Pemon Indians rolled a huge log
across the highway to block traffic. The tribe, some dressed in red
loin cloths and their faces streaked with paint, was defending its
piece of paradise.
	   Tensions are rising in Venezuela's Amazon rain forests, where
Indians and environmentalists are clashing with mining companies
and government officials who want to exploit some of the richest
gold deposits in Latin America and build towns and tourist hotels
in the wilderness.
	   Rapid economic development ``is going to mean the death of the
jungles and of the indigenous people,'' said Pemon leader Jose Luis
Gonzalez.
	   Workers with chain saws and bulldozers recently started cutting
a swath through the forest in southeastern Venezuela for a 470-mile
(750 kms) high-voltage electricity line that will be the lifeline
of the projects.
	   During the last two weeks, about 400 Indians trying to stop the
line periodically blocked traffic on a highway used by construction
crews as national guardsmen stood by in riot gear.
	   The dlrs 110 million line is to provide hydroelectric power to
northern Brazil, remote communities in eastern Venezuela and scores
of gold mining companies eager to work the pristine Imataca rain
forest reserve.
	   They're being drawn by gold deposits thought to be worth
billions of dollars and that over the centuries have attracted
explorers such as Sir Walter Raleigh looking for the legendary
golden city of ``El Dorado.''
	   Last year, President Rafael Caldera authorized large-scale
logging and gold and diamond mining in nearly half of Imataca.
	   The 9 million acre (3.6 million-hectare) reserve _ twice the
size of Switzerland _ sits in southern Bolivar state and boasts a
variety of wildlife that few places in the world can match:
jaguars, pumas, red howler monkeys, bearded bluebells, neon-colored
butterflies and the world's largest eagle, the endangered harpy.
	   Imataca ``is one of the most gorgeous endemic forests I've ever
seen,'' said Mary Lou Goodwin of the Audubon Society in Venezuela.
Nature lovers and scientists from around the world come to visit
it.
	   The power line also will slice through Canaima National Park,
one of about 100 U.N.-designated World Heritage Sites. The park is
home to the mysterious flat-topped mountains that inspired Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle's classic adventure story ``The Lost World.''
	   Government officials see the region as a vast untapped source of
wealth that could help alleviate the poverty that afflicts more
than half of Venezuela's population. Thousands of jobs would be
created through projects including a proposed 500-room hotel to be
built on sacred Pemon lands in Canaima.
	   Authorities deny their plans will wreak widespread environmental
and cultural destruction. They contend the damage should actually
decrease since large companies will help control thousands of
illegal miners who poison rivers with mercury, knock down trees
with high-pressure water hoses and create lawless boom towns rife
with drugs, prostitution and violence.
	   ``There are a lot of unfounded fears,'' said the Environmental
Ministry's Santos Carrasco.
	   Environmentalists and Indians say they aren't opposed to all
development in the jungles, but the government plan is too much,
too fast, and officials won't properly regulate the mining and
logging companies.
	   Bringing large-scale development to still mostly unexplored
Imataca is ``sort of like destroying a treasure chest before you
even know what you're destroying,'' said Atossa Soltani of
California-based Amazon Watch.
	   Bulldozers already have leveled some of the Indians' yucca,
corn, banana and pineapple crops. The Pemons and three other tribes
say they plan to keep shutting down the highway until the
government halts the electricity project.
	   They also want officials to overturn last year's mining and
logging decree, grant them title to what they say are millions of
acres of their ancestral lands and recognize their right to decide
the future of the region.
	   Pemon leader Lloyd Henrito said, ``We're the owners of this
land. We were here before Colombus, but in the eyes of the
Venezuelan government we are nothing.''

 &UR; Laos looks for way out of Asian economic quagmire &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BK102,104 &QL; 
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) _ After a decade of experimenting with the
market economy, communist Laos is finding out that capitalism isn't
quite what it was cracked up to be.
	   Especially during the current economic crisis in Asia, which has
also infected this landlocked, low-profile nation where per capita
income hovers below dlrs 400.
	   ``It's a tough time for us,'' said Chantavong Saignasith, head
of the State Planning Committee, who stressed that now was the time
to explore alternative strategies to pull Laos out of an economic
quagmire.
	   Laos switched from a centralized economy to a market-oriented
one in line with changes in neighboring Vietnam and eastern Europe.
But the capitalist road was hardly without its potholes.
	   The country came under stiff criticism last June during a visit
by the International Monetary Fund for allowing its macro-economy
to deteriorate in recent years.
	   In the 12 months through June 1998, the country's
non-convertible kip currency depreciated by 70 percent against the
U.S. dollar. The depreciation, coupled with high food prices
resulting from heavy flooding the previous year, has led to a sharp
rise in inflation _ to about 60 percent by mid-year.
	   The IMF also noted that net reserves had fallen by more than
dlrs 30 million during 1997 and the reserve position had declined
to 2 1/2 months of imports. The banking system, it said, was unable
to correct major weaknesses in banks just as state commercial banks
faced severe solvency problems.
	   Although authorities refused to provide details of the IMF's
prescriptions, Phiane Philakone, deputy governor at the Lao State
Bank, insisted that the dosage was just too much for his poor
country to swallow.
	   ``We will develop our economy in a way that is compatible with
our social, cultural and environmental needs,'' said Phiane,
sounding like a born-again socialist. ``If it's slower than what
other would like to see, then so be it.''
	   Instead, Chantavong, the planning chief, is looking to reduce
dependence on imports by producing basic consumer items and
identifying a niche sector in the rural sector that could give Laos
some advantages in export over neighboring countries.
	   This means farmers would have to be plugged into a modern
economic system, said Chantavong, who admitted the bold move won't
be easy since most practice subsistence agriculture.
	   ``Their supermarkets are in the forest. We have to know the
consequences if we want to subject them to a system that might not
allow them to turn back to their ways,'' he said.
	   He noted that since many grow their own rice, brew their beer
and catch fish from local ponds, the Lao population in general has
not been as harshly hit by the economic recession as more developed
nations like neighboring Thailand.
	   And on the monetary front, said Phian, the government is working
with international agencies on streamlining the banking system and
recapitalization.
	   ``We believe this will subject our banking system to
international standards and perhaps instill the necessary
confidence in the financial system,'' said Phian.
	   Observers say that turning things around will not be easy.
	   The country's exports declined by 9.5 percent while imports
increased by 15 percent last year, according to the United Nations.
	   Demand by Thailand for hydroelectric power, seen by some as
Laos's future economic salvation, has also dropped as that country
struggles with its own economic and fiscal crisis.
	   Vientiane has yet to secure a deal with Thailand, the main
buyer, over the purchase of hydroelectric power from the dlrs 1.2
billion Nam Thuen II project.
	   Thailand accounted for nearly 40 percent of dlrs 6.7 billion in
total foreign investment since 1988 when the Vientiane government
did away with the centralized economy. Over half of the country's
imports comes from Thailand, which is also an important export
destination for Laos's goods.
	   ``So when Thailand sneezes, Laos catches a cold,'' said Han
Luther, a German economist working with the government.
	   Furthermore, productivity of the Lao workforce is only 60
percent of that in southern China and Vietnam, while the labor cost
is 32 percent higher than southern China's and about 40 percent
higher than Vietnam's.
	   This combination, said Luther, amounts to a home-grown crisis
that has to be addressed.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rescue teams continue to pour in, eager to
save victims of the U.S. embassy bombing in Nairobi. But they fear
there is no one left to save.
	   Investigators were also pouring into Nairobi and into Tanzania,
where the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam was hit Friday by a nearly
simultaneous blast.
	   The investigators were luckier. They had a witness to talk to: A
Kenyan guard at the Nairobi embassy survived the bombing.
	   His picture was on the front page of the East African Standard
Tuesday, along with an account of his confrontation with the
bombers.
	   ``He resisted heroically,'' U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said in Washington.
	   The newspaper said the guard, Joash Okindo, confronted men in
the rear parking lot. One threw a grenade. Foley said the guard ran
away, just before their truck exploded.
	   The Standard said it talked to Okindo before he was taken out of
the country on a U.S. medical evacuation flight to Germany.
	   And in Tanzania, a dozen people, including Sudanese and Iraqis
were detained. But U.S. officials played down the importance of the
roundup.
	   Israel army radio also signaled a possible break in the case. In
a report from Nairobi, it said investigators suspect the bombers
used the sophisticated plastic explosive Semtex.
	   The FBI says finding out what kind of explosives were used and
how would be critical to the investigation.
	   So would an informant, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
on Monday offered a dlrs 2 million reward for information leading
to the capture of the ``cowards that committed this act.''
	   Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers, the first professional
search-and-rescue team to reach Nairobi after the bombing,
continued to dig for a woman named Rose.
	   Her voice fell silent Sunday, but they heard a tapping noise
Monday morning that spurred them on. By nightfall, however, there'd
been silence for hours.
	   Titus Ngwele, Red Cross coordinator at the scene, said the
Israelis lowered a microphone into the debris to check whether Rose
was breathing late Monday.
	   ``They weren't sure whether she was or not. She hasn't spoken
today. But they're still working to get her out and still hoping
that she's alive,'' he said.
	   The bombing in Nairobi was the deadliest attack ever on a U.S.
embassy, killing more than 200 people and injuring some 5,000.
	   In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
offered a dlrs 2 million reward for information that helps find
those responsible. But even as investigators followed several
leads, Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretary of state for
management, said U.S. authorities had received one to two dozen
threats of further bombs since Friday's attacks.
	   In Nairobi, university students marched to the bomb site Monday
for a candlelight vigil.
	   ``Go Fight Americans in America,'' said one sign.
	   U.S., Kenyan and Tanzanian investigators are playing their cards
close to their chest.
	   ``We will not confirm or deny the existence of evidence in this
criminal inquiry,'' said an American diplomat in Dar es Salaam,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   In Nairobi, the head of the Kenyan side of the investigation,
Army Maj. Gen. George Agoi, said he hadn't even talked to the FBI.
	   ``The Americans are here handling their side, and we are
handling our side,'' he said.
	   The rescue efforts _ haphazard at first _ may have destroyed
evidence at the two bomb sites, but U.S. officials said it was
inevitable because the victims came first.
	   ``Obviously the first priority is finding people alive and then
to recover bodies,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf.
	   No one has been pulled alive out of the rubble since Saturday.
Later Monday, the flag-shrouded coffins of 11 American victims were
solemnly loaded onto a military aircraft to begin their final
journey home. The twelfth American victim will be buried in Kenya.
	   The United States is bringing in a Navy Seabees construction
battalion in the next few days to help with the recovery.
	   ``If there are still missing victims, that will be their first
priority,'' said Navy Cmdr. Gordon Hume.
	   The Seabees are part of a 200-strong U.S. military task force
deployed in Nairobi. The task force includes a 20-person medical
team and a crisis response team to counsel people, Hume said.

 &UR; Laos eager to build dam in face of criticism &QL; 
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Regardless of what anybody says, Laos
is more determined than ever to become the battery of Southeast
Asia through its dlrs 1.2 billion Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric dam,
the country's largest ever development project.
	   Hoping for an annual income of dlrs 250 million to help
alleviate poverty, Laos is pushing ahead with the dam which critics
say will destroy the environment and displace about 800 families.
	   A coalition of 14 environmental groups recently called on
Thailand to forgo agreement to purchase power from the dam, citing
economic viability, as well as environmental and humanitarian
reasons.
	   The group said Thailand needed to reassess its power demand in
light of the current economic crisis, which has slowed industrial
growth.
	   The NT2 Consortium, which is building the dam, dismissed the
allegations, saying Laos affected people will be adequately
compensated and the Thai economy will be back on track in about two
years.
	   The consortium is looking to the World Bank to unlock loans from
commercial lenders by providing the controversial project a
``political risk guarantee.''
	   ``We expect to receive a final appraisal from the World Bank by
next June and begin construction by the end of next year,'' said
Khamleuang Sayarath, the Lao government's NT2 project director.
``The bank has been with us every step of the way and we are
positive it will come through for us.''
	   The bank, however, has been tight-lipped, having been severely
criticized in the past for backing dams that have wrought
environmental destruction.
	   Other dams are being planned or built in Laos, which has few
other income-producing resources. But the question of who will buy
the electricity weighs heavily in Asia's economically depressed
times.
	   ``We are talking about a project that will begin generating
electricity at the earliest in 2004. The situation should have
improved by then,'' said NTZ Consortium Director Jean-Christophe
Devallet.
	   Besides Thailand, Laos hopes that one day Vietnam and Cambodia
will also be buying its electricity.

	   PERTH AMBOY, New Jersey (AP) _ Before refineries lined the New
Jersey Turnpike _ in truth, before New Jersey existed; before Peter
was Great or Washington was born; before steam engines or
``Robinson Crusoe''_ before any of these things, the proprietors
ruled.
	   There were 12 men, most of them from London. Most would never
set foot in the New World. But they owned half of what would become
New Jersey, 1.1 million acres (440,000 hectares) of verdant field
and forest and pristine shoreline.
	   All but a smattering of those lands were sold off long ago, but
their corporation survived, its shares handed down from generation
to generation.
	   It is now 314 years old, the oldest continuously operated
corporation in the United States. But not for long. A court will
soon dissolve the East Jersey Board of Proprietors, and a vestige
of colonial America will be gone forever.
	   ``It was very traumatic for a number of members. It was all done
with a heavy heart,'' says Frederick A. Gerken, the board's
registrar.
	   The board has fallen victim to a very modern malady: Its
shareholders, most of them elderly, are afraid they may face legal
liability for environmental and other problems on lands the board
owns.
	   The age of the board's members is in itself a problem. For
hundreds of years, shares were kept within families, but sadly, in
the 1990s, the allure of being part of history is not what it once
was.
	   ``The grandchildren who might have become involved, well,
really, it doesn't mean anything to them,'' Gerken says.
	   The breakup wasn't easy. The board is not chartered by the state
_ it PREDATES the state _ and it took a while to determine that a
court could terminate the corporation. The court should act in few
months.
	   There was also the matter of dispersing the board's assets.
	   Its real estate operations _ including the rights to any
remaining lands _ were sold to the state for dlrs 300,000,
according to Jim Hall, assistant commissioner of the Department of
Environmental Protection.
	   Its sole building, the surveyor general's two-room brick office
in Perth Amboy, was sold to that city for a dollar.
	   And its greatest treasure, more than 300 years of maps and
records, was donated to the state archives in Trenton.
	   When they are made available to the public in a year or two,
these papers will offer a window into history. Most of them are
deeds, recording the sale of land marked by a prominent oak tree,
or the course of a creek.
	   But there is also the last will and testament of one Simon Roude
from March 26, 1689, ``being very sick of body but of perfect mind,
I do bequeath my body unto the earth for decent burrial and my soul
unto God who gave it. Nextly it is my will that after my deceasse
my wife will have the benefit of my housing land and meadow ...''
	   And there is the court record of ``Sambo the Negro,'' who was
charged with burning his master's barn in 1667. He was acquitted,
but that was not the end of his troubles. The court levied costs of
5 pounds, 3 shillings and 8 pence, which his master refused to pay,
so Sambo was sold.
	   And there is a large red portfolio containing, among other
things, two 3 1/2-foot-wide (1-meter-wide) pieces of parchment _
the words ``This indenture'' in black lettering inches (several
centimeters) tall, followed by streams of tiny script.
	   This is the original deed for all of East New Jersey, the birth
certificate of the East Jersey Board of Proprietors.
	   In 1664, King Charles II granted rights to what is now New
Jersey to his brother, the Duke of York, who then divided those
lands. The west went to Lord John Berkeley, and the east to Sir
George Carteret.
	   When they died, under the terms of their wills their lands were
sold to retire their debts.
	   The 12 men who bought East Jersey in 1682 were a prosperous lot,
including a goldsmith, two skinners, a draper, a tailor. The best
known was William Penn, the Quaker who already had been deeded
Pennsylvania.
	   But the cost was steep: 4,800 pounds. So the proprietors brought
in 12 more men, most of them Scots, to share the burden; the
corporation's first meeting was in 1684. Later, the shares were
split 4-for-1, bringing the total to 96.
	   Until 1702, the proprietors were the law in East Jersey, but
then they ceded the right to govern to Queen Anne, and contented
themselves with selling and renting the land.
	   Like most landlords, the proprietors were not always popular.
There were riots when the board tried to collect ``quit-rents''
from settlers who were obligated to pay so much per acre of farm or
wood land or city lots.
	   Maxine Lurie, a professor who teaches New Jersey history at
Seton Hall University, says the Revolutionary War ended the
proprietorships that owned Pennsylvania and Maryland.
	   But the New Jersey boards survived _ because among their number
were supporters of the revolutionary cause, because so many were
prominent people, because they were willing to change with the
times.
	   ``Here we had an organization that seems to come out of feudal
times, and it becomes a modern corporation,'' Lurie says. ``It's
kind of a strange transformation, but that's what happens.''
	   In the 1790s, she says, the board began a rapid sale of its
holdings.
	   ``People throughout New Jersey are stealing their lumber,
they're squatting on their land. People are taking it from them
piecemeal. They might as well sell,'' Lurie says.
	   Over the years, the proprietors were rewarded with a dozen
dividends of 5,000 or 10,000 acres each, and four of cash.
	   Gradually, the board's primary responsibility turned to title
research, helping to certify that sellers had title to land that
was being sold, using records that extended back to the original
East Jersey deed.
	   Still, the proprietors met every year, on the third Tuesday of
May, to sort through the year's business. Shares were bought and
sold, though the proprietors have been circumspect when asked about
the price.
	   Among the shareholders are prominent families like that of
former Gov. Thomas Kean. Fewer than half live in New Jersey, and
some live in Europe.

Bison hats, bags, vests, shoes becoming new niche industry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-US-Bison Ranch &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMES A. CARLSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PACKWAUKEE, Wisconsin (AP) _ Like tribal hunters of centuries
ago, bison rancher Georgia Derrick follows simple logic _ waste
not, want not _ in turning buffalo hides, skulls and other
byproducts into marketable items.
	   ``It's just really important that we do what the Native
Americans did, which is use everything from the animal,'' says
Derrick, who raises buffalo on a sprawling ranch in central
Wisconsin.
	   In a barn workshop, she uses tanned hides to make hats,
handbags, vests and coats, some with polished leather surfaces and
others covered with springy, fluffy buffalo fur.
	   Her business is part of a growing segment of the bison industry.
As meat sales rise 20 percent a year, companies are turning hides,
skulls and woven buffalo fur into a niche industry of its own.
	   Ranchers who might make about dlrs 1,000 from a bison's meat can
more than double their take by selling items made from other parts
of the animal.
	   ``When we started this business in 1994, well over half of the
hides were discarded, left to rot,'' said Tad Swanson, a vice
president with shoemaker H.S. Trask and Co. in Bozeman, Montana.
	   Trask now buys bison hides by the thousands and makes about
80,000 pairs of shoes and boots from them a year. Most sales are
through retail outlets such as Florsheim, Nordstrom and Dillard's.
Others are through catalogs such as L.L. Bean. The shoes run about
dlrs 140 a pair.
	   ``The leather itself is softer to the touch and it kind of molds
nicely to your feet,'' said San Francisco architect Greg Warner,
who owns a few pair.
	   Bison products also have become a cottage industry for
craftspeople. Ruth Hoffman of Dallas uses the animal's fur _ known
for its warmth, light weight and durability _ to produce knitwear
such as mittens, hats, sweaters and coats, all in the natural brown
color of bison.
	   Some items are made from only the soft downy fleece that grows
beneath the buffalo's coarse outer hair. Others have a combination
of both types of fur.
	   ``It's comparable to a very nice cashmere,'' she said. ``I feel
there's a very good market for it in the future.''
	   Larry Belitz of Hot Springs, South Dakota, takes the traditional
approach to his work with bison products. The former schoolteacher
studied tribal lore to find out how to hand-tan hides the way
Indians once did.
	   His buffalo-skin teepees are on display at several museums, and
he sells many other bison products, from leather goods to toy
horses fashioned from a pair of hoof bones.
	   ``We even sell the buffalo chips,'' he said. ``We don't
advertise at all, it's word of mouth.''
	   That's the same way Derrick's business developed.
	   An experienced leather worker, she was making bison products in
Denver before she and her husband, James Atten, were married in
1988. He had a bison herd on his Wisconsin farm, which has grown to
105 head, plus several dozen calves born this spring.
	   ``More and more people wanted me to make things for them. I
couldn't do it all,'' she said. ``I thought the demand is here ...
maybe it's time to really develop this business and get some other
people involved.''
	   In the past two years, she used a state farm-development grant
of dlrs 28,070 to train workers and link up with Wisconsin buffalo
farmers who could benefit from having byproducts used instead of
wasted.
	   Derrick sells her bison products at a gift shop on her ranch and
through a catalog. Her products include a trooper's hat for dlrs
125, an dlrs 85 flap-front purse and men's or women's vests for
dlrs 475. Small buffalo-hide bags run as little as dlrs 12.
	   She declined to give sales figures for her BisonRidge Ranch and
Leather Co. ``We're an emerging business. Everything that we make
goes right back into materials,'' she said.
	   Such bison products are developing into a huge growth area for
ranchers, said Sam Albrecht, executive director of the Denver-based
National Bison Association.
	   The association, with 2,100 members, estimates that 20,000 bison
went to slaughter in the United States in 1997.
	   It's a tiny fraction of the 135,000 beef cattle slaughtered
daily, but the bison industry is growing 20 percent a year,
Albrecht said.
	   By making use of byproducts, he said, ``you add extra value to
the bison itself, even when it's on the hoof, which is, in my mind
at least, more respectful.''

Mexican bishop says pope should cancel trip if Chiapas isn't

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ The bishop of a city
in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas is urging Pope John Paul
II to cancel his trip to Mexico in January unless an Indian
rebellion here is settled first.
	   But higher-ranking church officials say there are no plans to
scrap the trip.
	   Roman Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz in the mountain city of San
Cristobal de las Casas said the trip provides a ``remote but not
non-existent'' opportunity to resolve the uprising by the Zapatista
National Liberation Army, a guerrilla group that demands greater
rights for Mexico's poor Indians.
	   Peace talks with the group have been stalled for two years,
while gunmen linked to either side have targeted sympathizers of
the other.
	   ``If there isn't a more or less peaceful situation in the
country, a visit by the Holy Father wouldn't be appropriate,
because it could appear to be an approval of the lack of respect
for human dignity,'' Ruiz said in an interview Sunday night.
	   The pope has announced plans to visit Mexico on Jan. 22-25.
Those don't include a trip to Chiapas state.
	   The president of Mexico's Roman Catholic Episcopal Conference
dismissed suggestions the trip be canceled.
	   ``The arrival of Pope John Paul II now cannot be halted; only
God can halt it,'' said Bishop Luis Morales Reyes, who was visiting
Chiapas on Monday.
	   Ruiz said the government appeared to be trying to wrap up loose
ends before the pope's trip: ``If someone comes to your house to
visit, you'll at least sweep, won't you?''
	   In June, Ruiz ended his efforts to mediate a resolution to the
conflict, claiming there was growing government ``aggression''
against his church. The mediation commission he led also disbanded.

Buffalo, not dairy cows, roam on this Wisconsin farm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-US-Bison Goods
 &UR; By JAMES A. CARLSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PACKWAUKEE, Wisconsin (AP) _ The farm looks like most others in
central Wisconsin, except for the big, shaggy buffalo bulls grazing
contentedly on a wooded hillside next to the barn.
	   Then there's the huge, ornamental steel gate _ built for
something much bigger than most farm stock _ that guards the
entrance to BisonRidge Ranch and Leather Co.
	   Instead of Holsteins or Guernseys, this farm is home to a herd
of 105 American buffalo, plus a healthy batch of calves born this
spring.
	   The calving had started when a cold front arrived this spring
and the pregnant buffalo ``held their calves'' until better
weather, says Georgia Derrick, who runs the ranch with her husband,
James Atten.
	   That's one of many ways the bison, a native species of North
America, differs from domestic cattle.
	   Another is the low fat and cholesterol in the meat. With the
industry on the upswing, bison meat is available in many
restaurants and grocery stores, especially in areas near major
buffalo ranches and processing plants.
	   In the United States, the bison population that was almost wiped
out by hunters a century ago has climbed to 250,000, in herds
ranging up to the thousands on western ranches of media mogul Ted
Turner.
	   In Wisconsin, about 100 producers raise some 5,000 head of
bison.
	   Derrick, formerly of Denver, met her husband at a bison
convention in 1987. She had a leather business and was making bison
products; Atten had five bison on his Wisconsin farm. He now splits
time between the ranch and his real-estate business in the Chicago
area.
	   They sell some buffalo meat but focus mostly on raising bison as
breeding stock.
	   They've expanded the farm near Buffalo Lake to nearly 1,000
acres (400 hectares) and are switching fields that once grew corn
and other crops to grasses that can best feed bison.
	   They want to create a rotational grazing system, using the
buffalo's natural habits of moving from place to place to feed _
but within a network of permanent and portable fencing.
	   ``We're headed to sustainable pasture, with a lot of refuges for
wildlife,'' Derrick says. ``We want to raise our animals in harmony
with the others.''

Ninth-seeded Alex Corretja survives three-set tiebreaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS results of evening matches &QL; 
 &UR; By TERRY KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Alex Corretja's first-round match Monday at
the ATP Championship was no trip to the beach, although that's
where the Spaniard has been spending time lately.
	   Corretja, playing his first hardcourt match since March _ and
his first match of any kind after a three-week vacation _ needed
three sets and more than 2 1/2 hours to outlast Alex O'Brien 6-3,
6-7 (3-7), 7-6 (9-7).
	   ``It was good because it was good for my physical condition and
my mental game because after like 20 days off, it is always
difficult to make a comeback,'' Corretja said.
	   ``But today, for me, it was my first match, so I was hungry to
be on the court and hungry to play tennis.''
	   Corretja, ranked 12th in the ATP Tour rankings released Monday,
said he was invigorated by his vacation in Barcelona.
	   ``I was just having some fun and just trying to go to the beach
and to the pool,'' Corretja said. ``Right now I feel fresh again.''
	   O'Brien, who has never been ranked higher than 30th, was happy
to have pressed Corretja to a third-set tiebreaker.
	   ``I did a lot of positive things. I thought it was a good day
because I put a lot of pressure on him,'' O'Brien said. ``I'm my
biggest enemy ... today I didn't defeat myself.''
	   As one of the Mercedes Super 9 tournaments, the dlrs 2.45
million Great American Insurance ATP Championship has a spectacular
field. Of the top 10 players on tour, only sixth-ranked Greg
Rusedski, sidelined by an injury, is absent.
	   Pete Sampras is the defending champion and No. 1 seed. Marcelo
Rios, who took over the tour's top ranking from Sampras on Monday,
is seeded No. 2.
	   The tournament lost one seeded player Monday when Jeff Tarango
defeated 13th-seeded Alberto Berasategui of Spain 7-5, 6-2.
	   In other matches involving seeded players, No. 12 Albert Costa
of Spain beat Sebastian Grosjean of France 1-6, 6-4, 6-1 and No.16
Cedric Pioline of France beat Ramone Delgado of Paraguay 7-6, 6-3.
	   In other afternoon matches, Vince Spadea beat Justin Gimelstob
3-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-2; Jan-Michael Gambill beat Olivier Delaitre of
France 6-1, 6-3; Tommy Haas of Germany beat Jim Courier 7-6 (7-3),
7-6 (7-5); and Guillaume Raoux of France defeated Wolfgang Schranz
of Austria 7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 6-4.
	   Also, Magnus Larsson of Sweden beat Gianluca Pozzi of Italy 6-4,
7-5; Thomas Johansson of Sweden beat Wayne Black of Zimbabwe 7-6
(7-3), 7-5; and Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands beat countryman
Sjeng Schalken 1-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-2).
	   In evening matches, Todd Martin defeated Fabrice Santoro of
France 6-1, 6-4 and Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic defeated
Jason Stoltenberg of Australia 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (10-8).

Ship recovers Titanic hull plate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A rusting piece of the Titanic's
hull was raised to the surface Monday, 86 years after the doomed
ocean liner struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic.
	   The 20-ton starboard hull plate was lifted aboard a research
vessel stationed above the Titanic wreck about 375 miles (600
kilometers) southeast of Newfoundland.
	   ``A big piece of the Titanic is successfully aboard the ocean
ship Abeille,'' said Mike Consentino, a spokesman for the Discovery
Channel, the salvage's co-sponsor.
	   RMS Titanic Inc., which owns the rights to the ship's salvage,
said in a release a conservation expert was on the research vessel,
overseeing efforts to preserve the 21.5-foot-by-13-foot
(6.5-meter-by-four-meter) plate.
	   ``This piece will be very helpful in increasing our
understanding about how Titanic broke up after she sank,'' said
David Livingstone, a naval architect and Titanic expert.
	   The plate contains portals and is from the first-class section
of the ship.
	   Consentino said it was found about 16 kilometers from the rest
of the wreck.
	   The team tried in 1996 to raise the same piece, but lost it when
rough seas forced it back to the ocean floor after it was raised
close to the surface.
	   The crew planned on lifting the piece using gas-filled bags in a
difficult procedure that requires steady positions in the usually
rough North Atlantic.
	   An earlier attempt to raise the piece apparently failed Sunday
when something went wrong.
	   ``We at RMS Titanic are extraordinarily pleased to recover this
immense piece of Titanic's history today,'' George Tulloch, the
group's president, said in the release.
	   ``While the Titanic can never be resurrected, this section from
Titanic's hull will serve as a dramatic monument to Titanic's
memory for eternity.''
	   The lift was part of a scientific expedition looking at what
happened on Titanic when it struck an iceberg on April 15, 1912,
and sank, killing more than 1,500 of the 2,200 people on board.
	   Scientists believe the quality of the liner's metal and rivets
used to hold the plates in place might have played an important
role in the sinking.

Sugiyama winner on opening day

<TEXT>
	   MANHATTAN BEACH, California (AP) _ Ai Sugiyama has more than
money on her mind.
	   The highest ranked player to see action at the Acura Classic on
Monday, Sugiyama defeated Frenchwoman Anne-Gaelle Sidot 6-4, 6-3.
	   The Japanese player passed the dlrs 1 million mark in career
earnings last week when she upset Steffi Graf before losing in the
quarterfinals to Monica Seles.
	   ``Making dlrs 1 million has never been my goal,'' Sugiyama said
Monday. ``Playing better and with more consistency is what I want
to do. I have to be tougher.
	   ``My confidence is much better. Even playing against Monica, I
have confidence.''
	   In other matches in the dlrs 450,000 hardcourt tournament being
played at the Manhattan Country Club, Magui Serna of Spain defeated
Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand 6-7 ( 5-7), 7-5, 6-1; Julie
Halard-Decugis of France eliminated Kimberly Po 6-2, 6-4 and
Barbara Paulus of Austria outlasted Japan's Naoko Sawamatsu 3-6,
6-3, 6-2.
	   The top four seeds, including No. 1 Martina Hingis received
first-round byes.
	   Venus Williams pulled out of the doubles because of tendinitis
in her left knee which had been bothering her in the last two
weeks. Williams was not scheduled to play singles here.

Orioles edge Devil Rays; Yankees rout Twins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ Baltimore's Eric Davis had two
hits and an RBI to extend his club-record hitting streak to 26
games as the surging Orioles held off the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 2-1
Monday night for their sixth victory in seven games.
	   Juan Guzman (8-12) allowed three hits in 5 2-3 innings to
improve to 2-0 since the Orioles, who are a major league-best 23-6
since the All-Star break, obtained him in a trade with Toronto.
	   Reliever Jessie Orosco ended an eighth-inning threat by retiring
Wade Boggs and Fred McGriff with the tying run at second base, and
Armando Benitez worked the ninth for his 16th save in 17
opportunities.
	   Davis, who has hit in 28 of 29 since the break, went 2-for-4 and
gave Baltimore a 1-0 lead with RBI double off Tony Saunders (3-11)
in the first inning.
 &UR; Yankees 7, Twins 3
	   In New York, Hideki Irabu allowed just two hits in seven innings
and New York moved 56 games above .500 for the first time in 37
years.
	   The Yankees are 85-29 and remain on pace to break the
single-season record of 116 wins by the 1906 Chicago Cubs. New York
has won five straight and improved to 43-8 at home.
	   The Twins were making their first visit to Yankee Stadium since
David Wells pitched a perfect game against them on May 17. Irabu
hit leadoff hitter Otis Nixon in the first, but didn't give up a
hit until Marty Cordova's leadoff single in the fifth.
	   The last Yankees team to go 56 games over .500 was the 1961
World Series champions, who finished 109-53.
	   Scott Brosius and Bernie Williams homered to give a Irabu (11-5)
a 7-0 lead after seven innings.
 &UR; Angels 6, Tigers 2
	   In Detroit, Gary DiSarcina's double triggered a four-run second
inning and Omar Olivares won for the first time since June 17 as
Anaheim handed Detroit its seventh straight loss.
	   Olivares (6-8), who had lost his previous six decisions, pitched
seven strong innings as the Angels won for just the fourth time in
11 games. He allowed two runs and six hits, struck out six and
walked four.
	   The victory moved Anaheim within 1{ games of first-place Texas
in the AL West.
	   Luis Gonzalez hit two homers for the Tigers to raise his season
total to a career-high 16.
 &UR; White Sox 5, Athletics 3
	   In Chicago, Robin Ventura hit a two-run homer and Jim Parque won
for the first time since June 15 as the Chicago White Sox beat the
Oakland Athletics.
	   Ventura, who entered the game in a 4-for-26 slump, hit his 13th
homer of the season in the sixth to give Chicago a 4-3 lead and
help the White Sox win for the fifth time in seven games.
	   Parque (3-4), winless in his six previous starts, gave up three
runs and four hits in six innings. Bill Simas pitched the ninth for
his 13th save.
	   Kenny Rogers (11-5) failed in his second attempt to get his
100th career victory, giving up five runs and eight hits in eight
innings.

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Todd Hundley hit his first home run this season
and Al Leiter pitched seven strong innings Monday night, leading
the New York Mets to a 4-2 win over the St. Louis Cardinals.
	   Leiter (11-4) helped silence Mark McGwire, who leads the majors
with 46 home runs. McGwire struck out three times _ twice against
Leiter and once against Turk Wendell with a runner on in the eighth
_ as the Cardinals' five-game winning streak ended.
	   Hundley, who missed the first half of the season while
recuperating from elbow and shoulder surgeries, hit a two-run homer
in the third off Matt Morris (3-2) to snap a 2-2 tie. Hundley, who
hit 30 homers last year and set a major league record for catchers
with 41 in 1996, hadn't homered in 77 at-bats.
	   John Olerud's hitting streak stopped at 23 games, one shy of the
Mets club record set by Hubie Brooks in 1984. Olerud went 0-for-3
with a walk and scored a run.
 &UR; Astros 5, Brewers 2 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Sean Berry hit a tiebreaking three-run homer in the
eighth and Billy Wagner pitched a perfect ninth for his first save
since being struck in the head by a line drive.
	   Berry, who was 3-for-4, hit the first pitch thrown to him by
Chad Fox (0-3) after Jeff Bagwell and Moises Alou singled.
	   Alou added a two-run homer and was part of a key defensive play
as the Astros won their fourth straight.
	   Wagner picked up his 23rd save in his second appearance since he
suffered a concussion and cut ear when he was struck by a liner on
July 15 at Arizona.
	   Scott Elarton (1-0) pitched a hitless eighth for Houston.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rescue teams continue to pour in, eager to
save victims of the U.S. embassy bombing in Nairobi. But they fear
there is no one left to save.
	   Investigators were also pouring into Nairobi and into Tanzania,
where the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam was hit Friday by a nearly
simultaneous blast.
	   The investigators were luckier. They had a witness to talk to: A
Kenyan guard at the Nairobi embassy survived the bombing.
	   His picture was on the front page of the East African Standard
Tuesday, along with an account of his confrontation with the
bombers.
	   ``He resisted heroically,'' U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said in Washington.
	   The newspaper said the guard, Joash Okindo, confronted men in
the rear parking lot. One threw a grenade. Foley said the guard ran
away, just before their truck exploded.
	   The Standard said it talked to Okindo before he was taken out of
the country on a U.S. medical evacuation flight to Germany.
	   And in Tanzania, a dozen people, including Sudanese and Iraqis
were detained. But U.S. officials played down the importance of the
roundup.
	   Federal law enforcement officials in Washington said
investigators believe the Tanzania bomb was attached to a water
truck that serves the embassy and was triggered remotely,
apparently without the driver's knowledge.
	   Israel army radio also signaled a possible break in the case. In
a report from Nairobi, it said investigators suspect the bombers
used the sophisticated plastic explosive Semtex.
	   The FBI says finding out what kind of explosives were used and
how would be critical to the investigation.
	   So would an informant, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
on Monday offered a dlrs 2 million reward for information leading
to the capture of the ``cowards that committed this act.''
	   Eleven Americans who had come to Kenya in peace began their last

	   FUNAFUTI, Tuvalu (AP) _ The 9,000 inhabitants of the Polynesian
microstate of Tuvalu hope to become among the world's wealthiest
people on a per capita basis after the recent signing of an
Internet deal with a Canadian company, Prime Minister Bikenibeu
Paeinu said Tuesday.
	   Paeinu said the deal with Toronto-based computer marketing
company Information.ca Corp. would bring his country annual revenue
of between U.S. dlrs 60 million and U.S. dlrs 100 million.
	   The deal involves the marketing of World Wide Web addresses
using the unique two-letter suffix assigned to the island nation:
``tv.''
	   Several small, undeveloped countries are already involved in the
fledgling industry of selling their Internet addresses, including
to the world's largest online bookstore, Amazon.Com.
	   Tuvalu government officials believe their suffix will be worth
millions of dollars to television companies.
	   Based on the U.S. dlrs 60 million minimum, the deal represents
U.S. dlrs 6,666 a year for each islander, or more than U.S. dlrs
11,000 based on the maximum estimate of U.S. dlrs 100 million a
year.
	   By comparison, the 300,000 residents of the oil-rich sultanate
of Brunei have among the highest per capita incomes in the world,
with an average salary of about U.S. dlrs 15,000 annually.
	   Paeinu said Tuesday the money would be used for national
development projects including air services, health care and
education. It had not been decided whether funds would be
distributed directly to Tuvaluans.
	   Most Tuvaluans presently have a subsistence lifestyle with
income of several hundred dollars annually, if that.
	   A nation of nine atolls in the Pacific Ocean about 1,600 miles
(2,600 kilometers) northeast of Australia, Tuvalu has a total area
of just 16 square miles (27 square kilometers).
	   With an average height of around 13 feet (four meters) above sea
level, Tuvalu is considered by scientists to be at risk of
submergence as global warming causes sea levels to rise.
	   ``Our people are already dreaming about what to do with the
money,'' Paeinu said. ``One definite wish is to become a small
donor to the region through regional organizations. We would also
like to contribute to efforts to stop global warning with a part of
revenue earnings.''
	   Paeinu said the deal was signed with officials from
Information.ca at Funafuti on Aug. 6. Ten companies had bid for the
contract and three were shortlisted.
	   The Canadian company was chosen over a British company, Ixtel,
and a U.S. company, Netnames. Information.ca officials in Toronto
could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.
	   The agreement would bring Tuvalu revenue of ``between U.S. dlrs
60 million and U.S. dlrs 100 million'' a year based on a 65-35
percent share agreement in favor of Tuvalu, Paeinu said.
	   Tuvalu currently runs frugally on a budget of around U.S. dlrs
3.6 million (Australian dollars 6 million) derived from fishing,
earnings from seamen working on foreign ships, aid and income as
interest from a national investment fund of about U.S. dlrs 27
million (Australian dollars 45 million) invested mainly in
Australia.
	   It also makes about U.S. 1 million a year in fees paid by a
foreign company licensed to use the Tuvalu international telephone
access code for what the government was embarrassed to discover
were mainly sex chat calls relayed through its small national
exchange.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The flag-shrouded coffins of 11 Americans
killed in the worst terror attack on a U.S. Embassy were solemnly
loaded onto a military aircraft Monday to begin their final journey
home.
	   The 12th American victim, Jean Dalizu, who was married to a
Kenyan, will be buried in her adopted homeland.
	   The explosion Friday killed at least 192 people, including the
12 Americans and 33 Kenyans who worked at the embassy, and injured
almost 5,000 others. A nearly simultaneous attack on the U.S.
Embassy in neighboring Tanzania killed at least 10 people, all
Africans.
	   The Kenyan death toll was lowered Monday from 200 because of a
double counting error between Kenyan and U.S. Embassy officials.
	   The bodies were to be flown to Andrews Air Force Base in
Maryland via Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany, where they arrived
early Tuesday.
	   A military color guard holding flags stood at attention, eight
on either side of a ramp, as the coffins were carried to waiting
vans. They will be kept at the nearby U.S. hospital in Landstuhl
until they're flown home Thursday.

Court frees Sri Lankan journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A court freed a Sri Lankan journalist
who was arrested by police three weeks ago for suspected links with
the Tamil rebels, court officials said Tuesday.
	   Magistrate S. Kanapathipillai ordered P. Mannikavasagar's
release Monday after police failed to bring any charges against
him. He was detained under anti-terrorists laws, which empower
police to detain a suspect for three weeks without formally
charging him.
	   Mannikavasagar is a Tamil based in Vavuniya, the last major
northern town near where Sri Lankan troops are trying to crush an
insurrection by Tamil militants.
	   Mannikavasagar works for a popular Tamil-language daily
Virakesari, Reuters and the British Broadcasting Corporation. He
was not immediately available for comment.
	   Another Tamil journalist, Santhiralingam Sri Gajan, has
petitioned the Supreme Court for his release. He was arrested three
weeks ago also for suspected links with the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam.
	   Tamil rebels have been fighting for an independent homeland
since 1983, alleging widespread discrimination by the Sinhalese
majority. More than 54,000 people have been killed.
