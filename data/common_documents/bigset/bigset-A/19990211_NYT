<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ For most of the 1990s, Dale arnhardt was
the man who had to field all the questions about why he couldn't
win the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Year after year, Earnhardt had to answer the reporters who
wanted to know when he would win the big one. All that changed last
February when Earnhardt finally got the victory that had eluded him
for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another Winston Cup champion who also has been
trying for two decades to win the Daytona 500. Terry Labonte
inherits the dubious distinction of being the best driver on the
circuit who still is waiting to win at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale and I have run the same amount of Daytona 500s,'' said
Labonte, who will make his 21st start in the race Sunday. ``That
was the only reason I hated to see him win last year. I knew that
was going to put the pressure on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old Corpus Christi native has been one of the most
successful drivers in NASCAR over the past 20 years. Labonte has
two championships (1984 and 1996) and 20 victories. But Labonte
hasn't been able to win the one race every driver wants to win.
Does it get to him at times?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it does,'' Labonte said. ``This is the biggest race we
run. I can remember when I was 10 years old going to the movie
theater with my dad to watch the Daytona 500. In those days, it was
only on closed circuit. That was the first one I ever watched, and
I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning at Daytona was the first thing Labonte wanted to do when
he became a full-time Winston Cup driver in 1979. But he's still
waiting. Like Earnhardt before last year, Labonte has been close to
victory at Daytona several times.
</P>
<P>
   He has finished second three times, including 1997 when his
teammates made it a sweep of the top three places. Jeff Gordon won
and Ricky Craven was third for Hendrick Motorsports. Labonte also
has finished in the top five three other times, but it was the 1996
Daytona 500 when Labonte felt certain he was going to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That probably was the best car we ever had at Daytona,''
Labonte said. ``We led the most laps, but a plastic bag got on the
track and got sucked into our air cleaner late in the race. It
choked the engine down. It was just one of those weird things that
happens, but I was pretty disappointed that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Labonte hopes he can be the second consecutive veteran
driver who can end his jinx in the biggest event in racing. If he
does, Labonte will take home a check for more than $2 million
because he is one of the five drivers eligible for the $1 million
Winston No Bull 5 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   But for a man who has earned almost $19 million in his career,
it's not the money that motivates him. He doesn't want his career
to end without at least one Daytona 500 victory on his list of
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think we have a car capable of winning,'' Labonte
said. ``We kind of looked at last year as a new team because we had
a lot of new people here. We made a lot of mistakes last year, and
some of those were made at the shop, so we couldn't overcome them
at the tracks. But we had things clicking by the end of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte had a new crew chief last year in 28-year-old Andy
Graves. They struggled at times while going through an adjustment
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how important the people around you are
to your success,'' Labonte said. ``It's like any other sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take Vinny Testaverde as an example. When he was with Tampa
Bay and Baltimore, people didn't think he was very good. But this
year with the Jets, he had a great season. He's the same player,
but he has a lot of good people around him. Things just have to fit
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Things were fitting together nicely for Labonte at the end of
last season when he guided the Kellogg's Monte Carlo to a top-10
finish in six of the last seven races.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte believes that trend will continue, and he also thinks
his team will benefit from having Rick Hendrick back in charge.
Hendrick took a leave of absence last season while battling
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rick's presence will make a difference for us,''
Labonte said. ``It will make things go smoother and make sure
everyone is going in the same direction. At times last year, it was
like everyone wanted to be the boss when the boss wasn't there, and
that just doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a team owner with deep pockets, and one who is committed
to winning, means a lot to Labonte because he hasn't forgotten the
days when he wasn't so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started, I drove for a team that would have to
sell parts during the week to get new parts for the next race,''
Labonte said. ``We would be at the track, and somebody would show
up wanting to repossess our carburetor. When you suffer through
some years like that, it makes you appreciate being with a good
team.''
</P>
<P>
   When Labonte talks about the team, he means his owner, his car
and his crew. He is not a believer in the multiple-car team concept
that is prevalent in racing today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big myth is you have to have multi-car teams to win,''
Labonte said. ``It's not true. The only benefit I see is to the
owner in that it won't cost twice as much to run two cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte finished a respectable ninth in the points race last
season, but it paled in comparison to his teammate. Gordon had a
record 13 victories en route to his second consecutive Cup
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is the star of the circuit, but Labonte holds one record
that Gordon is not likely to reach, or anyone else for that matter.
Sunday will be Labonte's 603th consecutive Winston Cup start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fortunate to keep it going as long as I have,''
Labonte said. ``I got hurt at Riverside (Calif.) in 1982 when I hit
the wall and I broke my leg and ribs. If that hadn't been the last
race, I probably would have missed five or six races.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte started five races in 1978, but his first full season
began Jan. 14, 1979. He has started every Cup event since that day.
Labonte has come a long way from the teen-ager who was the 1976
track champion at the now-defunct Meyer Speedway in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never could have imagined in those days that I would be
where I am now,'' Labonte said. ``I was just doing it for fun.
Sometimes, I look back and can't believe I've been racing this
long. But to me, it's still fun. And the most fun I could have
would be to win this race on Sunday.''

MELLON'S GIFT TO THE NATIONAL GALLERY IS ITS LARGEST EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The philanthropist Paul Mellon, who died on Feb. 1
at the age of 91, has left the National Gallery of Art the largest
gift in its history, $75 million in cash and more than 100 pictures
worth many times that much, a gallery official said on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon's will, filed today in Fauquier County, Va., is said to
specify that the gallery receive two oils by Vincent van Gogh
(``Still Life of Oranges and Lemons with Blue Gloves,'' painted in
1889, and ``Green Wheat Fields, Auvers,'' done in 1890), as well as
art by Edouard Manet, Paul Cezanne, Claude Monet, Pierre August
Renoir and others.
</P>
<P>
   The bequest also includes a dozen paintings by the American
master Winslow Homer and works by other Americans, according to The
Washington Post, which reported the gift in Thursday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Earl A. Powell III, the gallery director, described the gift as
``the largest in the gallery's history,'' The Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon had previously given more than 900 works of art to the
gallery that his father, the financier Andrew Mellon, helped to
found on the National Mall. Construction of the gallery began in
1937 and was completed in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The cash will go to the gallery soon, but the artworks in the
latest bequest will not. They are to remain with Mellon's widow,
Rachel, until her death.
</P>
<P>
   Yale University and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond
were also left large gifts _ $75 million in cash and 130 pictures
for Yale and $10 million and more than 50 pictures for the Virginia
institution _ and numerous other public institutions were left
gifts of $1 million or more.

BATTLE FOR BEACHES CONTINUES

<P>
   COOS BAY, Ore. _ A desperate attempt to stave off an ecological
disaster by igniting 400,000 gallons of fuel on a doomed freighter
produced smoke and flame but apparently no lasting fire Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, a powerful storm packing gusts of 70 mph bore
down on the Oregon coast, threatening to crack the battered New
Carissa in half, spilling its gooey cargo of fuel on miles of
pristine beaches. Waves splashed foam up to the ship's rails at
dusk.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the Navy Explosives Ordinance Detachment from
Whidbey Island Naval Air Station set dozens of charges that were to
set the beached ship ablaze. First, blasts were to fracture the
639-foot cargo ship's fuel tanks. After oil flowed up into the
grounded ship's cargo hold, incendiary grenades were used to ignite
it.
</P>
<P>
   The plan worked _ temporarily. Flames flickered through open
cargo hatches, but within minutes the only thing left burning
aboard the ship was a small, smoldering fire in one cargo hold.
</P>
<P>
   Plans had shifted quickly from pulling the freighter's bow off
the beach to burning its fuel as the storm advanced toward shore.
Officials decided they had to destroy the New Carissa _ its hull
lined with cracks _ or the storm would.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 6 p.m. Wednesday night, the first smoke lifted from
the stricken cargo vessel. The fire seemed to die, but Coast Guard
officials had said it might take several tries to keep the oil
burning. Some Coast Guardsmen compared it to lighting a barbecue
grill, when it sometimes takes several attempts to light the coals.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Chief Petty Officer Gene Maestas could not yet
say that a fire was burning. He said infrared cameras did show two
hot spots in the vessel, which is 200 yards off the broad, sandy
beach of North Spit here.
</P>
<P>
   If the attempt to start a fire failed, a second try is not
expected until daylight Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic taken by emergency workers has been tried a few times
before. Among Coast Guardsmen in Alaska, it is known as the
``Aleutian Solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Vessels that have run aground in remote but environmentally
sensitive areas in Alaska can leave the Coast Guard little choice
but to burn their fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officers say it has been used two or three times in
the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, for example, charges and a fire consumed the fuel
aboard a Korean fish processor wedged between two rocks on an
uninhabited island in the Aleutian chain. The processor was leaking
fuel and carried more than 100,000 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, federal and state officials abandoned, for now, a
planned attempt to pull the bow of the ship out so that it would
face into waves, which have battered its hull, almost broadside,
since last Thursday. Also deferred was any hope of pulling the
entire vessel off the sand to safety, which officials said would
likely take days.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they feared that the ship could not hold together
through much more pounding, which resumed Wednesday as winds and
waves increased. A new storm stuck the Oregon coast late in the
day, packing wind gusts of 70 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the storm approach the grounded freighter, officials
worried that its minor ``burps'' of oil leaks could become a
deluge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe at this point that we can get the vessel off
the beach without having it come apart,'' said Coast Guard Capt.
Mike Hall, the federal on-scene commander.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said another storm was expected to follow the one lashing
the coast Wednesday night. ``The storms this time of year are
unforgiving,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the president of Smits America Inc., which is in charge
of the salvage operation, crawled through the vessel Wednesday and
not only found lengthwise cracks but also transverse cracks that
stretched from port to starboard.
</P>
<P>
   Those cracks worried the Coast Guard that a storm could crack
the freighter in half, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the engine room has become flooded. ``The
vessel is totaled right now,'' said Bill Milwee of Gallagher
Marine, which is representing the Japanese owner of the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   If they can get the fuel to ignite, it would burn for several
days. Eventually, the freighter will be cut up on the beach for
salvage.
</P>
<P>
   Torching the freighter was an abrupt change of tactics by
officials in charge of responding to the grounding. Until
Wednesday, officials believed their best chance to minimize damage
from the freighter's grounding lay in keeping as much oil as
possible inside the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency managers considered trying to string a cable to shore,
rig a hose to it and pump heated oil from the vessel to on-shore
tanks. But they said the risks of that operation going awry, both
to workers and the environment, were too great.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hall said the unified command of state and federal
officials agreed that the least risk to health and the environment
lay in burning the fuel inside the hull of the stricken ship before
it could escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best option,'' Oregon governor John Kitzhaber told
reporters, ``is a controlled burn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whidbey Island Navy team working on the ship was comprised
of one officer and five enlisted specialists. It's part of
Explosive Ordinance Disposal Mobile Unit 11 based on Whidbey
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Commanding the detachment is Navy Lt. Scot Wilson, 38, a career
explosive ordinance disposal specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The six-man detachment is a specialized shore detachment
assigned to respond to emergencies and calls for assistance in the
Pacific Northwest and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon state officials had worried aloud about the risk to human
health and the environment from the thick, black smoke that might
pour from New Carissa's fractured hull. Federal officials Wednesday
issued an emergency warning to local officials and the public that
it was igniting the ship's cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that in poorly controlled conditions like these,
oil burns incompletely, releasing unburned particles that include
toxic chemicals that can be harmful to people who inhale them. But
officials said they expected the plume to rise well above ground
level and dissipate as it traveled, especially with the strong
winds currently sweeping over the area.
</P>
<P>
   State officials urged people to keep doors and windows closed if
they saw smoke and suggested that people with asthma should
consider leaving the area.
</P>
<P>
   Washington officials supported the decision to burn the oil.
Though releasing smoke isn't without risk, it seemed far preferable
to the risk that oil would blacken beaches in a north-flowing stain
that could reach beyond Oregon and into Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the best trade-off at this moment,'' said
Steve Hunter, supervisor of spill response for Washington's
Department of Ecology.
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday, officials said wildlife damage from spilled
oil remained minor. One greme was spotted swimming in oily water
and perhaps 100 sanderlings were seen with oil spots on their
chests. But bird rescue stations set up by The International Bird
Rescue Center and the Clean Rivers Coop had not treated any birds
as of late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beach cleanup work continued into Wednesday, with about 300
people walking beaches, scooping up oiled sand into bags, and
carrying it to a collection site.

WEEKEND HOLIDAY HAS BUSINESS BLOOMING FOR FLORISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- On most Valentine's Days, Beverly Hasson-Ing
brings in her full staff and scrambles to guarantee that 500
deliveries of roses, balloons and teddy bears arrive at their
appointed offices -- all before lunch.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Hasson-Ing is sighing with relief: Valentine's Day
falls on a Sunday, spreading out the days of delivery from
workplaces on Friday to homes over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's really a little easier,'' Hasson-Ing, owner of
Mr. B's Flowers in suburban Winnetka, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the weekend holiday accomplishes what the flower
industry has long sought -- to transform Valentine's Day into
Valentine's Week. By Wednesday, florists' shelves were full and
ready to begin rolling out orders until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A customer just bought three orders of extra long, fancy
Ecuadorean roses, and they're going out today,'' said Rae Wexler,
assistant manager of Casa De Flores in the suburban Los Angeles
community of Encino in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a little pressure off. There's still a lot of labor
and things to take care of, but we have a little more time between
customers,'' Wexler said.
</P>
<P>
   At Mr. B's, Hasson-Ing said more than half of the Valentine's
Day deliveries are going out Friday, but she expects a weekend rush
of anxious, last-minute customers -- all men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men, for the most part, don't even think about it until Friday
-- sometimes Sunday,'' she said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Don't sweat it, men. Florists will be standing by.
</P>
<P>
   Florist shops were fairly quiet Wednesday -- what workers call
the calm before the storm. But a few men ventured out at lunch or
after work to make sure their loved ones got a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought my wife a bouquet with M&AMP;Ms. She loves candy,'' said
John, who asked that his full name be withheld because it might
spoil the surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Jason had similar secret plans. He said sending flowers to his
girlfriend at work Saturday gives her the chance to show off a
little in front of her co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other women in her office who get a lot of stuff, so
I want her to be noticed,'' Jason said. ``I want everyone in her
office to know that she's something special and that I love her.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, the early delivery lays the groundwork for a
romantic Sunday. Jason said. He said Joanne can expect a hint of
``future plans'' with her yellow roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not expecting anything at all,'' he said. ``I know
she'll turn red.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday afternoon, Marty Lavitt, owner of The Wild
Flower in the valley community of Northridge, about 25 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles, said he'd already sold 2,400
Ecuadorean roses -- 200 dozen at $80 a pop -- and he expected to
sell an additional 600 dozen before Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't include other plants, teddy bears, balloons and
floral arrangements, like the 13 identical carnation and lily
bouquets that Cheryl Petritz was busy making for a legion of law
office secretaries Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their bosses are so generous they all get a Valentine's
present,'' Petritz said, snipping flowers and placing them
perfectly with barely a glance at the arrangements. ``When you make
thousands of these things, you just kind of know where things go,''
she explained.
</P>
<P>
   As big flower holidays go, Petritz, a 28-year veteran of the
flower business, prefers Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all roses, so your hands don't get too sore,'' she
said, displaying rose-pricked palms. ``Plus, by Valentine's Day
you're so sick of seeing red and white because of Christmas. You
just don't want to see it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Peterson of Reseda in the valley bought his wife a bouquet
Wednesday -- but it was for their Feb. 11 wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just do cards on Valentine's Day,'' he said. ``We got
married on the closest Saturday to Valentine's Day because that
year Valentine's Day was on a weekday, and we couldn't make our
friends come to a wedding in the middle of the week.''

ALCOTT GETS WELL-DESERVED SPOT IN HALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a sun-splashed afternoon, with a brisk wind
swirling off the Verdugo Mountains, as Amy Alcott turned the
Oakmont Country Club driving range into her personal proving
ground. A veteran of the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour,
she knew that a good shot, especially on a demanding, tree-lined
course like Oakmont, does not necessarily travel in a straight
line.
</P>
<P>
   So she worked on her arsenal, bending some balls right and
others left. Some sailed high and rode the wind, others stayed low
and bored under it.
</P>
<P>
   All left Alcott's club face with a satisfying click, the sound
of perfection courting greatness.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1987 and Alcott was in hot pursuit of a place in
the LPGA Hall of Fame. Four years later had won 29 tournaments, one
short of admission, but then seemed to hit a wall.
</P>
<P>
   This week Alcott, a Santa Monica native, returned to Oakmont for
the Valley of the Stars Championship, still stuck on 29 wins but
her place in the Hall is secure thanks to changes announced this
week in the selection criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Alcott first won on tour while a teen-ager, capturing the Orange
Blossom Classic in 1975. Now she plans to win in her 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``That drive to win is still there, probably even more strongly
than it has been for a long time,'' she said. ``I don't have any
plans to pack it up because I'm going to be in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   That mind-set is crucial, especially on a course like Oakmont
and with the players who are entered.
</P>
<P>
   It features 132 players, including 1998 Player of the Year and
Vare Trophy winner Annika Sorenstam, 1998 Rookie of the Year Se Ri
Pak and Jennifer Rosales, the 1998 NCAA champion, who is playing on
a sponsor's exemption.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Naples LPGA Memorial champion Meg Mallon and LPGA Hall
of Famers Pat Bradley and Patty Sheehan are also entered. Counting
Alcott and fellow inductee Beth Daniel the field has four Hall of
Fame members.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Eggeling won last year's event with a 15-foot birdie putt
on the first playoff hole against Hiromi Kobayashi, who is also
playing. A rain storm that hit on Sunday shortened last year's
tournament to 36 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Clear and windy weather is forecast for this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the ability to work the ball critical and Alcott
still has that skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is still one of the greatest iron players I have ever seen
in my life,'' Daniel said of Alcott.
</P>
<P>
   That comes with lots of practice.
</P>

   ``I grew up pushing balls into sprinkler heads in my front lawn
over 36 years ago,'' Alcott said. ``I had big dreams then as I
worked on my game as a child and wanted to learn the art of this
great game we call golf.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Notes: &LR;  The tour did the right thing in changing the criteria
for Hall of Fame membership, including adding a veteran committee.
The only downside is that it took 14 years to do it. Now it makes
it more realistic to honor players who dominated during their era,
which is what Halls of Fame are all about anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There are 14 players in the LPGA's Hall. . . .
</P>
<P>
   This year's tournament got an image transplant with the Valley
of the Stars name replacing the Los Angeles Women's Championship.
The goal is to capitalize and advertise the San Fernando Valley
area's entertainment and industry roots.
</P>
<P>
   But the real star this weekend will be Oakmont. It is one of the
players' favorite tour stops as well as one of their toughest
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The course was designed in 1924 by architect Max Behr, who also
designed Lakeside Golf Club and was a consultant on the remodeling
of the famed Olympic Club's Lake Course in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Behr didn't like to put rough on his courses and so used the
natural terrain and bunkers, which Oakmont has aplenty, to guard
the greens. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA has its own version of a seniors tour. It's the Evista
Legends Series and has a $500,000, season-long bonus pool series
for LPGA Tour players 40 years of age and older. Players earn
points at this season's 32 LPGA Tour events. Points are doubled at
the tour's four major championships and are tripled at the
season-ending championship, the Healthsouth Inaugural. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The tour is losing one of sport's best administrators with the
resignation of commissioner Jim Ritts, who will be moving to Los
Angeles to work for an Internet company. He is one of the reasons
the winner at Oakmont will earn $97,500, and The Golf Channel is
providing television coverage of each round. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for Stuart Appleby in next week's Nissan Open at
Riviera, a course who owes its legend to the late Ben Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   While he likes the design, the greens are not up to par, he told
the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice layout,'' he said. ``But if the greens aren't any
good, then it makes all the good work from tee to green a bit
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   He last played Riviera, a tough test under the best conditions,
two years ago and missed the cut. &QL;

PAK MAKES TIME _ FOR EVERYONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE _ Golfer Se Ri Pak's English has gotten so good, her
speech is more precise these days than her drives.
</P>
<P>
   Her vocabulary, like her celebrity, is mushrooming. But there's
one itty-bitty word that continues to give the Korean fits.
</P>
<P>
   If only Pak could learn to say ``No,'' her life wouldn't
resemble a sentence sagging with subordinate clauses.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, 21, promised herself after her LPGA rookie season in 1998
that she'd simplify her schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck. Pak may win all four majors in a single season before
she has four uninterrupted hours to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Pak's problem, if you will, is she tends to be as accommodating
as cities bidding on the Olympics, refusing practically no request.
After being treated for exhaustion at last year's end, surely Pak
is placing limits on her availability this year.
</P>
<P>
   Right, Se Ri?
</P>
<P>
   Pak, fresh from a practice round Wednesday at Oakmont Country
Club, smiled and started to answer. But she was cut off by three of
the 58-member strong Korean press contingent that's in town to
document her every divot at the Valley of the Stars Championship
that begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One by one by one the three reporters shoved a piece of paper in
her face and pleaded for her signature. Never mind that asking for
an autograph while wearing a media credential is akin to signing an
incorrect scorecard. It's grounds for disqualification, but Pak
would sooner turn in her Korean passport than turn in anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Like the good sport she is, she signed everything with a smile.
As she rose, she saw the bemused expression on the face of the
reporter whose question she had started to answer before getting
sidetracked.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, who counted two majors among her four victories as a Tour
rookie, giggled. She realized that she unwittingly had provided the
answer to the accessibility question without uttering a sound.
</P>
<P>
   As she strode toward the practice range in her very distinctive
gait _ call it an accidental swagger _ she said sheepishly, ``I'm
better than I was last year (at turning down peoples' requests).''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, and at the rate she's going, in another few years she'll
be as aloof as.... Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make people upset,'' Pak admitted. ``Every
week is the same no matter where I go. I know I need to think `No'
means `No.' But I like to do what the people want me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a problem, considering her adoring public would sooner
pose her in front of their disposable cameras than ogle her
sweeping follow-through on the practice range (better to watch her
swing than her shot; she ranks 116th in driving accuracy).
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I've told her,'' said Pak's caddy Jeff Cable, ``you
cannot make everybody happy all the time. So you have to make
yourself happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone suggested to Pak that she'd be better off if she hadn't
bothered honing her English. After all, pitcher Hideo Nomo hid
pretty effectively behind a language barrier during his years with
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's what I should do,'' Pak said playfully.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, so it's way too late for that. But there's nothing
stopping Pak from following Tiger Woods' lead and flat-out refusing
to make time for the media at every Tour stop unless he's among the
tournament leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good idea,'' Pak said _ but she was laughing, thank
goodness. The last thing the world of professional sports needs is
another sullen superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Her four playing partners in Wednesday's program wouldn't have
her change a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Kagami was ecstatic when he learned Tuesday night that
he was paired with Pak.
</P>
<P>
   That he was still beaming at the completion of the
four-and-a-half-hour round was no small tribute to her.
</P>
<P>
   Stories abound about big-name golfers who speak in
monosyllables, when they speak at all to their amateur playing
partners. There was nothing cold about Pak, except maybe her nose
in the windy conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very friendly,'' said Kagami, an operation manager for
the Tokyo Broadcasting System, which is airing this week's
tournament in Japan on a tape-delayed basis. ``She helped me so
many times. She was very helpful to us. She's very mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak's poise was apparent to Cable almost immediately after he
started carrying her bag full-time. The two came together for real
at this tournament last year, which was shortened to 36 holes
because of rain. Pak, who was feeling under the weather all week,
finished in a tie for 45th.
</P>
<P>
   Cable wasn't sure what she needed or wanted from him, besides
over-the-counter cold and flu medicines. ``It took a little bit of
time for us to figure out how to work together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But before long, they were the best of buddies. On the road, it
was just the three of them: Pak, Cable and Pak's puppy, Happy.
</P>
<P>
   Hyper would have been a better name for the beagle. Toward the
end of the season, after watching Happy jump on one too many hotel
coffee tables and topple one too many lamps, Pak sadly suggested to
Cable, ``Maybe I should let someone else take care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That about ripped my heart out,'' said Cable, who knew how the
lonesome golfer loved the companionship the dog provided. He found
a good home for Happy, with a friend of his girlfriend on a farm in
Tennessee, and Pak since has replaced Happy with a Scottish
Terrier, also named Happy.
</P>
<P>
   In three starts this year, Pak has made two cuts but has no
top-10 finishes. The natives back in Korea are getting restless.
``If she doesn't win, it's a bad week,'' Cable said, alluding to
the pressure heaped on her in her homeland
</P>
<P>
   Watching her work her way around the course on Wednesday,
though, Pak seemed, well, happy. &QL;

SMALL FORWARD IS LAKERS' BIG QUESTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ It could happen tonight, possibly Sunday. But sometime
soon, coach Del Harris is going to have to decide who the Lakers'
starting small forward is this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox was the incumbent, but sat out the first three games
with sore feet while Kobe Bryant started putting up numbers as
gaudy as his $70.9 million contract _ 20.0 points, 10.7 rebounds
per game.
</P>
<P>
   But a healthy Fox returned to action Wednesday night, playing 17
minutes off the bench, and could be ready to start again as soon as
tonight in Minnesota. With the way Bryant has been playing, that's
far from guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Harris declined to entertain the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just take it as time goes on. I don't have to announce
starting lineups until 20 minutes before the game every night,'' he
said. ``There's no point in getting into a controversy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's really a subject for us to take because
like I've said, if playing time or starting or who scores points
becomes a big issue, we're not going to go anywhere. If I address
those issues, then I'm fostering a kind of controversy that will
defeat us,'' Harris added. ``So I don't want to get involved in
anything like that. We'll just work out what we work out to the
best interests of the team as we see it at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bryant not only scoring but rebounding _ he's 11th in the
NBA _ the 20-year-old has certainly made the case to be a starter
for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been doing well,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ``I would like
to see him stay (in the starting lineup), but it doesn't matter who
starts as long as everyone does their part.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, as he's done all along, said he's OK with going back to
the bench if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just have to change my mindset, try to recall last season
and how I tried to approach it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman watch: All is still quiet in Dennis Rodman's camp, but a
source close to the situation said the free-agent forward will make
a decision by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman is contemplating an invitation from owner Jerry Buss and
center Shaquille O'Neal to play for the Lakers this season, but
he's weighing if it's worth his time to play for $610,000, the
prorated share of the veterans minimum salary. He could retire to
pursue an entertainment career.
</P>
<P>
   If commissioner David Stern has anything to say about it, Rodman
will be back in the NBA soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss him,'' Stern said on a media conference call Wednesday.
This, despite Rodman's off-court antics and occasional on-court
outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reaction has always been as long as someone is going to
play by our rules, and someone is as great a player as Dennis is in
terms of his rebounding and championship rings, if he's capable of
playing, we'd love to have him,'' Stern said. ``I'm hopeful that
will happen relatively soon.''

KINGS' OPPONENTS ARE QUITE FORWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The current portion of the schedule is full of
challenges for the Kings, with Wednesday night's visit to Phoenix
followed by tonight's home game against Philadelphia, Saturday's
visit by Dallas and Monday's visit by the Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly against the Flyers and the Ducks, the Kings'
defensemen have a big job ahead of them. Those teams have two of
the best offensive tandems in the NHL, though the similarities end
there.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's 6-foot-4 Eric Lindros and 6-3 John LeClair
present obstacles of size and strength. The Ducks' Paul Kariya and
Teemu Selanne kill their opponents with speed.
</P>
<P>
   Kings defensemen Mattias Norstrom and Sean O'Donnell agreed that
as dangerous as LeClair and Lindros are, they'd rather face them
than Kariya and Selanne, whose quickness is intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``My quickness is good, but not exceptional,'' O'Donnell said.
``(Lindros and LeClair) are quick, but they're more about brute
strength, and that's more up my alley. But I don't mean by any
means that it's easy playing against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Norstrom said, ``For me, it's the ultimate challenge. Lindros
and LaClair, (Colorado's Peter) Forsberg and (Joe) Sakic, and
Selanne and Kariya _ it's pretty hard to beat those three duos.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Flyers' duo, Norstrom said, ``That tandem, they're second
to none in the league when it comes to crashing the net and
creating chances by playing physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Howling in pain: The Kings have been one of the NHL's most
injured teams for much of the year, but the Coyotes recently have
had more than their share of aches and pains.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Keith Tkachuk (back, ribs), center Mike Sullivan
(fractured rib) and defenseman Deron Quint (separated shoulder) all
returned to the lineup Monday night when the Coyotes lost 3-0 to
San Jose. Defenseman Gerald Diduck rejoined the lineup for the
Kings game after missing a month with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   But defenseman Jyrki Lumme (groin), left wing Brad Isbister
(hernia) and right wing Dallas Drake (separated shoulder) all sat
out the game against the Kings, as did backup goalie Jimmy Waite,
who has a bruised hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes also are without enforcer Jim Cummins, who is
serving a five-game suspension for elbowing Chicago defenseman Brad
Brown during Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we've got guys in or out, we have to be ready,''
Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: It was the 1,000th game of winger Russ Courtnall's
career. He and St. Louis' Geoff Courtnall are the only brothers in
NHL history to appear in 1,000 or more games.

DEVILS, CATS SHIFT KICKOFF TO SATURDAY AFTER THANKSGIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Snyder has benefited from Saturday meetings between
Arizona State and Arizona. He hopes for similar success this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's decision to televise the game will move the contest from
Friday, Nov. 26, to Saturday, Nov. 27. Kickoff is set for 11 a.m.
at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The network said the contest will be seen by 85 percent of the
country, which will give ASU one of its largest regular-season
television audiences ever. The remaining 15 percent will see
Georgia play Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ASU Athletic Director Kevin White said the broadcast presents
``a brilliant opportunity to afford our program tremendous national
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This rivalry has become one of the best in all of collegiate
sports, and now the entire country will be able to experience the
passion between these two institutions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During Snyder's seven seasons, he is 2-0 against the Wildcats on
Saturdays and 0-5 on Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played in the Oregon-Oregon State rivalry and I've
coached in the UCLA-USC and California-Stanford rivalries,'' Snyder
said. ``The ASU-UA rivalry is the best in my opinion, and now the
majority of the country can view firsthand what I am talking about.
Also, it provides our program with unmatched exposure.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Not this year &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite speculation in a Florida newspaper, the Sun Devils will
not square off with Florida State this season.
</P>
<P>
   ASU opens its season Sept. 4 against Texas Tech and already has
secured time at Camp Tontozona in August. A preseason meeting
between these teams would force the Sun Devils to move camp to late
July, which would disrupt ASU summer school classes at the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Devils spokesman Mark Brand said it's ``too late'' to make a
change and that the university would need to know by December to
make it work.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Orlando Sentinel'' said in Wednesday's editions that ASU
would consider playing the Seminoles in a preseason game, but
Brand, who was quoted in the story, said he was referring to future
seasons, and not 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida State spokesman said his school had not contacted ASU
and appears close to securing another opponent. &QL;  &QL; 
Timely score &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ASU's offensive line may have just become a little deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Mountain View High School standout Damien Niko received
word over the phone that he scored high enough on his college
entrance exam to enroll at ASU, according to Mountain View Coach
Bernie Busken. He is awaiting written confirmation from the NCAA
clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 295-pound Niko was a member of ASU's 1998
recruiting class but did not qualify for the 1998 season. The Sun
Devils, confident that he would score high enough on his test, made
him a member of the 1999 class.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 class features four offensive linemen, ranging from
6-3, 293-pound Regis Crawford to 6-8, 320-pound Nick Johnson. &QL;  &QL; 
Quick hit &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils will announce their spring football schedule
today. &QL;  &QL;

CARDS WORK ON MOORE  
 HOPE TO AVOID PUTTING FRANCHISE TAG ON MILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conventional thinking around the NFL is that if the Cardinals
don't sign Rob Moore or Jamir Miller by this afternoon, they will
place the franchise tag on Miller, who is considered one of the top
young outside linebackers in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Forget conventional thinking. After all, these are the
Cardinals, who still were working Wednesday night at signing Moore
and had done little to try to sign Miller.
</P>
<P>
   By signing Moore, a 30-year-old wide receiver, they could then
franchise Miller and protect themselves from losing him when NFL
free agency begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If those negotiations fail, the Cardinals are seriously
considering placing the franchise tag on Moore, assuring him of
being paid the average of the top five players at the position.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 25, has the most value. He's five years younger and was
the team's leading tackler last season despite playing most of the
year with a dislocated wrist. But some in the organization are
afraid of Miller's price tag _ $5 million to $7 million a year _
and he has said he thinks he deserves to be paid more than
Baltimore middle linebacker Ray Lewis, who earns $6.5 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals also know they will anger Miller by placing the
franchise tag on him and could face a long holdout. The franchise
tag assures Miller of earning $3.485 million next year, not close
to being market value at the position after Lewis' deal and
contracts of about $5 million a year signed by New England's Willie
McGinest, Pittsburgh's Levon Kirkland and New Orleans' Mark Fields.
</P>
<P>
   Just because the Cardinals would let Miller test the free-agent
market doesn't mean they would necessarily lose him. He told
friends this week he wants to re-sign with the team, and the return
of defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis, who turned down a head
coaching offer from Chicago, reinforced that desire.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals hadn't made Miller a serious offer as of Wednesday
evening and weren't expected to do so until today. The reason is
because they've spent most of their time trying to sign Moore, whom
the Miami Dolphins have made their No. 1 target in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's agent, Gary Wichard, said he didn't know whether a deal
could get done by the NFL's 2 p.m. (Arizona time) deadline today
for teams to announce their franchise players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The urgency is for them,'' Wichard said Wednesday. ``We want
to make a deal that will stand up over the course of the next
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've told the Cardinals that Rob wants to stay there. . . .
The bottom line is that Rob doesn't want to learn the name of a new
dry cleaners. His first two years were difficult in Arizona as far
as wins and losses, but now they have something going on there. And
when we put it on paper and draw up the names of the teams he wants
to be with, Arizona always is Number 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who said Tuesday that he wants to re-sign with the
Cardinals, is seeking a four-year contract worth between $4 million
and $6 million a year. The Cardinals earlier offered a three-year
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin still is hoping the Cardinals sign both
players and don't have to use the franchise tag on either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to have everyone under contract, but that's not the
reality of free agency,'' Tobin said. ``I'd like to get most of our
own guys back. Whether that is accomplished remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, the Cardinals have few salary cap problems for
next season, but that could change if they sign their top free
agents. According to NFL Players Association salary figures
obtained by ``The Republic,'' the Cardinals are a little more than
$15 million under next year's cap of $57.288 million, up from $52.4
million a year ago. But they still have 21 players who could become
free agents Friday, including eight restricted free agents. &QL;

SUNS' SLOPPY PLAY CONCERNS AINGE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The defense is terrible and the shooting is lousy, but the Suns'
kicking game is in pretty good shape.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Danny Ainge's boot of the ball into the America West Arena
stands Tuesday night is about the only memorable leftover from a
one-sided loss to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we were playing, I would have punted, too,'' General
Manager Bryan Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Suns backup center Joe Kleine thought the kick went slightly
awry, which is more than can be said of most of the Suns'
field-goal attempts on a night when they shot 36 percent. Kleine
said it was wide right and gestured in appropriate zebra-style.
</P>
<P>
   But the NBA decided it was way out of bounds. The league fined
Ainge $3,000 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My comment about the fine: Who cares?'' said Ainge, a former
major league baseball player who in a different setting might have
kicked dirt on referee Derek Richardson but was left with only the
ball after he was ejected in the fourth quarter of the 112-95 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, Ainge has plenty of other problems that demand his
care. The Suns are 2-1, but the signs aren't good, especially with
Western Conference favorite Utah at America West Arena tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The sloppy play, especially against Sacramento, has begun to
test his patience. His swift kick Tuesday night was not a symptom,
he said. At that point, he said, he simply was unhappy with a
flagrant-foul call. But he has begun to develop ``a short fuse''
because of the shoddy play.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's getting shorter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the reasons are familiar. After the lockout, there's a
league-wide lack of conditioning. And, with the Suns, there's
little familiarity among players on a revamped roster. But there's
no comfort in either.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Suns catch their collective breath and know one
another without name tags, the race could be finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said we're only three games into the season. I said,
`No, we're not. We're 35 games into the season,' '' said Ainge, who
is trying to jump-start his team in a season that has been cut to
50 games from 82. ``It's all tied up right now. It's going to be a
war, the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm discouraged that we're trying to take shortcuts instead of
pushing ourself to get in better shape. We're not playing with
enough urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Ainge gives his club a C-minus for its opening-week
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that might be generous,'' he said. ``We have done some
very good things when we've needed to. That's an important asset of
a team. But, otherwise, I think we're slightly below average.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a C-minus all the way around. A C-minus for defense. A
C-minus for offense. C-minus for coaching. C-minus for
conditioning. C-minus for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step in improvement might be an altered substitution
scheme. Ainge indicated he might distribute the playing minutes
differently. But he said he would not abandon any one of his first
seven to eight players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never going to bury a guy,'' he said. ``Somebody who has
been a starter will always have the chance to earn his minutes
back, whether it's one game or more. At the same time, we better
make sure we don't have any Lou Gehrigs sitting on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there's no argument with Ainge's assessment from the
Phoenix veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subpar,'' center Luc Longley said when asked to evaluate
himself after three games in which he is averaging 7.3 points, 6.3
rebounds and 22.3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides dealing with a lack of familiarity, Longley also has
been confronted with adjusting to a new offense. He was part of the
famed triangle in Chicago. He was the complementary piece to
Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   No Jordan and no Pippen would seem to be Mission Impossible. But
that's not necessarily so, the 7-foot-2 Australian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many habits from having played with the Bulls,''
said Longley, who tonight finds himself matched up against the club
he and his former Chicago teammates beat last year for the NBA
title. ``I'm having some trouble breaking those and learning to
play this style. Within the triangle, I had a very distinct role
and distinct reactions to what happened out on the court. Just
breaking those habits is the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting used to a different game.''
</P>
<P>
   For one week, at least, it's been almost as different as
Australian Rules Football. &QL;

EARNHARDT RACING FATHER TIME  
 DESPITE POOR SEASONS, SAYS HE CAN COMPETE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ He insists the fire raging in his belly
still burns white-hot. And he says NASCAR's pinnacle remains within
grasp and is not the seemingly unreachable target some would
suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt says a lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   What he doesn't say is that on April 29, he will be 48.
</P>
<P>
   The great Richard Petty posted the last of an astonishing 200
victories only two days past his 47th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   David Pearson, who with 105 career wins is No. 2 on NASCAR's
all-time list, was 45 when he drove into victory lane for the final
time.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Darrell Waltrip, who with 84 wins is tied at No. 3 with
Bobby Allison, hasn't won since 1992, when he was 45.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, however, is convinced there are more roses than
thorns in his future. And, Earnhardt added, a record-breaking
eighth Winston Cup championship certainly is not out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   The sad truth is the great ``Intimidator'' has been upstaged the
past four seasons by the driver he nicknamed ``Boy Wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jeff Gordon has won 40 races and three driving titles over
the past four years, Earnhardt has but eight triumphs and no
titles.
</P>
<P>
   When Earnhardt won last year's Daytona 500, it not only ended a
streak of never having won the sport's greatest race, it snapped a
seemingly eons-long winless streak that had reached nearly two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, however, never won again in 1998 and slipped to
eighth in the drivers standings, his lowest position since 1992,
when he finished No. 12, and only the second time in 13 years he
has finished outside the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think Earnhardt doesn't realize he has been running on
near empty the past few seasons. But he also knows and believes it
can be turned around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you don't win, you want to win more and harder,''
said Earnhardt, whose son, Dale Earnhardt Jr., won last season's
NASCAR Busch Series title and will make five Winston Cup starts
this season in a car owned by his dad. ``I can't say enough about
winning the Daytona 500, but it didn't satisfy my appetite for
winning. I want to win more races. I want to win that (eighth)
championship. And I think we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it just kills you to see the kid (Gordon) out there be as
dominant as he was (last season). I can think back and remember
when we were that way. I liked it when people would look at our
(No. 3) car pulling onto the track and wonder what we were doing
and how to beat us. It drove me to be the guy to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get back to there. We are starving and hungry for
that position again. We've got to race (Gordon), beat (Gordon) and
all the rest of the guys. We're focusing hard on that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Daytona win in February, Earnhardt was involved in a
bad crash in April at Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway and finished
with only five top-fives and 13 top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gordon produced 26 top-fives and 28 top-10s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to make excuses, but Dale drove hurt for part
of the season,'' said team owner Richard Childress, whose
driver-owner relationship with Earnhardt goes back to 1984. ``If we
keep him healthy this year and keep our team gaining, like we did
the last four races (last season), I think you'll see a different
Dale Earnhardt this year.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, it's not unfathomable for teammate Mike Skinner, who
finished 21st last season and has yet to win a race, to finish
ahead of Earnhardt in the final standings.
</P>
<P>
   Some even are predicting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Dale Earnhardt probably as well as anybody,'' Childress
said. ``We talked at the end of (last) year about getting everybody
in shape, and he's ready to go. I see that desire when I'm talking
to him. He's still got the desire to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of us is happy running like we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt is especially displeased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hard to see the disappointment,'' Dale Jr. said.
``He's still Dale Earnhardt.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he is. But how does he become the ``old'' Earnhardt again?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one way to correct the drop-off would be to improve
qualifying. Earnhardt only managed one top-10 qualifying position
all season, and only three winners from last season began their
journey from outside the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt recognizes the qualifying importance. But he also
knows another championship won't drop off the NASCAR tree unless he
is racing for the lead more times than he's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it's just been a couple of years that we've had
some turn of events that hasn't allowed us to be in the top five
every race,'' Earnhardt said. ``Richard and I really worked on our
strategies to make the team as good as we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be in the top five racing and finishing and
winning races to race for a championship. You can't do it in 10th
or 15th positions.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least, Earnhardt can enjoy Daytona without having to
answer 100 versions of the same question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great to come down and not be asked if you think you
can win Daytona this year and not have to talk about all the things
that have gone wrong (in) the last several (Daytona 500s),''
Earnhardt said. ``All that's behind us, but now (the media) wants
to know how it feels not to have that question asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning Daytona is an exciting memory, but it won't help you
win this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, help might be what Earnhardt needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a mark to beat, and somebody always breaks
that mark and sets a new mark,'' Earnhardt said. ``I think (Gordon)
and Hendrick (Motorsports) have done that. . . . But Jeff's a great
race-car driver, too. I had my day in that circle. I still think we
can have that day again. (Gordon) just pushes that level of
competition up higher. That's what makes us go faster and work
harder because what we all want to do is win.''
</P>
<P>
   Few, however, want to win more than Earnhardt. &QL;

IMPRESSIVE ROOKIES HIT WINSTON CUP 
</HEADLINE>
 GUNS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C _ Take a close look at the NASCAR Winston Cup
roster and what do you see?
</P>
<P>
   Wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional stick-and-ball sports, whose athletes mostly
are retired long before age 39, race car drivers often compete into
their 40s, 50s and, in some cases, 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Pass the heating pad, please.
</P>
<P>
   But NASCAR's lineup also includes a youthful look, and if
there's one thing the sanctioning body could use, it's a fresh coat
of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since drivers such as Dale Earnhardt (48 in April)
and Darrell Waltrip (52) are nearing the end of spectacular
careers. Throw in stars such as Rusty Wallace (42), Dale Jarrett
(42), Terry Labonte (42), Ernie Irvan (40) and Mark Martin (40),
who while still possessing plenty of kick in their tanks, they also
are closer to the end of their careers than to the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Who will replace them? Who will be the sport's next elite to
join Jeff Gordon, Jeff Burton and Bobby Labonte atop NASCAR's
ladder?
</P>
<P>
   Some Winston Cup drivers believe a segment of this season's
rookie crop, namely Tony Stewart, Elliott Sadler and Buckshot
Jones, and next year's, which is to include Dale NASCAR Busch Grand
National drivers Earnhardt Jr., and possibly Matt Kenseth, could be
tomorrow's stars.
</P>
<P>
   Future classes likely will include promising Adam Petty, son of
Kyle Petty and grandson of the great Richard Petty, and Casey
Atwood, both of whom are inaugurating Busch careers.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Park, who drives for the elder Earnhardt, Kenny Irwin Jr.,
and Jerry Nadeau, rookies last season, also are heralded as
possible stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a tremendous amount of potential,'' veteran driver Ken
Schrader said. ``There could be a whole lot of Winston Cup
championships among that group.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, does Richard Petty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go through these deals where you have a lot of drivers
coming in all the time, but you don't have the talent that I think
I see right now,'' Petty said. ``To me, this is a really, really
good crop of young drivers coming in that will basically dominate
Winston Cup racing for the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Michael Waltrip, who despite never putting a car in
victory lane in a career spanning 14 years and nearly 400 starts,
knows talent when he sees it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real impressed with Dale Jr.,'' Waltrip said. ``To me,
he's the front-runner to be the next superstar. But with anyone
coming up from Busch, there's going to be questions. They won on
Saturday, but can they win on Sundays?''
</P>
<P>
   Recent history shows it's being done.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 27, went from a Busch flash to a Winston Cup megastar in
less than five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, 34, was winless his first two Winston Cup
seasons, but has been Pontiac's top driver the past four years with
seven wins.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton, 31, has five wins the past two seasons after making
the Busch series jump in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those guys set a precedent,'' said Ward Burton, Jeff's
older brother, who won in only his second Winston Cup season after
graduated from the Busch circuit five years ago. ``They proved you
can do it and I think it opened doors to Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be drivers were just recycled from one team to the
next.''
</P>
<P>
   It still happens, but talented Busch drivers certainly are
making inroads.
</P>
<P>
   And few, if any, are more talented than Earnhardt Jr., last
season's Busch champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can put down into words how great a season
he (Dale Jr.) had last year,'' said Sadler, hired to drive the
famed Wood Brothers machine. ``I'm sure he's going to have a strong
Winston Cup career.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we all want to make it to the Winston Cup level. A lot of
us going up like myself, (Stewart) and (Dale Jr.) are all at a
young age. We're all in our mid to lower 20s. It shows a great
future for Winston Cup racing. And it shows what a great job Busch
Grand National has done to mold us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think you can throw away a lot of stuff we won in Busch
because Winston Cup is so much tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, 23, finished eighth with two wins in last season's Busch
standings, one position ahead of Jones, 28, who has developed a
reputation, whether warranted or not, of perhaps being too overly
aggressive on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buckshot Jones looks an awful lot like Ernie Irvan looked at
the same time in his career, knocking walls down and all that kind
of stuff,'' Charlotte Motor Speedway President Humpy Wheeler said.
``But he knows how to get it (the car) into the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Stewart, who many believe will emerge as this season's
Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my pick,'' Nadeau said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine, too,'' Irwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 27, hopes they're right. Stewart only entered 22 of 31
Busch races last season, a season in which he also drove on the
Indy Racing League circuit, where he was the series' star
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   But like Gordon, who opted for NASCAR when it became apparent
the opportunities were greater than in open-wheel racing, Stewart
also was faced with an Indy car-NASCAR decision a couple of years
ago. And at the time, NASCAR looked more feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be here for awhile,'' Stewart said. ``I don't want
to go anywhere. And I wouldn't do this if I thought the transition
wouldn't be easy. That's not to say it's easy, but it's easier
going to Winston Cup from Busch than it is from (the IRL) to Busch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big challenge to do well here. Obviously, one of the
challenges is the competition. Everybody here is here because they
deserve to be here. But I think I've got as good a chance as anyone
to win rookie of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Jones, who received a business degree from Georgia,
believes Stewart and Sadler should be considered favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be good, but you've got all that Wood Brothers
experience (for Sadler) and Tony Stewart has all the resources at
Joe Gibbs Racing,'' said Jones, who won two Busch races in three
seasons. ``Every time I've moved up into another division, it
becomes a lot harder. But it's never been harder than going from
Busch to Winston Cup. I've asked guys like Kevin Lepage and Steve
Park what it's like and they tell me you have to get used to more
horsepower and the technology. I've got to judge where to lift in
the corners and baby the throttle more. The hardest part will be
the first half of the year and getting used to the cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Jones, Stewart and Sadler will run into Earnhardt
Jr., who will make five Winston Cup starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait until (Dale Jr.) gets up here full-time,'' Jones
said. ``Matt Kenseth will be up, too. And (Atwood) will be awesome.
But Dale is the one who's going to give everybody a run for their
money . . . And I think it's going to be fun for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the old-timers. &QL;

COYOTES CLAIM ICE NOT NICE AT ARENA  
 SURFACE GROWING SOFT RECENTLY, PLAYERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While discussing why his hockey team seemed to operate around
the ice about as fluidly as a rusty Zamboni machine against the San
Jose Sharks, Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld suggested part of the
reason might be the Zamboni process itself.
</P>
<P>
   The ice surface at America West Arena, Schoenfeld said, hasn't
been the greatest lately. Turnovers have been as prevalent as
pretzels and beer.
</P>
<P>
   Because the NBA lockout has compressed the basketball season,
the arena floor has undergone ice-to-hard wood changeovers on six
consecutive days, which Schoenfeld and some of his players said has
put an extra strain on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   It was especially noticeable Monday, a day after the Suns' home
opener against the Denver Nuggets, he said, when there were an
unusually high 67 total giveaways between the Coyotes and the
Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just us,'' Schoenfeld said. ``The ice is bad around
the league, and that's too bad because part of the entertainment
value of our sport is the speed of the game. When you can't make
crisp passes and you're fumbling the puck, the speed is taken away.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would like to see our ice better all the time than what
it is. I really would. They're trying, but they're struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would make for crisper passes, more speed to the
game and more continuity to the flow rather than a lot of
turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, however, neither Schoenfeld nor anyone from the
Coyotes had formally lodged a complaint to arena officials in
charge of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``First I've heard about it,'' said Gray Rich, director of
operations at America West Arena and Bank One Ballpark. ``We have a
good relationship between the operation crew and the front office
of the Coyotes. There's a lot of communication there. But we don't
have a whole lot of contact with the players or the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a problem, we'll do everything we can to fix it,
but I don't know if there's a witch to find or if there really is a
problem at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of complaints in general about the ice in most NHL
cities, however, the league decided last month to institute a new
policy during warm-ups before the start of the second and third
periods of play. To prolong the freshness of the resurfacing done
by the Zamboni at intermission, all players except for the starters
are forbidden to zip around the ice to stretch their legs or take
practice shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Two-minute bench minors are handed out for any infraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in any worse shape than it is any other place,''
Coyotes defenseman Gerald Diduck said of the ice at America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good until basketball started,'' teammate Deron Quint
said. ``Now that basketball is going, it's off. It was great
(earlier), but we play one night, the Suns the next, and it's
starting to take its toll. The puck is bouncing a little more than
it did. The ice is softer. It gets chipped up easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich said the constant changeovers from hockey to basketball
shouldn't affect the ice for Coyotes games. The operations crew
follows the same fail-safe maintainance procedures set by NHL ice
guru Dan Craig, he said, and hasn't taken any shortcuts just
because the Suns and the Coyotes have been alternating in the arena
every night since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a problem,'' Rich said, ``it wouldn't be because of
the changeovers.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a problem with the arena's main ionization
unit, which purifies the water used to make the ice by removing and
dissolving solids. The unit, called ``Jet Ice,'' began showing
inconsistent readings about three weeks ago, Rich said, and the
system has since been taken off line.
</P>
<P>
   The ice crew now is relying on the use of portable tanks to do
the same job, Rich said. Unlike the Jet Ice unit, which can filter
up to 12,000 gallons of water, the portable tanks have a processing
limit of approximately 800 gallons, but Rich insists they are more
than adequate to handle the load.
</P>
<P>
   The portable tanks will continue to be used until the old system
can be remodified to better accommodate the hard water of the
Phoenix area, Rich said. The water is tested each day, however, and
Rich said its pH marks are well within operating guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But Coyotes veteran Rick Tocchet said he's noticed a change in
the ice for some time now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way: After the first seven or eight minutes,
you have to change your style and shoot a little more and try not
to pass,'' Tocchet said. ``I had a breakaway the other day, I had
(Chicago goalie Jocelyn) Thibault beat, and I was ready to flip it
into the net and then the thing bounces and rolled away from me. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played here and know in the last 10 minutes (of each
period), we have to start shooting more and then maybe the bad hops
will become good hops for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, both teams have to play on it,'' Coyotes forward Shane
Doan said. ``It's tougher some nights than others. It's better than
it has been the past couple years.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of steel retainers along the bottom of the dasher
boards has helped improve the overall quality of the ice, Rich
said. They were installed after the Coyotes' first season in the
Valley. Most of the complaints ceased midway through the 1996-97
season after Craig arrived from Edmonton and worked with Rich and
his operation crew on better ways to flood and maintain the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan had a whole different philosophy about how to do things,''
Rich said. ``He said, `No, guys. You don't do it that way. You do
it this way.' And we've been doing it his way every since. . . . I
talk to Dan anytime there's a problem. I talked to him (Tuesday),
but it wasn't because we knew about any new problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig, who supervised the ice for several years at Edmonton
Oilers games where the ice generally was rated by players as the
best in the NHL, said last season that America West Arena has made
huge strides. Overall, he said at the time, the rink conditions
more than lived up to NHL standards.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL, which hired Craig as its chief ice consultant, frowns
upon Craig granting interview requests, and ``The Arizona
Republic'' was told he would not be made available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rich said the Arena's increased workload won't have a negative
effect on ice conditions, but Schoenfeld and his players apparently
aren't convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld reiterated the point while talking about a highlight
film goal he saw the other night in a game between St. Louis and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tic-tac-toe goal that was just beautiful,''
Schoenfeld said. ``But you can't make those plays on crappy ice. I
mean, you don't play football on a field with a bunch of moguls on
it, do you?'' &QL;

RENOVATION WOULD KILL ARENA PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are 31 dates left on the schedule, but the real games are
just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   And the first political power play is on its way.
</P>
<P>
   A new plan will be unveiled within two weeks detailing a
reconfiguration of America West Arena, sources say. This one has
been endorsed by the city of Phoenix and the powers that govern the
stadium. It will cost $10 million and reportedly addresses the
primary thorn in the side of Coyotes' owner Richard Burke: the
4,500 seats handicapped by obstructed views.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant,'' said one source who has seen the plans.
``It improves the seating problem dramatically. And the question
becomes, `Are we better off spending $10 million to fix a majority
of the problems or are we better off spending $150 million for a
new building?''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the new plan is acceptable to the Coyotes remains to be
seen, and remains somewhat irrelevant. Because what it will
accomplish could be highly damaging to the Los Arcos project,
namely giving the casual voters another reason to shoot down a May
18 referendum, a blueprint that includes a 20,000-seat facility for
the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   You have heard much about Burke's list of needs, the
requirements necessary for hockey to thrive in the desert: The
seats. The signage. The luxury suites and revenue streams. And now,
the quality of ice that is hampering the Coyotes' sudden premium on
seamless hockey.
</P>
<P>
   But the average fan can only identify with one issue, and that's
the seats hiding 20 percent of the ice. If that can be corrected,
who wants to vote for a project that will cost $624 million, of
which an estimated $219 million will come from the public sector?
</P>
<P>
   Only the puckheads. Which means the referendum probably goes
belly up and the Coyotes stay in Phoenix, part of the Colangelo
portfolio. And in the long term, Burke either spends his own money
to build his stadium or he takes his team to another state.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this will only exacerbate an icy relationship between
the Coyotes and Jerry Colangelo's group, which essentially runs the
arena for the city. The Coyotes are spending a lot of money to get
the referendum passed. They've invested $10 million in a practice
facility. They are part of a league swimming in red ink, an
industry where only a handful of teams will make money this year.
Part of an NHL that could be facing a serious labor shutdown a few
years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes want their own stadium. To control their cash flow.
To enhance the value of their franchise. So the organization makes
long-term cents.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Cardinals, much is riding on goodwill. A sizzling start
was largely overshadowed by a football team that finally made the
playoffs, a fact that made the Coyotes' front office bristle. As
the Coyotes have mucked about over the past month, attendance has
waned a bit and a general malaise has set in.
</P>
<P>
   There is a month separating the end of the season and the
referendum for a stadium district. A 3-0 victory over the Kings on
Wednesday was a much-needed jolt preceding a rough stretch of
schedule. Just as with the Cardinals, momentum is key, and the
postseason could be make or break.
</P>
<P>
   There are those in the Coyotes' organization who believe
Colangelo is leader of the Evil Empire, a man determined to
undermine their efforts. Truth is, Burke is a first-time owner who
employed a first-time general manager. They have made their share
of rookie mistakes. Their living conditions are not great, but the
structure of the deal is not nearly as bad as they lead you to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   If the reconfiguration makes sense, Burke and Colangelo should
call a truce and work on a feasible plan of amenity sharing. The
town is big enough for the both of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes belong in Phoenix. For the synergy of downtown.
Because the building is intimate and loud. Because the
infrastructure is already in place. Because three sports teams
living in one city block has helped turn a sagebrush town into a
growing metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no sense of place on the corner of Scottsdale
and McDowell roads. &QL;

GORDON STARTING DEFENSE OF CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Jeff Gordon is not the bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   He's not Charles Manson, Hannibal Lecter or even Captain Queeg,
for heaven's sake. And he's certainly not Darth Vader, although
there are about 40 NASCAR Winston Cup teams parked in garages right
now at Daytona International Speedway thinking Gordon's team might
be out of this world.
</P>
<P>
   All Gordon is (psst, all you Gordon trashers, please pay
attention) is someone who wants to win, which is exactly what Mark
Martin, Dale Jarrett, Rusty Wallace and everyone else wearing a
helmet wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   What separates Gordon from most everyone else, however, is he
wins often and at warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Gordon won seven races and the first of three
driving titles.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, he won 10 races and finished runner-up in the
final standings to teammate Terry Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago (yawn), Gordon won another 10 races and a second
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last season, a season for the ages, Gordon tied a
modern-era record with 13 wins and a third driving crown.
</P>
<P>
   That's 40 victories in 127 starts over four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   No one else comes close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably one of the few people that hated to see (the
1998) New Year's countdown,'' Gordon said. ``I wanted to live 1998
for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Why relive it when so many believe 1999 could produce similar
numbers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say that if (Gordon) has the kind of season
they had last year, they're going to win the championship again,''
said Jarrett, who with three wins finished third in the standings.
``I`m not sure myself or anyone else can expect to do the things
that they did.''
</P>
<P>
   What Gordon did, in addition to the victories, was record an
astounding 26 top-five finishes in 33 races. Throw in an additional
two finishes between sixth and 10th, and it's easy to see what few
opportunities the opposition had to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Like none.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way (number) the 24 car (Gordon) takes a step
backwards is if somebody puts him a step backward,'' Jeff Burton
said. ``They're not going to forget how to win. They'll perform at
the same level they were performing at last season, but somebody
has got to make them look like they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is who?
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Martin won a career-high seven races last season, yet still
finished a distant runner-up to Gordon in the final standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to race as hard as we can and do the best
that we can, and that's what they'll do,'' Martin said. ``I expect
them to run as well this year as they did last year. I don't know
what to expect from us for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not going to get caught up in expectations and
disappointments. I've been doing this stuff for a long time and I
don't need that.''
</P>
<P>
   What Gordon needs, believe it or not, is more wins.
</P>
<P>
   Most, he wants to again put team owner Rick Hendrick, who is
battling leukemia, in the winner's circle. Hendrick, who also was
forced to relinquish control of the race team last season as part
of a plea bargain for a mail-fraud charge, has returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of the team is to Rick in victory lane,'' Gordon
said. ``The sooner the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year we (the team) talk about the competition getting
tougher and tougher,'' Gordon said. ``We've got to be able to step
up.''
</P>
<P>
   But how many steps could there possibly be left to take? Doesn't
there come a point when there are no more steps on the ladder?
</P>
<P>
   ``The gains from where we're at are going to be smaller and
smaller, but you've still got to try and get better,'' said chief
mechanic Ray Evernham, perhaps the most important link in the chain
besides Gordon. ``The bottom line is when we roll into Daytona,
when that first wheel rolls, nobody cares anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't care whether you won 13, 14 or none. It's Square
One. We're back at a clean slate. We've got to work as hard, maybe
harder than everybody else, to make some gains and make sure that
if people are going to elevate to the level we were at (last) year,
that we're gone by the time they get here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't wait around for them in this sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's waiting? Gordon?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, that's right, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrians wait. Cars stopped at stop signs wait.
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon? Hah. Gordon might as well be a Tomahawk missile on a
endless flight to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Gordon's team) have raised the bar and set a new
standard,'' said driver Rusty Wallace, the 1991 series champion.
``Since it doesn't seem like they're going to slow up any time
soon, it's up to us and the rest of the series to catch up to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure doesn't look like they're going to wait around for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon loves to hear the competition talk like that because it
means they are talking about him and not him talking about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather deal with the team to beat than the team that
doesn't do anything,'' Gordon said. ``Definitely, it adds pressure
to us. But that's really what we thrive on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is a very determined, very competitive person. I'm a very
competitive person. So are the people at Hendrick Motorsports that
make up this entire team. There's a lot of motivation for us to do
what we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when we hear things like what other teams are saying,
that's what you want to hear because you want to be the team to
beat. I just hope we can live up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't Gordon live up to it? What's so different this
season than last year or the season before?
</P>
<P>
   Well, at the moment, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But teams with Chevrolet Monte Carlos in their pit stalls are
expected to receive the manufacturer's newest version at the Coca
Cola 600 in May at Charlotte Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what kind of a machine it will be? Will it roar or
will it sputter?
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've heard and what I've seen, it should be a good
race car,'' Gordon said. ``It just kind of depends on what
decisions NASCAR makes with the templates and everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I definitely think it's a concern. I think we'd rather
have been working on it in the off-sesaon and bringing it out the
first of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   If the new model does lack anything, you can be sure Gordon and
Evernham's crew will be able to make up for it.
</P>
<P>
   But what is it about Hendrick Motorsports that puts them on a
pedestal above everyone else?
</P>
<P>
   Financial resources?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who's visited the Hendrick operation located in
Harrisburg, N.C., knows it is a behemoth of a facility.
</P>
<P>
   But has anyone seen Dale Earnhardt's new 108,000 square-foot
shop?
</P>
<P>
   Or Joe Gibbs Racing, which at 133,000 square feet, is considered
the ``Garage Mahal'' of all shops?
</P>
<P>
   As far as team personnel, much of Gordon's success likely is due
to the wonderful camaraderie he and Evernham share. If they weren't
driver and crew chief, they'd still be best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's looking to have that Jeff Gordon as their driver,
but I'm not sure that person is out there,'' Jarrett said. ``He's
put himself in a very enviable position because he's aligned
himself with some of the best people in the business. When you do
that and combine it with the talent he has, it's a great match-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he's the best in the business and has all the best
people in the right place, we're not giving up. We know they can be
beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Gordon can't be beaten again this year, there's always
next year when a guy named Dale Earnhardt Jr., is due to drive
full-time on the Winston Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   So anticipated is Earnhardt's arrival, track promoters already
are hyping the rivalry, which actually starts this season as the
younger Earnhardt will make five Winston Cup appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with Gordon making five NASCAR Busch Grand National
starts, they will meet 10 times on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I not surprised at (the hype)?'' Gordon asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, however, is impressed with Earnhardt's Busch Grand
National progress, which resulted in a monster championship year
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's amazed me, how patient he has been,'' Gordon said. ``He's
definitely aggressive. He's very talented, but he's shown a lot of
patience and that's impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Dale Jr., be the next Gordon?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say,'' said retired driver Richard Petty, who
with a NASCAR all-time mark of 200 wins, was the original Gordon.
``Three, four years ago, you would have said who's going to be the
next Earnhardt. There was nobody on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same with Gordon. The guy that beats Gordon, if he's
not here now, he will be here. Nobody stays on top all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there. I've been up and I've been down. Earnhardt
has been up and been down. Nobody stays on top for very long. Time
takes are of it. The good Lord has a way of balancing everything
out. Nobody gets to be a super human forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even Gordon?
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back at last year and just shake my head,'' Gordon
said. ``I don't think we necessarily look at how can we win more
than 13 races. I'm telling you, in this sport, if you win one race,
you've done something. If you win five or more, then you're having
one heck of an awesome season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect to go out there and do that. But we do feel
we're capable of it if the right things fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they fall into sequence again this season, well, there's
always next season, right? &QL;

ZANARDI'S FLIGHT CERTAIN TO YIELD NEW LOOK AT TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that Alex Zanardi has departed for life overseas and the
Formula One racing circuit, Championship Auto Racing Teams will
have a new driver at the throne for the first time in three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The series also may have its first titlist in four years not
sporting Target/Chip Ganassi Racing colors.
</P>
<P>
   Ganassi driver Jimmy Vasser won the 1996 CART title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to miss Alex and what he brought to the series
and the team, but it will be business as usual,'' Vasser said.
``We're going to have the same basic package with Honda engines,
Reynard chassis and Firestone tires, and that has been the package
to beat fore a few years now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Firestone has been the dominating tire on the circuit.
In 19 races last season, Firestone was on the winning car in 18.
</P>
<P>
   And at last week's three-day CART Spring Training session at
Miami-Dade Homestead (Fla.) Motorsports Complex, Firestone drivers
posted eight of the fastest 10 speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear, however, should make some inroads in 1999 because the
company has more time to devote to the circuit now that it has
ended its F-1 involvement.
</P>
<P>
   As for driver alignments, there have been many off-season moves.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Rahal retired and replaced himself with Max Papis.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Pruett, who at age 39 replaces Rahal as the circuit's
oldest driver, left car owner Pat Patrick, a part-time Valley
resident, for Arciero-Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett's new teammate, Indy Lights champion Cristiano da Matta,
is one of several rookies to get their CART induction papers.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Juan Pablo Montoya has replaced Zanardi and Robby Gordon
began his own team with assistance from Mike Held and Indy Racing
League team owner John Menard.
</P>
<P>
   Helio Castro-Neves, who finished second to Tony Kanaan for last
season's rookie of the year crown, left Bettenhausen Motorsports
for Hogan Racing, where he replaces Finland's J.J. Lehto, who lives
in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Al Unser Jr. didn't go anywhere, but lost teammate Andre Ribeiro
when team owner Roger Penske chose to go with one driver for the
first time in several years.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Unser's losing streak now has reached 55 races and
counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is we're going to be a lot better in 1999,''
Unser said. ``I think everybody could see how good our Penske car
was last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Another driver who won't make the starting grid at the March 21
season opener is former Scottsdale driver Paul Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   Following a series of fines, penalties and being placed on
probation, CART suspended Tracy for the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians Patrick Carpentier and Greg Moore posted the fastest
speeds at Miami-Dade and some are predicting Moore will become the
new Zanardi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we rattled a few cages among some of the people who
had already tested (at Miami-Dade) for three or four days,'' said
Moore, who with two wins and four poles in 1998, finished fifth in
the standings. ``The list of people that are competitive and able
to win races is just massive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to be consistent over the entire
season. I certainly expect us to be race-winning contenders pretty
much everywhere we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotsman Dario Franchitti, Tracy's teammate at Team Kool Green,
won three races last season and also is considered a threat by
some, including ``The'' ``Arizona Republic,'' to replace Zanardi as
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti, however, wasn't thrilled with the test session.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found a balance for the car,'' Franchitti said. ``It's
not a good balance, but at least we've got a balance, and when we
do something to the car now, something happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a day behind, but we've got a couple of days of test
here (in Miami) in March and I think we'll be where we need to be
for the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradise Valley resident Adrian Fernandez also has attracted
attention as a CART title contender. Fernandez won twice and
finished fourth in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez's teammate is P.J. Jones, whose father, Parnelli
Jones, won the 1963 Indianapolis 500. Jones lives in Scottsdale
along with CART driver Mark Blundell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Swift (chassis) is a good car and has a lot of
potential,'' Fernandez said. ``We are just scratching the surface
of the car's capabilities and there is still a lot of work to be
done. But I see improvement each time we test the car.'' &QL;

FORGIVENESS FOR CLINTON A COMPLEX NOTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daylight has nearly ended when Corpus Christi Catholic Church
opens its confessionals to those who need a midweek penance.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they retreat behind closed doors, reveal their sins
and ask for forgiveness. Many sit and pray for a while in the
church with austere white walls and stained-glass windows before
going on with their lives. They have come to clear their
consciences.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in the back of the church, a twentysomething couple sit
in a pew and clutch each other tightly. Tears trickle down her
face, and he kisses them off her cheeks. They sit that way for
several minutes. Finally, they get up and walk together toward the
confession booth. He goes in first; she waits her turn.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness. Punishment. Penance. It is a simple concept.
</P>
<P>
   For a nation wrestling with the sins of their president, such
notions are far more complicated. Behind closed doors Wednesday,
senators spend another day grappling with President Clinton's
iniquities and whether he should be forgiven or punished.
</P>
<P>
   As Judith Walters lights candles to the Virgin Mary, she reveals
her conflicting emotions over the president's transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Christian, I know what is right to do. I believe anyone
who is sorry for their sins should be forgiven,'' she says. ``But
outside the church, I have different feelings. I think about
politics. I think about what the office of the presidency should
stand for. I think about what a leader should be. And I think he
shouldn't get away with what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrugging her shoulders and heading toward the door, Walters,
nonetheless, adds compassionately, ``I think he is just flesh and
blood, too. So we should forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to face his judgment by day's end. Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott wants a vote by midafternoon on whether
Clinton is guilty. But some already have granted their
dispensations.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Vermont Sen. James Jeffords was the first
Republican to offer his. He acknowledged that Clinton had committed
shameful acts. But the senator, grudgingly perhaps, echoed the
refrain of the president's supporters and insisted that Clinton's
offenses ``do not reach the high standard'' of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Harkin, though he has made little effort to conceal his
views on the matter, did the same. The Iowa senator told reporters
Wednesday he would not vote to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Will America follow suit?
</P>
<P>
   At Corpus Christi, Mark Rowan was forgiving. Sitting in one of
the church gardens, as he does after confession, Rowan gazes at a
statue of Jesus with outstretched hands and talks about absolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who hasn't been wrong before? Who hasn't done something they
regret and they are very sorry for?'' Rowan asks, adding that he
believes in the power of confession and forgiveness. ``(The
president) is sorry for what he did. He deserves forgiveness, too.
We all do.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few people remain in the church as Teresa Margolis dips a
fingertip into a bowl of holy water. She doubts the Senate will
ever truly forgive Clinton for his lies. Margolis predicts the
president will be acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate,
but only because they couldn't get enough Democrats to vote with
them. But she said Clinton has another jury to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this is over, I think we're going to need lots of
spiritual healing,'' Margolis says. ``The trial has shown an ugly
side of human nature. In the end, it'll be everyday Americans like
me and you who will decide whether he should be forgiven, and
whether he deserves to be forgiven. Of course, God, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie
Amparano is taking the pulse of people in the Valley. Do they care
about President Clinton's trial? Do they want him removed from
office? What does captivate Americans? She looks for the answers.

CAN BRACK BECOME STEWART-LIKE STAR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A star was born. Now he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart, whose immense talents seemed a perfect tonic for
the fledgling Pep Boys Indy Racing League, waved bye-bye last
season following three successful years with the series.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was the original IRL ``Poster Boy.'' More than that,
Stewart, who has departed for Joe Gibbs Racing and the NASCAR
Winston Cup circuit, was a star on whom the IRL could hang its hat.
</P>
<P>
   Now the circuit must find someone else.
</P>
<P>
   But who?
</P>
<P>
   Billy Boat? Jeff Ward? Greg Ray?
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Maybe Kenny Brack.
</P>
<P>
   Brack seems a logical choice. Although born in Sweden and
probably not the ideal driver IRL officials had in mind to lead the
series in its infancy, Brack still reflects unmistakable talent.
</P>
<P>
   He not only drives for the legendary A.J. Foyt and is the
defending series champion, Brack won three successive races last
season to firmly entrench himself as a budding star.
</P>
<P>
   Is Brack ready for such lofty status?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel like a star?'' Brack asked. ``I am what I am and I
do what I do, and that's it. I don't look upon myself as a star. I
try to stay the way I've always been. Being yourself is the best
way to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack being Brack was certainly enough to capture last season's
IRL crown.
</P>
<P>
   But was it enough to overcome the loss of Stewart?
</P>
<P>
   Reigning Indy 500 champion Eddie Cheever Jr., a native
Phoenician and winner of the IRL opener last month at Walt Disney
World Speedway, believes one driver doesn't necessarily make or
break the series.
</P>
<P>
   If one star leaves, Cheever said, there's always one or two or
three to step in and fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing drivers are not ordained like the Pope,'' Cheever said.
``They're created. The way you create them is to have racing
drivers competing against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRL has done an incredibly good job in understanding what
the American public wants, which is oval racing. You'd be hard put
to find an American series where the racing is more hard fought.
The IRL is emulating a lot of things NASCAR did, and racing on
ovals is one of them. The IRL has really put the driver back in the
forefront.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can argue IRL races last season didn't provide some of
the best shows on television. But what it can't afford, despite
Cheever's claim, is the loss of such stars as Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Even a NASCAR loyalist such as Charlotte Motor Speedway
President Humpy Wheeler realizes stars capable of carrying a sport
are rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have seen (Stewart) stay in IRL
racing,'' Wheeler said. ``He was making a name for (the series).
</P>
<P>
   ``What we can't have now is Kenny Brack going Formula One
racing. He has to stay in the IRL.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Brack received several offers to take his talents
elsewhere, he decided there was no place like home, and at the
moment, home is the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without getting specific, I probably had three really, really
good offers from other teams,'' said Brack, who finished 22nd in
the opener following an accident on Lap 106 involving rookie
Gualter Salles. ``I can't tell you which series they were, but they
were with very good teams, racing winning teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel right now that I'm with a very good team. We get
along great and we still have some unfinished business in the IRL.
The Indy 500 is still the greatest race in the world and you can
only get there if you're in the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't have a desire to go anywhere. I don't see any
other series as a step up. I see a couple that would be side steps,
like (Championship Auto Racing Teams) and Formula One. But there's
no reason to change just to change. I'm very happy where I'm at.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRL is good racing, very good racing. We just need to draw
people's attention to the races.''
</P>
<P>
   At least, Wheeler has liked what he's seen, so much so that one
race is scheduled at Charlotte and two are at Texas Motor Speedway,
which is owned by the same corporation that owns Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have no respect for each other,'' Wheeler said.
``It looks like stock cars from 1958, on dirt. They dart and do
things that stock cars can't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) the greatest thing the IRL has going for it is the Indy
500. The Indy 500 is still the greatest race in the world. If Kenny
Brack wins the Indy 500 this year, everybody in the free world is
going to know that . . . at least for 48 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Stewart wins it, well, the IRL star search will have to
continue. &QL;

POSSIBLE AMWEST SALE SLOWS EXPANSION AT SKY HARBOR
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX _ Believing that America West Airlines is likely to be
sold, Phoenix Mayor Skip Rim sza is slowing down an expansion
project at Sky Harbor International Airport and planning for air
travel with a reduced America West pres ence.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It appears the sale of America West is insurmountable, and
it's just a question of when,'' Rimsza said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he has been unable to meet with America
West executives. But the mayor said he bases his conclusion on the
views of aviation-industry analysts, as well as those of the city's
airline consultant.
</P>
<P>
   There is no deal imminent, al though United Airlines last month
said it was interested in acquiring the Tempe-based carrier. Other
air lines then chimed in, but no deal has been announced, and some
Wall Street analysts doubt that one will ever happen.
</P>
<P>
   America West officials declined to comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Mike Boyd, who believes a United purchase of Amer
ica West is possible, said it's prudent for the Phoenix mayor to be
scripting a worst-case scenario for Sky Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's being very realis tic,'' said Boyd of the Boyd
Group, an aviation-consulting firm in Ev ergreen, Colo. ``Looking
for a life raft after you've hit an iceberg is not doom and
gloom.''
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza said he will delay for 30 days the award of an estimated
$86 million contract to expand the parking garage at Terminal 4.
The City Council was scheduled to consider that contract next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   During the delay, the city's staff will study how to shuffle the
airline lineup at Sky Harbor, assuming a sale would lead to fewer
flights.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Rimsza said he wants to talk to executives of
other airlines, to sell them on the idea of bringing more service
to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Phoenix is concerned, Rimsza said that there would be
no positive side to an America West sale. Not only would the area
lose a corporate headquarters, he said, it also would diminish Sky
Harbor's status as an airline hub, reduce the low-fare competition
that exists be tween America West and Southwest Airlines, and leave
the airport with less business.
</P>
<P>
   The city is building 12 new gates for America West at Terminal
4. That work began before reports of a possible sale surfaced. All
indica tions are that the gates will be completed.
</P>
<P>
   But, Rimsza asked, what happens if there isn't an America West
to fly into those gates?
</P>
<P>
   He has asked the city's aviation staff to look at different
lineups for the airport's terminals. The city soon will need to
replace 37-year-old Terminal 2, which has 12 gates.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Wallace, a deputy city manager who will direct that
study, said the city needs to come up with some options quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those `what ifs' because no one knows what the
final outcome will be,'' Wallace said. ``We just want to remain
flexible, so we can adapt to the airlines. It's important we think
it through now, while we have time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempe Mayor Neil Giuliano said he agreed with Rimsza's approach.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd take the same cautious approach as Rimsza if he
were running the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Although he does not want to lose America West and its Tempe
headquarters, Giuliano is less glum than his Phoenix counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   He said he met last week with Bill Franke, America West's chair
man of the board, and got no insight into whether a deal is likely.
</P>
<P>
   But even if there were to be a sale, it would take six to 10
months for it to be completed, he said, citing various legal
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the airline is on track to move in late March
into its new headquarters in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bill Franke's office, you'll see all the furniture is
tagged for a move,'' Giuliano said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix plans to add 3,600 spaces to the 3,100-space parking
garage at Terminal 4. The expansion is expected to take three
years, to minimize disruption to travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines was less than enthusiastic about Rimsza's
plan to delay the expansion project.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DeeDee Crook, regional market ing director for Southwest, said
the airline thinks now is the time to build for growth in air
travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business for us right now is very good,'' Crook said. ``Even
if traffic were to dip . . . at the airport, that would be a good
time . . . to complete the improvements and prepare for the
future.'' &QL;

WINNING IS JOHNSON'S (PRO) STOCK IN TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He holds two national records, is 13 wins away from tying the
great Bob Glidden in all-time National Hot Rod Association
victories and clearly is one of the dominant drag racers of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Who is he?
</P>
<P>
   John Force? Dave Schultz? Gary Scelzi?
</P>
<P>
   No, no and no.
</P>
<P>
   Try Warren Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   With nine wins last season, Johnson now has 72, two more than
Force and 13 shy of Glidden's 85.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also won a fourth NHRA Pro Stock title, and in October
at Dallas, shot down previous national marks for speed (201.34 mph)
and elapsed time (6.867 seconds).
</P>
<P>
   A season for all seasons, however, is just another season to
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to move forward,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   OK.
</P>
<P>
   So what about 1999? And 2000? At age 55, soon to be age 56, is
it possible for Johnson to one day overtake Glidden, who at one
time in their dragstrip wars treated Johnson the way an alley cat
treats a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible, but I don't think about it,'' said Johnson, who
was routinely beaten by Glidden in most of their early head-to-head
races. ``Everyone always asks me about that. Do I really want to
beat Glidden's record?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a goal of mine. I've never really considered it.
Records are made to be broken and sooner or later someone is going
to break it. It's just the nature of the game. If I break it,
someone else will break mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Glidden) did a remarkable job of winning 85 races. He was
very fortunate to be in the right place at the right time. And I
was unfortunate to start racing when he was in his prime. Then,
when his career started to go into decline, and I hate to use that
word, that's when I started winning. It's just two overlapping
curves.''
</P>
<P>
   But what curves.
</P>
<P>
   Either way you put it, Glidden and Johnson or Johnson and
Glidden, no one in the Pro Stock division comes close to
accomplishing on the dragstrip what these two drivers have
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Glidden is retired, but Johnson, although seemingly nearing the
point of no return, believes he is nowhere close to calling it a
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our program is as strong as it's ever been,'' said
Johnson, who unveiled a new Pontiac Trans-Am paint scheme last
weekend in the opener at Pomona, Calif., where he was ousted in
Round 2 of eliminations. ``Overall, we're doing pretty decently.
You ride a winning horse as long as it's still moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's still moving, all right.
</P>
<P>
   It's moving because Johnson won't stop moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys never get to see their fathers like I do,'' said son
Kurt Johnson, who also competes in Pro Stock. ``I'm sure proud of
him. He's the professor of Pro Stock, and it's well-earned. He
outperformed everyone else last year by two or three hundredths.''
</P>
<P>
   If the elder Johnson ever surpasses Glidden, the professor will
have earned a doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the all-time winner is only one facet of the big
picture,'' said Johnson, who also finished runner-up eight times in
the final standings, three of them against you-know-who (Glidden).
``The number of championships you win is another facet and how well
you did financially is another facet.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're trying to do at our race shop is to make a decent
living. And I still enjoy racing.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has to talk to Scelzi about enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   Since replacing the late Blaine Johnson in 1997, Scelzi has won
two straight Top Fuel championships.
</P>
<P>
   Last season's crown came courtesy of a record-tying six wins in
the division and national records for speed and elapsed time.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first year, I thought, `Man, there's no way we can
have a season as good or come close to what we did,' '' Scelzi
said. ``Then, we turn around and win another one. I mean, I'm going
to quit asking how good it can get because I know how bad it can
get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm one excited guy. I feel really good about
myself and about the team. Everybody here (at the race shop) is
just upbeat.'' &QL;

KIDNAP VICTIM ON LIFE SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Daily News Staff Writer Steve Carney contributed to this
story.) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As abduction victim Chris Rawlings lay on life
support Wednesday, police searched for motorists who saw the
attackers and were offered a $1,000 bill for a ride away from the
crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the gunmen crashed Rawlings' Bentley on Monday,
spilling him out of the trunk, one man ran to an intersection in
the suburban Los Angeles community of Tarzana in the San Fernando
Valley and tried to buy his escape with money taken in the robbery,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe no one took up the man's offer. ``They
probably got a good look at the suspects,'' said Los Angeles police
Detective Rick Swanston, an investigator on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect is described as an African-American man in his 20s,
wearing a white shirt and sweating profusely, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The second attacker -- described only as an African-American man
-- got away by committing a carjacking and later dumping the car on
the Foothill Freeway at Maclay Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators now believe the motive for the abduction is
robbery, and they suspect the gunmen followed Rawlings to his Quedo
Drive home, beat him and then ransacked the house in search of
valuables.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said they suspect Rawlings drew the robbers'
attention because he was wearing expensive jewelry and driving a
$250,000 Bentley. They believe he did not know the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred as Rawlings returned to his home from the
supermarket, where he bought diapers for his baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a follow-home,'' Swanston said. ``They ransacked
the home and stole property.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives declined to provide more details about the stolen
items. They said they believe the robbers stuffed Rawlings into the
trunk of his car and drove off with the intention of taking him to
an ATM machine to withdraw money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our best bet,'' Swanston said.
</P>
<P>
   Other details emerging include that when Rawlings' wife, Barbie,
witnessed the attack in the garage, she fled onto the roof with
their two children, 1 and 3, Swanston said. There, she called 911.
</P>
<P>
   By the time police arrived, the gunmen were escaping in
Rawlings' Bentley with him in the trunk. Following a chase with
speeds as high as 100 mph, the Bentley crashed and the attackers
fled.
</P>
<P>
   Downed power lines from the crash and rain foiled efforts to
catch the men. ``As soon as they got out of the car, they were
gone,'' Swanston said. ``They just disappeared into the woodwork.
Everything blackened.''
</P>
<P>
   While detectives worked to piece together clues, at least a
dozen of Rawlings' family members paced the hallways at Northridge
Hospital Medical Center, consoling one another as they waited for
any updates.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings suffered massive head trauma, including a deep puncture
wound to his temple, apparently during the crash, Swanston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His injuries are life-threatening,'' the detective said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Knoernschild, president of Rawlings' alma mater,
Crespi Carmelite High School in nearby Encino, has shuttled back
and forth to the hospital since the carjacking to be with the
injured man and his family. He said he administered last rites to
him Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fine young man. He loved life,'' Knoernschild said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw Rawlings only last week, when the 1987 graduate
stopped by to visit. ``He seemed very happy. His conversation
revolved around his family,'' Knoernschild said.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings talked about his joy at coming home to see his young
daughters, and his efforts to work less on weekends so he could
spend more time with his wife. ``He was a young man who seemed to
enjoy life.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings co-owns Gentlemen's Quarters Fine Mens Clothing in the
San Fernando Valley community of Woodland Hills with Rodney
Leonard, who said his friend's outlook is not good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just praying that he's going to be all right,'' said
Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings, a star football player in high school, ran track in
college and went into the business world with the same focus and
intensity, Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an entrepreneur. He's just all over,'' Leonard said.
``Chris is just a businessman. It's hard to say what happened or
how it happened. I don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Rawlings makes a living through auto leasing and the
stock market. His friends said he co-owns the clothing store and
works for Woodland Hills-based Amazon Leasing, where he conducts
seminars and sets up and sells software.

   MIAMI-CUBANS (Miami) _ The decades of immigration from Fidel
Castro's Cuba has made this city so distinctly Cuban that the
cultural clash here is no longer between Cubans and Americans as
much as between different waves of Cuban immigrants. With each
batch of immigrants who win the annual visa lottery, with each of
the smuggled boatloads of Cubans that land almost daily in South
Florida, Cuban Miami becomes less cohesive, encompassing a people
who differ in social class, race, generation and politics, who
increasingly come from different worlds. Special report. By Mireya
Navarro.

   MIRANDA-RIGHTS (Undated) _ It sat there unused by prosecutors
for thirty years, but this week, a law passed by Congress in 1968
was dusted off by a federal appeals court in Virginia and used to
declare that federal law enforcement officials need not follow one
of the best known Supreme Court decisions of this century, Miranda
vs. Arizona, under which criminal suspects are routinely read their
rights everywhere in America. From coast to coast, prosecutors,
defense lawyers and legal experts said the ruling provided the most
serious challenge to the Miranda ruling since it was issued in
1966, and opened an unexpected debate about one of this country's
bedrock legal rules. By William Glaberson.

   NY-SUSPECT-MAYOR (New York) _ News analysis: If the greatest
accomplishment of the Giuliani administration is the precipitous
drop in the city's crime rate, its most glaring shortcoming may be
the failure to cultivate a trusting relationship with most of the
city's black leaders. Now, the best and the worst have melded into
the case of the unarmed African immigrant who died in a hail of
police bullets, presenting Mayor Rudolph Giuliani with one of the
most perilous challenges of his political career. By Dan Barry.

   WINDSOR-CHAIRS (Hampton, N.H.) _ ``Probably the greatest public

``Dave found a picture a while ago of a Shaker dining room,'' he

   CUOMO-LOGO (Undated) _ The logo is nothing spectacular. If it

give it a second glance. It's just three lowercase letters topped

economical symbol represents the U.S. government _ the Department
of Housing and Urban Development, to be precise. The big accent
mark is actually a roof. Lisa MacSpadden, the department's deputy
assistant secretary for public affairs, explained that the new
symbol was a pet project of Andrew M. Cuomo, the HUD Secretary. She
volunteered Cuomo for an interview about the logo. By Karrie
Jacobs.

house, in eastern Bali, packs a lot of history and serves up a
classic Balinese scene: terraced rice fields and Mount Agung, the
volcano that is the island's most important natural feature. By
Clifford A. Pearson.

UCLA BEATS USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Danny Farmer has never lost to USC. Not in football. Not in
volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   For three seasons, Farmer was on the winning side of the
USC-UCLA football rivalry. And during that same span, five
consecutive volleyball matches between the two teams have resulted
i Bruins victories.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Farmer earned No.6 and the team (7-2, 5-12) won
its 13th straight over the ninth-ranked Trojans (5-2, 5-1) with a
15-5, 15-10, 15-10 victory in a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
interdivision match at USC's North Gym.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer had 12 kills, a far cry from Evan Thatcher's 20 or Adam
Naeve's 19, but it was apparent he was up for this match,
especially with the heckling factor.
</P>
<P>
   The fans packed into the tiny North Gym (1,250 came to this
match in a building that seats 1,000) and heckled Farmer
mercilessly. They said he stunk and asked if he remembered the
football team's loss at Miami. Farmer later claimed he never heard
it, but his playing said otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   After Thatcher went into the crowd to chase a ball in the third
game, the fans ribbed him. Farmer responded with a quick, hard
kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people talk a lot,'' he said. ``You don't listen.
You've got to prepare for it every single night.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only one. The fans often asked Naeve if he's
pigeon-toed (he isn't). Yet Naeve calmly went about his business,
knocking down numerous quick sets and blocking effectively for the
fourth-ranked Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   In the third game, he blocked freshman Beau Rawi. Rawi pointed
his index finger at him as if to say, ``That's one.''
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, Naever blocked him again, one of his seven
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they'd go back to him, and I knew he'd hit it the same
way,'' Naeve said. ``He's a freshman, and he made a freshman
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's youth, which had served it well in winning six straight
matches, was exposed Wednesday night. Freshman Brook Billings had
15 kills, junior Eli Fairfield had 13 kills and sophomore Craig
Dennis had 11 kills in two games, but the lack of senior leadership
showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fired up,'' said sophomore Trevor Julian, a
Harvard-Westlake graduate who finished with seven kills and seven
errors, and who said it was his fraternity brothers doing the
heckling. ``Every now and then it (inexperience) happens, and we
couldn't pull ourselves out of it. We didn't have a pulse. Like in
the first game: We got down big (13-2) and couldn't pull ourselves
out.'' &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

UCLA COACH STEVE LAVIN CREATES A SPORTS FIRST: SINCERE APOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Among the great upsets, it won't rank with
Douglas-Tyson, Yank-Soviet hockey or asteroid-dinosaur.
Nevertheless, it caused me to slap palm to forehead and tip over in
the Barcalounger.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently unprompted by lawyers, cops, angry spouse or
embarrassed boss, a prominent sports figure held himself
accountable for unsportsmanlike behavior and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly. Loudly. In print. With sincerity and without
qualification.
</P>
<P>
   If you missed it, check the letter to the editor in Wednesday's
P-I sports section. UCLA men's basketball coach Steve Lavin
apologized for one of the great sideline rages in recent sports
history, during the Bruin-Husky game Jan. 31 at Hec Ed.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin had a reasonable argument. Star guard Baron Davis fouled
out of the game on what TV replays showed to be a phantom call
against Deon Luton.
</P>
<P>
   The foul, and subsequent technical fouls on Davis and Lavin, put
Luton on the line for eight consecutive free throws, an odd
spectacle destined to rival major league baseball's latest
marketing scheme: The Festival of the Intentional Walk.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin took the reasonable argument to an unreasonable end. The
ride was a dandy, however, complete with the
hold-him-back-and-drag-him-away maneuver that is one of the primary
jobs of assistant coaches.
</P>
<P>
   As a fan of the exploits of George Karl, Lou Piniella and
Kramer, I put the Lavin Lambada ahead of the best of the ex-Sonic
coach's sideline nutouts, and alongside the premier twitchy
pratfalls of Seinfeld's sidekick. Still No. 1 is the Mariner
manager's hat-kicking episode last season, a rage of the ages that
was just an orange fright wig short of the Emmett Kelly Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Riveting as was Lavin's spectacle, he knew his hysteria cost his
team points as well as momentum. Although somewhat calculated,
because he wanted to make a point about his cumulative frustration
with a Pac-10 official whom he was convinced had it in for the
Bruins, the episode flashed the kind of reckless selfishness that
he consistently counsels his players against.
</P>
<P>
   So he penned a letter of apology, sending it not only to
Washington, but his fellow Pac-10 coaches and athletic directors as
well as Puget Sound-area sports editors.
</P>
<P>
   It follows a similar letter from Davis to the Pac-10, but that
seemed the sort of mandatory act of contrition ordered by a coach
or a school.
</P>
<P>
   The Lavin letter was different because basketball coaches do the
Foghorn Leghorn footstomp fairly often, and I don't recall any
offering much more than a mumbled post-game regret while they wipe
off the foamy saliva.
</P>
<P>
   There was surprise, too, for Marc Dellins, who figured to be
managing any spin doctoring from his position as UCLA's sports
information director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' said Dellins by phone Wednesday. ``I knew about the
letter, but I didn't know he sent it to newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Lavin said his actions were inexcusable and
inappropriate, taking away attention from what he said should have
gone to UW coach Bob Bender and his team for a big win.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin is a little sensitive about this sort of behavior because
he was raised by schoolteachers who were big on setting an example,
and also because he's never drawn a tech in 2{ years as UCLA coach.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there he was, the lead highlight on the sports-news shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I did after the game was apologize to the team
for being a bad role model,'' Lavin said Wednesday. ``Then when I
talked to the media, I gave credit to Washington, but the reporters
were more interested in the technicals and me. I felt afterward
that Washington didn't get the credit it deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellins said that some forget Lavin is only 34, and perhaps a
little more vulnerable to an unthrottled adrenal gland than more
experienced coaches. While that's probably true, Lavin also offered
up a consciousness that many of his older peers would do well to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to diminish the credibility of the Pac-10, which
has taken such great strides in recent years to establish itself as
the top conference in the West,'' he said. ``You just want to be
clear in your actions that you don't destroy something that took so
much to build.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely that the Pac-10 battlements will pull a Jericho
wall because of Lavin's actions. But it's surprisingly reassuring
to know that he would even consider such a consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, Lavin was ashamed. How often does a sports figure
publicly own up to something like that?
</P>
<P>
   The standard sports apology scenario usually contains an
eye-contact-avoiding athlete or coach, surrounded by friends and/or
suits, reading a statement at a podium in an awkward cadence
containing several words he had never spoken until he rehearsed
them five minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A cynical part of me is whispering that maybe Lavin has plotted
this gig for maximum PR value, too.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, I'm going to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   In a time when it is possible for a president to argue the
meaning of the word ``is,'' I'm ready for a guy who will own up to
destructive behavior, its consequences to others, and mean it when
he says he's sorry.

HORNADAY, SPRAGUE KEEP TRUCKIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Ron Hornaday never will forget the telephone
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Ron, it's Dale Earnhardt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday: ``Get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt: ``No, it's really me. I saw you race (in the NASCAR
Winter Heat Series) and I like the way you drive. Would you be
interested in driving for me and (wife) Teresa (in the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series)?''
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday: ``When do you want me there.''
</P>
<P>
   This was five years, 23 wins and two driving titles ago. To
Hornaday, it always will be yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep going back to when Dale and Teresa gave me that first
phone call,'' Hornaday said. ``We've always set high goals for
ourselves to go out and win championships. That's all we're trying
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   In the truck circuit's brief four-year history, Hornaday has
finished third, first, fifth and first, capturing last season's
title by a scant three points over nemesis Jack Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   No one should be surprised if Hornaday and Sprague again duke it
out for the crown.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hornaday, Sprague never has ventured too far from atop the
ladder, nearly mirroring Hornaday in productivity. Sprague won five
races last season, one less than Hornaday, and has 13 career
victories. He's finished fifth, second, first and second in the
series' four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get away from each other,'' Hornaday said. ``I know
we're going to be battling again.''
</P>
<P>
   A mistake, however, would be to think there aren't other
contenders to worry about. Just look around.

Sauter and Stacy Compton are just a small sampling of talented
threats capable of dethroning Hornaday and Sprague from familiar
perches.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Chevy is debuting its Silverado model to replace
the dominant C/K, which accounted for 65 wins and all four
manufacturer championships to date.
</P>
<P>
   Although similar to the C/K, the Silverado is incorporating a
new front-end design and a more rounded appearance overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornaday camp also will benefit with the addition of Steve
Hmiel, a Jack Roush protege hired to be team manager for Dale
Earnhardt Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hmiel likely will devote much of his time and energy to
Earnhardt's NASCAR Winston Cup and Busch Grand National programs,
which includes Dale Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Steve Park,
Hornaday won't be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to realize that everyone at DEI is on (an equal
plane),'' Hmiel said. Everyone gets all the equipment they need and
one of my jobs is to make sure no one feels left in the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes Hornaday, who doesn't want to be known as the Dale
Earnhardt of the truck series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the Ron Hornaday of the truck series,'' Hornaday
said. ``If I win seven championships like (Earnhardt has done in
Winston Cup), then you can say I'm the Dale Earnhardt of trucks.'' &QL;

1998 ACT OF EARNHARDT JR. HARD TO FOLLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is the apple in his son's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He is the tallest mountain, the brightest star, the greatest
painting.
</P>
<P>
   He is Pavarotti on stage at the LaScala, Michael Jordan with the
ball in the closing seconds, Marlon Brando in front of a movie
camera.
</P>
<P>
   He is everything to Dale Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a touching example of a son's love for a
father, it is the undeniable affection Dale Jr., has for Dale
Earnhardt Sr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my dad very much,'' Dale Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   It's that unflinching love, that desire to please a legendary
father that helped spur Dale Jr., to untold riches and success last
season on the NASCAR Busch Grand National circuit. Dale Jr. begins
what is expected to be his last season on the Busch tour on
Saturday when he races in the NAPA Auto Parts 300 at Daytona
International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Although a rookie, Dale Jr., 24, burst from nowhere and grabbed
the Grand National spotlight with a series-high seven wins and the
driving title, becoming the hottest stock-car driver to hit the
circuit this side of Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of set a barrier that's going to be hard for any of us
new guys to reach,'' said Grand National rookie Adam Petty,
grandson of Richard Petty.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, when Dale Earnhardt Inc. officials decided to put
the younger Earnhardt in a Grand National machine, the short-term
goal was for him to hopefully develop into a top-five driver by the
end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   A trip into victory lane was viewed as a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   One win soon became two, then three and, finally, seven. A star
was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of what Dale Jr, has accomplished,'' said Dale Sr.,
a seven-time driving champion. ``He has surprised all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Earnhardt only had a handshake agreement to drive
for his father at the beginning last season. Then, when it became
apparent Dale Jr. was too good and too focused to risk losing (as
if that really were possible), a formal contract was drawn up.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jr., who was being paid $500 per week plus a percentage of
race winnings, signed a lucrative five-year deal that included five
Winston Cup races this season and a full-time effort beginning in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Later, DEI President Don Hawk negotiated a five-year contract
with Anheuser-Busch Inc., that is worth about $10 million per
season for Dale Jr., to drive the brewery's Winston Cup car through
2004.
</P>
<P>
   More endorsements have followed since the season concluded, so
many that the younger Earnhardt now has the financial means to not
only sell his double-wide trailer to move into a new home, he can
darn near afford to buy the entire subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Dale Jr., remains unassuming and almost embarrassed to be
associated with such sudden wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just honored,'' Dale Jr. said. ``I feel very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But no one can deny Dale Jr.'s obvious talents, which are as
immense as they are distinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw flashes of (Dale Jr.'s) brilliance, but we didn't see
enough to foresee a Busch Grand National champion with seven wins
and three poles,'' Hawk said. ``He surprised us that underneath the
shell of a late model stock car driver there was so much more than
we ever saw. He just drove the devil out of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put him in a Winston Cup car and sent him to the racetrack,
telling him to take five laps. The son of a gun guy takes eight
laps because he's having so much fun and won't come in. The next
thing you know, we look at the stopwatch and he's running as fast
as the other guys (during the test).''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jr. may be the sport's next superstar. And don't for a
minute believe NASCAR won't try and help perpetuate a Gordon-Dale
Jr. rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Although both drivers have enviable qualities off the racetrack
_ both share boy-next-door characteristics _ they are near
opposites in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is Hollywood handsome, is married to a former model and
well-spoken in front of a microphone or camera.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jr., is ruggedly handsome, single and soft-spoken to the
point of almost being shy.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: Gordon is Gordon and Dale Jr., well, he's an
Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Jeff have talked (briefly) about it a little bit,''
Dale Jr. said. ``He feels like me, that we can use it to our
advantage. We know it's going to fill seats a little bit if he's
got somebody racing him hard, doing it every week and battling for
the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to do is be competitive. If (Gordon) is the
competition, he's the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jr. knows it will be hard to emulate Gordon's success and
reach the top, if he ever does.
</P>
<P>
   No promises, Dale Jr. said. Just a conviction to try and follow
in his daddy's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I'm still so young is probably an advantage,''
Dale Jr. said. ``I probably have no clue or no idea what's going
on. All I know is it feels good (to see fans wearing T-shirts with
his photo splashed across the front).
</P>
<P>
   ``That was exciting to see that. It kind of fueled the fire to
drive even harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the elder Earnhardt is difficult, if not impossible, to
pin down for interview requests, Dale Jr. has politely obliged.
</P>
<P>
   At the Charlotte Motor Speedway media tour in early January,
Dale Jr. twice was paraded in front of notepads and cameras within
a span of 24 hours. And he answered every question without
flinching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I`m honored that (the media) are interested in what I have to
say right now,'' Dale Jr., said. ``It means a lot to me to give you
guys the real answer.''
</P>
<P>
   And it also means a lot to take care of the fans, for it wasn't
too long ago that Dale Jr., also was one of those fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race fans pay a lot of attention to your personality because
that's something that's hard to see on the racetrack,'' Dale Jr.,
said. ``The more they can know about you, the more they can decide
whether to like your or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I get more involved in the sport and more involved with
(sponsors), I have to become more professional in the way I talk.
But I know exactly where I came from and know what I'm interested
in. That's not easy to forget. I just can't grow up any faster than
I'm growing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   You see? You see the honesty and the tenderness in the words,
the willingness to open his soul to strangers? Isn't it admirable?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a really good person,'' said Buckshot Jones, who is
jumping from Grand National to Winston Cup. ``I really like him a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Dale Jr.'s on-track personality, forget it. Like all
racers, he wants the winner's check as much as the next guy, even
if that guy is his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dale Jr. proves there's some genetics involved with
driving a race car,'' Charlotte Motor Speedway President Humpy
Wheeler said. ``Except he's a much better race driver at this point
than his father was when he was his age. He's smoother and he's
pretty cool in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but what happens when he starts hearing boos from all the
non-Earnhardt fans? Will he explode?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' Dale Jr. said. ``But I don't know if
we're ready to say we're going to be dominant in the Cup series, at
least not now. I just hope my personality and everything that I've
said keeps me from getting booed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine because when Dale Jr. speaks, he speaks from the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   And that's all that counts. &QL;

PIPPEN ON A MISSION AS THE ROCKETS' MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robin's only full season without Batman was _ ``Boom! Pow!
Splat!'' _ a super failure.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Scottie Pippen, who played Robin to Michael Jordan's
Batman for 10 of the past 11 seasons, averaged career highs of 22.0
points and 8.7 rebounds and was the most valuable player of the NBA
All-Star Game in the 1993-94 season. But without superior sidekick
Jordan, he failed the Chicago Bulls like a dead battery in the '94
playoffs, pouting out the final 1.8 seconds of one game, then
committing the phantom foul on a Hubert Davis 3-pointer on the
decisive play of their Eastern Conference finals loss to the New
York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the six championships earned with Jordan in Chicago,
it's what Pippen does without him in Houston that will ultimately
define his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie, it'd be great to win one without
Michael,'' said Pippen, whose Rockets visit the Mavericks tonight
at Reunion Arena. ``It's something I haven't done. But he didn't
win one without me, either. It'd be nice the next time I see him to
be able to pull out something he doesn't have, that seventh ring.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Rockets acquired Pippen in a trade after he signed a
five-year, $67 million free-agent contract last month, they got a
rare player who can dominate at both ends of the court. They also
got the rarest of NBA commodities: a well-fed champion who remains
hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to see if Scottie can win without Michael,''
Rockets forward Eddie Johnson said. ``You can see the fire in his
eyes. When you're already one of the greatest players of all time
and people are questioning you, that's major motivation right
there. ''
</P>
<P>
   Already a member of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players, Pippen has
two Olympic gold medals, seven All-Star appearances and another
seven selections to the All-Defensive team on his 11-year resume.
He escaped the fall of the Bulls' empire seeking respect in the
form of a lucrative contract, organizational appreciation and
success on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to take away from the fun that I had in Chicago
competing, winning championships. That was always great,'' Pippen
said. ``But let's face it: The organization up there stinks. It was
not the best of both worlds, and away from the game, it just wasn't
there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is apparently here for Pippen in Houston, where he can
compete for another championship with Charles Barkley and Hakeem
Olajuwon, get paid his market worth after earning only $2.7 million
last season, and get along with ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already spoken to the organization more in a month here
than he did in 11 years in Chicago,'' said Pippen's wife, Larsa.
``He won championships there, but he was never truly happy. The
Rockets are giving him the attention he needs, he deserves. He
won't let them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen has taken to Houston so much that he turned his recent
house-hunting into a home-building, expecting to move his family to
the area permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel so relaxed, so comfortable, so wanted,'' he said.
``It's beyond my wildest expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   On the court, the game's most versatile player has been slower
to adjust. He was badly outplayed by Los Angeles Lakers phenom Kobe
Bryant in a season-opening loss in LA and has struggled to find
shots in a half-court offense based on isolated post-ups by
Olajuwon and Barkley. On defense, in the open court and down the
stretch, however, Pippen has been the impact player the Rockets
needed to upgrade from the retirement of Clyde Drexler.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most complete player in basketball,'' Rockets coach
Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``There's nothing he can't do on a
basketball court. He'll give you an assist, a steal, a block, a
rebound, take a charge, make a 3-pointer, give you a post-up
basket, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen scored 24 points and grabbed 13 rebounds in the Rockets'
home opener Monday night, and has taken pressure off Houston's
unproven guards by bringing the ball upcourt from his familiar
point-forward position on key possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie and I are going to play great together,'' Barkley
said. `I've played with Scottie on a couple of Dream Teams, and
some of the best compliments I've gotten in my life have been when
I've played with Scottie.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing with a shot-blocking center for the first time in his
career, Pippen relishes the opportunity to gamble on defense like
never before. He said he hopes to parlay his roaming into leading
the league in steals, being selected defensive player of the year,
becoming an MVP candidate and leading the Rockets to their third
title of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who has Drexler's old locker at the Rockets' practice
facility, is champing at the chance to write his own script to a
championship. In Chicago, it was Jordan or even Steve Kerr and John
Paxson who made the title-clinching plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another challenge for me, maybe the biggest,''
Pippen said. ``I have an opportunity to go somewhere and see if I'm
really the player that people think I am. I can't wait to prove
them right.''

COWBOYS GEARING UP FOR FREE-AGENCY SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Although the Cowboys' 1999 season opener is
nearly seven months away, the season unofficially kicks off
tomorrow when NFL free agency begins.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones said, ``that's when
the bell rings.''
</P>
<P>
   It's when the Cowboys begin, in earnest, the process of
assembling a roster for next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' coaches and scouts have been evaluating players for
the past month, however Jones said tomorrow is the first day the
Cowboys can start putting their plans into action.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Cowboys must get their finances in order, which means
trimming at least $3 million of their payroll to fall in line with
the NFL's 1999 cap figure of $52.288 million. They likely will need
to trim more to become aggressive in the free-agent market and to
re-sign their own free agents.
</P>
<P>
   To clear room, the Cowboys are reworking the contracts of
several players, and could release a few others today.
</P>
<P>
   Three candidates to be waived are tight end Eric Bjornson
(expected to make $895,000 next season), receiver Billy Davis
($1.12 million) and middle linebacker Fred Strickland ($1.17
million). None is expected to start next season.
</P>
<P>
   Contract extensions could be in order for quarterback Troy
Aikman and cornerback Deion Sanders. Aikman's contract, which pays
him $8.55 million next season, is up after the 2001 season. Sanders
can become a free agent at the end of next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had preliminary discussions with Sanders' agent,
Eugene Parker. Aikman's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said nothing has
been discussed, but he said an extension is not beyond reason
considering Aikman wants to play several more years and in light of
the contracts being signed by other quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the biggest difference between the 1999 season and
past years is the team isn't facing a major decision regarding one
of its own unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' priority is restricted free agent Randall Godfrey.
The team is likely to tender a one-year offer of $934,000 to him
today so it will have the right of first refusal or be compensated
by a first-round pick if the linebacker leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Other in-house priorities include receiver Ernie Mills,
linebacker Broderick Thomas and guard Nate Newton, who are
unrestricted free agents but are not expected to command huge
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also must figure out what role Newton could play
given his age (37) and injury problems of the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey said the coaches have discussed several ways
to reshuffle the offensive line, including moving left tackle Larry
Allen back to guard to pair with 1998 free-agent pickup Everett
McIver. The Cowboys could also move Tony Hutson to Newton's
left-guard spot.
</P>
<P>
   The list of possible additions included two high-profile free
agents: linebacker Quentin Coryatt and wide receiver Carl Pickens.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, however, will likely come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt, who sat out the 1998 season after being released by the
Indianapolis Colts because of an injured pectoral muscle, has been
contacted by at least eight teams, said Steve Zucker, the agent for
Coryatt and Pickens.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said both players want to join the Cowboys. And it's no
secret one of the Cowboys' top off-season priorities is finding a
receiver to stretch the defense and make big plays alongside
starter Michael Irvin. However, acquiring Pickens won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals made him their franchise player, meaning if the
Cowboys signed Pickens they would have to give Cincinnati two
first-round draft picks. The Cowboys could negotiate a
sign-and-trade deal, but it would require a couple of high draft
picks.

FOR KWAN, SKATING GLITTERS EVEN WITHOUT THE GOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Michelle Kwan didn't fall at the Nagano Winter
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   But she got back on her feet and carried on, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   She had been the consensus favorite to capture the women's
figure skating gold medal. At the age of 17, she had swept the U.S.
Nationals _ the Olympic trials _ leaving behind a trail of
showering flowers and perfect scores.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant and blessed with a classic style, Kwan was supposed to
be the graceful angel who would rescue skating from its playground
charge of triple-jumping prepubescents.
</P>
<P>
   But Kwan never won the gold medal. On the most important night
of her athletic life, she skated tentatively, almost cautiously,
and ended up leaving just enough of an opening for 15-year-old Tara
Lipinski to steal the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski, whose jumps had been described as low line drives to
Kwan's graceful butterflies, jumped the first tricycle to the
professional ranks.
</P>
<P>
   But Kwan got on her feet and carried on.
</P>
<P>
   There is more than a little irony, therefore, that Kwan finds
herself his week in the scandal-wracked home of the 2002 Winter
Games.
</P>
<P>
   She is here to defend her title at the U.S. National Figure
Skating Championships. She is an amateur still, an amateur who will
be eligible to complete here in 2002, if she so chooses.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Olympic visitor in Salt Lake, in other words, came
through just to make a few bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it only took me a few moments to get myself together
after the Olympics,'' Kwan said, reflecting on what happened 12
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterwards, I left Nagano, and I realized that a lot of the
things that happened were for the good. I don't think if I could go
back in time, I would change anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Nagano helped me to grow as a person and as
an athlete. What happened was good. And it was meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are stunning words to be coming from the mouth of a
teen-ager whose life could have turned forever in four nervous
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The cash is blurring the line more and more in figure skating.
But from a historical standpoint, skating carves a cruel line
between its champions and its champion-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Our Olympic memories are filled with visions of Peggy Fleming,
Dorothy Hamill and Kristi Yamaguchi.
</P>
<P>
   For each of them, though, there is a forgotten image of Janet
Lynn, Linda Fratianne and Debi Thomas _ the ones who were expected
to, but didn't, finish first.
</P>
<P>
   A cruel combination of nerves and fates may have conspired
against Kwan in Nagano. For one thing, she and coach Frank Carroll
had chosen to forgo the Opening Ceremony and continue to train in
Lake Arrowhead, Calif. She was the favorite, and she had only to
look at the covers of ``Time'' and ``Newsweek'' to be reminded. She
eschewed the Olympic Village and mingling with the other athletes
in favor of a downtown Nagano hotel room with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   It was a telling role reversal. Lipinski, whose parents had
always cast a protective shadow, was allowed to come in early and
march with the U.S. team in the ceremonies. One day she was posing
with Akebono, the 500-pound sumo champion; the next she was being
interviewed by David Letterman's mom.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the Olympic free-skating final, Lipinski dashed
and pranced up the ice with a joyful abandon. Skating fifth in the
final group, after Kwan had to go first, Lipinski seized the
opening on the judges' score cards.
</P>
<P>
   On the victory stand in Nagano, as the anthem was being played,
Lipinski grinned as if it were her birthday party. Kwan's makeup
was streaked with tears.
</P>
<P>
   But one month later, Kwan was in Minneapolis, winning the world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Fratianne, also a Carroll student, had to settle for a bitter
second at the 1980 Olympics. The story is told how, bitter and
disappointed, it took her 15 years before she ever opened the case
and looked at her silver medal.
</P>
<P>
   Wow, Kwan said, when told the story. She had looked at her
silver medal the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are daunting. There are triple-jumping munchkins all
along skating's yellow brick road. Four years before the 1994 and
1998 Games, respectively, few casual Olympic watchers had heard of
Oksana Baiul and Lipinski, either.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan will be 21 when the Games come to Salt Lake City. Her
skating legacy is yet to be written.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be remembered as a person who didn't just skate,''
she said, pondering the question, ``but as a person who comes from
within and, hopefully, reaches out to the audience and touches
them.''
</P>
<P>
   If that includes a gold medal, so be it, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I guess I would call a champion a person who never gives
up _ who always believes in themselves,'' she continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I feel I'm stronger than ever from the Nagano
experience. It's helped me as a person, and it's pushed me
further.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a push, she agrees, that could easily carry her another
three years.

RANGERS' PALMEIRO HAS MINOR SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ First baseman Rafael Palmeiro underwent minor
arthroscopic knee surgery yesterday, but the Rangers expect him to
be ready to play in the March 5 exhibition opener.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro apparently tore cartilage in his right knee while
running stairs during his conditioning program. The Rangers
described the cartilage tear as ``small'' and the surgery
``minor.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, 34, is the Rangers' most significant off-season
acquisition. He signed a five-year contract worth $45 million
contract in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers acknowledged Palmeiro could be limited during the
early stages of spring training, but general manager Doug Melvin
said he expects the left-handed power hitter to be ready for their
exhibition opener with the Cincinnati Reds in Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something he could have played with,'' Melvin said. ``He
probably wouldn't have had surgery if it were during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't play a position like center field, where he's
running balls down in the gap, or catching, where he's up and down
all the time, or the middle infield.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro had two alternatives: Undergo surgery before reporting
to camp Feb. 24 or run the risk of a two- or three-week stint on
the disabled list should the knee require surgery during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin dismissed any comparisons to second baseman Mark
McLemore's injuries. McLemore has undergone four knee operations
since May 1997; his second operation required a 41-day stint on the
disabled list in 1997, and knee problems limited his playing time
last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also announced they have signed pitchers Jonathan
Johnson, Ryan Glynn and Derrick Cook and second baseman Kelly
Dransfeldt to one-year contracts. The four signed for the
major-league minimum $200,000 and will earn $1,098.90 per day while
on the 25-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have seven unsigned players _ pitchers Danny
Patterson, Al Levine, Dan Kolb and Matt Perisho, catcher Cesar
King, third baseman Rob Sasser and center fielder Ruben Mateo _ on
their 40-man roster.

TCU STAR ISSUES CHALLENGE TO TEAMMATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Just two days after TCU lost its fourth
consecutive game, forward Lee Nailon and guard Prince Fowler called
a players-only meeting in hopes of snapping the Horned Frogs out of
their slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody had to step up,'' Nailon said of the meeting Monday.
``I told Prince: `I think it should be me doing all of the talking
and everybody else just listening.'''
</P>
<P>
   Expect Nailon's words to be ringing in his teammates' ears
during tonight's Western Athletic Conference game against Wyoming
at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he said, if we're waiting for him to come back and
win games, we're going to be disappointed to find out teams win
games, not players,'' Horned Frogs guard Ryan Carroll said. ``He
said we _ as a team _ had to get this one win, and we'd go from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU lost to SMU on Saturday, when Nailon missed the last 71/2
minutes because of a sprained ankle. Nailon is expected to play
tonight. TCU desperately needs a victory to jump-start a finishing
push toward a Western Athletic Conference tournament berth, much
less an NCAA berth. TCU has to be one of the top six teams in the
Mountain Division to qualify for the WAC tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a team that's quit. This isn't a team that has an
I-don't-care attitude,'' Horned Frogs coach Billy Tubbs said.
``This team cares. They're a great bunch of guys to work with.
Maybe, we're too nice. Maybe, that's part of our problem.''
</P>
<P>
   With the possible exception of Fowler, TCU seems to lack that
let's-get-nasty characteristic so crucial in crunch time that last
season's team had.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one thing that we had last year, and I hate to refer to
last year,'' Fowler said, ``but we haven't had that in the last
couple of ballgames. We had guys last year who hated losing so much
that they'd do anything to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing instead triggered a bit of sniping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just fussing at each other, little stuff,'' Carroll
said.
</P>
<P>
   So Nailon stepped forward and challenged his teammates and
himself, too.
</P>
<P>
   Results, he's hoping, will be evident tonight. /

HICKS IN LINE TO BUY SMALL STAKE IN MAVS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stars and Rangers owner Tom Hicks apparently has convinced Ross
Perot Jr. to sell him a minority stake in the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   The two sports moguls yesterday downplayed the likelihood of an
imminent deal but confirmed through spokesmen that talks are under
way and that there is an understanding a deal will be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   A Mavericks spokesman stressed that Perot has no plans to sell a
majority interest in the basketball club even though Hicks has
publicly coveted control of the franchise since before a group
headed by Perot bought it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A 10 percent to 15 percent stake for Hicks has been discussed.
Perot's group owns 54 percent of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speculation about an imminent investment by me in the Dallas
Mavericks is premature,'' Hicks said in a statement. ``Talks are
preliminary. Ross Perot Jr. and I have had discussions about
further aligning our interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks and Perot clashed publicly when they were courting
political and economic support for a new sports arena in downtown
Dallas. However, Hicks said the Stars and Mavericks organizations
have since worked well together on arena design and development
issues, making a further business partnership possible.
</P>
<P>
   For Hicks, even partial ownership in the Mavericks would help
him further integrate his sports and entertainment business
interests, reflecting trends in professional sports ownership led
by figures such as Ted Turner and Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   It could provide him leverage as he tries to develop a regional
sports television network featuring his Stars, Rangers and other
sports. The Mavericks would be a key programming element for such a
network, and the greater Hicks' investment in the franchise, the
more likely his network would be to land the basketball team's
games. That perception also could provide him clout in negotiating
with potential partners in his sports network, such as Fox Sports
Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Perot could benefit from Hicks' investing in Perot's
arena-related real estate development project in downtown Dallas.
As part of a deal, Hicks would take a minority investment in that
project, called Victory.
</P>
<P>
   If the club is valued at about $250 million, a 15 percent stake
in the Mavericks could be worth about $35 million on the open
market. The franchise's worth has increased substantially since the
arena was approved by Dallas voters. The new building guarantees
the team greatly increased revenues from luxury suites, club seats
and other sources not present at Reunion Arena.

SOONERS' LATE BASKET COOLS OFF LONGHORNS, 64-63
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Oklahoma snatched the banner away from Texas as
the Big 12's hottest team last night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners rained in 13 shots from 3-point range, and guard
Michael Johnson hit an off-balance 12-foot jumper with 5.6 seconds
remaining to give Oklahoma a 64-63 upset before an Erwin Center
crowd of 11,492.
</P>
<P>
   But it was that kind of a night around the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Longhorns (14-10) dropped to 9-2 and lost for the
first time in six games, they maintained their game lead on the
pack courtesy of Nebraska's improbable victory at Kansas. Oklahoma
(17-7) won its fourth consecutive game and reasserted itself in the
tightly-bunched conference race.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri all stand at 8-3, a game
back of the Longhorns. Oklahoma State lost at Colorado to fall to
7-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``This win tonight gives hope to a lot of teams and not just us,
though we're certainly in the mix,'' Sooners coach Kelvin Sampson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma came from 63-56 down at the end of a 15-2 Texas run
with 2:47 remaining to within one on 3-pointers by Eduardo Najera
at 2:37 and Johnson with 48.7 seconds remaining. The Longhorns
uncharacteristically committed turnovers on three possessions after
Will Clay drove the baseline for the 7-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team we lost it in the last two minutes because of
execution,'' Texas coach Rick Barnes said. ``You turn the ball over
three of your last four times down the floor and you lose this time
of year. We did not understand time and score. We played too quick.
We just didn't work the game the way it had to be worked. I'm
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going to win the conference if we won this game
tonight. But you can put a lot us in a bag, shake it up and we're
all right there. It comes down to who executes.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas had three chances to win after Johnson's jumper. After a
timeout, Gabe Muoneke's half-court pass was stolen by Tim Heskett.
But Heskett couldn't stay inbounds and Texas got another chance.
Kris Clack found Ivan Wagner with the next inbounds pass and Wagner
tried to drive to the hoop from the left corner. But Ryan Humphrey
rejected his offering out of bounds with one second to play.
</P>
<P>
   Clack inbounded again with a lob in the lane. Gabe Muoneke went
high and amazingly got a shot and a tip off before the horn.
Neither found center net.
</P>
<P>
   ``A play that could have worked, but I missed it,'' said
Muoneke, who scored a team-high 16 but committed two of the three
late turnovers. ``A tough night and that's all I can say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost this game. Oklahoma played well, but we had the game
and let it slip away. . . . and that hurts, because we've been
working on execution this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Najera connected on 5-of-8 3-pointers to lead with 23 points. He
also played a major role in the Sooners' limiting Longhorns center
Chris Mihm to one field goal and his conference-low six points.
</P>
<P>
   Clack also had an off night with only five points.

LAKERS' BRYANT DELIVERS IN CLUTCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Everyone knew this moment would come. The Lakers,
fighting for their lives in a tight game, winding down to the last
90 seconds, and the question hovering overhead like a voracious
vulture with a bad attitude.... !ital!OK, so who takes the crucial
shot?!off!
</P>
<P>
   Er, Nick Van Exel? He was on the floor, all right, but in the
wrong uniform, which is why the question had been dogging the
Lakers ever since they traded their point guard to Denver last
June.
</P>
<P>
   They had no clutch shooter, no go-to guy down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But they do. No surprise that his name is Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   With the Van Exel-led Nuggets threatening a major upset
Wednesday night, Bryant took yet another step toward legitimate
stardom, scoring nine fourth-quarter points and six in the final
1:35 to secure the Lakers' 103-98 victory at McNichols Sports
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's pair of whiplash-inducing baseline drives past Bryant
Stith _ one for a dunk, one for a layup, both turning into 3-point
plays _ saved the Lakers from an early-season embarrassment and
answered that nagging question about who takes the big shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take it,'' Bryant said. ``I have no problem with that.
I'll take it every time.''
</P>
<P>
   And oh, did the Lakers need it against the winless Nuggets.
Denver kept the game close throughout with better hustle,
outrebounding the Lakers 53-34 behind Antonio McDyess and Raef
LaFrentz, who combined for 45 points and 31 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   And when LaFrentz wasn't beating the Lakers to the boards, the
rookie, too agile for Shaquille O'Neal to guard on the perimeter,
was killing them with his jump shot. It was LaFrentz's 3-pointer
that cut the Lakers' lead to 89-88 with 4:44 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant answered with a 3-pointer of his own. When the Nuggets
tied the game 92-92, Bryant went for the baseline drive and the
jam, plus the foul shot to make it 95-92. And when Denver cut the
lead to 96-95 with 27.2 seconds left, Bryant went for the replay,
blowing by Stith again and laying it in over LaFrentz, who fouled
out on the play and sent Bryant to the line again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to dunk on him,'' Bryant said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   He settled for another three-point play and a 99-95 lead with
15.7 seconds left. Eddie Jones and Robert Horry put it away with a
pair of free throws apiece. Jones and Bryant finished with 21
points each, and Bryant added 10 rebounds for his fourth straight
double-double.
</P>
<P>
   Said coach Del Harris, rather wryly, ``I don't think I'll be
getting a lot of questions anymore about do we have anybody who can
take a shot at the end of a game. I've been asked that about 1,000
times.''
</P>
<P>
   All 1,000 since Van Exel was traded. But Van Exel himself was
not in a clutch-shooting mode in his first game against the team he
spent five years with. He hit 3 of 19 shots and went 0 for 6 in the
fourth quarter, finishing with nine points and 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real up (emotionally), I just didn't make shots,'' Van
Exel said. ``I was probably up too much.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had to deal with good friend Eddie Jones pickpocketing
him for four of his six steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's still Eddie. He got me a couple times,'' Van Exel said
with a laugh. But he was serious when he expressed relief that the
first reunion was past him. ``I'm glad it's over with,'' he said.
``Now I can just concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris credited the retooled Nuggets with a ``gutsy effort'' and
said the Lakers were fortunate to escape with a win.
</P>
<P>
   They did not, however, escape unscathed. Just as Travis Knight
(flu) and Rick Fox (sore feet) returned to action, the Lakers got a
scare when O'Neal pulled his groin in the second quarter, then
aggravated it in the third. He also got poked in the right eye, but
finished with a game-high 29 points. &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich opened his cupboard and started to
experiment. A little of this. A little of that. He mixed
ingredients that had never been placed in the same bowl until, as
they say on cable-television cooking shows, ``Bam!''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tomjanovich sprinkled his celebrated forward in at point guard,
tossed in a 6-10 shooter with his spectacular big men and added
just a touch of rookie Cuttino Mobley, and voila. After watching
Sacramento score easily for most of the second half, the Rockets
stymied the Kings' offense down the stretch to earn a 92-82 victory
Wednesday night at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That big lineup is good for us,'' Pippen said. ``We're able to
overpower teams and take advantage of it. That's the way we played
back in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   It can hardly get any better than that. Pippen, running the
offense at the point, set up three field goals with drives
reminiscent of his championship days with the Bulls. Matt Bullard,
in for most of the fourth quarter after not playing at all against
Denver on Monday, nailed a huge 3.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley played through the pain of a partially torn knee
cartilage and still had 16 points and 16 rebounds. And Mobley
limited often-spectacular Kings rookie point guard Jason Williams
to four missed shots over the final eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a lot of different weapons,'' Tomjanovich said. ``A
lot of it depends how they play us and the double team. We made a
lot on the double team. But the one play when Scottie Pippen drove
the middle, sucked in the defense and kicked it to Bull for an easy
3 at the top I think we can get a lot more of that stuff where we
don't have to go straight post-up or pick-and-roll. That's good,
solid basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all their creativity, the Rockets sealed the win with
the tried and true.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon, who began the game appearing his most
comfortable and explosive offensively this season, put the game
away when, with the Rockets leading 86-82, he used a classic Dream
Shake to float a shot over Vlade Divac and into the net with 31.6
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dream was getting his rhythm and made some real quick spins to
the middle that set up his counter moves,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I
thought he was really aggressive, not only offensively but on
rebounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon and Bullard each added a pair of free throws for the
final 10-point margin.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon finished with 19 points and 13 rebounds. Brent Price,
starting for the injured Matt Maloney on the day of his namesake
grandfather Hartley Price's funeral, had 16 points and four
assists, often scoring to cease Sacramento runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the days to get an opportunity, it came like this, on a
very emotional day,'' Price said. ``Obviously, I dedicated the game
to him. The last thing he told me, the last words I ever heard him
say were, `Go get 'em, Brent.'''
</P>
<P>
   While Price was inspired, Barkley was determined not to allow
his injury to slow his rapid start. He struggled with his shot for
the first time this season, making six of 17 shots without the
explosiveness, he said, that he had in the first three games. But
with Roger Bates _ the former Auburn assistant coach who taught him
how to rebound _ on hand, Barkley had eight offensive boards and
came within two of his league-leading pace of 18 rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My knee is going to be sore,'' Barkley said, unsure if it will
respond in time for tonight's game in Dallas. ``That's just
something I can't worry about anymore. It affects me, obviously. I
missed some shots I normally wouldn't miss because I can't explode
like I wanted to. But we made a decision to delay the surgery, so I
can't complain about it. I just have to play through it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as with Barkley and his painful if not debilitating injury,
the Rockets played through a terrible third quarter and found a way
in the fourth. Pippen started the quarter with a driving reverse,
Price drove the lane, and Barkley drew a foul inside for a 6-0 run
to a 70-69 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, however, continued to run. Williams, who had missed
his first five shots of the night, had regained every bit of his
touch while losing none of his nerve. That inspired Tomjanovich to
try Mobley, his quick-footed rookie, at the point defensively for
the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to the game with 8:46 left, Mobley allowed
Williams only four forced shots the rest of the way. Each missed.
Williams finished with 16 points but had just two in the fourth
quarter on an uncontested fast-break layup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love a challenge,'' Mobley said. ``Jason Williams is a
really good player. I got to know him really well at the
rookie-orientation camp. I wanted to go out there and play defense.
I'm 6-4, 6-5, with long arms. I got a hand up (for Williams) to
shoot over. That's what makes Scottie so good.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pippen running the point offensively, Williams was forced
to give up six inches and almost 40 pounds on the other end of the
court and could do little to disrupt the Rockets' suddenly clicking
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking credit,'' Barkley said, ``but at the timeout, I
said, `Coach, if they're going to play that little Jason Williams
kid out there, we've got to make him pay for it on offense. Why
don't you put Scottie on him and go big on him and make him play
defense? I think it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, everything worked from that point on. It just took the
right mix of ingredients.

EXCEPTS: THE SENATORS BEGIN TO SPEAK OUT ON THEIR FINAL DECISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With IMPEACH-RDP) (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are statements made on Wednesday by
members of the Senate on how they intend to vote in the impeachment
trial of President Clinton. The statements were provided by the
senators' offices.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   Arlen Specer, Pennsylvania
</P>
<P>
   The extreme partisanship of the impeachment proceeding in the
House prejudiced the matter before it came to the Senate. While it
takes two to tango or be partisan, somehow the House Republicans
bore the brunt of the public disdain on the partisan charge. It was
more than the party-line votes. The whole process was filled with
rancor, acrimony and bitterness, which contributed significantly to
the public view that it was all politics without real substances.
...
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was schizophrenic in wanting to avoid what many
considered to be a pointless trial. Others considered it to be our
constitutional duty to hold a trial and give appropriate deference
to the House's action on the articles. In a series of halting
half-steps, the Senate stumbled through a ``pseudo-trial'', a
``sham trial'' _ really no trial at all. In the end, it would have
taken less time to let the House managers put on their case with a
full White House defense than the helter-skelter procedures adopted
by the Senate. ...
</P>
<P>
   Each senator individually and the Senate collectively took an
oath to do ``impartial justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has done only ``partial justice,'' a double-entendre,
both (1) in the sense of not doing ``impartial justice'' to the
House managers by unduly restricting them in the presentation of
their case, and (2) ``partial justice'' in the sense of hearing
only part of the evidence. When the Senate prohibited live
witnesses and permitted only three videotaped depositions, the
House managers had one hand tied behind their back. There has been
no ``trial'' but only a ``pseudo-trial'' or a ``sham trial.'' The
best the House managers could do was to cut, paste and glue
together transcripts from the independent counsel's grand jury
proceedings. Ms. Lewinsky testified briefly on videotape and the
President gave two vague, evasive depositions.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers could not meet the heavy burden of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt. That is the only appropriate statement
where the underlying charges are the crimes of perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Had the House managers sustained that burden under these
articles, there was a further burden of persuasion, as I see it, to
establish that the national interest warranted removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Perjury and obstruction of justice are serious offenses which
must not be tolerated by anyone in our society. However, I remain
unconvinced that impeachment is the best course to vindicate the
rule of law on this offensive conduct. President Clinton may still
be prosecuted in the Federal criminal courts when his term ends.
His lawyers have, in effect, invited that prosecution by citing it
as the preferable remedy to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal trial for the President after his term ends may yet
be the best vindicator for the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   If the full weight of the evidence with live witnesses had been
presented to the Senate instead of bits and pieces of cold
transcript, it is possible that the Senate and the American people
would have demanded the President's appearance in the well of the
Senate. Under firm examination, the President might have displayed
the egregious character described harshly by his defenders in their
proposed censure petitions. That sequence might have led to his
removal.
</P>
<P>
   But on this record, the proofs are not present. Juries in
criminal cases under the laws of Scotland have three possible
verdicts: guilty, not guilty, not proven. Given the option in this
trial, I suspect that many senators would choose ``not proven''
instead of ``not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   That is my verdict: not proven. The President has dodged perjury
by calculated evasion and poor interrogation. Obstruction of
justice fails by gaps in the proofs.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Jeffords, Vermont
</P>
<P>
   I will oppose both articles of impeachment against President
Clinton when they come before the Senate. This decision is not made
easily, but it is made with the confidence that it is right. And it
is made with confidence that the process that has taken place in
the Senate has been fair and just to all parties. ...
</P>
<P>
   The facts and circumstances of this case are low and tawdry, but
these same circumstances do not, in my opinion, cause his offenses
to rise to the level of impeachable acts. They do not neatly fit
into the definition of ``other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   I am gravely concerned that a vote to convict the President on
these articles may establish a low threshold that would make every
President subject to removal for the slightest indiscretion, or
that a vote to convict may imperil every President who faces a
Congress controlled by the opposing party. Yet, at the same time, I
am concerned that a vote to acquit could be mistaken by future
generations to mean that perjury and obstruction of justice are not
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The President's actions were reprehensible and morally wrong. It
is my belief that President Clinton gave misleading statements,
that President Clinton did obstruct justice, but his actions in
this case do not reach the high standard of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   John H. Chafee, Rhode Island
</P>
<P>
   Now, this has been a very, very difficult case to decide. The
House managers have done an excellent job, and I am filled with
admiration for each and every one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some have accused the House Republicans of conducting a
vendetta against the President. But let's remember; the House
Republicans didn't create this situation, nor did Judge Starr
concoct the charges. It was President Clinton, who through his own
actions and extraordinary bad judgment, caused these proceedings.
If he had told the truth right from the beginning of this affair,
our country would not have been dragged through these divisive
events. ...
</P>
<P>
   This trial is not to determine whether the President is guilty
of inappropriate and reckless sexual behavior. This trial is not
about what the polls say about the President's popularity and
whether or not he's been a ``good President.'' This trial is not
about a comparison of the impeachment of Federal judges to an
impeachment of a President. That difference has been well pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
   Before we proceed to consideration of the proof of the
violations of the articles, we ask ourselves what standard of proof
should we use? The answer is we can use whatever standard each of
us chooses to use as long as we stay within the parameters of the
charging articles. ...
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty with each of the charges in Article II is that
circumstantial evidence in each of these cases is rebutted by
direct evidence or by confusion that leaves us saying, ``This is
very murky,'' and makes me question whether it warrants removing
the President of the United States from office. ...
</P>
<P>
   Absent the proof that I find necessary to justify the removal of
a President, I will vote to acquit on both articles.
</P>
<P>
   Richard G. Lugar, Indiana
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial of President Clinton is not about
adultery. The impeachment trial involves the President's illegal
efforts to deny a fair trial result in the suit brought by Ms.
Paula Jones. I have no doubt that the President worked deliberately
to deny justice in this suit. In doing so, he clearly lied to a
Federal grand jury and worked to induce others to give false
testimony, thus obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones has often been described as a small person in our
judicial system. In contrast, the President, who at the time of his
inaugural takes a solemn oath to preserve and protect equal justice
under the law for even the most humble of Americans, is a giant
figure. One of the central questions of this trial keeps intruding:
``Is any man or woman above the law?''
</P>
<P>
   The legal defense team for the President does not admit that
there is adequate proof of either perjury or obstruction of
justice. They contend that senators must embrace a theory of
``immaculate obstruction'' in which jobs are found, gifts are
concealed, false affidavits are filed, and the character of a
witness is publicly impugned, all without the knowledge or
direction of the President, who is the sole beneficiary of these
actions. The President's lawyers further contend that such crimes
are, in any event, insufficient to remove the President. ...
</P>
<P>
   During this trial, I have concluded that the prosecutors made
their case. I will vote to remove President Clinton from office not
only because he is guilty of both articles of impeachment, but also
because I believe the crimes committed here demonstrate that he is
capable of lying routinely whenever it is convenient. He is not
trustworthy. Simply to be near him in the White House has meant not
only tragic heartache for his wife and his daughter but enormous
legal bills for staff members and friends who admired him and
yearned for his success but who have been caught up in his
incessant ``war room'' strategies to maintain him in office.
</P>
<P>
   Slade Gorton, Washington
</P>
<P>
   I will vote to remove the President from office. . . .
</P>
<P>
   If we acquit, if we say that some perjuries, some obstructions
of justice, some clear and conscious violations of a formal oath
are free from our sanction, the Republic and its institutions will
be weakened. One exception or excuse will lead to another, the
right of the most powerful of our leaders to act outside the laws _
or in violation of the law _ will be established. Our republican
institutions will be seriously undermined. They have been
undermined already, and the damage accrues to all equally:
Republicans, Democrats, liberals and conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one thing this President can be relied on to do, it
is to put his interests before those of his office and of the
Republic. President Clinton has debased the Presidency now, and if
he is allowed to remain in office, the low level to which he has
brought the Presidency will continue, and that is not tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot will to my children and grandchildren the proposition
that a President stands above the law and can systematically
obstruct justice simply because both his polls and the Dow Jones
index are high.
</P>
<P>
   Our duty in this case is as unpleasant as it was unsought. But
our duty is clear. It was imposed on us, by history, without
equivocation, 212 years ago. It requires us to convict the
President of Article II of these articles of impeachment. And that
is how I vote, with clear conscience and saddened heart.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wellstone, Minnesota
</P>
<P>
   I think that a tough, bipartisan censure resolution which makes
clear our contempt of what the President has done in lying to his
family, his friends, his staff and the American people about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky is the more appropriate course
than removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, if we are ultimately blocked from voting on censure,
the President will not have escaped the judgment of the country and
the Congress. Any senator, in any venue they choose, can offer
their own forceful, public censure of the President, repeatedly if
they like. I certainly have. A corporate expression, for the
record, of the Senate's condemnation of the President's actions,
while preferable, is not essential, for all of us have already made
known our views.
</P>
<P>
   We all condemn the President's behavior. It has been said so
many times, it hardly bears repeating, were it not for the willful,
partisan attempts to mischaracterize a vote against removal as a
vote to condone what the President has done. That is, of course,
preposterous; the President has been impeached. That has happened
only once before in our history. . .
</P>
<P>
   Finally we bring to a close this long, sad year of
investigations, and hearings and speeches. It has been a painful
year. In many ways, it has been a lost year. Think of what we might
have done this past year, had we not done this. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And now we are called together to come to judgment on this
President, and then to return promptly to the pressing issues that
lay before us, and that require our urgent attention. That judgment
is by now clear: Bill Clinton should remain President. The censure
of this body, and the historic impeachment that will ever attach to
his name, will leave a permanent mark on his Presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Frank R. Lautenberg, New Jersey
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton's shameful behavior in an
inappropriate relationship has caused great pain to his family and
the nation, the House managers have not proven that he committed
``high crimes or misdemeanors.'' His conduct did not threaten our
constitutional system, and the national interest will not be served
by removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   I hope that my colleagues will reject the articles of
impeachment and not weaken the Presidency for future generations.
These proceedings should not serve as a precedent for using
impeachment as a political weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Levin, Michigan
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment and removal should be based on sturdier foundations
than the heap of inferences that have been placed before us, when
those inferences are pieced together from bits of testimony of
witnesses whose direct, explicit testimony contradicts the
inferences. The House managers would have us overlook the forest of
direct testimony while getting lost in the trees of their multiple
inferences. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I have had a deep concern about the impeachment process which
formed the basis of this trial. While my decision to reject the
articles is based on the inadequate proof of the crimes alleged,
the process which brought this matter to trial was deeply flawed. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   Daniel K. Akaka, Hawaii
</P>
<P>
   I cannot overstate my disappointment with the actions of the
President. He deliberately misled the American people and greatly
diminished the public's trust in the office of the President.
However, I have concluded that the two articles of impeachment, as
drafted and presented by the House, fail to meet the constitutional
standard of high crimes and misdemeanors, and I will vote to acquit
the President. ...
</P>
<P>
   The record does not contain the level of proof necessary to
convict and remove the President. Certain facts are indisputable:
the President lied to the American people and to his family about
an extramarital affair; he lied to his staff and he was misleading
in his deposition in the Paula Jones civil suit and his grand jury
testimony. However, impeachment is not a constitutional means to
punish a President when his ``conduct gets out of bounds,'' as one
House manager argued. The constitutional standard is whether high
crimes and misdemeanors were committed, and that test has not been
met. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Dodd, Connecticut
</P>
<P>
   I cannot conclude beyond all reasonable doubt that this
President is guilty of the criminal charges enumerated in either
article of impeachment. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The criminalization of our political process must stop before
irreparable damage is done to the institutions of our Federal
system.
</P>
<P>
   It is right to condemn in harsh words the behavior of the
President. It should be equally appropriate to condemn the damage
done by an independent counsel statute that has spawned runaway,
brakeless prosecutors that storm the country trampling on our
system of justice, completely unchecked by any branch of
government.
</P>
<P>
   The damage this President has caused his office can and will be
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   The damage the Office of Independent Counsel and court decisions
that allow unlimited discovery in civil lawsuits may be far more
difficult to repair.
</P>
<P>
   That fragile balance between our three coequal branches of
government is being subjected to unprecedented strains as a result
of events that have occurred over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   Richard H. Bryan, Nevada
</P>
<P>
   The President's conduct is boorish, indefensible, even
reprehensible. It does not threaten the Republic. It does not
impact our national security. It does not undermine or compromise
our position of unchallenged leadership in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Although I conclude that the evidence presented in this case
does not reach the standard commanded by the Constitution to
convict and remove a President, it does not follow that we are
precluded from registering our strong disapproval of the
President's personal conduct. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a way. After our vote on these articles of impeachment,
and assuming, as most believe, there are not the votes to convict
the President, the Senate should proceed immediately to adopt a
bipartisan resolution of censure. &QL;

MIGHTY DUCKS BEAT MIGHTY FLYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ All the Mighty Ducks faced Wednesday night at the Pond
was the hottest team in the NHL in the Philadelphia Flyers, the
NHL's two top goal-scorers in Eric Lindros and John LeClair, and
the NHL's hottest goalie in John Vanbiesbrouck.
</P>
<P>
   No biggie.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Teemu Selanne and Fredrik Olausson, the Ducks handed
the Flyers their first loss in nine games 5-4 before 16,357.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne had two goals and an assist, increasing his career point
total to 600. Olausson also had two goals, the 10th multi-goal game
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Just as impressive was the job the Ducks did on LeClair and
Lindros. LeClair (33 goals) and Lindros (30) entered the game 1-2
in the NHL in goals. Lindros got his 30th and 31st goal of the
season in the second period, but LeClair failed to get a shot off
in the first two periods. LeClair finally put one in the net (No.
34) in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers entered Wednesday's game with just one loss in their
previous 24 games (16-1-7), the best 24-game stretch in the NHL
since the Boston Bruins went 21-1-2 in the 1982-83 season. The
Flyers also entered the game unbeaten in their previous eight games
(6-0-2) and were the only Eastern Conference team without a loss to
a Western Conference team this season (11-0-4).
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks played up to the level of their competition. They
took a 2-0 first-period lead and led 3-2 going into the third.
Then, two quick goals _ by Steve Rucchin and Olausson _ in the
opening minutes of the third period gave the Ducks a 5-2 cushion.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair's goal midway through the third made it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers managed to make things interesting when penalties by
the Ducks' Matt Cullen and Jamie Pushor gave the Flyers a two-man
advantage with 7:31 left. The Flyers held the two-man advantage for
1:19, but couldn't convert.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Ducks' fourth consecutive win, their longest winning
streak since a club-record six-game streak in March of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's game marked the first of three tough games in a
five-day stretch for the Ducks, who continue with games against
Dallas and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But they began the stretch in fine fashion, jumping out to a
two-goal first-period lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks wasted no time taking advantage of their first
power-play opportunity of the night. After the Flyers' Dan McGillis
was given a two-minute penalty for cross checking 6:51 into the
first period, the Ducks peppered Vanbiesbrouck with shots on goal.
Vanbiesbrouck stopped a slapshot from just inside the blue line by
Paul Kariya, then smothered Rucchin's shot from just outside the
crease.
</P>
<P>
   But at 7:25 of the first, the Ducks got one through. Selanne
took a pass just to the left of the crease from Olausson and
knocked it into the net for a 1-0 Ducks lead. It was the Ducks'
41st power-play goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   With the Flyers at full strength less than two minutes later,
the Ducks struck again. Olausson took a pass from Travis Green and
fired a shot from the right wing past Vanbiesbrouck's stick side at
8:58.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Chris Rawlings died Wednesday night, two days
after the Los Angeles resident was beaten and kidnapped during a
home-invasion robbery that ended in a fiery crash in suburban
Tarzana, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings, 30, was pronounced dead at Northridge Hospital Medical
Center in the San Fernando Valley community of Northridge at 6:01
p.m., said Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Don Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now a homicide investigation,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings had been on life support at the hospital since the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   He was surrounded by his friends and family members during the
day Wednesday and had been given last rites by the Rev. John
Knoernschild, president of Rawlings' alma mater, Crespi Carmelite
High School in nearby Encino.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved life,'' Knoernschild said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Knoernschild said he saw Rawlings only last week, when the 1987
graduate stopped by to visit. ``He seemed very happy. His
conversation revolved around his family,'' Knoernschild said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, police searched for motorists who saw the
attackers and were offered a $1,000 bill for a ride away from the
crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the gunmen crashed Rawlings' Bentley on Monday,
spilling him out of the trunk, one man ran to an intersection in
suburban Tarzana, approximately 21 miles northwest of downtown Los
Angeles, and tried to buy his escape with money taken in the
robbery, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe no one took up the man's offer. ``They
probably got a good look at the suspects,'' said Los Angeles police
Detective Rick Swanston, an investigator on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect is described as an African-American man in his 20s,
wearing a white shirt and sweating profusely, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The second attacker -- described only as an African-American man
-- got away by committing a carjacking and later dumping the car on
the 210 Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators now believe the motive for the abduction was
robbery, and they suspect the gunmen followed Rawlings to his home
in the suburban Los Angeles community of Woodland Hills, about 24
miles northwest of downtown, beat him and then ransacked the house
in search of valuables.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said they suspect Rawlings drew the robbers'
attention because he was wearing expensive jewelry and driving a
$250,000 Bentley. They believe he did not know the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred as Rawlings returned to his home from the
supermarket, where he bought diapers for his baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a follow-home,'' Swanston said. ``They ransacked
the home and stole property.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives declined to provide more details about the stolen
items. They said they believe the robbers stuffed Rawlings into the
trunk of his car and drove off with the intention of taking him to
an ATM machine to withdraw money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our best bet,'' Swanston said.
</P>
<P>
   Other details emerging include that when Rawlings' wife, Barbie,
witnessed the attack in the garage, she fled onto the roof with
their two children, 1 and 3, Swanston said. There, she called 911.
</P>
<P>
   By the time police arrived, the gunmen were escaping in
Rawlings' Bentley with him in the trunk. Following a chase with
speeds as high as 100 mph, the Bentley crashed and the attackers
fled.
</P>
<P>
   Downed power lines from the crash and rain foiled efforts to
catch the men. ``As soon as they got out of the car, they were
gone,'' Swanston said. ``They just disappeared into the woodwork.
Everything blackened.''
</P>
<P>
   While detectives worked to piece together clues Wednesday, at
least a dozen of Rawlings' family members paced the hallways at
Northridge Hospital Medical Center, consoling one another.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings suffered massive head trauma, including a deep puncture
wound to his temple, apparently during the crash, Swanston said.
</P>
<P>
   Knoernschild said that the last time he spoke with Rawlings, the
young man talked about his joy at coming home to see his young
daughters, and his efforts to work less on weekends so he could
spend more time with his wife. ``He was a young man who seemed to
enjoy life.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings co-owned Gentlemen's Quarters Fine Mens Clothing in
Woodland Hills with Rodney Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings, a star football player in high school, ran track in
college and went into the business world with the same focus and
intensity, Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Rawlings made a living through auto leasing and the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   His friends said he co-owned the clothing store and worked for
Woodland Hills-based Amazon Leasing, where he conducted seminars
and set up and sold software.

KINGS ARE SHUT OUT 3-0
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Kings coach Larry Robinson was dressed in black, the
perfect match for his postgame mood on a night when his team's
hopes of snagging a playoff berth began to look more and more
remote.
</P>
<P>
   He had watched as the Kings had played the Phoenix Coyotes to a
scoreless tie for two periods Wednesday night, and he had watched
the horror show of a third period in which Greg Adams scored twice
and Jeremy Roenick once, lifting their team to a 3-0 victory before
a crowd of 14,377 at the America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes his team had made weren't what galled him. Rather,
for the umpteenth time, Robinson had studied his team's effort and
found it lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, maybe pride is a forgotten word,'' Robinson said.
``We need to get that blood, sweat and tears back.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, the Kings' supply of tears should be enough to irrigate
the Arizona desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, (the coaches' tears)'' Robinson said when this was
mentioned to him. ``I don't know about the players.''
</P>
<P>
   With 30 games remaining, the Kings (19-29-4) fell six points
behind San Jose in the race for the eighth and final playoff berth
in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by the Coyotes (28-13-10) snapped the Kings'
two-game winning streak and moved Phoenix within two points of
Dallas for first place in the conference. Nikolai Khabibulin
stopped 26 shots in recording his seventh shutout of the season,
three of them against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as the game wore on, we started getting a little more
aggressive,'' Adams said. ``We put a lot of pressure on them, on
their defensemen, and I think it paid off as the game went along.''
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille came the closest of anyone from either team to
scoring in the first two periods, but his shot on a power play
early in the first period hit the left post.
</P>
<P>
   At the 2:29 mark of the third, the Coyotes scored the only goal
they'd need, with Adams getting a step ahead of Kings defenseman
Sean O'Donnell and redirecting a hard cross-ice feed from Rick
Tocchet past goalie Jamie Storr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost sight of the puck for a second and lost Adams for a
second,'' O'Donnell said. ``I saw (Tocchet) wind up and I thought
he was going to shoot. He made a good play and I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams scored again nine minutes later, when Storr misplayed a
long, unscreened shot from the left point. Roenick added a
breakaway goal with 6:06 to play.
</P>
<P>
   But it was almost as if the game had ended when Phoenix took its
1-0 lead, especially considering the Kings have rallied to win only
three times this season in the 26 games in which they've allowed
the first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Robinson comments regarding the Kings' pride, or
seeming lack thereof, O'Donnell said, ``I agree with that. Not
enough guys are playing for each other. Just watch the game. We
didn't have a lot of scoring chances, we didn't pay the price.''
</P>
<P>
   And the ultimate price of not paying the price may be an early,
unfulfilling end to this sour season.
</P>
<P>
   Over roughly the past calendar year, including last season's
playoffs, the Kings are 30-46-5 in their last 81 games. To make the
playoffs, they will need to suddenly turn around and post a record
well above .500 in their last 30 games. There seems little reason
to believe this team is capable of such a feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play and play to win,'' Robitaille said. ``We
better do that (tonight against Philadelphia) or we're not going to
win. We've got to play with emotion. These are do-or-die games.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the moment, the Kings are dying.

91,585 SEE MEXICO LOSE TO ARGENTINA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mexican fans proved again that when Mexico's
national soccer team is in town, it takes more than chilly
temperatures to keep them away.
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that Mexico's opponent in Wednesday's highly
touted exhibition match was two-time World Cup champion Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Serving as a preview to the upcoming Copa America in Paraguay
and the Confederations Cup later this summer in Mexico, a sold-out
crowd of 91,585 turned out to see Argentina defeat Mexico 1-0 at
the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Coliseum general manager Pat Lynch called it the largest soccer
crowd ever in Los Angeles, surpassing the more than 88,000 that
showed up to see Mexico play the United States in the Gold Cup last
January. Another estimated 1,000 watched the game on closed-circuit
television inside the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina, ranked No.7 in the world by FIFA after reaching the
quarterfinals of the World Cup in France before losing to Holland,
notched a goal in the 67th minute thanks to a breakdown in the
Mexican defense.
</P>
<P>
   On a free kick just inside the midfield stripe, Argentine
playmaker Marcelo Gallardo sent a pass behind the Mexican defense
down the left flank. Guillermo Schellotto gathered the ball as
Mexico tried to draw an offside trap. Schellotto raced toward
Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos as teammate Juan Sorin followed up
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Schellottos' pass for Sorin in front of Campos ricocheted upward
off of Campos' foot, allowing Sorin to finish with an easy header
in the right netting.
</P>
<P>
   No.12 Mexico, which lost in the second round to Germany in the
World Cup, asserted itself following the Argentine goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans' first decent shot at Argentine keeper German
Burgos came in the 75th minute when Cuauhtemoc Blanco's shot from
15 yards sailed inches over the crossbar. A few minute later,
another shot hit the crossbar as Mexico kept the pressure on with
three straight corner kicks _ two of which resulted in good
chances.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, Argentina dominated throughout.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexico's team has trained sparingly since the World Cup,
Argentina has trained regularly. It showed on the field as Mexico
constantly chased Argentina, failing to secure a single shot in the
opening half. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

UCONN WARDS OFF BC 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HARTFORD _ The Las Vegas oddsmakers figured Connecticut was 26
points better than Boston College. It wasn't quite that easy for
the second-ranked Huskies, though they did continue a tradition
with their 21st consecutive victory over the Eagles, 66-50,
Wednesday night before a crowd of 16,294 at the Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having its modest three-game Big East winning streak
halted, BC gave UConn a harder time than anyone expected, sort of a
sequel to last month's effort when the Huskies beat the Eagles,
91-78, at Conte Forum.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Huskies didn't shoot well, hitting on just 39.7
percent (23 of 58) of their field goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Their struggles were embodied by All-America forward Richard
Hamilton, who had missed the previous two games with a deep thigh
contusion and showed obvious rust in his return, totaling just 9
points on 4-for-15 shooting and going scoreless during an 0-for-4
second half.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huskies got 19 points from Khalid El-Amin and 14 from
reserve Edmund Saunders, who was 4 for 6 from the field, 6 for 8
from the foul line. And they dominated the boards, 49-29, pulling
down 21 offensive rebounds, collecting 16 second-chance points, and
outscoring BC, 36-26, in the paint. They also cashed in at the foul
line, going 17 for 28 while BC was 2 for 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our opportunities, but we didn't put our shots down,''
said BC coach Al Skinner, whose team fell to 6-15 overall, 3-10 in
the league. ``Plus, we didn't get rebounds. UConn had 28 foul shots
and we only had six, and both teams played aggressively. We had our
opportunities, but we just weren't able to take advantage of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn coach Jim Calhoun felt his team ``wore them down with our
size, and we were quicker and we have more experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Huskies (21-1, 12-1) did fall short in at least one
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we would score 85 points, with BC a team that will
play the fast kind of game with us,'' said Calhoun. ``But we forced
too much. We didn't do well on the three-on-one breaks, either. We
didn't approach this game the way we wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 33-25, at the half, BC was still hanging around,
within 9 (49-40), before UConn put the game away with an 8-0 run
that boosted the margin to 17 with 4:48 left.
</P>
<P>
   The bright spot for the Eagles was freshman forward Brian Ross,
who established season bests in scoring (20) and rebounding (10),
displaying a deft long-range touch with 4-for-9 3-point shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept their scoring low, with them only getting 14 points
off the fast break,'' said Ross, who missed his first three shots
and wound up 8 for 16. ``Coach told me to keep shooting and they
started to fall in. And then I hit two in a row and it started to
feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   The low point for BC was losing sophomore guard Kenny Harley,
who was ejected for tossing an errant punch at Hamilton with 7:48
left in the first half. As a result, he must sit out Saturday's
game at Rutgers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ So what can be made of this? On the first play
of Wednesday night's game, University of Massachusetts center Lari
Ketner dived on the court for a loose ball, surprising his
teammates, coaches, and many in the partisan Mullins Center crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't done that since he got here,'' said forward Chris
Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   Or this? The Minutemen shot 60 percent in the second half, ran
off a 14-2 spurt after St. Bonaventure cut a 12-point deficit to 5,
then coasted to their most lopsided Atlantic 10 victory of the
season, a 64-46 decision before a crowd of 5,473 who saluted the
home team's effort with several ovations.
</P>
<P>
   UMass (11-12, 7-4) often saves such efforts for college
basketball's elite and struggles against lesser opponents. But
Wednesday night they resembled the Minutemen teams of old,
deploying pressure defense and occasional precision offense while
playing through their lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Monty Mack scored 24 points and Ketner added 12 points, 8
boards, and 4 blocks for UMass, which outscored St. Bonaventure on
fast-break points, 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the best overall effort of the year by far,''
said coach Bruiser Flint, who dismissed junior forward Ajmal Basit
Tuesday night, citing strained relations between the two, but
declined to say whether the move affected team chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and on that first play of the game, Lari dived and
saved the ball from going out of bounds. That pretty much set the
tone. We played well defensively. We knocked down some shots. That
was the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it mean that the Minutemen, arguably one of the biggest
disappointments in college basketball, are ready to turn the corner
and salvage their beleaguered campaign with five regular-season
games to play?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I've been telling them the last few weeks, if we come out
and play hard, we'll get good results,'' said Flint. ``That's the
bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass, which lost at St. Bonaventure, 53-50, Jan. 9, led, 29-21,
at halftime Wednesday night and increased the margin to 35-23 with
17:26 left. St. Bonaventure, which shot 31 percent from the floor
in the first half, scored 7 straight points, cutting the lead to
35-30.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Minutemen staged one of their best runs of the season.
Ketner had a block and a 3-point play and Mack added 5 points in a
14-2 surge that gave the Minutemen a 49-32 lead with 7:47 left.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure (11-12, 5-6), which was led by Tim Winn's 16
points, cut the lead to 53-41 with 4:08 left but could come no
closer.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen will need such efforts to close out the regular
season strongly. On the horizon: Rhode Island in Providence
Saturday, at George Washington Wednesday, then home against Xavier
the following Saturday. Flint said there's no telling whether
Wednesday night's effort is something to build on, since UMass has
followed solid efforts with sorry ones several times this season.
</P>
<P>
   But the coach added that it should at least boost the team's
confidence going into the critical three-game stretch. ``We played
hard tonight,'' said Flint. ``We played well. Guys have to feel
good about themselves after doing this.''

   AMHERST, Mass. _ University of Massachusetts coach Bruiser Flint
dismissed Ajmal Basit from the squad before Wednesday night's 64-46
win over St. Bonaventure, citing a strained relationship between
himself and the junior forward from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement delivered to the press 90 minutes before
the game, Flint cited conduct detrimental to the team. But
afterward, he said his move was based solely on the fact the two
did not get along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to help the kid as much as I possibly can,'' said
Flint. ``It just didn't work out between me and him; that's the
bottom line. I'm going to try to help him get second opportunities
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to say this, and I've said this to my team: Ajmal
was never late. Ajmal was somewhat responsible in terms of if I
sent him somewhere to do something, he did it. And he did well in
school. But we just weren't good together.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments before the game, rumors swirled regarding what prompted
Flint to dismiss Basit, who in three years has been known as much
for his on-court gyrations as his untapped potential.
</P>
<P>
   Flint confirmed that the dismissal occurred after Tuesday's
practice but denied that it followed a heated confrontation with
Basit, prompting the coach to ask him to leave. ``We just had a
discussion about our relationship,'' said Flint.
</P>
<P>
   Flint said he spoke Wednesday with Basit, who apologized to him
for how their relationship had gone. The coach denied there had
been any physical confrontation between Basit and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Flint added that he spoke to Basit's mother and said Basit will
finish the semester at UMass.
</P>
<P>
   Basit, who graduated from high school power St. Anthony's in
Jersey City, will remain on scholarship for the rest of the season.
But his dismissal ends an often tenuous relationship with Flint.
</P>
<P>
   When Flint took over from John Calipari three seasons ago, Basit
was the only one of the Minutemen's four freshmen who appeared to
have doubts about fulfilling his commitment to attend the school.
There were reports he considered transferring to Seton Hall, but he
enrolled at Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   During the latter portion of his freshman season, Basit was so
bothered by his decreased playing time that he did consider
transferring. Last season Flint said he seriously considered asking
Basit to transfer at the time, but the two ironed out their
differences.
</P>
<P>
   However, this year Basit struggled while starting the first
eight games and was replaced by Chris Kirkland. Coming off the
bench, he averaged 3.9 points and 2.6 rebounds in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the dismissal, St. Anthony's coach Bob Hurley
said he had spoken to Basit and his mother and would help the
junior transfer. Hurley added that Basit is an emotional player and
probably would have fared better with a more experienced coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Ajmal wrong? Probably, but he was put into a situation
where he had an inexperienced coach,'' said Hurley. ``He's a very
emotional kid. During the course of the season, I noticed how he
lost his job when the team was struggling and no one else lost a
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint countered, ``If Bobby Hurley was really concerned, he
would have been calling me about Ajmal before now.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Wednesday night's game, UMass players declined comment
on the matter, saying they did not know much about Flint's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when asked about some of the factors which have led
to the team's subpar (11-12) season, senior center Lari Ketner
said, ``It's a lot of stuff off the court, not so much on the
court, that are the reasons why we haven't met the expectations the
way we were supposed to. It's been just players against coaches,
players against players, and stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday night how he felt about Basit's dismissal,
Ketner said, ``He's my friend and I'm sorry to see him go, but we
just have to keep our heads up and not make it a total loss, just
play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint declined to say whether relationships between Basit and
other players were strained: ``I don't want to get into that.''

DUCKS STOP FLYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ All the Mighty Ducks faced Wednesday night at the Pond
was the hottest team in the NHL in the Philadelphia Flyers, the
NHL's two top goal-scorers in Eric Lindros and John LeClair, and
the NHL's hottest goalie in John Vanbiesbrouck.
</P>
<P>
   No biggie.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Teemu Selanne and Fredrik Olausson, the Ducks beat
the Flyers 5-4 in front of 16,357, handing Philadelphia its first
loss in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne had two goals and an assist, increasing his career point
total to 600. Olausson also had two goals, the 10th multi-goal game
of his career, and added two assists.
</P>
<P>
   Just as impressive was the job the Ducks did on LeClair and
Lindros. LeClair (33 goals) and Lindros (29) entered the game 1-2
in the NHL in goals. Lindros got his 30th and 31st goals of the
season, but LeClair failed to get even a shot off in the first two
periods. LeClair finally put one in the net in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers entered Wednesday's game with just one loss in the
previous 24 games (16-1-7), the best 24-game stretch in the NHL
since the Boston Bruins went 21-1-2 in the 1982-83 season. The
Flyers also entered the game unbeaten in their previous eight games
(6-0-2) and were the only Eastern Conference team without a loss to
a Western Conference team this season (11-0-4). Remarkably, the
Flyers hadn't lost a game on the road since Dec. 4 (3-0 at
Buffalo).
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried not to make this game bigger than it was,'' Ducks
coach Craig Hartsburg said. ``Sure, it means a little bit more than
most, but every two points are important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks took a 2-0 first-period lead and led 3-2 going into
the third. Then, two quick goals _ by Steve Rucchin and Olausson _
in the opening minutes of the third period gave the Ducks a 5-2
cushion.
</P>
<P>
   That's when things got interesting. LeClair's goal made it 5-3.
Then, after penalties by the Ducks' Matt Cullen and Jamie Pushor,
the Flyers had a two-man advantage with 7:31 left. The Flyers held
the two-man advantage for 1:19 but couldn't convert.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks finished killing the power play, but Lindros' second
goal of the night made it 5-4 with less than three minutes
remaining. But the Ducks held on despite a furious finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had great control of the game until halfway
through the third after our power play,'' Hartsburg said. ``Then it
started to slip away from us. We're a young team and those things
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 50 minutes we played a real good game, as solid and smart
as we have all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg credited Rucchin for keeping LeClair and Lindros in
check, but Rucchin was just happy to get the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was one of my better games this year,''
Rucchin said. ``But we did a good job. Only one of their goals came
at even strength. I think we should be proud of our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Ducks' fourth consecutive win, their longest winning
streak since a club-record six-game streak in March of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's game marked the first of three tough games in a
five-day stretch for the Ducks, who continue with games against
Dallas and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But they began the stretch in fine fashion Wednesday, jumping
out to a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks wasted no time taking advantage of their first
power-play opportunity. After the Flyers' Dan McGillis was given a
two-minute penalty for cross checking 6:51 into the first period,
the Ducks peppered Vanbiesbrouck with shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Vanbiesbrouck stopped a slapshot from just inside the blue line
by Paul Kariya, then smothered Rucchin's shot from just outside the
crease.
</P>
<P>
   But at 7:25 of the first, the Ducks got one past Vanbiesbrouck.
Selanne took a pass just to the left of the crease from Olausson
and knocked it into the net for a 1-0 Ducks lead. It was the Ducks'
41st power-play goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   With the Flyers at full strength less than two minutes later,
the Ducks struck again. Olausson took a pass from Travis Green and
fired a shot from the right wing past Vanbiesbrouck's stick side at
8:58 of the first for the two-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks found trouble early in the second period after Cullen
was called for high sticking 1:30 into the period and sent to the
penalty box for four minutes. But the Flyers, with the fourth-best
power play in the NHL at 20.3 percent, were unable to get one past
goalie Guy Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks didn't have such luck later in the period on another
power play. Daymond Langkow knocked in a loose puck in front of the
crease at 11:03 to narrow the Ducks' lead to 2-1. Lindros was
credited with an assist.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, though, got their two-goal lead back soon after on
Selanne's second goal of the night, coming off Vanbiesbrouck's
deflection of a shot by Rucchin.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros answered with his 30th goal of the season on a power
play at 15:46 of the second to make it 3-2 going into the final
period.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The business press played the birth announcement of sothebys.com
last month as another story about the frenzy for e-commerce. The
snooty British auction house, founded in 1744, was going to remodel
itself after eBay, the 24 hour electronic garage sale!
</P>
<P>
   Out the window went centuries of snobbery, mystique and
pretension. Up, up went Sotheby's stock, on the basis of a Web site
that didn't yet exist and that wouldn't be selling anything for six
months.
</P>
<P>
   But the dotcomming of Sotheby's is about more than a fusty old
company chasing fresh loot. It's a harbinger of the dramatic
transformation that's about to sweep the entire business of buying
and selling rare and precious things.
</P>
<P>
   The market for art, which has long behaved very differently from
markets for other kinds of goods, is about to be transformed by the
irresistible force of the Internet. The upscaling of the online
auction fad is one aspect of this change, but perhaps only a small
part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The trade in art has always been anomalous in economic terms.
What's unusual about the business is its secretiveness. Vendors of
most other kinds of goods--household appliances, cut-up chicken
parts, and condominiums--generally advertise what they have for
sale and how much it costs. Transparency benefits consumers, who
can compare prices, features, and quality. If you want to buy a 19
inch color television set, you start by checking the newspaper for
advertised prices. In markets where price comparisons aren't easily
available--Oriental rugs or new cars--buyers are at a conspicuous
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   The buying experience is unpleasant because consumers suspect
they're being fleeced. Market secrecy tends to break down, because
sellers have to reveal their prices if their competitors do. In
recent years, this has happened with cars and even Persian carpets.
</P>
<P>
   In the art world, however, secrecy has survived. Art dealers
seldom advertise prices and sometimes won't even quote them if
they're not convinced a buyer is on the hook. There was an outcry
among gallery owners a few years ago, when New York passed a law
requiring them to post prices for works that are actually on
display. Most follow it, but grudgingly. ``We're sheepish about
posting prices,'' says a dealer I know at a high-end SoHo gallery.
``Why give out free information?'' And don't even bother asking
what they have for sale. At Wildenstein &AMP; Co., which has the
world's largest private collection of Old Master and Impressionist
paintings, not even employees are allowed to know what's inside the
vaults.
</P>
<P>
   The one check on the power of dealers has always been auctions,
where individuals can buy and sell, bidding is public, and prices
are published. Selling more art at auctions and expanding the
number of people who can participate in auctions, which is what
Sotheby's is trying to do by holding them online, will bring more
efficiency (if less drama) to the art market.
</P>
<P>
   But the real way the Internet stands to revolutionize the
economics of the art business is simply by breaking down the
secrecy that prevails in the nonauction sector of the market. If
some dealers are willing to sell art to buyers via the
Internet--and almost all of them are now fanatically eager to do
so--those who remain coy about what they have and how much they
want for it will put themselves at a competitive disadvantage.
They'll be denying themselves access to the fastest expanding
sector of the international art market.
</P>
<P>
   The chief vehicle for this transformation isn't Sotheby's. It's
ArtNet, on online service which now provides access to the wares of
700 dealers around the world, and which is adding new galleries at
the rate of 70 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ArtNet is the brainchild of Hans Neuendorf, a German dealer who
started the first international art fair, in Cologne in 1967--the
first actual art market. A few years ago, Neuendorf founded ArtNet
as a database for auction results. Now he has turned it into a
consortium of galleries offering wares directly over the Internet.
The company is headed for--you guessed it--an IPO. Neuendorf says
he wants to challenge the way the art business works directly.
``This tendency to keep everything secret, to take little
advantages of information, has resulted in a suffocation of the
market,'' he says. ``If you wanted to set up a system to keep
people away from buying art, it would be very close to what we have
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind Neuendorf's business is that the Web will
expand the market not only by spreading information but also by
making art into a more liquid asset. Web auctions like Sotheby's
and the competitor Neuendorf plans to launch in March should
significantly reduce the transaction costs associated with selling
art--for dealers and private individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The seller doesn't have to pay a commission, as in an off-line
auction. Gone will be the need for expensive catalogs,
transparencies FedExed around the world, and multiple packing,
shipping, and insurance costs as the work goes from gallery to
auction house to purchaser. Today the sale of a work of art can add
25 percent to the purchase price and take six months; an efficient
online sale might add only 10 percent and take but a few days.
</P>
<P>
   What, you might ask, do dealers stand to gain from making
information available online if it merely gives leverage to their
customers? The answer is that the Internet stands to expand the
market as a whole more than enough to compensate them for having to
compete with each other.
</P>
<P>
   A gallery in Geneva or Berlin can now sell artwork to someone
who never leaves Iowa City. Some even think that while Internet
competition may drive prices down initially, prices will rise as
sellers are matched with buyers and the market clears. Neuendorf,
for one, says he expects the Web to drive art prices through the
roof. Judging from what Pez dispensers are fetching on eBay, he
might just be right.

MONEYBOX: REPRICING ISN'T RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The essential problem with the hefty salaries and stock-option
grants (that top executives now take to be their god-given right)
is that the people handing out the salaries and the options are
effectively the same people who are receiving them.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where the CEO is also chairman of the board, that's
almost literally true, but even in cases where the board is made up
of outside directors, those directors are often CEOs or top
managers at other companies, who presumably will benefit if
executive salaries rise in general.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, of course, shareholders would step in to hold down
egregious salary increases. But shareholders are prohibited from
determining the salary of a given individual, and although some
resolutions have been offered restricting a company's top salary to
the multiple of the average employee's pay (so the CEO could only
make 20 times what the average worker makes), they've rarely
garnered more than 5 percent of shareholder votes. At a time when
the market is booming, the scratch-my-back-and-I'll-scratch-yours
strategy seems to be working quite well for top execs.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes what happened last Thursday at General
Datacomm Industries' annual meeting especially important, as
shareholders voted in a resolution blocking the company from
repricing stock options without prior shareholder approval.
</P>
<P>
   Repricing options is, of course, a viscerally repulsive
practice. Corporations that have seen their stock prices tumble
change the strike price of their employees' options so that if the
stock rises from the point to which it's fallen everyone can get
rich. Everyone, that is, but the shareholders who bought the stock
when it was much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Options are traditionally justified as a necessary incentive
designed to align the interests of management and shareholders. But
repricing, by essentially eliminating the downside risk for
management (if the stock goes south, executives know they'll get
another chance at a fortune), destroys the very alignment options
were supposed to create.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is, to be sure, more complicated than this. If we
don't reprice, companies argue, we'll have a hard time holding on
to our employees. And it's also true that repricing options only
for employees below a certain level makes considerably more sense
than repricing for senior management.
</P>
<P>
   But there's clearly a chicken-and-egg problem here. Companies
say they have to reprice because otherwise they'll lose talent. But
if no one repriced, then executives wouldn't expect that second
chance.
</P>
<P>
   And in any case, the ``talent'' that companies are afraid of
losing is the talent that's responsible for the collapse of the
stock. So why should companies be so anxious to keep these
executives around?
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of companies that already have bylaws
requiring shareholder approval before repricing. But the General
Datacomm vote was the first time that shareholders had added such a
bylaw. (Typically, the company told the Wall Street Journal that it
had ``serious questions'' about the resolution's validity. In other
words, company's management doesn't think the company's owners
should have any say over the dilution of their own stakes in the
company.)
</P>
<P>
   In the future, repricing should become a new locus of
shareholder activism. Over the past 10 years, we've heard so many
executives take credit for all the ``shareholder value'' they've
created. But when shareholder value is destroyed, it's always
someone or something else's fault. The General Datacomm vote sends
a simple message, one that should be sent to every CEO in America:
if you screw up, you don't get paid extra.

HOLLYWOOD'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE MOB 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 With a vertical color photo of Steve Van Zandt, Tony Sirico and
James Gandolfini in an episode of ``The Sopranos.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Hollywood is still married to the mob. It's been a long
relationship_but the passion is every bit as strong as it was way
back in the '30s when they were called gangster movies.
 &HT;    In l972 began the Francis Coppola ``Godfather'' trilogy_two of
them among the finest American movies ever made_plus other
memorable pictures about the inner workings of the Cosa Nostra.
Among the best: ``Once Upon a Time in America'' (1984),
``Scarface'' (1983), ``The Untouchables'' (1987), ``Goodfellas''
(1990), ``Bugsy'' (1991), Donnie Brasco (1997) and ``Casino''
(1995).
 &HT;    Now Hollywood's love affair with the Mafia is taking over the
home screen. Cable giant HBO might consider changing its name this
year to MOB TV. Besides a weekly series, it has three mob-oriented
films coming up this season.
 &HT;    ``The Sopranos,'' the comedy starring James Galdolfini as a
likable mobster Tony Soprano who runs his business out of New
Jersey, is getting rave reviews and ever-growing audiences.
Juggling his own nuclear family, his mob family and a cranky mother
(Nancy Marchand) who strikes dread and guilt equally in his heart,
he keeps having panic attacks. Finally they send him to a shrink
played by Lorraine Bracco (remember her in ``Goodfellas''?) who
prescribes Prozac for the capo.
 &HT;    Also upcoming on HBO (Feb. 27,) is ``Lansky,'' with Richard
Dreyfuss turning in an Emmy-worthy tour de force as Jewish mobster
Meyer Lansky who hobnobbed with the likes of Lucky Luciano and
Bugsy Siegel.
 &HT;    Then HBO gives us ``Vendetta,'' a compelling tale of political
corruption and the mob in turn-of-the-century New Orleans, and
finally ``Excellent Cadavers'' with Chazz Palminteri and F. Murray
Abraham in a tale about two courageous prosecutors who risk their
lives to bring members of the Italian Mafia to justice.
 &HT;    Rival Showtime this summer will serve up six hours of the
life-story of mob boss Joseph Bonanno. ``Bonanno: A Godfather's
Story'' with Martin Landau playing the ex-mob boss who is 94 and
lives on a ranch in Arizona. The show has the authentic touch:
Bonanno's son Bill, who knows what really goes on inside the mob,
serves as the show's executive producer. He says, ``Here's a series
that really gives you the lowdown_faithfully and truthfully.''
 &HT;    Then he adds cryptically, ``I'm sure when you see this movie
it's going to tell you something about yourself as much as it does
about us.''
 &HT;    The movie studios are not about to be left out in the rush. In
March ``Analyze This,'' a mob comedy, will be in your neighborhood
multiplex starring Robert DeNiro. It sounds like ``The Sopranos''
revisited. DeNiro is a man about to assume the crime boss mantle
who has second thoughts. So he goes to a family shrink played by
Billy Crystal, a doc with a slew of problems of his own with his
fiancee played by ``Friends''' Lisa Kudrow.
 &HT;    Six other mob-themed films will open on the big screen this
year. (See list below)
 &HT;    So what goes on here? Why do mob stories continue to intrigue
the public?
 &HT;    ``I've thought about this a thousand times and can't settle on
any one answer,'' notes David Chase, (``I'll Fly Away'' and
``Northern Exposure'') who created ``The Sopranos'' and has written
and directed many of the episodes. ``I think a large part of it has
to do with that savage twist to what is essentially a bourgeois
life. Also, the organized family represents a family which_for a
change _it would be fun to be part of, as opposed to our own real
life families. We look to our real life families and see
disappointing, annoying characters, whereas the mob family is
composed of people who will kill anyone who messes with us. And in
their daily lives these guys always do exactly as they please.''
 &HT;    Chase's ``Sopranos'' action takes place on the mean streets of
New Jersey. ``New Jersey is heavily Italian-American,'' he
observes. ``As an Italian American kid growing up there I read
constantly in the news about local Italian mobsters, yet I'd never
seen it depicted on screen. It's always been New York. So for `The
Sopranos' it was time for a new location_a new look.''
 &HT;    Actors too love to delve into the lives of the hard men. Says
Anthony LaPaglia who plays Lucky Luciano in ``Lansky,'' ``All the
aggressions that you'd like to take out in life, you can take them
out on the screen. These guys are great fun to play, great suits,
great period.''
 &HT;    And all of them treasure favorite lines from mob movies past.
 &HT;    For ``The Sopranos''' Gandolfini it's ``Get the canolis'' from
``The Godfather.'' For David Chase it's Joe Pesci's line to Ray
Liotto in ``Goodfellas'': ``What am I_a clown? Do I amuse you?''
 &HT;    And for Michael Imperioli, who plays Tony Soprano's
out-of-control nephew, it's a line from ``The Godfather'' given by
the Hollywood producer shortly before he wakes up to find that
bloody horse's head in his bed: ``You can't afford for me to look
ridiculous.''
 &HT;    ------

 &HT;    HEALTH/SCIENCE: Taking sample of newborns' DNA useful tool, some
parents find
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the freezer next to the frozen orange
juice, in a little foil pouch, Micky Cradit's mom keeps a sample of
his DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months ago, Micky became one of the first babies
genetically fingerprinted under a program _ now being proposed as a
state law _ that allows hospitals to take a newborn's blood sample
for future DNA identification. Not a bad idea, thought Micky's mom,
who also happens to be a lab tech at the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement's DNA lab, where blood samples are typically used to
find criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``DNA analysis is a powerful thing and a wonderful tool and
we're just starting to tap into all that can be done,'' said Rona
Kay Cradit.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Micky's venture into the high tech world of DNA
analysis began long before his birth, when the problem of child
abductions made national headlines with the disappearance of Adam
Walsh. A year after the 1982 kidnapping and slaying, FDLE created
its Missing Children Information Clearinghouse, which is
shepherding the program. So far, 1,300 babies have taken part in
trial sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The number of abducted children has remained fairly constant _
about 4,600 nationally every year _ but public attention to the
problem has intensified. Florida had 2,089 children reported
missing or abducted in 1997. But those numbers include children
lost at the mall or missing only briefly before being found.
</P>
<P>
   High profile cases like JonBenet Ramsey's have only increased
concern and generated ideas to help find children. Among them are
several home-test kits that use a child's saliva for analysis,
which can cost as much as $100.
</P>
<P>
   Cradit was not yet pregnant when someone brought a kit to her
lab two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought wow, this is a really good idea but let's look some
more,'' Cradit said.
</P>
<P>
   Her chief concern was that DNA analysis done now might not be
useful in 10 or 20 years. In addition, bacteria from saliva can
break down DNA.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, a company that analyzes DNA contacted FDLE
looking for an endorsement. When Linda McDonald, the
clearinghouse's senior management analyst, contacted the lab about
the request, Cradit volunteered her expertise. She had already
discovered that a Maryland company was manufacturing a new paper
that could preserve DNA in blood for up to 100 years without
storage problems and suggested hospitals do the testing at birth.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald sent requests to 111 hospitals around the state and
persuaded Tallahassee Memorial Hospital to run a trial program that
coincidentally began the day Micky was born.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500 original tests offered at Tallahassee Memorial, only
two parents refused. Martin Memorial Medical Center, which started
the sampling last week, has done about a half dozen, said
spokeswoman Gina Winch.
</P>
<P>
   The way the test works is simple:
</P>
<P>
   After delivery, when blood is drawn for state-required
screenings for sickle cell anemia and other diseases, nurses blot
the baby's blood on the treated paper, seal it in a foil pouch and
give it to the baby's mother. The sample can be stored in a cool
place or the refrigerator, Cradit said.
</P>
<P>
   If the need ever arises _ if the child's remains need to be
identified or law enforcement believes a DNA sample might aid the
search for a missing child _the DNA can be analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   To downplay any Orwellian notion of an overly intrusive
government, the state decided not to create a database.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to have a big brother issue,'' McDonald said.
``We don't want people afraid that somebody is doing something with
their child's blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandating the sampling would ensure it is available to all
parents at a reasonable cost, said Rep. Bob Starks (R-Casselberry),
who drafted a House bill. The kit costs only $1.40 and hospitals
can be reimbursed for the procedure through the state, he said.
Hospitals could choose to charge patients more than $1.40 for the
service.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, North Carolina started a similar program using a
federal grant with elementary school children. But when the grant
stopped, so did the program, Starks said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is selling the idea to parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just opens a Pandora's box of what we don't want to think
about,'' said Nancy McBride, director of the Florida branch of the
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
</P>
<P>
   McBride said recent photographs and videotape are the best tool
for finding children. Still, DNA is critical when it comes to
identifying children's remains.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the sampling has not been used in any investigation of a
Florida missing child, McDonald said. But several years ago, when
police discovered the body of a small girl in New York they
believed might be Katherine Lugo, who disappeared in 1994 in
Riviera Beach, they requested DNA for a comparison. To get the
sample, authorities had to track down the girl's biological father
and mother, which was time-consuming and emotionally trying,
McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the natural progression from fingerprints to DNA. And we
have to keep it all in balance.'' McBride said. ``I don't want it
to be a knee-jerk reaction. It's another tool.''

 &HT;    World War II, Old West books back in print
 &HT;    ATTN: COX -- Entertainment Editors
 &HT;    For Sunday, 2/7
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Palm Beach Post-Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bison Books, an imprint of the University of Nebraska Press, has
reissued some very interesting titles. The Frontier World of Doc
Holliday was originally published in 1957 and, along with John
Myers' Doc Holliday, is considered the definitive biography of the
legendary dentist/gunfighter.
</P>
<P>
   Custer &AMP; Company is a collection of material gathered by the
noted amateur historian Walter Camp about Little Big Horn. Camp
went around in the early part of this century talking to all the
survivors he could find on both sides of the battle. Camp died in
1925, and his papers were scattered and, in some cases, lost. This
edition puts as much of Camp's material as survives between covers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Harry Brown's A Walk in the Sun was originally
published in 1944, as the war it describes was winding down. It's a
neo-realist portrayal of a single American platoon struggling
through the Italian campaign. It was made into a good movie by
Lewis Milestone, which in turn contributed much to Steven
Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   A Walk in the Sun is one of the best novels of World War II, and
its return to print is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Malice Incorporated ...
</P>
<P>
   The small, gay-oriented Cleis Press in San Francisco will be
publishing Gore Vidal: Sexually Speaking, a collection of articles
and interviews. Mostly an anthology of previously published
material, there will be two new interviews, one between Vidal and
Larry Kramer, another between Vidal and Cleis' publisher.
Publication is expected in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Storm clouds over Europe ...
</P>
<P>
   Overlook Press will be issuing This is Berlin, transcripts of
William L. Shirer's broadcasts of the coming storm that he made for
CBS between 1938 and 1940. Shirer's tapes were discovered by his
son-in-law, and it would seem to make sense to issue an
accompanying CD of selected broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Child ...
</P>
<P>
   Those who remember Francois Truffaut's lovely, sad 1969 movie
about a child found living with wolves who is taken in and, after a
fashion, domesticated by a young doctor, might want to check out
two spinoff books that have just come out from Farrar, Straus and
Giroux.
</P>
<P>
   Victor is a novel, and The Wild Boy is a picture book, and both
are by Mordecai Gerstein, who's been obsessed with the story for 20
years. Truffaut based his movie on a true story, and Gerstein spent
weeks bicycling through France, visiting the places Victor lived.

 &HT;    Our Favorite Martians: The red planet has inspired many stories,
characters here on the blue sphere
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ As long as people have been looking into the night
sky, big bright Mars has been one of our favorite celestial
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Named for the Roman god of war, the angry red planet is 142
million miles from the sun and has a diameter of 4,217 miles. It
lives up to its namesake with natural violence far greater than
what we know on Earth, with winds gusting to 350 mph and evidence
of great floods that swamped vast areas. Its mean temperature of
minus 67 degrees Fahrenheit is enough to turn the hardiest little
green man blue.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from perhaps Uma Thurman, no other heavenly body has
inspired more wonder and awe. Writers such as H.G. Wells, Edgar
Rice Burroughs and Ray Bradbury have pondered the possibility of
life on Mars. NASA plans to touch down on its surface for the
second time this December. Hollywood has made countless trips.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, television gave us ``My Favorite Martian,'' a
sitcom starring Ray Walston as an alien who crashed on Earth and
Bill Bixby as the newspaper reporter who aided him, smelling the
story of his career. However, the Martian looked human, spoke
English and refused to admit to anyone but Bixby what he was. A
big-screen version of the TV show opens today, starring Christopher
Lloyd and Jeff Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   So in honor of the fourth planet and all its various
inspirational spinoffs, here's a look at some of our favorite
Martians (though we're sure there are some we've forgotten):
</P>
<P>
   _ Ray Walston: As Uncle Martin on the 1960s sitcom ``My Favorite
Martian,'' this stranded alien had little retractable antennae,
could make himself invisible and could move objects just by
pointing at them. He just couldn't fix that darn spaceship, despite
trying for three seasons, from 1963-'66.
</P>
<P>
   _ Christopher Lloyd: The movie version of Uncle Martin is played
by an offbeat character actor from Stamford, Conn., whose eccentric
roles include ``Taxi'''s Reverend Jim, ``Back to the Future'''s Dr.
Emmett Brown and ``The Addams Family'''s Uncle Fester. He made his
screen debut in 1975 as one of the inmates in ``One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Marvin the Martian: Introduced in the 1948 Looney Tunes
cartoon Haredevil Hare as ``Commander X-23,'' Marvin the Martian
has spent much of the last 50 years attempting to blow up Earth
with his Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator, because Earth
blocks his view of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Invaders From Mars'': The 1953 original was a stylish sci-fi
cheapy about a little boy who can't convince small-town residents
of an alien invasion because they've already been brainwashed by
the invaders. Tobe Hooper did a disappointing high-tech remake in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Mars Attacks!'': Tim Burton based his campy 1996 sci-fi
spoof on a gruesome 1960s trading cards series depicting an alien
invasion. These malicious little green men torment a Cub Scout pack
with a toppling Washington Monument, bowl down the icons on Easter
Island and swap Sarah Jessica Parker's head for that of a
Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Great Gazoo: While not technically a Martian, this little
green man from ``The Flintstones'' is the former head scientist on
the planet Zetox. Banished to Stone Age Earth for inventing a
disintegration device, Gazoo must prove himself worthy by helping
Fred and Barney.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Devil Girl From Mars:'' A 1954 space farce about about a
sexy, leather-clad female from Mars and her very large robot, who
arrive on Earth to round up men for breeding purposes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mick Mars: The Motley Crue guitarist was born Bob Deal in
Terre Haute, Ind., on April 3, 1956, and moved to California with
his family when he was 8. He was signed to the band after placing
an ad in The Recycler that read: ``Loud, aggressive, rude guitarist
available.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Mars Needs Women'': This silly 1968 sci-fi comedy starred
former Mouseketeer Tommy Kirk as a Martian who arrives on Earth
with four pals in search of women to help them repopulate their
planet. He winds up falling for a go-go dancing female scientist,
played by television's Batgirl, Yvonne Craig.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Mars Needs Guitars!'': The second album by Sydney,
Australia's, Hoodoo Gurus boasted ``a hip title, spiffy cover art,
characteristically kitschy thank-yous and a top-notch opening tune
in `Bittersweet','' according to the Trouser Press Record Guide.
Still, it's not up to snuff with 1983's ``Stoneage Romeos'' and
1989's ``Magna Cum Louder.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Santa Claus Conquers the Martians'': Pia Zadora and Jamie
Farr are among the green-skinned tykes in this 1964 bomb, in which
St. Nick and two Earth children are abducted by a spaceship because
Martian kids don't have a Santa Claus of their own.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars: David Bowie
introduced his otherworldly stage persona in February 1972, backed
by the Spiders: Mick Ronson, Trevor Boulder and Mick ``Woody''
Woodmansey. He publicly retired the group in July 1973 on stage at
London's Hammersmith Odeon. The same month, ``Life on Mars'' _
Bowie's third space-themed single _ hit No. 3 on the UK charts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quisp: This pink-skinned, propeller-headed alien in cool green
tights is actually from Planet Q, but he surely must have passed
Mars en route to Earth with a spaceship full of ``the quazy energy
cereal'' that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Martian Chronicles'': Ray Bradbury's classic novel _
adapted as a 1979 television miniseries _ is set in the year 1999,
when three expeditions have been launched for Mars. The strange
fate of each mission unveils another layer of mystery that shrouds
the red planet.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Total Recall'': Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a
21st-century construction worker plagued by dreams about the
colonization of Mars in this mind-bending 1990 sci-fi film,
directed by Paul Verhoven and based on Phillip K. Dick's short
story, ``We Can Remember It For You Wholesale.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Martians Go Home'': Nerdy composer Randy Quaid accidentally
summons a billion green Martians to Earth in this low-budget 1990
bomb, based on Fredric Brown's classic sci-fi humor novel. The
annoying Martians are all played by mediocre standup comics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kenneth Mars: Described as a ``frequently histrionic comedic
character player since the 1960s'' by ``The Film Encyclopedia,''
the Chicago-born actor is best known as the Nazi author of
``Springtime for Hitler'' in Mel Brooks' ``The Producers.'' He also
appeared as wooden-armed Inspector Kemp in Brooks' ``Young
Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mars Pathfinder: The NASA spacecraft landed on Mars on July 4,
1997, sending back spectacular pictures of the planet's surface and
ushering in a new age of space exploration. NASA plans to send a
pair of spacecraft to Mars every two years over the next decade.
The Mars Climate Orbiter and the Mars Polar Lander are scheduled to
reach Mars this year to conduct water research. The big mission to
bring back Martian soil and rocks is set for a 2005 launch.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Invasion of the Saucer Men'': A minor camp classic from 1957
in which little green men with alcohol for blood do battle with
hot-rodding teen-agers. Frank Gorshin, who would later don green
tights as ``Batman'''s Riddler, played the ill-fated town drunk.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Men Are From Mars...'': So bring me my supper, woman!
</P>
<P>
   _ John Carter of Mars: Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs began
his writing career in 1911 with a story best known by its hardcover
title, ``A Princess of Mars.'' Fleeing an Indian war party in the
Arizona foothills, John Carter is transported to the red planet,
where he rescues and wins the hand of the beautiful Princess of
Helium. Burroughs' Martian series eventually totaled 11 books, and
featured some of his best writing.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Species II'': Underwear model Justin Lazard is infected with
spores of alien DNA during a mission to Mars in this gory 1998
sequel. The hunky astronaut returns to Earth as a
tentacle-sprouting sex machine whose alien babies explode out of
screaming women all over town.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The War of the Worlds'': H.G. Wells' classic novel about the
invasion of Earth by Martians inspired Orson Welles' infamous 1938
Mercury Theatre radio broadcast that scared the bejabbers out of
thousands of gullible, panic-stricken listeners. Then there was the
frightening 1953 film version produced by George Pal, which won an
Academy Award for its dazzling special effects of destruction
caused by the Martian war machines. The film inspired a syndicated
television series that ran for two seasons, from 1988-1990.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster'': This low-grade 1965
horror flick involves an interplanetary robot gone berserk among
Puerto Rican disco dancers. Released on video as ``Mars Invades
Puerto Rico.'' _ ``It! The Terror From Beyond Space'': Ridley
Scott's ``Alien'' owes a debt to this 1958 sci-fi thriller, in
which the sole survivor of the first Martian expedition is accused
of murdering his crewmates and brought back to Earth by a second
spaceship. The actual culprit is a Martian monster which has crept
aboard the returning ship and begins killing the crew members.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Angry Red Planet'': An unintentionally amusing 1959
sci-fi adventure about giant amoeba creatures attacking the first
expedition to Mars. Filmed in the odd ``Cinemagic'' process, which
turned mostly everything pink, the movie has earned cult status for
its wild special effects.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Flight to Mars'': Scientists and newspapermen land on Mars
and discover a lost underground civilization that wants to invade
Earth using the U.S. spacecraft. The 1952 sci-fi adventure was the
first film of its genre to be shot in color.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Planet of Blood'': An eerie 1966 space opera about a Martian
vampire brought to Earth. The movie cribbed expensive effects
footage from a big-budget Russian film, ``Niebo Zowiet.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Lobster Man From Mars'': An occasionally funny 1990 comedy
about a rich movie producer (Tony Curtis) who needs a
tax-sheltering flop. His solution is to buy an amateur horror movie
from a young filmmaker that features the kooky title creature and a
screaming maiden.

 &HT;    THE LAST SEQUEL: Larry McMurtry completes his trilogy
 &HT;    For Sunday, 2/7
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUANE'S DEPRESSED, by Larry McMurtry. Simon &AMP; Schuster; 431
pages; $26.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, Jacy Farrow is dead. The high school tease who
animated The Last Picture Show and whose return to town motivated
Texasville, has been killed in a plane crash before the beginning
of Duane's Depressed, the deceptively easygoing, masterly third leg
of Larry McMurtry's Texas trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   Jacy's death is not a major plot strand, nor are any of the
characters that we have grown to know so well over the course of
the previous two books prominently featured; they're seasoning, a
Greek chorus, but McMurtry stays focused on his main subject.
</P>
<P>
   Duane thinks about Jacy once or twice, but not a lot, because
he's got problems of his own. For no reason in particular but every
reason in general, Duane Moore has decided that he doesn't want his
life anymore.
</P>
<P>
   This manifests itself in a sudden decision to stop driving and
start walking. He hides the keys to his pickup because he's sick of
riding and not seeing anything. He goes to his cabin on the
outskirts of town. He gets a dog named Shorty.
</P>
<P>
   Karla, his more or less idiotic wife of 40 years, who believes
that if she pecks at a problem long enough it will unravel, is
driven to distraction by his sudden absence from her life and, for
that matter, his own. What she doesn't understand is that something
has to change; Duane just hasn't figured out what, exactly.
</P>
<P>
   His more or less useless children, who have long parked their
ill-mannered brats _ check out Little Bascom _ at their
grandparents' house while they engage in serial relationships and
drinking and drugging, are also stunned. What to do without Daddy?
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry's mastery of his character and setting are such that
you never notice that, in terms of conventional plotting, almost
nothing happens, but you're never bored for a minute. There's
movement, but it's mostly internal. (Woe betide anybody who tries
to make a movie out of Duane's Depressed _ movies are all about
plot, and good writing is all about character.)
</P>
<P>
   Duane walks to the store. He visits his old friend Sonny, who
seems to be willing himself to die. Against his better judgment, he
goes to a therapist. The therapist tells him to get back in touch
with life by reading Proust. He struggles mightily with Proust. He
falls in love with the therapist. The therapist is a lesbian with a
surly partner.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all this, McMurtry kills off a central character
with all the coldblooded dispatch for which he's famous _ he's the
literary equivalent of the Old Testament Jehovah.
</P>
<P>
   So Duane has to contemplate even more than he planned on.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever decided you wanted out, and not just for a
weekend, McMurtry's careful delineation of Duane's mental state
makes perfect sense:
</P>
<P>
   ``The cabin was the opposite of town _ there, everything was
disorderly: his kids taking drugs and neglecting their kids, his
oil business crew growing more deranged every year. Of course,
Karla did keep a neat greenhouse _ he had to give her that, even if
the winter tomatoes were only the size of pecans. But the town
churned with disorder, and what he wanted for himself was order. He
wanted each tool in its place at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The literary antecedent for Duane's Depressed is, of course,
Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, another deceptive but profound
moral tale of the emotional chaos caused by one man who would, for
his own reasons, prefer not to.
</P>
<P>
   Larry McMurtry is a professional writer and puts out a book
every two years or so, and not all of those books have been
absolutely necessary. Too many sequels to Lonesome Dove and some
obvious throwaways. But every once in a while, he rises up and
throws down something so defiantly good that you remember why you
read him in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry is on such good terms with his people, his affection
undimmed by the passing years, that he achieves the sort of
shambling, wry warmth, completely devoid of sentimentality, evoked
by Will Rogers nearly 70 years ago. Although that's the primary
note McMurtry strikes, to leave it at that would ignore the deep
well of anguish animating Duane's Depressed; anguish over growing
old, over a life that feels completely unlived to the person inside
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess life's always more complicated than people think it's
going to be,'' muses Duane at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just while you're young and after sex,'' replies Ruth, his
90-year-old accountant, Sonny's lover all those years ago in The
Last Picture Show. ``Now that I'm not after sex my life is
perfectly simple _ you bring me little sacks of okra and I sit here
watching ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, this is a book about the dailiness of life, the
turning of the Earth, the way people have of going on no matter
what befalls them, and the possibility of second and third acts in
a small town in west Texas. It's a comfort and a glory.

 &HT;    World War II, Old West books back in print
 &HT;    ATTN: COX -- Entertainment Editors
 &HT;    For Sunday, 2/7
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Palm Beach Post-Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bison Books, an imprint of the University of Nebraska Press, has
reissued some very interesting titles. The Frontier World of Doc
Holliday was originally published in 1957 and, along with John
Myers' Doc Holliday, is considered the definitive biography of the
legendary dentist/gunfighter.
</P>
<P>
   Custer &AMP; Company is a collection of material gathered by the
noted amateur historian Walter Camp about Little Big Horn. Camp
went around in the early part of this century talking to all the
survivors he could find on both sides of the battle. Camp died in
1925, and his papers were scattered and, in some cases, lost. This
edition puts as much of Camp's material as survives between covers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Harry Brown's A Walk in the Sun was originally
published in 1944, as the war it describes was winding down. It's a
neo-realist portrayal of a single American platoon struggling
through the Italian campaign. It was made into a good movie by
Lewis Milestone, which in turn contributed much to Steven
Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   A Walk in the Sun is one of the best novels of World War II, and
its return to print is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Malice Incorporated ...
</P>
<P>
   The small, gay-oriented Cleis Press in San Francisco will be
publishing Gore Vidal: Sexually Speaking, a collection of articles
and interviews. Mostly an anthology of previously published
material, there will be two new interviews, one between Vidal and
Larry Kramer, another between Vidal and Cleis' publisher.
Publication is expected in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Storm clouds over Europe ...
</P>
<P>
   Overlook Press will be issuing This is Berlin, transcripts of
William L. Shirer's broadcasts of the coming storm that he made for
CBS between 1938 and 1940. Shirer's tapes were discovered by his
son-in-law, and it would seem to make sense to issue an
accompanying CD of selected broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Child ...
</P>
<P>
   Those who remember Francois Truffaut's lovely, sad 1969 movie
about a child found living with wolves who is taken in and, after a
fashion, domesticated by a young doctor, might want to check out
two spinoff books that have just come out from Farrar, Straus and
Giroux.
</P>
<P>
   Victor is a novel, and The Wild Boy is a picture book, and both
are by Mordecai Gerstein, who's been obsessed with the story for 20
years. Truffaut based his movie on a true story, and Gerstein spent
weeks bicycling through France, visiting the places Victor lived.

The martinis served on silver trays and shaken in individual silver
shakers. Does all this make the Windsor Court in downtown New
Orleans the best hotel in the world? Yes, according to Conde Nast
Traveler, which recently asked 37,000 readers to pick their
favorite hotel by rating rooms, service, food and location. The
Windsor Court won by scoring more than 90 percent in all four

named ``Life Is Beautiful.'' Add a last-minute dark horse, director
Shekhar Kapur's ``Elizabeth,'' and the Oscar race breaks down into
a battle between fatigues and Elizabethan finery, between wars with

   RINGEL ON VIDEO _ One of the more interesting things about ``The
Hi-Lo Country,'' the new western starring Woody Harrelson, is its
lineage. The movie was originally supposed to be directed by Sam
Peckinpah. In fact, Peckinpah tried for more than 20 years (he died
in 1984), but his version never quite got saddled up, so to speak.
Still, if you're in the mood for a dose or two of the Peckinpah

   COXNET-BOOKS 0212 _ We call each February Black History Month,
but it needs to be a whole lot more than a revisitation of black
history. With the focus on the black experience, the view can be
forward as well as backward, which is _ or should be _ the goal of
any study of the past. Books have always done well to record and
remind us of the events that brought us to this time, this place.
(Dempsey, Dayton Daily News)
</P>

   WITH
</P>
<P>
   REVIEW _ What makes an Anne Lamott book, such as her new
``Traveling Mercies,'' such easy reading is the voice. As confiding
as one of J.D. Salinger's narrators, and as funny, she draws you
in. Within a few pages you care about her _ this California author
who is so open about everything from her alcoholism to her
religious faith. Putting the book down would be like hanging up on
a dear friend.
</P>
<P>
   SKUBE ON BOOKS _ Allen Barra's sympathies are with Wyatt Earp,
but he is no hagiographer. His understated humor and his sense of
the ironic make ``Inventing Wyatt Earp'' part revisionist history
and part disquisition on the malleable meaning of legend, with
impromptu forays into film criticism. (Skube, Atlanta

the North Georgia Mountains and draws on DePoy's experience living

is ``Cold Mountain'' by Charles Frazier. In case you missed it,
it's an absorbing story about a Confederate soldier who is wounded
and heads for home when he leaves the hospital instead of heading
back to his regiment. He is, technically, a deserter, although, as
you get to know him and his circumstances, you realize that he is a
sympathetic character, much more so than the renegades who roam the
countryside looting and killing as they pretend to be pursuing
deserters for the ``cause.'' (Milner, Lufkin Daily News).

   WINDSORHOTEL _ NEW ORLEANS _ The mantra of the Windsor Court
Hotel is details, details. Details such as the 175 roses flown in
from South America every Friday and placed in a priceless antique
urn in the lobby. The $8 million collection of English art and
antiques adorning common rooms. The afternoon tea poured in
Wedgewood china cups and accompanied by homemade scones and tarts.
The martinis served on silver trays and shaken in individual silver
shakers. Does all this make the Windsor Court in downtown New
Orleans the best hotel in the world? Yes, according to Conde Nast
Traveler, which recently asked 37,000 readers to pick their
favorite hotel by rating rooms, service, food and location. The
Windsor Court won by scoring more than 90 percent in all four
categories. We were impressed during our stay, but there were

in 1984), but his version never quite got saddled up, so to speak.
Still, if you're in the mood for a dose or two of the Peckinpah

back to his regiment. He is, technically, a deserter, although, as
you get to know him and his circumstances, you realize that he is a
sympathetic character, much more so than the renegades who roam the
countryside looting and killing as they pretend to be pursuing
deserters for the ``cause.'' (Milner, Lufkin Daily News).

<P>
   Going to Europe? Consider paying for the trip with the euro, the
new coin of the realm in 11 European countries. Simplicity is the
most compelling reason to do so, as the euro eliminates the
arithmetical gymnastics needed to figure out the true cost of a
360,000 lire jacket in Rome, a 200 franc bottle of burgundy in
Paris or 35 Irish punts at a Dublin bed and breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Like the dollar, the euro is made up of 100 cents. It is
currently trading at about $1.15 US. How much easier to estimate
that the jacket will run about 248 euros, that burgundy 40 euros
and that night in Dublin 57 euros. Just one currency to plan a
budget on, instead of 11.
</P>
<P>
   The euro debuted on Jan. 1, 1999, when 11 European countries
began the three-year transition of merging their individual
currencies into one. Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain are
the financial brothers-in-arms, while laggards Britain, Denmark,
Sweden and Greece have yet to join.
</P>
<P>
   During this initial stage, in which the euro will coexist
alongside national currencies, the euro is a ``virtual'' currency,
used for non-cash transactions, which include credit cards, checks,
travelers' checks and direct debits.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of exchange between the euro and the national currency
of a given country is fixed, so there's no fluctuation. There will,
however, be fluctuations between the euro and currencies in
nonparticipating countries, such as Switzerland and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The actual notes and coins won't appear until Jan. 1, 2002.
There will be seven notes, in denominations of five to 500 euro, as
well as eight coins. Seven months after issuance, on July 1, 2002,
national currencies from those 11 countries will no longer be
legal.
</P>
<P>
   Double price lists, of national currency and euros, are starting
to become commonplace at European airline offices and railway
terminals, as well as in hotels, restaurants and shops. While
European merchants are not required to accept euros until Jan. 1,
2002, many are already doing so and many more will follow suit.
There's economic pressure to do so, as increasing numbers of
travelers become accustomed to the idea of spending euros rather
than lire, pesetas or francs and patronize shops accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, travelers are not obliged to pay for anything in
euros. But they may want to. For Americans traveling to Europe this
spring, the most immediate benefit of the euro is simplification.
</P>
<P>
   With the euro, travelers can compare prices and values quickly
in the 11 participating countries. Since the cost of identical
goods in Europe can vary sharply between countries, with a single
currency you can easily compare what a Diet Coke, a compact rental
car or a modest inn will cost in the Netherlands, Belgium and
France. This ``price transparency'' will be evident on purchases
big and small and will likely result in an increase in competition,
both within the 11 countries and in neighboring countries looking
for their share of business.
</P>
<P>
   With financially strong countries like Germany and weaker ones
like Portugal as European Monetary Union members, prices may
decrease slightly in the former and increase in the latter. But
it's unrealistic to expect that a deluxe Berlin hotel will be as
modestly priced as Lisbon's finest, any more than one would expect
a Manhattan property to lower its rates to stay in line with a
hotel in, say, Omaha. But as the prices of goods fluctuate, the
cost of a European vacation may well change in the next couple of
years.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Handwerk, director of public affairs for American
Express, suggests that ``tour packages may actually decrease in
price,'' as a result of greater competition among suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Since there's no euro cash yet, credit cards will be the most
convenient way to complete a transaction in euros. With the advent
of euro notes and coins in the 11 countries, travelers will realize
an immediate savings in currency transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers ``can lose up to 5 percent'' of their capital by
trading dollars into francs and then pesetas, according to Deanna
Hermanson, the project manager for the single European currency at
Visa International. The company advocates charging purchases in
euros on multi-country visits to eliminate such losses.
</P>
<P>
   Euro-denominated travelers' checks are now in use and can be
prepurchased in the United States and used to pay for travel
services in 11 European countries. But travelers should note that
if they pay for a 75-euro meal in Frankfurt with a 100-euro
travelers' check right now, they'll get their 25 euros worth of
change in German marks.
</P>
<P>
   For American travelers, there may well be a downside to the
euro, whose ``raison d'etre'' is European economic stabilization.
That stability will likely mean a less volatile currency, less
fluctuation and fewer opportunities to take advantage of market
downturns.
</P>
<P>
   But as Hermanson of Visa International points out, ``Even though
Mediterranean countries are still less expensive than northern
countries, I think the destinations themselves will still draw the
traveler.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Who's newsier than Monica?
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Feb. 14, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I asked a friend when he thought we would hear the last of
Monica Lewinsky and he appropriately told me that I was out of my
mind to even think we ever would hear the last of her _ or of Ken
Starr, even Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While America might want closure, it's not going to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime this month, a book about Monica is coming out, and one
Internet reviewer wrote: ``I thought we knew it all, but `Monica's
Story' blew me away.'' Then he admitted he didn't read the book and
made up the review ``out of humor and admiration for Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   But there probably will be people reading the Internet who
believe the review is authentic, so keep your seat belts fastened.
There are going to be all sorts of wild followups to rumors and/or
facts about this entire sordid mess.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered aloud if there ever was a day in the past year or so
when we didn't read Monica's name in the paper and, again, my
friend appropriately told me that I was nuts to think there wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   But it intrigued me. So I got into my computer and connected to
the archives of my local morning newspaper. How many items in 1998
editions of that paper contained the name ``Monica Lewinsky?'' I
asked the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The answer flashed back: 929. That's an average of two and one
half items a day. My friend felt that number was low; so did I but,
hey, computers don't lie, do they?
</P>
<P>
   Looking up name frequency seemed like a fun thing to do, so I
also looked up Bill Clinton for 1998. He showed up in 836
documents. But when you add the formalized William Jefferson
Clinton, there are 34 more appearances for a grand total of 870;
that's still 59 less than Monica.
</P>
<P>
   I kept having my little fun. Mark McGwire, the home run hitter,
appeared in 692 documents, 533 more than Jesus Christ. Saddam
Hussein, surprisingly, appeared in only 373 documents, little more
than one a day. Frank Sinatra, who died in 1998, was mentioned in
187 stories, and the Spice Girls, who didn't really die but only
seemed like they did, showed up only five times less.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge success of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' actor Tom
Hanks's name appeared but 85 times, while Lucille Ball, who has
been dead 10 years, showed up 27 times.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Springer: 125; Bill Gates: 149. Michael Jordan and the
Pope were 11 apart, Jordan getting 534, the Pope 523.
</P>
<P>
   Is there one person who could possibly have topped Monica
Lewinsky's 929 stories? Seems unlikely, doesn't it. But there was.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr a.k.a. Kenneth Starr!
</P>
<P>
   When I probed the computer for Starr's appearances using Kenneth
as his first name, there were 737 showings. When I went back with
the shortened Ken, there were an additional 205 documents for a
grand total of 942; that's 13 more than Monica.
</P>
<P>
   By the time 1999 is completed, the Lewinsky/Starr/Clinton gully
probably will be filled with another voluminous number of
appearances. This story is far from over; the principals and
antagonists won't ever let go.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, in case you're interested, the name of Jose Saramago
appeared only eight times in 1998. Who's Jose Saramago? The
76-year-old Portuguese novelist and poet won the 1998 Nobel Prize
for Literature.
</P>
<P>
   Had he done a book on Monica, his name probably would have
appeared upwards of 500 times.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Impeachment farce produced one hero
 &HT;    (Eds: This column, which many papers run on Sundays, was written
for use after the Senate vote.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, now, wasn't that fun! We got to talk dirty in public for
more than a year. We learned the names of lots of members of
Congress. We discovered it's a toss-up whether it is more dangerous
to be a friend of Bill or a friend of Linda.
</P>
<P>
   And it all ended just about where it began: The president got
caught recklessly and very stupidly playing '63 Dodge Back Seat in
the White House and lied to us about it and, panicked and being the
fool hug-a-bear he is, rubbed right up against perjury and
obstruction of justice even if he didn't actually grope them.
Though that may depend upon what ``if'' is.
</P>
<P>
   To get from Point A right back to Point A again a year later, we
pretty much put the national business of the United States on hold.
We turned over millions more dollars to Cotton Mathe _ er, to
Kenneth Starr so he could keep chasing Bill Clinton on behalf of
the political right. And we were forced, like dough down a tube,
through a partisan impeachment charade driven, it turned out, more
by suspicions than by evidence. The House's hysteria flopped in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I believe, we are all supposed to put on our
serious faces and intone about how the constitutional mandate has
been fulfilled, about the essential sobriety of the process and
about how, no matter what we think of the outcome, we are dazzled
by the elegance of its stately procedures.
</P>
<P>
   But that would just be hanging a deadpan mask on what history,
here's guessing, is likely to regard as farce.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody comes out of this looking somewhere between silly and
just awful. Clinton, for his inability to operate two organs at
once, the brain being the other one. The House Republicans for
their lunatic lynching and hollow self-righteousness. The media for
driving 90 miles an hour. Down hill. Without brakes. The Senate for
dragging out the obvious in the service of the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, one hero, so three cheers for the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   They got it right, right from the start. Within moments of the
first break, TV's yammerers had the president just days from
disgraced resignation _ and only a step ahead of the sheriff _ but
the people already knew better. They saw the president's blunders
as both appalling and a bit of a giggle and in any event, given
what they already suspected of him, not very surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The people calculated the president was doing a fair-to-good job
and that his little whoopee was a family not a national matter.
What is more, and likely was crucial, the American instinct for
fair play kicked in. Most folks rightly figured Clinton's troubles
were his own damn fault but saw Starr and his toughs as getting
involved where they had no business and then piling on.
</P>
<P>
   For their common sense, the people have been called sell-outs,
moral slugs, dummies and dupes. They have taken that in stride, too
_ in all, showing far more poise and proportion than the pols and
pundits who kept announcing that Americans had fallen into a sorry,
sorry state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are the safest ... lodgement of power.'' Andrew
Johnson said that, sort of one impeachment guy to another.

 &HT;    World War II, Old West books back in print
 &HT;    For Sunday, 2/7
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bison Books, an imprint of the University of Nebraska Press, has
reissued some very interesting titles. The Frontier World of Doc
Holliday was originally published in 1957 and, along with John
Myers' Doc Holliday, is considered the definitive biography of the
legendary dentist/gunfighter.
</P>
<P>
   Custer &AMP; Company is a collection of material gathered by the
noted amateur historian Walter Camp about Little Big Horn. Camp
went around in the early part of this century talking to all the
survivors he could find on both sides of the battle. Camp died in
1925, and his papers were scattered and, in some cases, lost. This
edition puts as much of Camp's material as survives between covers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Harry Brown's A Walk in the Sun was originally
published in 1944, as the war it describes was winding down. It's a
neo-realist portrayal of a single American platoon struggling
through the Italian campaign. It was made into a good movie by
Lewis Milestone, which in turn contributed much to Steven
Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   A Walk in the Sun is one of the best novels of World War II, and
its return to print is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Malice Incorporated ...
</P>
<P>
   The small, gay-oriented Cleis Press in San Francisco will be
publishing Gore Vidal: Sexually Speaking, a collection of articles
and interviews. Mostly an anthology of previously published
material, there will be two new interviews, one between Vidal and
Larry Kramer, another between Vidal and Cleis' publisher.
Publication is expected in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Storm clouds over Europe ...
</P>
<P>
   Overlook Press will be issuing This is Berlin, transcripts of
William L. Shirer's broadcasts of the coming storm that he made for
CBS between 1938 and 1940. Shirer's tapes were discovered by his
son-in-law, and it would seem to make sense to issue an
accompanying CD of selected broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Child ...
</P>
<P>
   Those who remember Francois Truffaut's lovely, sad 1969 movie
about a child found living with wolves who is taken in and, after a
fashion, domesticated by a young doctor, might want to check out
two spinoff books that have just come out from Farrar, Straus and
Giroux.
</P>
<P>
   Victor is a novel, and The Wild Boy is a picture book, and both
are by Mordecai Gerstein, who's been obsessed with the story for 20
years. Truffaut based his movie on a true story, and Gerstein spent
weeks bicycling through France, visiting the places Victor lived.

BOXER SAYS SHE WILL VOTE TO ACQUIT CLINTON AND OPPOSE CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Barbara Boxer, dismissing the question of
whether her distant family ties with President Clinton presented
her with a conflict of interest, said Thursday she will vote to
acquit the president.
</P>
<P>
   In a preview of the 15-minute speech that she will deliver
Thursday or Friday during closed Senate deliberations, Boxer mildly
criticized Clinton's behavior as ``irresponsible and indefensible''
and then went on to slam Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
investigation, deride Linda Tripp who recorded telephone
conversations with Monica Lewinsky, and rail against the House
impeachment as ``an illegitimate process.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with reporters for California news organizations, Boxer
said she won't support efforts by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
to formally censure Clinton, saying she ``didn't agree with the
conclusions'' of a proposed censure.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she isn't likely to sign any letter that Feinstein
and other Democratic senators are working on that would rebuke
Clinton for his behavior. Feinstein says she may resort to such a
letter if the Senate fails to take up a formal resolution of
censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a letter, I'm inclined to write my own,'' Boxer said.
``If I'm going to write to the president, I'd like to write what I
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that she is concerned that Democratic efforts to
revive the censure resolution after the one-week recess that starts
Friday could drag on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about it becoming the dominant issue in the Senate,''
she said. ``I'm worried it could take too much time away from other
work.''
</P>
<P>
   In her six-page prepared statement that Boxer will read to the
Senate, she said Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky boils down to
a ``consensual affair, wanted by both parties. It was irresponsible
and indefensible: a young woman, a relationship wrong in every way,
a president trying desperately to hide the affair.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said Clinton's behavior was no excuse for Starr's
``witchhunt,'' which, she said, ``went from a real estate deal, to
several other fruitless investigations, to a sex deal built around
illegally recorded phone conversations with someone named Linda
Tripp... Heaven help us if we all act like Linda Tripp, secretly
recording our dear friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In her prepared remarks, Boxer acknowledged that her daughter
Nicole is married to Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, Hugh Rodham.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer thanked her fellow senators for not questioning ``the
propriety of my participation in this impeachment matter'' but she
complained that she was ``the target of a barrage of questions by
the media and others outside this body'' because of the family tie.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said her ``deep reverence'' for the Constitution has
prompted her to reject the articles of impeachment because ``the
high crimes and misdemeanors constitutional requirement for removal
has not been met... not even close.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution does not say remove the president if he fails
to be a role model for our children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not say remove the President if he violates the
military code of conduct, or the Senate ethics Code. It does not
say remove the President if he brings pain to his family...,'' she
declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no bipartisan support for it and the president's
removal would hurt the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said ``impeachment and removal from office were not meant
to be a punishment of the president, but rather a protection of the
country from a tyrant who would use his or her power against the
people and the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer also said the House prosecutor's case did not present
``one shred of direct evidence for their claims, and the details of
their circumstantial case have been decimated in many respects.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Clinton will not be placed ``above the law'' because he
will be subject to prosecution after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer told reporters she ``never once'' considered convicting
the president and that she has ``felt like the American people,''
who polls show have opposed impeaching or removing the president
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, just maybe, history will say that the Senate stopped a
partisan witchhunt against the president of the United States,''
Boxer said. ``If the Senate does that, I think something good will
have come of it.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WHITHER MICROSOFT?
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday,
 &HT;    Feb. 14.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four days a week, Joel Klein, the Justice
Department's antitrust chief, walks over to the federal courtroom
where the Microsoft trial has unfolded for the past 16 weeks. There
Klein sits on a wooden bench, watching David Boies, his top gun,
pick Microsoft's defenses apart.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has made Boies' task easier by concocting a legal
strategy that has occasionally left the judge shaking his head in
disbelief at what he has heard.
</P>
<P>
   Some 95 out of every 100 personal computers being shipped today
are pre-loaded with Microsoft Windows. But Microsoft claims that it
lacks monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. antitrust laws, monopolies aren't illegal. But
seeking to leverage your strength in one arena, such as operating
systems, to gain supremacy in another, such as cyberspace, is
strictly verboten.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft might have told U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson that it was a ``good'' monopolist, one striving to improve
its products, make its customers happy and keep its prices low.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company's lawyers have argued that Windows is at
dire risk of being consumed by Linux, a free operating system that
only computer nerds love.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson doesn't appear to be buying this line. Nor, for that
matter, are the investors who have bid up the price of Microsoft's
shares by more than 60 percent since this trial began.
</P>
<P>
   At least one can sense why Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates might
be a bit paranoid over the future of his company. In developing
DOS, the precursor to Windows, in the early 1980s, Gates did the
kind of nasty turn to IBM that he fears somebody is going to do to
him.
</P>
<P>
   That person could be Scott McNealy, Gates' one-time Harvard
buddy, who has pushed his company, Sun Microsystems, to develop
Java, a new technology that McNealy hopes will someday make Windows
superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if four years from now Microsoft's
market capitalization fell from $300 billion to $1 billion,''
McNeely told me recently as we shared a late-night brandy in a
Swiss hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, at a lunch for media moguls, I asked Gates whether
he had entertained any thoughts of striking a deal with the feds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's rather to unusual to do that kind of thing in the
middle of a trial,'' the world's richest man allowed.
</P>
<P>
   But then Gates proceeded to lay down his marker for a
settlement: the government would have to let Microsoft continue to
enrich its Windows technology. Leave our crown jewels alone, Gates
suggested, and all else could be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Which takes us back to Joel Klein and, specifically, to Klein's
schedule on Fridays, when Jackson doesn't hold court. On Fridays,
Klein meets with a team of lawyers and computer gurus who are
fashioning remedies to put before Jackson should the judge rule
against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson remains free to impose his own remedies or to borrow
outsiders' ideas. (McNealy thinks Microsoft should be barred from
gobbling up more companies.) What's becoming increasingly clear,
however, is that at some point down this antitrust road, Klein and
Gates will need to have a long chat.

HOUSTON'S NEW PLAYER: RAPPIN' WITH SOUTH PARK MEXICAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Carlos Coy looks like your average neighborhood tough
guy: closely shaved head, neatly trimmed goatee, baggy clothes,
heavy gold jewelry. He's the guy you see on your way to work,
walking into the corner convenience store or hanging out at the
neighborhood bar.
</P>
<P>
   Coy's story is also familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Just 28, he's been married to his wife, Georgina, for 11 years;
they have a 3-year-old daughter. Coy also has a son from a previous
relationship. He dropped out of high school, received his GED and
spent a semester taking basics at San Jacinto College in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a businessman, an entrepreneur,'' Coy said.
``What they were trying to teach me, I got it, and that was
teamwork. Everybody has to work as a machine to produce, but to do
that, you have to be a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that philosophy, Coy set out to produce something
that he could call his own: rap music. He formed Coy Entertainment
and its rap subsidiary, Dope House Records.
</P>
<P>
   Coy has released three albums of rhythmic, hard-core rap under
the name South Park Mexican since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's double-disc, ``Power Moves: The Table,'' is his best
work to date, a slick collection of smooth flows and fluid lyrics.
Coy is confident and controlled on the mike. A number of tracks,
including ``West Coast,'' ``Gulf Coast,'' ``East Coast'' and the
bilingual ``Illegal Amigos,'' are as good as any rap hit on the
radio.
</P>
<P>
   South Park Mexican's lyrics deal with everyday life through
Coy's eyes. Mean streets, drugs and gangs are regular themes,
accented by a few four-letter words. There are also lots of
self-references _ ``I've been the South Parker since Welcome Back,
Kotter'' _ and mentions of his Hispanic heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a few rap names, but South Park Mexican stuck,'' Coy
said. ``I knew that there was a hunger ... for Mexicans on the
mike. I use South Park because that's the neighborhood where I
learned a lot of what I rap about, (and) that's where Scarface was
from ... DJ Screw ... Even now Li'l Keke's comin' out of South
Park. I knew it was gonna be something familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   Coy's bilingual music gets virtually no radio play, but through
word-of-mouth and exhausting promotion, he has managed to move
impressive numbers.
</P>
<P>
   According to national figures from Soundscan, ``Hustle Town''
has sold 29,000 units, and ``Power Moves: The Table'' has sold
12,000 since its release in late December.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's selling great right now. He's the hottest thing going in
the Houston vicinity, for sure,'' said Robert Guillerman,
co-founder of Southwest Wholesale, which distributes products to
record stores in the Southwest region.
</P>
<P>
   ``His reputation is that he's the hardest worker in the record
business. Other people might work as hard as him, but nobody can
outwork him. I totally expect that he'll be selling nationally, and
he's totally capable of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Coy Entertainment has been a family affair.
Brother Arthur Jr. put up the initial money and is co-owner; sister
Sylvia handles promotions and bookkeeping; and father Arthur is
SPM's road manger.
</P>
<P>
   To call Coy's beginnings humble is an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked a neighborhood guy if he could make me a few beats. I
was giving away furniture, I gave away my television for beats, and
I wrote to those beats,'' Coy said, referring to the turntable
rhythms and melodies that serve as the base for his music. The
result was his first album, ``Hillwood.'' At the outset, he
produced 100 cassettes for $130.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold them for five bucks ... went to car shows. I used to
make people buy those things. People would give me $5 'cause I just
begged them so long. I went to car washes; I went to club parking
lots.``
</P>
<P>
   These days, Coy doesn't have to take such a grass-roots approach
to getting his music out to the public. Fans and curiosity-seekers
can walk into the local Blockbuster Music or Soundwaves and find
SPM's albums amid titles from DMX, Jay-Z and Foxy Brown. Online
music stores, including CDnow, Music Boulevard and Amazon.com, even
carry his music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised a hustler. &UR;  &LR; When I was 9 and 10 years old, I shot
pool like Fats Domino. We lived by a bar, and that's where I hung
out at all my life. I'm not from a very nice world.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Coy took violin lessons in the fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what really opened me up to music, and it was something
beautiful,'' he said. ``There were white girls in there _ and
Chinese girls and little Mexican girls in there _ who had played
for years, and here's this one Mexican kid, the only male in the
violin class.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior high brought out a different side of Coy, one that often
got into trouble and strayed from study.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when the girls, gangs and grudges popped in,'' Coy
said. ``That's when I was strappin' with everybody, fightin',
acting wild, running with women. Needless to say, my record started
at a very young age.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coy says he was able to veer off that path.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my best songs will be around a negative situation,
but I'm gonna try to find a way to pull out of it by the end of the
song. A man can really only write what he knows, and what I know is
the streets. Every troubled kid can hear my music and rap with me
and get all that out, because that's what I did. I had to write to
get it all out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing from the life that I've lived (is) I can
tell you what it's all about and let you know how you can come out
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In between touring and other projects, Coy speaks at schools and
correctional facilities. Despite his raw lyrics, he sees himself as
a role model for Hispanic kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have Leonardo DiCaprio. They don't have LL Cool J.
I wanna be all those people in one, and I wanna be the very best,''
Coy said. ``I'm gonna put that belief in 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Coy could indeed wind up a major force. Warner Bros. and other
record companies have expressed interest in SPM, but so far, none
have offered the deal Coy is seeking _ one that would offer
distribution for the entire roster of Dope House Records artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a record company,'' Coy said. ``They're taking me as an
artist. I want them to respect me as a record company, and since
we're not hungry, we're gonna continue to prove that we are a
record company.''

   Coy has a roster of local artists ready for release within the
next few months on Dope House, many of whom he has showcased on his
own albums. SPM is also at work on ``The Third Wish,'' a new album
due out this year.

   In the end, Coy seems most comfortable not as a cocky, aspiring
superstar in an Italian suit and rented limo, but as someone simply
given the opportunity to do something more with the cards he was
dealt.

OSCAR NOMINATION A BONUS FOR `CENTRAL STATION' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: An accent mark is needed over e in Josue) 
 
By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time ``Central Station'' was nominated for two major
Academy Awards on Tuesday, director Walter Salles Jr. could hardly
have been surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's biggest hit in Brazil, ``Central Station'' has
become an international success. A major attraction at the Toronto
Film Festival, it had received more than two dozen international
awards before winning the Golden Globe as best foreign-language
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought of winning any prize,'' said Salles, calling
from Sao Paolo, Brazil. ``We only thought to do a film because we
were totally passionate about that story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that happened since we finished the film, every
recognition, is an honor for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Oscar nominations, ``Central Station'' had
joined a short list of Brazilian films that have had a strong
impact in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central Station'' is nominated for best foreign-language film
and best actress, Fernanda Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Without falling into sentimentality, this little road movie
about a sour old woman reluctantly helping a young boy search for
his possibly dead father was among the most profoundly moving films
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Salles, 42, called on a cell phone from a taxi. He had little
faith we would be able to finish a conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in a city where the signal for cell phones is like the
worst in the world. I hope it won't jeopardize our very good
will,`` he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Central Station,'' an aging former teacher, Dora
(Montenegro), makes her living writing letters for illiterate
people in Rio de Janeiro's vast train station. A cynical student of
human nature, she sees most of her clients as liars or fools whose
letters will go unanswered. Most she just throws away.
</P>
<P>
   One client dictates a love letter to her husband, from whom she
is separated, telling him about their 9-year-old son. Moments
later, the woman is hit by a truck, leaving the boy, Josue
(Vinicius de Oliveira), an orphan.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, the woman takes Josue home, thinking she can make a
profit from him. When her scheme backfires, getting her in trouble
with dangerous people, she must leave town. She agrees to help the
boy find his father in Brazil's remote northeast territory.
</P>
<P>
   If you think they're going to become fast and adoring friends,
think again. But Dora and Josue need each other and slowly form a
bond, becoming an unlikely but memorable screen team.
</P>
<P>
   While the movie deals with several cultural problems in Brazil,
including illiteracy and poverty, its themes and appeal are far
more universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tolstoy said the more local you are, the more universal you
might end up being,'' Salles said. ``When you tell a story about a
specific part of the world it might find an echo elsewhere, because
of its realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (make movies) to reach the largest possible audience. To
see that the film can be decoded in different countries such as the
United States or France, is really a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful'' tries to touch the heart
through the more obvious methods of humor and sentimentality.
Salles could have done that in ``Central Station,'' making Dora and
Josue charming. It would have made the film easier to finance, but
less genuine. Although much of the movie's tone was developed as it
was rehearsed and shot, Salles knew from the first he could not
slide into mawkishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a major concern,'' he said. ``We didn't want it
to be sentimental, which is why we wanted Dora to portray the
toughness of the urban chaos in Brazil. The boy had to convey the
difficulty of surviving in such a society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little by little, they discover the importance of affection,
but in doing so they don't lose their original toughness. This is
something we fought for since the very beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran actress Montenegro has won several festival awards for
the role and was also nominated for a Golden Globe. Casting the
crucial role of Josue was almost the downfall of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had done 1,500 tests for a full year prior to finding
Vinicius,'' Salles said. ``We were looking for a boy who knew what
the battle for survival in the streets of Rio meant, but had not
lost his innocence in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, totally by chance in the airport of Rio, a shoe-shine
boy came up to talk to me. I was really amazed by the density of
his eyes and the way he was so expressive. We started to talk, and
more and more I was under the impact of his physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him to do a film test, and he said that was impossible
because he had never been to the movies. Finally he came to this
test and was so brilliant and so intuitive that we all knew he was
the kid who had to do this role. ''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers of ``Central Station'' often come away concerned about
its young star, especially if they remember the fate of Fernando
Ramos da Silva, the child star of ``Pixote'' (1980), another
Brazilian film that became a U.S. hit. After brief stardom, da
Silva returned to the slums of Sao Paulo, where he was killed by
police at age 20.
</P>
<P>
   Salles is convinced Vinicius will have a different fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``His personal story is totally different,'' said Salles. ``He
is not a street kid. He comes from a (poor but) solid family with a
mother who is very present. He's got a home, a really solid
education; he knew how to read and write. He's got four brothers
and sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's production company is paying for the the boy's
education and his family's housing through his college years.
Vinicius is also introducing a daily TV show for children, and
considering other movie roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' has long been considered this year's front
runner for the foreign film Academy Award, but ``Central Station''
has to be considered a strong contender, too. If it does not win,
however, Salles can take comfort in knowing he has made a memorable
film that has touched hearts worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should not hope to do a film with anything but passion and
integrity,'' Salles said. ``What happens after that is just a
result. If (success) happens, it's for the best. If it doesn't, it
shouldn't change your life.''

 &HT;    Bad habits ingrained with TAAS formulas
 &HT;    (EDS: Part 3 of 4)
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ As a parent of two children in public schools, I
can attest to the time they've spent on spelling. Indeed, in the
elementary grades my sons likely have spent more homework time on
spelling lists than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I've seen enough student writing to know this:
Grade-schoolers who memorize ``trapezoid'' and ``parallelogram''
will turn around and treat ``there'' and ``their'' as the same
words, ``are'' and ``our'' as interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? A contributing factor is the Texas Assessment of
Academic Skills. And bad spelling isn't the only bad habit it helps
promote.
</P>
<P>
   Even good students today are abysmal spellers. But there is a
solution. It's the simplest solution in the world. The Texas
Education Agency doesn't have to research it. Merriam-Webster has
done it already.
</P>
<P>
   Take a dictionary, place it in the hand of a child. Tell the
child, ``Use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Make spelling count on TAAS and Texas' children will spell
better. Guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't spelling already count on TAAS? Sort of. Graders are
instructed to penalize students for glaring and repetitive
misspellings. But no one can memorize every word. You need a
dictionary. And having a ``secure'' testing environment means no
reference materials, no asking the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's stupid. Good writing needs reference materials. A
good speller doesn't memorize every word. A good speller is one who
knows when to check the dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   The TAAS writing section is administered in grades four, eight
and 10. Within a time allotment, students produce a composition
based on a prompt.
</P>
<P>
   What gets graded is an ``unpolished draft,'' according to
Victoria Young, who coordinates TAAS composition for the TEA.
</P>
<P>
   What about making spelling count, letting students refer to
dictionaries? State testing czar Keith Cruse said it's an option
TEA ``will look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas policymakers should know that nothing would have a more
immediate benefit to English composition in Texas than children
getting intimate with dictionaries. They would if TAAS passage were
in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Another serious TAAS-related problem is the tendency of some
teachers to drill students on formulas reputed to ace the writing
test.
</P>
<P>
   These formulas, one of which is as prolific as ragweed in Waco,
involve the counting of words, the counting of lines, and the use
of empty, self-evident introductory phrases like: ``I'm going to
tell you about...'' followed by numbing redundancies:
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing to do is...''
</P>
<P>
   ``The second thing to do is...''
</P>
<P>
   ``The third thing to do is...''
</P>
<P>
   It's hideous writing. But educators across the state are
convinced: It passes TAAS. They'll wave the test scores your way if
you doubt them. Indeed, TAAS writing test scores are rising. But to
what end?
</P>
<P>
   College writing instructors find themselves ``unteaching'' these
habits which have been hammered into young heads in the most
glaring of all examples of ``teaching the test.''
</P>
<P>
   Good writing is not rote conditioning that adds up to a desired
number of lines. Good writing is the use of words to effect.
</P>
<P>
   When I described this syndrome to three TEA experts in Austin
last week, they reacted like good educators ought to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes for abysmal writing and it's not educationally
responsible,'' said Young. Maybe these formulas can help unlock
writing skills for students frozen in the bottom 10 percent. For
the other 90 percent, it's a disservice.
</P>
<P>
   If Texas can't have a state writing test that reinforces good
habits, it shouldn't have any. Right now, even with TAAS writing
scores rising, it doesn't.

CLINTON LAUNCHING FUND-RAISING CAMPAIGN FOR DEMOCRATIC HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is planning a fund-raising event
in San Francisco on Feb. 25 to launch a nationwide fund-raising
drive to help Democrats reclaim control of the House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The president's appearance is part of a drive entitled
``Majority 2000'' that seeks to raise $10 million in 1999 to help
Democrats overcome the six-seat edge that Republicans have in the
435-member House.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the event in San Francisco will be used by the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to recruit and finance
Democratic candidates for the House, and by the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee that helps Democrats running for the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco fund raiser will be followed by fund raising
events in eight other cities. White House officials said that
president's schedule has not yet been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Barry Toiv denied that
Clinton is targeting individual House Republicans who have led the
year-long effort to impeach the chief executive and remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led House voted two articles of impeachment
against Clinton on Dec. 19. The Senate is expected to vote to
acquit the president of perjury and obstruction of justice charges
in connection with the sex-and-cover-up scandal involving former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's goal is the same as before _ to elect
Democrats who can help enact the Democrats agenda to protect Social
Security, strengthen education and expand health care,'' Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Clinton will work in the next two years to elect
Democrats to Congress just as he has in every election since he
captured the White House in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, embroiled in the Lewinsky sex scandal last fall, helped
raise millions of dollars for Democratic campaign efforts at a
series of invitation-only fund raisers. But the president kept his
public campaigning on behalf of candidates to a minimum, in an
effort to avoid injecting the scandal into local congressional
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Toiv said that the White House learned from past efforts on
behalf of Democrats that ``you need to go out early, recruit good
candidates and raise money.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged to help Democrats regain control of the House at
a Democratic retreat with House Democrats at Wintergreen, Va., on
Tuesday. Clinton's stepped up commitment follows a decision by
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., to forego a
threatened challenge of Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats scored major gains in the House in last
November's election, narrowing the margin of Republican control to
six seats. Republicans won control of the House and Senate in 1994
for the first time in 40 years, in an election widely viewed as a
repudiation of Clinton's leadership and his failed effort to
overhaul the nation's public and private health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also plans to attend a fund raising event in Los Angeles
on Feb. 26 before joining his wife to attend parent's weekend at
Stanford University, in Palo Alto, Calif., where the couple's
daughter Chelsea is a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's two day parents' weekend drew a record 3,000 parents
to the Stanford campus, university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Stanford newsletter to parents said that one of the most
popular events from last year's weekend was the ``Back to School''
lectures for parents and students that featured subjects such as
``Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers,'' the demise of communism and the
future solvency of Social Security.

BOMB-SHELTER COMEDY MISFIRES ONCE ABOVE GROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 1/2 STARS 
 
 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's October 1962. Cuban Missile Crisis. Nutty
professor Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) and his pregnant wife,
Helen (Sissy Spacek), are throwing a swinging cocktail party when
JFK comes on television and informs the nation of the dire
situation. The guests put down their martinis and Rob Roys long
enough to absorb the news, and Calvin abruptly calls the evening to
an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to keep a prayerful watch-and-wait stance,''
he intones grimly.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin, though, has ideas that go way beyond watching and
waiting. Underneath his kitschy suburban tract home, Calvin has
built the world's most elaborate bomb shelter, equipped with a
supermarket-style food storage room, trout farm and lawn chairs
that look up to a blue concrete sky. Once his guests leave, Calvin
ushers Helen underground and closes the hatch to wait for news.
</P>
<P>
   Then a funny thing happens. A jet fighter plane crashes into the
Webbers' San Fernando Valley home, completely destroying it. Down
in the shelter, Calvin and Helen hear the explosion and mistake it
for the end of the world. Ever vigilant, Calvin activates the
safety mechanism on the shelter's doors, locking them for 35 years.
(``By then the radiation will have dissipated and we'll be safe,''
he says.)
</P>
<P>
   That's the setup for ``Blast From the Past,'' a halfway decent
comedy that's funny and inventive as long as it keeps its
sensibility rooted in the Cocktail Culture. But once the Webbers'
son grows up (Helen gives birth to a boy in the shelter) and leaves
his Cold War cocoon for supplies, the movie becomes standard
fish-out-of-water fare, losing most of its appeal in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Webbers' son, Adam (Brendan Fraser, doing another variation
of the wide-eyed innocent from ``George of the Jungle'' and ``Still
Breathing''), ventures into the 1990s world with a 1960s
sensibility. So while rap music blares all around him,
straight-arrow Adam whistles along with Perry Como. While others
strike cynical poses, Adam is unabashedly optimistic and trusting.
And while a street-smart young woman, named, naturally enough, Eve
(Alicia Silverstone), spends her time angry about the past, Adam is
simply happy to have a future that includes the possibility of a
girlfriend. (Guess who?)
</P>
<P>
   ``Blast From the Past'' works best when it's down in the bunker,
spoofing Calvin's Cold War paranoia and cleverly imagining what 35
years underground would do to a family. But once the film enters
the present day, it runs out of energy and ideas. The screenplay,
by director Hugh Wilson and Bill Kelly, doesn't clash Adam's basic
decency with today's culture in any interesting or creative ways.
Fraser is left to basically speak VERY LOUDLY and wonder why other
people think he's weird.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the romance between Adam and Eve is as formulaic as
the selection of their names. Another subplot, involving the owner
of the property directly over the bomb shelter, is irritating and
stupid and takes the movie nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser remains an appealing and gifted performer, but he has had
better material before. Silverstone displays little of the charm
that made her so captivating in ``Clueless.'' Much better is Dave
Foley, Eve's gay roommate who engagingly helps Adam make sense of
the modern world. Unfortunately, the filmmakers didn't have a
similar presence to help them add a little more fun and originality
to this disappointing film. &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

`MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE' IS HALF-EMPTY, HALF-FULL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 STARS  
 &HT;     By ROB LOWMAN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Somewhere as you're drifting through the first
third of ``Message in a Bottle,'' you start thanking some higher
power _ or at least some studio executive _ for not casting Julia
Roberts in the role of Theresa Osborne, a love-shy divorcee with a
young child.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily we have Robin Wright Penn, who adds some weight to a
role that would likely float away with Roberts' cloying style.
</P>
<P>
   Picking Wright Penn instead of Roberts is one of the smart
choices by ``Message's'' makers. But for every plus there is a
minus.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Nicholas Sparks' best-selling novel of the same title,
``Message'' begins with Theresa, a researcher for the Chicago
Tribune, finding a bottle with a letter in it addressed to
``Catherine'' and just signed ``G,'' while on a walk on a Cape Cod
beach. Theresa, who is on vacation alone while her ex-husband
watches their son, is taken by the force of the letter's romantic
words. When she returns to her job, she is determined to find the
letter's writer and convinces her boss, a high-powered columnist
(Robbie Coltrane), that there might be a story in the bottle's
origin.
</P>
<P>
   (It's nice to have an understanding boss. Of course, as you're
watching this, you're wondering how you get a job where you do so
little actual work and seem to get paid so well. But we digress
into reality, and this a romantic fantasy.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Theresa discovers that there are other bottles with
messages and tracks the source to the outer banks in North Carolina
and a widower, Garrett (Kevin Costner). It's Garrett who has been
throwing the bottles into the ocean as messages to his late wife.
His in-laws blame him for her death, and, to make matters worse,
the still-grieving Garrett has left her art studio untouched,
setting off a feud with them over ownership of her paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa goes down to meet Garrett and (surprise) falls in love
with him. With two wounded birds like this, of course,
complications are bound to ensue. Recounting more of the
Harlequin-novel-style plot would be a silly exercise _ just think
sudsy.
</P>
<P>
   But, as mentioned, ``Message'' has pluses as well as minuses; so
let's add them up.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side: Paul Newman as Garrett's recovering alcoholic
dad. His rascally charm helps breathe life into the film.
</P>
<P>
   On the minus side: Paul Newman as Garrett's recovering alcoholic
dad. Newman can play this role in his sleep. It would have been
nice to give him more challenges. (A better script would help.)
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side: Wright Penn. She doesn't play with her hair.
You believe her as a mother.
</P>
<P>
   On the minus side: Kevin Costner. Mr. ``Postman'' isn't
terrible, but he isn't compelling enough to make romance fans line
up at the box office. Put him in a comedy or an action flick, but
he's too affable to be a silent, edgy sex symbol. Robert Redford
could have done this role 20 years ago in his sleep. (They would
have wanted Newman as his partner, though.) Redford can speak
volumes with one of his stares; Costner just looks like he's zoned
out.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side: some terrific actors in the supporting cast,
including John Savage, Illeana Douglas and Robbie Coltrane. It's
always nice to see them in a movie.
</P>
<P>
   On the minus side: some terrific actors in the supporting cast,
including John Savage, Illeana Douglas and Robbie Coltrane, who
have nothing to do.
</P>
<P>
   So, where are we? Plus, plus, plus. Minus, minus, minus. Oh
let's just call it a wash.!end! &QL;

OUR RATING: 2 1/2 STARS &HT;     
By MARLA MATZER

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Calling ``My Favorite Martian'' one of the more
entertaining TV comedy-to-film translations would be damning with
faint praise. Other than a few sly reworkings such as ``The Brady
Bunch'' and ``The Addams Family,'' the results have been pretty
dismal.
</P>
<P>
   But if all you expect of ``Martian'' is for it to be a mildly
diverting entertainment, you shouldn't be disappointed. It's
briskly paced and provides a number of genuine laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of this movie's audience probably wouldn't have
been born when the TV series went off the air in 1966. Suffice it
to say that while the basic premise is the same _ reporter
encounters Martian who's crashed on Earth, Martian takes on human
form and refuses to reveal his alien identity to others _ the movie
has received a total update.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Daniels' character Tim O'Hara, now a TV journalist rather
than a print reporter, stumbles across a Martian spaceship wreck.
He unwittingly drives home with the craft and its pilot _ played
with trademark wild-eyed intensity by Christopher Lloyd _ in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's shtick is greatly enhanced through the use of special
effects. Some are more special than others. Scenes where Uncle
Martin, as he becomes known, morphs into other people are
impressive. On the other hand, a running gag in which his spacesuit
takes on a life of its own is tiresome. It seems a slightly
desperate attempt to make Lloyd a younger, Jim Carrey-like sidekick
without the Jim Carrey-like price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two sexy female co-stars _ Elizabeth Hurley and Daryl
Hannah _ Hurley in particular displays a fine comic flair as Brace
Channing, a rich, spoiled and hyper-ambitious news anchor. Channing
shows no interest in the smitten O'Hara until she realizes he's
sitting on a gold mine with the Martian story. She then sets out to
seduce him, at the same time that the sweet camera operator Lizzie
(Hannah) has fallen for O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran character actor Wallace Shawn plays a prototypically
nerdy scientist, who, like Channing, is intent on outing the
Martian. While there's nothing really new about the character,
Shawn milks it well.
</P>
<P>
   The other winning character role belongs to Ray Walston, the
original Uncle Martin. His fleeting appearances as a government bad
guy seem to be a gratuitous in-joke until the end, when Armitan
reveals himself to be ... well, we won't spoil the surprise. But
just as he's done in shows from ``Damn Yankees'' to ``Picket
Fences,'' Walston nearly steals the show.

WHEN MELODY MEANS MONEY

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You hear it all the time _ the money in music is
in publishing.
</P>
<P>
   So, we called Les Bider, chairman and chief executive officer of
Warner/Chappell Music, the world's largest music publisher, to
explain why.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based Warner/Chappell, which counts 56 nominations
in this year's Grammy Awards, including those of Sheryl Crow and
Madonna, owns rights to songs and licenses tunes for records,
radio, TV, movies, commercials, toys and games.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that last category _ toys and games _ is fast becoming
one of the most lucrative markets for songs. Among the
biggest-selling toys around the world last Christmas was a dancing
Santa that played ``Jingle Bell Rock,'' an ice-skating ``Winter
Wonderland'' and a Frosty the Snowman that played its namesake
tune.
</P>
<P>
   Warner/Chappell _ which paid a reported $25 million for a
catalog that included ``Happy Birthday to You'' in 1990 _ also sold
a heck of a lot of ``Macarena'' toys a few years ago, Bider said.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 10 years or so, there's been substantial
activity in the buying and selling of music catalogs.
Warner/Chappell, whose nearest competitor is EMI, owns about 1
million song titles.
</P>
<P>
   Among Warner/Chappell's copyrights is Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in
Blue,'' the theme of the current United Airlines campaign, and Sly
Stone's ``Everyday People,'' used in Toyota commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals were worth nearly $1 million each, split between the
publisher and composer, Bider said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a song that hasn't been hot for many years can
sometimes bounce back with a lucrative new life. &UR;

VALENTINE ETIQUETTE: TIPS TO MAKE YOUR DAY SIZZLE, NOT FIZZLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  ``Love is a fire. But whether it is going to warm your hearth or
burn down your house, you can never tell.'' 
 
_ Hollywood screen legend Joan Crawford 
 
By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ You'd think that a day devoted to love would be a snap
to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's Day is a minefield of potential calamities just
waiting to blow up no matter where you stand on the
relationship/love spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   It's a day when great expectations often turn to deep
disappointment. The gift is wildly extravagant or inappropriate;
the card is too generic or too intense; you didn't do enough to
celebrate; you did too much.
</P>
<P>
   Here's some advice: Chill out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're getting too worried, you're somehow missing the
point. This is supposed to be all about love and caring and
connecting with someone else in a joyful way,'' says psychologist
Sally Porter Ross. ``As long as your intent is good, you can work
through anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but the day will flow a lot easier if you know the
proper etiquette for V-Day. Here are some guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   _ Do something.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be in a heap of trouble if you let the holiday pass
without putting some thought into how to celebrate it.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Schwartz, a relationship author who has been studying the
holiday for a decade, says the No. 1 reason women give for being
disappointed with Valentine's Day is their significant other ``does
too little, and he does it too late.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Men don't realize how important this day is to most women,''
says Schwartz. ``It's the one time of year he can show up romantic
again.''
</P>
<P>
   He says most men are romantic at the beginning of a
relationship. But as time passes, they forget it is an ``important
goal'' for their significant other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women want to improve the man's romantic performance.
Most guys want to improve their sexual performance. We have to sort
of combine the two,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   _ But don't convey false intentions.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent Valentine's Day, a Houston man thought he had
bought his girlfriend the right present: A diamond dinner ring.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem came when she opened the gift while they were
dining out and began shrieking, ``Yes, I'll marry you!''
</P>
<P>
   To her, it looked like an engagement ring because she assumed
they were on the brink of marriage. He had no such intentions and
didn't let the moment pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, I didn't mean that,'' he whispered.
</P>
<P>
   The couple broke up soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Porter Ross suggests that anyone in a semi-serious relationship
clarify his or her intentions beforehand so the date doesn't
degenerate into the ``Valentine's Day From Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The day takes on a lot of significance. Whatever you
experience will be experienced in capital letters,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't send an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by Southwestern Bell, 87 percent of
women and 77 percent of men who use the Internet plan to send an
e-mail greeting card to their sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say that's not a good idea, particularly if romantic
musings are sent to the office, where co-workers may catch a
glimpse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember you're not the only one who is going to
read it, so nothing with passion in it should be sent by e-mail,''
says Houston etiquette expert Annie Cater. ``The only safe way is
to write a letter, seal it and mail it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ But a card is fine, as long as it's personalized.
</P>
<P>
   Just picking a card out is really not enough, unless you add at
least a few well-chosen words about what the person means to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valentine's Day is the one time you can be very, very personal
with your handwriting,'' says stationer John Ludlam. ``It's the
time to look around and be thankful for the special people in your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes a favorite teacher or friends. Cater sends small
Valentine cards such as those schoolchildren exchange to all her
adult friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think it's fun,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   After Ludlam's mother died, he began to send Valentines to his
sisters just as she did while she was alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept up the family tradition,'' he says. ``I felt so good
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   For couples who may be in the early stages of a relationship, an
affectionate yet humorous card may be a way to tell a person he or
she is special without laying everything on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can ease things if you're not sure how serious or intense
the relationship is,'' says Porter Ross.
</P>
<P>
   In such a situation, she recommends keeping two sets of gifts or
cards on hand _ one lighthearted and one with a more romantic
intent _ and wait to see what your intended gives you first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can whip out the one that best suits the situation,'' she
says. ``In that way, you haven't put yourself out there to look
like a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Write a poem.
</P>
<P>
   Striking out on your own with a few lines is particularly
thoughtful. But if the spirit doesn't move you, it's OK to copy a
few lines of a favorite love poem _ as long as you credit the
source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you don't have to speak for yourself,'' says Ed Hirsch, a
poet and professor in the Creative Writing Program at the
University of Houston. ``You also have Shakespeare on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   _ And read it out loud.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch, who has written a book of poems titled ``On Love,''
says, ``If you feel rapturous about your beloved, testify to that
fact. Lyrical poetry is a wonderful way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're stumped for a way to begin, take a couple of lines
from a Hirsch poem titled ``Gertrude Stein,'' that starts like
this: ``Love happens to be an astonishing state, a state in which
all of us are astonished.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't tell your honey not to buy you anything and get upset
when he or she doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to gift-giving on Valentine's Day, ``no'' often
means ``yes.'' More than one woman has told her significant other
not to buy a gift and then gotten miffed when nothing appears on
Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   It may not make sense, but it seems to be a fact of life. ``The
etiquette is that gifts are always accepted, even when you say
they're not,'' says Cater.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't buy a nice gift for your significant other and charge it
to your joint account.
</P>
<P>
   One woman got a beautiful silk nightgown from her husband for
Valentine's Day and was thrilled about how thoughtful he was _
until the bill came a few weeks later. To make matters worse, it
was on their joint account, so she had to write the check for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe how much he paid for it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't even consider the ``I'm Broke'' excuse.
</P>
<P>
   One rose on a pillow can be as thoughtful as three dozen in a
vase. Two pieces of a favorite chocolate can mean as much as a
5-pound box. If you can't afford champagne or your lover doesn't
drink, be creative. Schwartz says his wife loves melted ice cream,
so he serves it to her in a champagne glass.
</P>
<P>
   The key, he says, is to do something ``way beyond'' what your
significant other expects you to do.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking a meal at home or including a card with a promise for a
future date without the kids can still make the day special.
Showering him or her with a lot of little things can make a much
bigger impact than one impersonal gift that costs a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't give anything that plugs in.
</P>
<P>
   Unless it's for pleasure. Practical gifts, like kitchen
appliances, won't get you points on Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, giving an intimate gift, like lingerie, can
be tricky. Underwear should only be given in an intimate
relationship and opened privately. And you must make sure it's the
right size or risk the wrath of your sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   Safer choices are pearls, a picture frame with your photo or the
dogs' or the kids', favorite candy in a velvet box or a Dopp kit,
and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Valentine's Day is on Sunday this year, many
florists are delivering to homes on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't drink too much.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing puts a damper on an amorous evening more than drinking
too much. Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take charge.
</P>
<P>
   If you know the other person is not planning anything for V-Day,
don't sulk. Instead, make the plans yourself. In that way, you'll
get exactly the kind of romantic holiday you want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women would rather be right than happy,'' says Schwartz.
``Why set it up to be a bad situation? This is the one time of the
year you have an excuse to rekindle the passion in the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Cater recalls one memorable Valentine's Day when she and several
friends planned a dinner party for their sweethearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We women all did it. We all chipped in and sent them
invitations for dinner and gave them crazy gifts. It was fun,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cast a spell.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, and your true love still hasn't caught the
V-Day fever, try casting the ``Old Dog, New Tricks'' spell from
``The Little Book of Love Spells'' (Andrews McMeel, $9.95).
</P>
<P>
   Wave a yellow candle over a piece of new black lingerie and
chant, ``Our love has grown, our love is strong. The spark's died
down and that is wrong. Again like new love it will be; New joy and
lust immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Then when your honey comes home, put on the lingerie, light the
candle and whisper the chant again.
</P>
<P>
   And have a spellbinding evening.
</P>

`BLAST' DIRECTOR, ACTORS MAKE A COMEDY WITH MANNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
 
 &HT;    By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Blast From the Past'' looks like another one of
those Brendan Fraser fish-out-of-water comedies, where some guy
from a simpler place finds himself adrift in a big, bad, modern
city.
</P>
<P>
   And it is. But unlike ``Encino Man'' and ``George of the
Jungle,'' ``Blast'' has something to say along with its broad
physical humor and culture clash gags. And what it has to say is
remarkably refreshing for a light, youth-aimed comedy: that good
manners never go out of style, most especially in these rudest of
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they ever leave?'' Fraser, himself an archetypally polite
Canadian, asks rhetorically. ``I would argue that people have
always felt the past was more genteel, no matter what age of
history they were in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a very simple and basic premise of what it means
to be a gentleman,'' adds the 31-year-old actor, ``and that is a
person who endeavors to make others as comfortable as possible at
all times. Those are words to live by, and that's something I
definitely learned from this.''
</P>
<P>
   The funniest thing about ``Blast From the Past'' is, arguably,
an accident of political history. The film, which was written by
director Hugh Wilson (``The First Wives Club'') and Bill Kelly, was
conceived as a satire of a previous political era _ the early-'60s
peak of Cold War paranoia. But now it's inadvertently become a
lesson in proper behavior at a time when our elected politicians,
who once were addressed as ``distinguished gentlemen,''
pathologically act like anything but.
</P>
<P>
   What if, the scenario goes, during the 1962 Cuban Missile
Crisis, a brilliant scientist (Christopher Walken's Calvin Webber)
locked himself and his pregnant wife (Sissy Spacek's Helen) in the
super-deluxe, underground bomb shelter he'd built for just such an
occasion _ and for the next 3{ decades.
</P>
<P>
   When, according to Calvin's calculations, the surface radiation
would have subsided sufficiently to permit habitation, he
reconnoiters the world above. To his shock, the vicinity of his
former San Fernando Valley home is now crawling with mutants _ or,
at least, with the flamboyant kind of '90s denizens the straitlaced
'60s suburbanite can register only as freaks.
</P>
<P>
   But the Webbers are running out of supplies, so they're forced
to send their strapping, 35-year-old son, Adam (Fraser), on a
provisions hunt. Impeccably well-raised and thoroughly uninfluenced
by the Beatles, Donald Trump, Beavis &AMP; Butt-head or any other
pop-culture demon.
</P>
<P>
   Adam immediately gets himself lost in L.A., then found by tough
cookie Eve Rostokov (Alicia Silverstone). Initially pitying the
naive lug, savvy but love-scarred Eve gradually grows fond of his
awkwardly gallant ways.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't only work in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's essential to be a gentleman these days, and I thought it
was wonderful to get that message out in the world,'' says original
``Clueless'' princess Silverstone. ``When I read the script, I fell
in love with Adam's character because he is just this dreamboat.''
</P>
<P>
   And Brendan Fraser was playing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I was little, my lawyer told me she had
Brendan Fraser as a client,'' Silverstone recalls. ``I said, `Oh
yeah? Can you set me up with him?' And she said, `No! It's illegal.
You're 15.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `God! Stupid lawyer!' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   When they finally did spend some time together, Fraser was not
about to take advantage of the now-legal Silverstone. He just isn't
that sort of guy. Besides, he was otherwise engaged: Brendan and
Afton Fraser were married last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But could there be any doubt that he was a felicitous co-worker?
</P>
<P>
   ``Brendan is a very sweet, nice guy,'' Silverstone affirms,
``and what was lovely about working with him was that he was
responsible for himself and respectful of the fact that I needed to
do my own thing. I like that, rather than having this false
camaraderie that can come up among people who are only going to
work together for a few weeks. There was none of that pretense with
Brendan.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser returns the compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find Alicia charming and warm and so friendly and real,'' he
says. ``I find that, when I act, I tend to take in all the
information and ponder every single point. But she can look at all
the information and just get the point. She listens with every pore
on her body when she acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken the wrong way, that could be a line from director Wilson's
``Police Academy'' slob farce. The filmmaker is not known for
finding chuckles in polite places. ``First Wives'' hit it big with
angry, vengeful humor. And the popular TV sitcom he created, ``WKRP
in Cincinnati,'' was considered smart but hardly well-behaved.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Blast From the Past'' gave the filmmaker a chance to prove
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay in touch with an English teacher I had in high school
who's now, like, 90,'' explains Wilson, 54. ``She told me once,
`What I feel so sorry about for anyone who does comedy today is
that you can't do a comedy of manners anymore, because no one has
any!'
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what she meant, but I think it's always lurking around.
These things come and go; progress goes on a straight, forward arc,
but style and such is a pendulum that goes back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is something of a gent himself. Definitely a gentleman
farmer, and a good neighbor. He gave Oscar winner Spacek, whose
back fence borders his own Virginia spread, the first straight
comedy role of her career in ``Blast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had so much fun doing this,'' says the actress famous for
playing Loretta Lynn in ``Coal Miner's Daughter'' and being covered
in pig blood for ``Carrie.'' ``I mean, it's so silly. This was just
such a departure, and I basically had no idea what I was doing. But
it was nice not to be typecast.''
</P>
<P>
   One drawback, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe it all to Hugh, my neighbor,'' she says appreciatively.
``But you know, I really had to behave myself because, my God, I
have to live by the guy! I had to be on time, professional,
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Walken is an actor few associate with either comedy or
good behavior, at least not since, as he tells it, ``my depraved
thing started in `Annie Hall''' 22 years ago. Since then, Walken
has essayed an outstanding gallery of mostly creeps, killers,
psychos and suicidals (the one he played in ``The Deer Hunter''
earned him an Academy Award).
</P>
<P>
   But Walken claims that he has long looked forward to playing a
nice guy in the movies. Calvin Webber is as close as he's gotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain kind of logic behind what Calvin does,'' he
explains. ``He has the money, the resources and also the
temperament to take his wife and child underground in this utopian
setting of his own design.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's bountifully equipped, '60s luxe shelter is indeed as
comfortable a place as anyone could want to spend 35 years locked
within. If they felt they had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to leave there, he's got everything he
wants,'' Walken notes. ``He's a good father, a good husband, a nice
man, gifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a little wacky.''
</P>
<P>
   But he certainly raised a fine boy. Fraser sees Adam as another
one of the angelic innocents he's drawn to playing: the prehistoric
Encino Man, George of the Jungle and his Canadian cartoon cousin
Dudley Do-Right, whom Fraser just finished playing in a movie
directed by his new friend and respected collaborator, Hugh Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call them clones of each other, but they do have
this sense of a time bubble around them,'' he says of the comic
roles. ``They all could have literally tumbled down from the sky
and plopped down in the middle of a world that is new and
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a nice allusion to draw, thank you,'' he tells a
reporter who suggested the connection. Then Fraser mentions ``Gods
and Monsters,'' the critically acclaimed drama for which his
co-stars Ian McKellen and Lynn Redgrave were just nominated for
Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bit of Clay Boone, who I play in the movie, along
that way, too,'' he says. ``And you know, that role was ...''
</P>
<P>
   The interviewee pauses, like he's just noticed he's been talking
much too ungraciously much about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, wasn't Ian McKellen brilliant in `Gods and
Monsters'?'' &UR;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hearst Magazines and Miramax Films announced Thursday
that they will jointly publish Talk, a new general interest monthly
magazine edited by Tina Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine will debut in August with the September edition.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Magazines, the world's largest publisher of monthly
magazines, will take a 50 percent joint-ownership stake in Talk
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst will be responsible for circulation and manufacturing
management, as well as newsstand distribution and subscriptions.
Miramax's Talk Media will be responsible for editorial content,
advertising sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Talk magazine, which will premiere with a circulation of
500,000, will feature commentary, criticism, reporting, opinion and
profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Miramax Films established Talk Media in conjunction
with Tina Brown and Ron Galotti to publish Talk magazine, produce
television programming and publish books. The venture with Hearst
Magazines is limited to Talk magazine and its related Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fantastic partnership,'' said Harvey Weinstein,
co-chairman of Miramax Films. He credited Michael Eisner, Disney
chairman and CEO, and Peter Murphy at Disney for putting the deal
together.
</P>
<P>
   Cathleen P. Black, president of Hearst Magazines, predicted that
Talk magazine will be ``a real blockbuster.'' She said Talk
management aims to make it ``one of the nation's most-read
magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner said the strengths of both partners in the joint venture
add up to ``a potent combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank A. Bennack, Jr., president and CEO of The Hearst
Corporation, commented, ``A partnership of this kind between movie
and publishing giants is very exciting to us. It fits very well in
Hearst's overall strategy to enhance the size and strength of our
magazine business, which today encompasses 112 editions worldwide
in more than 100 countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Brown, chairman of Miramax's Talk Media, said she hoped to
``establish Talk as one of the most widely read and one of the most
influential magazines in the marketplace today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has a number of relationships with Disney, the parent
company of Miramax Films and ABC, including A&AMP;E Television Networks
(a Hearst joint venture with ABC and NBC); Lifetime Entertainment
Services (a Hearst joint venture with ABC); ESPN Inc. (a Hearst
minority ownership arrangement with ABC); ESPN magazine (which is
distributed by Hearst), and Birnbaum's Official Guides to Walt
Disney World and Disneyland, jointly published by Hearst and
Hyperion, which is owned by Disney.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hearst-Argyle Television, of which Hearst is the
majority shareholder, is the largest affiliate group of the ABC
Television Network.

NEW DVDS SHOW SEX ON THE EDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
 
 &HT;    By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As you may have seen earlier in the week, a number
of people in this country don't like sex. A survey, led by
University of Chicago researchers, said that a growing number of
Americans are sexually dysfunctional. Nowhere, however, did it
mention that seeing ``Last Tango in Paris,'' ``Damage'' or
``Crash'' might be cash.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this trio of films are among the strongest and most
provocative cinematic meditations on the subject of sex. But
whether they are erotic or not is the question. The eroticism in
the films is often intertwined with brutality, perversity and
death, and for some, perhaps, enough to put those in the audience
off sex.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly valentines to love, the three have recently been released
on DVD and include the unrated versions of the films. And despite
their flaws, the filmmakers were willing to push the envelope of
cinema and deserve an audience. The adult subject matter is just
that _ adult, not childish titillation dressed up. (By the way, if
you saw the R-rated versions, the uncut versions are unlikely to
shock you.)
</P>
<P>
   The 1972 ``Last Tango'' was hailed at the time as a
revolutionary film by influential critic Pauline Kael. (``The most
powerfully erotic movie ever made,'' she gushed.) Directed by
Bernardo Bertolucci (``The Last Emperor'') and starring Marlon
Brando, the film was expected to lead to an adult art cinema.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't, of course. Instead we have an overkill of teen
movies, perhaps the real reason there is a rise in sexual
dysfunction. But Kael was right on one point: ``Tango'' remains a
powerful movie.
</P>
<P>
   But erotic? Hmmm ... that is the question all three films are
asking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tango'' certainly has the veneer of erotica with its sultry
sax score by Gato Barbieri, but the story of the middle-aged Paul
(Brando) and 20-something Jeanne (Maria Schneider) belies that. The
couple meet by chance in an empty Paris apartment. Paul's wife has
recently committed suicide. Jeanne is on the verge of marriage.
Paul and Jeanne are instinctually drawn together without knowing
each other's names and have brutal, impersonal sex. Their
continuing relationship _ if you call it that _ only exists within
those empty walls. Anonymity is what they crave. They want to lose
themselves in the realm of the senses, even if that world isn't
pleasurable.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Malle's ``Damage'' (1993) tells the story of an
extramarital affair between a married, middle-age politician
(Jeremy Irons) and his son's fiancee (Juliette Binoche). As the
pair keep the facade of normal lives _ he the loving, doting
husband, she the bride-to-be _ their clandestine affair grows more
obsessive and weird. Sex for them is not about pleasure or the
erotic but release. There is a brutal, sadomasochistic edge to it
that stems from the restraints they feel in the normalcy of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   David Cronenberg's ``Crash'' (1996) undoubtedly is the most
difficult of the three to sit through. A movie of bruised flesh,
shiny metal, flashing ambulance lights and gruesome, perverse sex,
the story revolves around a group of people who are sexually
aroused by car crashes. Based on a book by J.G. Ballard (``Empire
of the Sun''), the film is more than an exploration of sex and
death (one character re-creates famous and fatal crashes like James
Dean's). It's a trip into the forbidden _ voyeurism, fetishism and
cinematic violent nightmares. Does cold chrome turn you on?
``Crash'' is unrelenting, but that is also its strength.
</P>
<P>
   The DVDs of the films offer the usual niceties (theatrical
trailers, etc.). And you have the option of choosing the R-rated
version on ``Crash'' and ``Damage,'' the latter of the two also
having an interview with the late Malle, one of the greatest
directors of the past 50 years.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Who would have thought that Evil's favorite song
is ``I'm a Little Teapot''? You figure it would have been something
from Michael Bolton.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be reminded of watching the chilling gasoline scene in
``Reservoir Dogs'' and never again being able to listen in comfort
to the Stealers Wheel song ``Stuck in the Middle with You.''
</P>
<P>
   You will forever get a chill from the children's ditty
``Teapot'' after watching ``Stephen King's Storm of the Century''
on ABC. Spread out over three nights (Sunday, Monday and Thursday
at 9 p.m. EST, check local listings), the six-hour ``Storm of the
Century'' ranks among the most terrifying of King's
made-for-television works. This may be in part because King himself
wrote the miniseries, a first, rather than having one of his books
adapted for television.
</P>
<P>
   This novel for television (a book has been released to coincide
with the miniseries) will stick with you for days, a morality tale
where in the end a choice must be made between two answers, both
right and both horribly wrong. You will mull what you would have
done long after you shut off your bedroom light Thursday and try
fitfully to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Little Tall Island (you remember: Dolores Claiborne lived there)
is about to meet Hell. The isolated Maine community, two miles from
the mainland, is the focal point of two major storm systems that
will collide, dumping five feet of snow to go along with
hurricane-force winds. This is indeed a storm of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Daly plays Mike Anderson, the island grocer and
$6,000-a-year constable (Question: Why do ``Wings'' alumni often
pop up in King's television movies, like Steven Weber in the 1997
remake of ``The Shining''?). Anderson is the narrator, telling the
story of the 1989 storm in a flashback from the present.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the storm is whipping up, old Martha Clarendon is found
dead. Seated in her living room, with an odd-looking cane, is a
man, a creepy stranger who speaks in riddles by the name of Andre
Linoge.
</P>
<P>
   Linoge, portrayed in understated brilliance by theater and movie
actor Colm Feore, has nothing personal against the old lady. It was
just his calling card. While Mike Anderson and deputy Alton
``Hatch'' Hatcher (Casey Siemaszko) arrest him, they soon learn it
is Linoge who has captured them, and the town.
</P>
<P>
   As more townspeople start dying while the storm whips into a
fury, Linoge is a puppeteer behind bars, a mysterious man who has
the power to stop the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me what I want,'' he says over and over in various ways,
``and I will go away.'' Linoge soon lets the townfolks in this
community know that even its most upstanding citizens have sinful
pasts. He is Evil who preys on the sinful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're town is full of adulterers, pedophiles, thieves,
gluttons, murderers, bullies, scoundrels and covetous morons,''
Linoge said. ``And I know every last one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   And he tells. Who had an abortion. Who cheated on a college
exam. Who is the gay basher who took out a man's eye in a beating.
Who is dealing pot. Who cheated on their woman. Everyone has a
secret, and no one is pure, except for, of course, the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Born in lust turn to dust,'' Linoge says. ``Born in sin, come
on in.'' King is not a comforting writer. ``Storm of the Century''
is a contradiction in the true King fashion: painful to endure,
impossible to ignore. He brings out the masochist in all of us. We
can't stop watching.
</P>
<P>
   There is that stoic New England feel throughout, from the way
characters address each other by first and last names, to the flat,
drawn-out accents (although the one employed by Siemaszko as Hatch
sounds a little like Cary Grant imitating an Australian imitating a
Bostonian). Lots of ``ayups.'' Lots of practicality amid bloody
chaos (the violence is mostly assumed, not shown).
</P>
<P>
   And in the true New England tradition, the climatic scene is a
town meeting, where the taxpayers of Little Tall Island vote on the
most bizarre ``item on the floor'' ever to be raised by a
community: Should they give Linoge what he wants?
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself after seeing this: Would you? Could you? Hum a song
while you do: I'm a little teapot, short and stout ...

CANADA'S HOSPITALS ARE FEELING A CHILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Drastic cuts in Canada's once-vaunted socialized
medical system coupled with winter's usual quota of broken bones
and pneumonia cases is transforming many hospitals into disaster
zones.
</P>
<P>
   In Quebec and Ontario, the country's two most populous
provinces, emergency rooms in major urban centers appeared headed
for medical meltdown this week with not nearly enough doctors,
nurses or technicians available to handle caseloads. Overcrowding
in the system meant hundreds of patients _ including people
suffering from serious fractures, high fevers and even heart
ailments _ were forced to endure waits of 24 hours or more for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is functioning right on the edge,'' said Dr. Guy
Morrisette, a Quebec emergency room physician. ``It is very near a
major crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambulances in Toronto were told to take patients to less-crowded
hospitals in the suburbs. In British Columbia, several major
hospitals cancelled all ``non-essential'' surgery, including hip
replacements and other procedures that have to be scheduled many
months and even years in advance in Canada's struggling health
system.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was worst in Quebec, where emergency room patients
were parked on guerneys in hallways, out-of-the-way corners and
supply closets because of a severe shortage of hospital beds. The
sights and smells in many Montreal hospitals rivalled those of the
most impoverished cities, with bleeding patients screaming for
attention in jampacked facilities reeking of urine and vomit.
</P>
<P>
   At Sacre Coeur Hospital, discarded syringes and dirty bandages
were strewn on an emergency room floor that was also puddled with
blood and spilled soda. Fire exits were blocked by patients on
stretchers.
</P>
<P>
   Similar scenes have been repeated in scores of Canadian
hospitals in recent weeks as the troubled national health care
system staggers into its busiest season after years of cost-cutting
by government. Winter is always a peak time because of flu,
respiratory infections and slips on icy sidewalks, but Canada's
hospitals are increasingly unable to cope.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, nurses and administrators acknowledged that the
situation is becoming desperate in many hospitals, including some
of the nation's best teaching and research institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions are almost inhuman,'' said Jennie Skenne, head of a
federation of Quebec nurses. ``You have sick people patients
spending 48 hours in corridors packed in like sardines.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dr. Brian Gore of Montreal: ``The system is hanging by a
thread.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's government-funded health system, which guarantees
``free'' care for all citizens, was considered a model for the
world when it was launched in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian system lurches from one crisis to the next as
provincial governments shutter hospitals and ``claw back''
physicians' fees as a way of balancing budget books. Government
sets and pays all medical fees and imposes income limits on
doctors, who are forbidden by law from any private billing of
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec has shut down 10 hospitals in two years to save money,
reducing the number of acute-care beds in the province from 23,380
to 18,100. Seven metropolitan hospitals were closed in Montreal,
Canada's second-largest city after Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, doctors and other health care workers are deserting
Canada in droves, heading mainly to the United States. The Canadian
Medical Association recently warned that ``the safety of patients
is being compromised by increasing demands for greater cost savings
. . . Patients have died waiting for surgery or other necessary
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Barakett, vice-president of the Quebec Federation of
General Practitioners, told the Montreal Gazette that 600,000
people in the Montreal region alone have seen their primary care
physicians quit practicing or depart Canada for more lucrative
practices south of the border. Few new doctors are taking their
place.
</P>
<P>
   The acute shortage of general practitioners means that more and
more Canadians are forced to head for emergency rooms in the event
of any illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people can't find a general practitioner,'' said
Louise Fullerton, head emergency nurse at Montreal's Royal Victoria
Hospital. ``They get their front-line care at emergency because the
care they need isn't out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Canadians are becoming increasingly frustrated with a
system once hailed as the nation's crowning social achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is supposedly the pride of Canada, but it's a
nightmare and a disgrace,'' said Jean Deschamps as he clutched the
hand of his 73-year-old wife, Jeannine, who had come to the
emergency room at Maisoneuve-Rosemont Hospital 16 hours earlier
suffering from breathing distress, but who had yet to be admitted
although an oxygen mask had been fitted over her face.
</P>
<P>
   All around the couple, mothers soothed feverish babies, while
older children bore their broken wrists or wracking coughs with
stocism. A few distraught adults cursed at nurses often toiling on
their second- or third straight shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really frightening is this isn't a `disaster' by normal
definition,'' said Deschamps, a retired professor of chemistry.
``There hasn't been an earthquake or horrible explosion. This is
just an ordinary day in an ordinary hospital in one of the richest,
most advanced societies on earth.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When I see a new computer, I reach for my screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   I want to know what's inside _ the parts that were bolted
together to produce the PC. Nowadays anybody with a tool kit can
assemble computers and sell them for a few hundred bucks. Some of
these so-called ``white-box'' computers are as good as anything
from Compaq or IBM. Others are tinny junk.
</P>
<P>
   How do you tell? Well, here's what to look for. And yes, you can
check without unscrewing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the processor at the heart of it all. There are a
raft of good cheap processor chips on the market, with only a few
to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The first generation of Intel Corp.'s low-cost Celeron
processors was notoriously slow. But I got decent performance from
SimCity 3000, a game with demanding three-dimensional graphics, on
a $500 eMachine computer with the new Celeron chip running at 333
megahertz (megahertz is a measure of a computer chip's operating
speed). Indeed, according to industry benchmarks, the latest
Celerons may be too good; they rate nearly as high as Intel's
Pentium II flagship line. So skip older Celeron-based machines and
take a look at the 333.
</P>
<P>
   Some other cheap PCs rely on a processor called the MediaGX from
Cyrix, a division of National Semiconductor Corp. This was the same
type of chip found in last year's breakthrough sub-$1,000 computer
from industry leader Compaq Computer Corp., and Packard Bell NEC
still offers some MediaGX machines. But it's definitely last year's
technology.
</P>
<P>
   From a gearhead's perspective, the MediaGX is quite advanced.
Most computers use separate chips to process sound and video, while
the main processor does the rest. MediaGX puts all this stuff on
one chip, thus saving money for the computer maker. But MediaGX
machines deliver sluggish performance, and traditional systems are
now so cheap that there's no need to make this compromise. Avoid
the MediaGX boxes and look for cheap machines that use the Cyrix M
II, AMD K6-2, or Intel Celeron.
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to the computer's graphics subsystem, the part
that draws pretty pictures on the screen. A good graphics
accelerator with lots of memory will actually make your computer
work faster, and make graphic images look good. Companies like ATI,
Diamond, and Matrox make good-quality graphics processors. You also
want at least 4 megabytes of memory assigned exclusively to the
graphics chip.
</P>
<P>
   No self-respecting computer comes without a modem. Insist on
getting a V.90 modem, capable of downloading data at up to 56,000
bits per second. Don't settle for one of the slower V.34 modems.
</P>
<P>
   The modems inside many cheap computers aren't full-fledged
modems at all. Regular modems are really small computers in their
own right. Cheap machines usually use a stripped-down device called
an HSP modem or Winmodem, which depends on the main processor chip
to work. These modems slightly reduce your computer's processing
speed, and they only work with Microsoft's Windows operating
system. Don't buy one for use with an alternative operating system
like Linux. Still, for day-to-day Web surfing, HSP modems work
fine. They're a safe way to save a few bucks.
</P>
<P>
   I also count card slots, those empty spaces in the computer's
motherboard where you can plug in useful accessories. Say you're
getting a second machine for the home. You might want to fill one
of your motherboard slots with a $40 Ethernet card. Then you can
link the two machines in a local area network, and share a single
printer between them. You also need an Ethernet card to get cable
modem service for high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Just about all PCs have extra card slots. I'd insist on at least
two. Slots come in two types, called PCI and ISA, and most
motherboards will have both. But most accessory cards are PCI these
days, so try to get at least one empty PCI slot.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this checklist the usual no-brainers. Of course you look
for a multigigabyte hard drive _ the bigger the better. The cheap
boxes all come with 32 megabytes of memory, but that's a bare
minimum; spend more for 64. And if you must run Windows, run
Windows 98; some cheap machines still offer Windows 95. But Windows
98 lets you use the new Universal Serial Bus devices, like printers
and scanners, that work as soon as you plug them in. Of course,
this assumes that you buy a computer with USB connectors. You'd
better.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, this wish list would have run you well over $1,000.
Today you can hit the spot for $500 to $600, and have money left
over for a screwdriver.

 Microscopic data seen as key in breast study
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Women undergoing breast biopsies who have a microscopic change
in their breast tissue called a radial scar appear to have about a
90 percent higher chance of developing breast cancer later,
according to a study conducted at two Boston hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Brigham
and Women's Hospital, both in Boston, led by Dr. Timothy W. Jacobs,
evaluated biopsies from 1,396 women participating in the nurses'
health study.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 99, or about 1 in 14, showed signs of radial scars.
About 33 percent of the 99 went on to develop breast cancer,
compared to 17 percent of the women without radial scars. The
cancer risk was ``further increased in women with larger or
multiple radial scars,'' the study leaders write in the current New
England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Radial scars cannot be seen in a biopsy without a microscope,
and doctors are unsure how they develop. Nevertheless, Nadine Tung,
director of the Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Risk and Prevention
Program, said the study indicates that ``the presence of radial
scars should be formally incorporated into pathology reports'' so
that both women who have them and the women's physicians can be
vigilant about monitoring for cancer with mammograms and other
tests.

</P>
<P>
   The safety of the US blood supply has been dramatically improved
in the past decade or so, to the point where the risk that someone
getting a blood transfusion will contract HIV or hepatitis is a
fraction of what it was 15 or 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence T. Goodnough, director of blood transfusion at
Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis and a medical professor at
Washington University, and colleagues reviewed 120 recent studies
on blood transfusion for a report in the current New England
Journal. The information shows blood quality has been greatly
improved through better screening of risky donors, better testing
of blood, and the end in 1979 of the practice of buying blood from
donors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Goodnough reported, patients getting blood transfusions
face more risk that they will get the wrong blood type, or a unit
contaminated by bacteria, than that they will contract a virus from
a donor.
</P>
<P>
   The current risk of contracting HIV from donated blood has
dropped to about 1 in 800,000, down from as high as 1 in 100, or 1
percent, in some communities in the early 1980s. The hepatitis
risk, over 20 percent in the early 1970s, is now under 1 in 60,000.
And with 12 million blood-unit transfusions performed per year in
the US, the risk of death per unit is less than 1 in 1 million.

<P>
   More than one-third of US senior citizens signing up for
Medicare have ``significant difficulty'' understanding medical
information, including written instructions for taking a
prescription or preparing for a medical procedure, according to a
report in the current Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study, by Prudential HealthCare Medicare officials, followed
3,260 people in Cleveland, Houston, and Florida. It concludes that
health plans should try harder to identify people who may get
confused and provide them pictorial or video instructions. . . .
Bed rest, the most common medical advice for the nerve inflammation
sciatica is no better than ``watchful waiting,'' according to a New
England Journal study by Dutch researchers. A total of 183 men and
women with sciatica, which causes soreness of the lower back and
buttocks, were assigned to either stay in bed for two weeks or
maintain their normal lifestyle while staying in touch with
doctors. After 14 days, 70 percent of the people who stayed in bed
an average of 21 hours a day felt better, but so did 65 percent of
those who kept going to work. After 12 weeks, all but 13 percent of
people in both groups reported less pain and debility, leading the
Maastricht University Hospital researchers to cite ``no evidence
that bed rest is an effective treatment.'' . . . Measuring
hand-grip strength of middle-aged men is a very good predictor of
their risk of becoming disabled when they become elderly, according
to a JAMA report on a 25-year study of Japanese-American men in
Hawaii. Grip strength is a good indicator of overall muscle tone,
and those who have the strongest grips when they are 45 to 68 may
have a ``greater reserve of strength'' to offset debilitation when
they grow older, said study leader Taina Rantanen of Finland's
University of Jyvaskyla.

BLUMENTHAL BECOMES `SOURCE' OF CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over lunch with a White House official Tuesday, Washington
political columnist Walter Shapiro spent 10 minutes talking Social
Security and campaign reform before the conversation got down to
brass tacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you going to tell me about Sidney and Chris Hitchens?''
the White House staffer asked impatiently.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange spinoff to the sagging impeachment plot, the
scandal on Washington's mind these days is not about Bill Clinton
and Monica Lewinsky. It is the sordid tale of two old friends _
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal and journalist Christopher
Hitchens _ who have become mortal enemies.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Blumenthal may have perjured himself by
testifying in the impeachment trial that he was not spreading
anti-Lewinsky stories to the media. In an affidavit filed Friday,
Hitchens said Blumenthal described Lewinsky to him as a ``stalker''
and the president as a ``victim,'' and asserted that Blumenthal
told the same story ``to other people in the journalistic
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, even as his boss apparently finds himself on the verge of
being acquitted after a year of scandal, Blumenthal could end up
being one of the few fish flopping around in Kenneth Starr's frying
pan _ thanks to an old buddy.
</P>
<P>
   A former Clinton-adoring journalist who joined the White House
in 1997, Blumenthal is widely viewed as a relentlessly pro-Clinton
spinner and gossip monger. Hitchens, a Clinton-hating British
journalist, is generally viewed as a contrarian gadfly. Given their
controversial _ and distinctly non-lovable _ reputations, one wag
has labeled their showdown ``the Iran-Iraq War.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy exploded last weekend when Hitchens, who writes
for Vanity Fair and The Nation, filed the affidavit concerning a
lunch conversation he had with Blumenthal in March about Lewinsky.
Hitchens, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday, made his
case on CNN, NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' and in an op-ed piece in
Tuesday's Washington Post. He told CNN that Blumenthal led him to
believe ``the president evolved this (stalker) theory of Monica
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal could not comment on the matter. But his attorney
William McDaniel said Wednesday that Hitchens did not contradict
Blumenthal's testimony that ``I talked about Monica Lewinsky with
all sorts of people.'' While Blumenthal may have described Lewinsky
as a ``stalker'' to Hitchens, McDaniel said, it was ``Hitchens, in
his own mind,'' who decided that characterization was emanating
from the president.
</P>
<P>
   Affidavits backing Hitchens's basic version of events have been
filed by his wife Carol Blue, who was also at the lunch, and by
journalist R. Scott Armstrong, who was told about the luncheon
later. (One complication is that Blue's affidavit could be seen as
differing with Hitchens's on exactly what Blumenthal said.)
</P>
<P>
   The issue may hinge on whether Blumenthal was casually
describing characterizations of Lewinsky or whether he was
parroting a presidential line designed for media consumption. Asked
if he expected to Blumenthal become the target of an investigation,
McDaniel said that ordinarily, this incident would simply be a
tempest in a teapot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' he noted, ``the teapot is occupied by Ken
Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   So what began as what McDaniel called ``a lunch between
friends,'' has turned into a full-fledged Washington psycho-drama
about an old social friendship rent asunder by Monicagate.
(According to a Washington Post story, Hitchens even traced his
lineage to family of Blumenthals and began referring to Sidney as
``cousin.'')
</P>
<P>
   Craig Crawford, executive editor of the Hotline political
newsletter, said the story already had ``pretty high altitude'' in
Washington, but when Tim Russert devoted a ``Meet the Press''
segment to the issue Sunday, ``he got it up to 35,000 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's playing down in Washington not as a legal problem for
Blumenthal, but as a friendship shatter in the journalistic
community,'' said Fred Barnes, editor of The Weekly Standard
magazine. ``I'm on Hitchens's side on this one, but they deserve
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Blumenthal appears to be scoring the most points when
this saga is weighed as a journalism and friendship issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not of the Sidney Blumenthal `martyr to democracy'
viewpoint,'' said Shapiro. But ``I am waiting to talk to a Chris
Hitchens defender because I have yet to meet one.''
</P>
<P>
   The journalism issues here are murky. McDaniel has acknowledged
that no one was under any agreement not to disclose that Blumenthal
was a news source, and he said, ``I don't think there's a
journalistic ethics issue here.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet a number of media ethicists do think Hitchens violated an
important boundary by relaying the nature of his conversations with
Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think the idea of a journalist throwing over a source
is troublesome in any circumstance, but this one is more
troublesome,'' said Bill Kovach, curator of Harvard's Nieman
Foundation. It opens the door ``to investigating every relationship
between the journalist and investigative bodies in Washington for
the past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was appalled frankly,'' said Marvin Kalb, director of
Harvard's Shorenstein Center. ``I do, in this case, strongly
question (Hitchens's) motivation and I think he has entered a
terribly tricky area.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some speculation that Hitchens may not have completely
forseen the consequences of his affidavit or the danger that now
lurks for his friend.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Sunday's ``Meet the Press,'' Hitchens said, ``If Mr.
Clinton is acquitted and allowed to walk and a separate case is
brought against Sidney, that would be a scandal and a disgrace. . .
. I won't testify if it's just against him.''

A CONVERT TO PEACEMAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   King Hussein's eulogizers mean well, but in their extravagant
and fulsome panegyrics, they are doing Jordan's departed ruler no
favor. There is much to praise in Hussein's works, but he is being
made to sound as if he were the greatest statesman and humanitarian
of the era _ Winston Churchill, Mother Teresa, and Andrei Sakharov
rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   From Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general: Hussein's
``true majesty found expression in a lifelong struggle to bring
peace to the ordinary men and women of the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Chicago Tribune: ``A mighty voice for peace in the
Middle East fell silent over the weekend, sending a shudder around
the world. . . . The void he leaves is immense,'' making more
elusive ``the comprehensive peace Hussein worked so tirelessly to
achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   From Hillary Clinton: ``How much better off this region and our
world would be if . . . all of us stopped to think: How would King
Hussein have acted? What would he have said?''
</P>
<P>
   This is overkill. Hussein was indeed a voice for peace _ but
only in the last years of his life. For most of his reign he was
something very different: an autocrat who used violence to crush
his rivals, punish Israel, and inflate his reputation in the Arab
world. It is impossible to truly admire the peacemaker he became
without knowing something about the warmonger he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, in the worst blunder of his career, Hussein spat on the
hand that reached out to him in peace.
</P>
<P>
   The hand was Israel's. War with Egypt and Syria was looming, and
the Israelis fervently hoped to avoid a fight with Jordan as well.
Publicly and privately, they implored Hussein to stay out of the
war, promising that there would be no attack on Jordan. But on June
5, the king began a bombardment across the border. Israel sent one
last plea via the Norwegian general Odd Bull, head of the UN
observers in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall not initiate any action whatsoever against Jordan,''
it read. ``However, should Jordan open hostilities, we shall react
with all our might.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein replied by intensifying the shelling in Jerusalem and
bombing the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Radio Amman announced in the
king's name that all Israelis should be ``torn to bits.'' Hussein
himself went on the air to declare: ``The hour of revenge has
come.'' It wasn't mere rhetoric. Israeli columnist Elyakim Haetzni,
a former member of parliament, recalled on Monday how, after the
Jordanians retreated from the West Bank, ``Israeli soldiers found
written orders from the king instructing his men to kill everybody
_ men, women, and children _ in Motza and Sha'alvim, two Jewish
communities situated between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.''
</P>
<P>
   It was said of Hussein this week that his defeat in the Six Day
War showed him that there was no alternative to peace with Israel.
In fact it showed him no such thing. After the war, the king
continued to allow deadly attacks on Israel to be launched from
Jordanian territory. He welcomed Yasser Arafat and the terrorists _
fedayeen _ of the PLO into his kingdom, declaring: ``We have come
to the point where we are all fedayeen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat overplayed his hand. The PLO attempted to seize
control of Jordan in 1970, triggering the brief civil war later
dubbed ``Black September.'' Arafat's forces had many supporters,
but Hussein repelled the challenge with overwhelming force.
Thousands of Palestinians, many of them civilians, were massacred.
It was the bloodiest month of Hussein's reign. In all the tributes
to Hussein the lifelong peacemaker, the slaughter of 1970 went
largely unmentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Largely unmentioned as well was Hussein's decision during the
Yom Kippur War of 1973 to send the 40th Armored Brigade, his crack
tank force, to join the Syrian assault on Israel. Or his embrace of
Saddam Hussein following the invasion of Kuwait _ an embrace so
wholehearted that the king proclaimed Saddam an ``Arab patriot''
and funneled military aid to him during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan paid a steep price for the king's bad bet on Iraq. A
billion dollars in annual aid from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states
were cut off. Tens of thousands of Jordanian Palestinians, expelled
from Kuwait, came streaming home. Only then, desperate to get back
into America's good graces, did Hussein at last turn to
peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation was astonishing. Not since Anwar Sadat had an
Arab leader thrown himself with such fervor into the cause of peace
_ real peace, not merely a frigid absence of hostilities. ``I am
determined,'' the king said of the 1994 treaty normalizing
relations between Israel and Jordan, ``not to have . . . a peace
between governments, but a peace between people.'' It was a promise
he kept.
</P>
<P>
   An extraordinary moment occurred in March 1997, when Hussein
visited the grieving families of seven Israeli girls shot dead by a
deranged Jordanian soldier. He knelt before the mourners, tears in
his eyes, words of comfort on his lips. It was an act of humanity
unprecedented in Middle East history.
</P>
<P>
   The greatness of King Hussein was not that he devoted his life
to peace. It was that he was able to rise above himself, to break
through a mindset of violence and become an apostle of
reconciliation. That is what the world has lost, and why Israelis
lowered their flags to half-mast when their former enemy died last
Sunday.

WOULD-BE CANDIDATES CAN'T WAIT FOR TRIAL TO END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Senator John F. Kerry talked with Senator John
McCain recently, the two quickly agreed on one thing: The
impeachment trial of President Clinton was making it difficult to
launch a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the Arizona Republican, is all but certain to run for
president, his aides said, while Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat,
expects to make up his mind within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But neither man wants to announce his presidential intentions
during the trial, fearing it would seem too political and would be
overshadowed by the delibations about Clinton's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free the Senate!'' Kerry said Wednesday, explaining that the
trial has delayed his decision by six weeks. ``I am ready to quote
Martin Luther King and say, `Thank God Almighty, I am free at
last!''
</P>
<P>
   The damage from the delay is clear: Every week the senators put
off their decision, they fall another $500,000 to $600,000 behind
in the crucial race for campaign money to bring in the $26 million
to $31 million this year that political experts say is needed to
compete strongly in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Kerry and McCain have concerns about how their vote on
the impeachment articles might affect their campaigns. McCain, for
example, is counting on support from political independents and
could be hurt if he votes to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The trial has given rise to a new round of personal questions.
McCain has been asked by the news media recently about whether
presidential candidates should be asked about their personal lives,
including the reason why McCain's first marriage broke up. McCain
responded that all he intends to say is that he was responsible for
the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, could be hurt if the
scandal-weary public decides there needs to be a fresh face in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing that many people are uninterested or are fed
up with the trial, candidates from outside Congress might have the
most to gain. Texas Governor George W. Bush, for example, has
condemned Clinton's actions, but doesn't have to vote on
impeachment. Bush, a Republican, has repeatedly been asked whether
any of his personal activities would disqualify him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I'm going to answer questions about specific behavior
is remind people that when I was young and irresponsible, I was
young and irresponsible,'' Bush has said.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said such statements are
important in the context of the coming presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very, very significant that McCain and Bush are trying
to get ahead of the curve, trying to inoculate themselves on
personal questions, on personal behavior,'' Rothenberg said.
``McCain has not only acknowledged marital problems; he has taken
responsibility for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Opinsky, a spokesman for McCain's presidential
exploratory committee, said that the trial has put extraordinary
constraints on the senator, but that McCain found time to go to New
Hampshire recently on his first campaign-style foray. Opinsky said
McCain could benefit from the trial's aftermath if there is a
public appetite for a reform-minded candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a voice to change the system, and he has a reputation
for that,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky said he didn't know how McCain would vote on the
articles of impeachment and thus couldn't say how the matter would
affect the campaign. McCain has declined to discuss the trial until
it is over.
</P>
<P>
   A third senator, Republican Bob Smith of New Hampshire, has
filed his presidential candidacy papers and has begun collecting
money. Representative John Kasich, an Ohio Republican who supported
impeachment, is expected to run. Both men have been highly critical
of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, meanwhile, has sought to turn
the Clinton impeachment to his advantage, noting that his
once-ridiculed campaign for ``family values'' is more attractive in
the aftermath of the revelations about Clinton's relationship with
Monica S. Lewinsky. Other Republican prospects _ including Lamar
Alexander, Steve Forbes, and Gary Bauer _ also have made an issue
of the Clinton scandal.

NEW LAW WORRIES RESEARCHERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With rising alarm, universities and hospitals are
moving to repeal a new and little-noticed federal law that requires
them to release details of their research to the public, possibly
including confidential interviews and trade secrets, if the work is
backed by federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The law was included with little debate in a 4,000-page
appropriations bill that Congress approved as one of its final
actions last year. It says that ``all data'' produced by
researchers receiving federal grants can be obtained through the
Freedom of Information Act, a federal law that gives citizens
access to government documents.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law, who include Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, say its intent is to provide the public access to all
research used by federal agencies in setting policies and
regulations. The measure arose from a complaint by industry groups
that the Harvard School of Public Health refused to release data
that federal regulators relied on when they proposed tougher
air-quality standards two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But as news of the law trickles through the research community,
universities and hospitals are reacting with apprehension. They say
the law could result in much broader releases of information,
putting notes, confidential material, and incomplete or misleading
data in the hands of those who want to use it for profit or who
oppose the research for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see nothing positive in this,'' said Dr. Eugene Braunwald,
who oversees 2,000 researchers at Partners Health Care, the parent
of Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham &AMP; Women's Hospital in
Boston. ``It's mischievous. It was not discussed. It was buried in
a huge bill without a full airing. This is nothing you just slip in
to suddenly change the life of lots and lots of scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have grave concerns,'' said Kevin Casey, spokesman for
Harvard University. ``This is a large problem, and the more we look
into it, the more sirens go off.''
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of other research organizations expressed concern
about how the law will be applied. They include the National
Academy of Sciences, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Boston University Medical Center, and the American Association of
University Professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to implement this law that is tolerable,''
said Dr. David Korn of the Association of American Medical
Colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Representative George Brown Jr., Democrat of California, has
filed a bill to repeal the law, and 21 lawmakers echoed the
research community's concerns in a letter to the federal agency
charged with implementing the new measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom of Information Act is a 32-year-old law that compels
government agencies to release a wide variety of documents on
request. The law, however, allows the government to withhold
information for a variety of reasons, such as national security and
``unwarranted'' invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Those exemptions will prevent the government from releasing
sensitive information gathered by researchers, such as confidential
medical records or proprietary material, said Andrea Andrews,
spokeswoman for Senator Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican who
wrote the law.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said the law arose from a dispute over Harvard's Six
Cities study, which tracked the health of about 8,000 people for
close to 20 years and found a link between air pollution and
health. When the EPA cited the study in proposing tougher air
standards, lawmakers and industry groups demanded that Harvard
release more details of its work. The researchers refused, saying
that the habits, death records, and medical histories of their
subjects were obtained under confidentiality agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers allowed independent scientists to review the
data, but Shelby believes better access is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the public pays for a study, then we should be able to
examine that study,'' Andrews said. ``And agencies such as the EPA
should not be allowed to propose regulations without releasing the
study on which they are basing the regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   But researchers say that the language in Shelby's measure is so
broad that confidential information might not be protected.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, depending on how it is interpreted, the law could give
anyone access to research data before it is published, violating a
long-held tradition that those who gather the data get to interpret
it first. Researchers also worry that the law might force them to
disclose new research that could be patented and turned into
profitable products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of industrially supported research,'' said David
Litster, vice president for research at MIT. ``Sometimes a company
will provide us with confidential information _ the source code for
software or something else _ that they do not want public. This law
just seems to cast a very broad net, and nobody knows quite what
could be scooped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say that the scientific process, by its very nature,
already requires that all pertinent data be made public. Scientific
results are not valid unless they can be reproduced, and prominent
journals will not publish papers unless they contain enough data to
satisfy independent reviewers. ``If scientists don't put their work
in the pubic eye, it's not worth anything to their careers,'' said
Ruth Flower of the American Association of University Professors.
</P>
<P>
   Some academic groups also say they fear the law will be used by
industry groups to harass researchers whose work might lead to
tougher regulations.
</P>
<P>
   They cite the case of Dr. Paul M. Fischer of the Medical College
of Georgia. In 1991, Fischer and others released a study showing
that Joe Camel, the cigarette cartoon symbol, was as well known to
6-year-olds as Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco giant R.J. Reynolds sought the details of Fischer's
work, including the names and telephone numbers of all children who
participated in the study and the addresses, phone numbers, and
background information of the people who interviewed them. The
company argued that Fischer, as a public employee, had to release
this and other information under Georgia's open records law. The
tobacco company won, though the state law was quickly amended so
the children's names remained confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to me was very clearly not an attempt to
understand the science. This was an attempt to shut down my
research operation,'' said Fischer, who has since left the medical
school. The new federal law, he said, ``will be used by companies
to harass researchers. This is going to be a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williams, a spokesman for the five largest US tobacco
companies, said it was ``blatantly unfair'' to say the industry
would use the new law to harass researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that if researchers ``try to drive public policy,
then they should be prepared to have their data face rigorous
public review.''

QUAYLE SHARPENS HIS GAME PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Shortly after Vice President Dan Quayle lost with
George Bush in their reelection bid of 1992, he went to former
President Nixon for career advice. ``Should I run for governor?''
Quayle, an Indiana native, asked, recalling how Nixon ran
unsuccessfully for the job in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Nixon scoffed in reply. ``You will run for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it is.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, who Thursday was set to make his first foray to the
first-primary state of New Hampshire since filing his presidential
candidacy papers late last month, delights in explaining his game
plan. Just as Nixon, the onetime vice president, defied the critics
and came back to win the presidency, the oft-scorned Quayle has
jumped into the White House race and declared he will be vindicated
in like fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Not many politicians would go so far in comparing themselves to
Nixon; it is the kind of comment that would have prompted groans
from one of Quayle's ``handlers'' during the Bush-Quayle campaigns.
But this is a different Quayle than the man who, he now
acknowledges, was ill-prepared for the vice presidential campaign
in 1988. When he came to his native Indiana last week to promote
his bid, there was no media feeding frenzy, no hostile press
conferences, and nary an inquiry about whether he was qualified for
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Quayle, 52, took every perceived negative and sought to
turn it to his advantage. After his 12 years in Congress and four
years as vice president, he said, ``I am the most qualified, most
prepared man in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Having suffered through all manner of insult from critics and
comedians alike, Quayle now shrugs it off, presenting himself as
battle-toughened. When editorial cartoonists this month sharpened
their pencils and implied that Quayle couldn't spell his own name,
the Quayle team professed delight. The plan is to let the media get
the gibes out of their system and then hope they focus on Quayle's
message.
</P>
<P>
   And he does have a message. Providing unusual policy detail for
a just-announced candidate, Quayle proposed a 30 percent income tax
cut for all Americans, with three tax rates: 10 percent for people
with incomes below $44,000; 20 percent for salaries between $44,000
to $160,000; and 28 percent for those making above $160,000.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't provide full details on how he would pay for such a
huge tax cut, though he points to the large and growing federal
surplus and suggests the elimination of as many as half of the
Cabinet agencies. (He doesn't say now which ones.) He also calls
for significant increases in defense spending, and would give
employees the option of funneling 30 percent of their Social
Security payroll taxes into a new form of Individual Retirement
Accounts.
</P>
<P>
   And although Quayle clearly is a conservative, he also
underscores that he won't be a pigeonhole candidate catering to one
wing of the Republican Party. For example, although no one doubts
Quayle is firmly antiabortion, he never used the word ``abortion''
or even ``pro-life'' during his press conference in Indianapolis
last week. Asked about this in an interview later, Quayle smiled
and said, ``I said the word `life.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The values I have been fighting for are faith, family,
freedom, and life,'' Quayle said. ``I don't intend to dwell on one
particular issue versus another. I speak for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of Quayle's stump speech sounds downright
Clintonian. He focuses relentlessly on what he called the
middle-class economic squeeze, precisely the issue that the
Clinton-Gore campaign used against the Bush-Quayle team in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   While Quayle says he is the most qualified presidential
candidate in America, he has been largely off the national stage
since leaving the White House in January 1993. Asked to explain
what he has done for the past six years, he said that he has
written two books, run a political action committee called Campaign
America and taught economics at the Thunderbird graduate school for
international management, a well-regarded institution in Glendale,
Arizona. He has also served on some corporate boards and given
numerous paid speeches.
</P>
<P>
   The most important activity may have been his fund-raising work
as head of Campaign America, a political action committee formerly
run by Bob Dole. Quayle in the last two years raised $6 million,
much of it which was distributed to local and state candidates whom
Quayle now hopes will back him for president. He also developed a
direct-mail list of 100,000 contributors who now may be asked to
contribute to Quayle's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   To understand Quayle's campaign, it is essential to understand
how he has been shaped by the cauldron of the 1988 campaign.
Plucked from obscurity by Bush against the wishes of some top Bush
advisers, Quayle, then 41, was introduced to the nation as a
surprise selection at the Republican convention in 1988. Quayle was
seen charging onto stage with Bush, in what he later called an
over-eager appearance. Within hours, stories were circulating that
Quayle was worth $600 million and got strings pulled to avoid
military duty by getting a stint in the National Guard. Some top
Bush aides soon began plotting to get him off the ticket, an idea
that was shelved in favor of sending Quayle to small towns,
carefully chaperoned by campaign ``handlers'' whom Quayle despised.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is the first to say that he needs to recover from what he
calls the ``nonsense'' of 1988, when he became the butt of
countless jokes about his intellect and spelling skills.
</P>
<P>
   The caricature of Quayle was based partly on exaggeration and
misconceptions. He was never worth $600 million _ more like $1
million. He was a mediocre student who often longed for the golf
course, but he was also a law school graduate. He seemed
politically green, but he is still legendary in Indiana for beating
the supposedly unbeatable Representative Ed Roush and then the
even-more-unbeatable Senator Birch Bayh. Even Quayle's
elitist-sounding name _ J. Danforth Quayle _ was misunderstood. The
first two names were picked in memory of his father's best friend,
James Danforth, who was killed during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But proving the critics wrong will not win Quayle the
nomination. In an awkward turn of events, Quayle expects his
toughest challenger to be Texas Governor George W. Bush, the son of
the man who brought Quayle to prominence. A number of Quayle's
closest associates, including former press secretary David
Beckwith, have said in interviews that they expect to back Bush if
he gets into the race.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle can't even rely on winning Arizona, where he spent part
of his childhood and now resides. The state's popular US senator,
former Vietnam prisoner of war John McCain, is expected to seek the
nomination. The crowded GOP field also may include Elizabeth Dole,
publisher Steve Forbes, former Education Secretary Lamar Alexander
and former Reagan aide Gary Bauer. But Quayle was helped when
Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, who was expected to court a
Quayle-like constituency of religious conservatives, decided not to
run.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle views 2000, with a wide-open GOP field and no incumbent
to contend with, as his best chance at the presidency _ ``my one
bite at the apple.'' His hopes rest largely on doing well in the
small states with conservative constituencies _ states like Iowa,
whose caucus is traditionally the first major political event of a
presidential year and New Hampshire, which prides itself on holding
the first primary. Quayle's trip this week to New Hampshire is part
of that strategy. Quayle will be escorted by former Governor John
Sununu, the one-time Bush White House chief of staff who has
remained close to the former vice president. Quayle and Sununu will
attempt to reestablish their old ties to Granite State, where the
importance of activists was underscored by the surprise primary
victory in 1996 of conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quayle is given more respect and a chance by the activists
around the country than the media around the country give him
credit for,'' said Ron Kaufman, a former political director of the
Bush White House. Kaufman himself expects to back George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's chief weapon in the campaign, he said, can be summed up
in one word: freedom. As a vice presidential candidate, Quayle
said, he always had to mimic Bush's positions, always had to stop
and think whether his utterances were in sync with the boss. Now,
he said, he is campaigning more like the political prodigy from
Indiana. His favorite memory of the campaign so far is when a
Hoosier came up to him recently and said, ``I'm glad to see Senator
Quayle is back with us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really find the words to describe the feeling I
have,'' Quayle said. ``It's my campaign.''

HUBBLE PHOTOS SHED NEW LIGHT ON BIRTH OF PLANETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Photographs from the Hubble Space Telescope are providing a
picture of how the Earth's solar system formed, helping to confirm
astronomers' theories of how planets are born, astronomers report.
</P>
<P>
   None of the pictures actually show planets, which are too faint
to be seen at even the distances of the nearest stars. But they do
show swirling disks of gas and dust around newborn stars, in some
cases with gaps or holes in the disks that seem to show the effects
of planets. Astronomers believe that all planets, including Earth,
originally formed from such disks.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble images, showing young stars at various stages in the
early formation of planets, can be assembled into a sequence that
shows how the process unfolds, the astronomers said this week at a
National Aeronautics and Space Administration briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Though the stars differ somewhat in size from our sun, these
images of the various embryonic stages of planet formation may be
the closest thing we will ever have to baby pictures of our solar
system in its formative years, the astronomers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have an assembly of pictures that span almost the
entire evolutionary sequence'' of the sun and its planets, said
Steven Beckwith, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute
in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new pictures were taken of one of the nearest
interstellar clouds where stars are being born, in the
constellation of Taurus. These stars, imaged by astronomer Deborah
Padgett and her colleagues using a camera on the Hubble telescope
that picks up infrared light, are about 450 light years (or about
2.7 quadrillion miles) from Earth. Most of the images show dark
bands cutting through the bright image of a star, because the dusty
disks are seen edge-on from Earth's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures provide strong support for theories of planet
formation which were formulated decades ago, long before
astronomers thought that it would be possible to see such processes
in action anytime in the foreseeable future. ``It's a good example
of a theory that's been around for a long time, but we were only
able to check it in recent years,'' Beckwith said.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of nearby regions of space where stars are forming from
large gas clouds seem to show that the vast majority of stars _ and
perhaps virtually all of them _ are surrounded by such
``protoplanetary disks'' early in their lifetimes. This is good
news for those who hope to find signs of intelligent beings out
among the stars, because it suggests that most stars will
ultimately be found to have planets _ presumed to be the likeliest
place to find life.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since none of the actual planets in such systems can yet
be seen, the astronomers cautioned that it is too soon to be sure
what the pictures mean. David Leckrone, senior NASA scientist for
the Hubble project, said that ``it's a good halftime score, but the
game isn't over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And Beckwith added ``until we can actually see the planets, we
won't know for sure.'' Still, he said, the images are good news for
the theorists because they fit the expected picture. The proof may
require direct detection of planets, he said. But in the meantime,
while it may be possible to come up with alternative explanations
for some individual pictures, other than current ideas about the
birth of planetary systems ``there isn't any other theory that
could account for this whole range of observations.''

<P>
   Nonstop menstrual bleeding and a painful growth in her uterus
have made Lynda Tottenham's life so miserable that the 47-year-old
can no longer comfortably stand on her feet all day at her Cape Cod
hairdressing shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about very heavy bleeding with clotting, to the
point where I feel like I'm going to drop dead sometimes,'' said
Tottenham, who has had the bleeding and fibroids for years. ``I
can't take this anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So she and her physician have scheduled a hysterectomy,
considered a definitive treatment for a patient with Tottenham's
symptoms, according to criteria established by the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
   But Tottenham's managed care plan has not approved the
procedure, saying it was ``unable to verify the clinical need''
based on its guidelines, according to the plan's denial letter to
Tottenham's gynecologist, Dr. Kenneth E. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of what's happening in managed care,'' said
Smith, who has joined hundreds of physicians, nurses,
psychologists, and other health care workers in a national effort
known as the Ad Hoc Committee to Defend Health Care, prompted by
mounting concerns surrounding changes in the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   The case, under appeal through Health Risk Management Inc., a
Minnesota for-profit company that manages the plan for Tottenham's
insurer, Arbella Life and Health, is among a growing number of
examples being cited nationwide by patients and physicians
frustrated with managed care.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a seriously ill 84-year-old man was discharged
against his and his doctor's wishes from a Boston-area hospital
after concerns were raised by HMO officials about whether he met
hospitalization criteria, according to Dr. David Dodson, the man's
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in the largest verdict ever against an HMO, a
California jury awarded $116 million to a woman whose husband died
trying to get Aetna US Health Care of California to cover an
experimental cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, a jury awarded $13.1 million to a Kentucky woman
who was denied coverage for a hysterectomy, after her doctor said
it would cure her cervical cancer. Humana Health Plan Inc., which
refused to pay for the procedure, lost one appeal last month but
plans another.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the mounting populist revolt, legislation has
been filed at the federal and state levels, calling for such
patient protection measures as an outside appeals process,
disclosure of any financial incentives for doctors or other
providers to limit treatment, a documented process of determining
medical necessity, and the right to sue an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where more than 50 percent of insured people
are enrolled through managed care plans, among the highest rates in
the country, and where regulation of plans is among the weakest,
several bills have been filed to change the system, according to
the Boston-based consumer advocacy group Health Care For All.
</P>
<P>
   And the Ad Hoc Committee to Defend Health Care, in Boston, plans
to gather enough signatures to place a binding statewide referendum
on the 2000 ballot in favor of universal health care and against
for-profit medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care officials defended their contributions to the
health care system, saying they have trimmed costs while improving
care, and reduced unnecessary hysterectomies, caesarean sections,
and other overusage that drove costs up under the old
fee-for-service health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because our CEO and founder is a physician himself, he's very
concerned that people make sure that we aren't trying to do the
doctor's jobs for them,'' said Laura Pigott, public relations
manager for Health Risk Management, or HRM, which is expected to be
deciding Tottenham's appeal by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   With HRM's own set of guidelines, ``We're trying to help them,
so they can make the best informed decision for their patients,''
Pigott said. ``I know the perception a lot of times is that
guidelines are just there to facilitate denials,'' but that is not
the case, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pigott said patient confidentiality prevented her from
discussing Tottenham's case. ``We very carefully make it so that
patients' interest is respected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If the medical specialist reviewing Tottenham's case upholds the
denial of the hysterectomy, Pigott said Tottenham can still appeal
to Arbella.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 100,000 cases reviewed by HRM last year for the
approximately 70 health plans it manages nationwide, just .5
percent were appealed because the treating physician disputed the
finding, Pigott said. And out of the cases appealed, 76 percent of
the ``non-recommendations'' were upheld, while the rest were
modified or overturned, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Tottenham _ who pays nearly $700 a month to Arbella for
coverage for just her and her husband, and can't afford the
additional cost for hospital coverage for their sons _ that answer
isn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``My surgery is scheduled for March 9. I haven't canceled it,''
she said. ``If the insurance company continues to refuse, I'm going
to work something out with Dr. Smith, and then I'm going to see a
lawyer.''

NEW LAW WORRIES RESEARCHERS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With rising alarm, universities and hospitals are
moving to repeal a new and little-noticed federal law that requires
them to release details of their research to the public, possibly
including confidential interviews and trade secrets, if the work is
backed by federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The law was included with little debate in a 4,000-page
appropriations bill that Congress approved as one of its final
actions last year. It says that ``all data'' produced by
researchers receiving federal grants can be obtained through the
Freedom of Information Act, a federal law that gives citizens
access to government documents.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law, who include Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, say its intent is to provide the public access to all
research used by federal agencies in setting policies and
regulations. The measure arose from a complaint by industry groups
that the Harvard School of Public Health refused to release data
that federal regulators relied on when they proposed tougher
air-quality standards two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But as news of the law trickles through the research community,
universities and hospitals are reacting with apprehension. They say
the law could result in much broader releases of information,
putting notes, confidential material, and incomplete or misleading
data in the hands of those who want to use it for profit or who
oppose the research for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see nothing positive in this,'' said Dr. Eugene Braunwald,
who oversees 2,000 researchers at Partners Health Care, the parent
of Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham &AMP; Women's Hospital in
Boston. ``It's mischievous. It was not discussed. It was buried in
a huge bill without a full airing. This is nothing you just slip in
to suddenly change the life of lots and lots of scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have grave concerns,'' said Kevin Casey, spokesman for
Harvard University. ``This is a large problem, and the more we look
into it, the more sirens go off.''
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of other research organizations expressed concern
about how the law will be applied. They include the National
Academy of Sciences, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Boston University Medical Center, and the American Association of
University Professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to implement this law that is tolerable,''
said Dr. David Korn of the Association of American Medical
Colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Representative George Brown Jr., Democrat of California, has
filed a bill to repeal the law, and 21 lawmakers echoed the
research community's concerns in a letter to the federal agency
charged with implementing the new measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom of Information Act is a 32-year-old law that compels
government agencies to release a wide variety of documents on
request. The law, however, allows the government to withhold
information for a variety of reasons, such as national security and
``unwarranted'' invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Those exemptions will prevent the government from releasing
sensitive information gathered by researchers, such as confidential
medical records or proprietary material, said Andrea Andrews,
spokeswoman for Senator Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican who
wrote the law.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said the law arose from a dispute over Harvard's Six
Cities study, which tracked the health of about 8,000 people for
close to 20 years and found a link between air pollution and
health. When the EPA cited the study in proposing tougher air
standards, lawmakers and industry groups demanded that Harvard
release more details of its work. The researchers refused, saying
that the habits, death records, and medical histories of their
subjects were obtained under confidentiality agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers allowed independent scientists to review the
data, but Shelby believes better access is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the public pays for a study, then we should be able to
examine that study,'' Andrews said. ``And agencies such as the EPA
should not be allowed to propose regulations without releasing the
study on which they are basing the regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   But researchers say that the language in Shelby's measure is so
broad that confidential information might not be protected.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, depending on how it is interpreted, the law could give
anyone access to research data before it is published, violating a
long-held tradition that those who gather the data get to interpret
it first. Researchers also worry that the law might force them to
disclose new research that could be patented and turned into
profitable products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of industrially supported research,'' said David
Litster, vice president for research at MIT. ``Sometimes a company
will provide us with confidential information _ the source code for
software or something else _ that they do not want public. This law
just seems to cast a very broad net, and nobody knows quite what
could be scooped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say that the scientific process, by its very nature,
already requires that all pertinent data be made public. Scientific
results are not valid unless they can be reproduced, and prominent
journals will not publish papers unless they contain enough data to
satisfy independent reviewers. ``If scientists don't put their work
in the pubic eye, it's not worth anything to their careers,'' said
Ruth Flower of the American Association of University Professors.
</P>
<P>
   Some academic groups also say they fear the law will be used by
industry groups to harass researchers whose work might lead to
tougher regulations.
</P>
<P>
   They cite the case of Dr. Paul M. Fischer of the Medical College
of Georgia. In 1991, Fischer and others released a study showing
that Joe Camel, the cigarette cartoon symbol, was as well known to
6-year-olds as Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco giant R.J. Reynolds sought the details of Fischer's
work, including the names and telephone numbers of all children who
participated in the study and the addresses, phone numbers, and
background information of the people who interviewed them. The
company argued that Fischer, as a public employee, had to release
this and other information under Georgia's open records law. The
tobacco company won, though the state law was quickly amended so
the children's names remained confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to me was very clearly not an attempt to
understand the science. This was an attempt to shut down my
research operation,'' said Fischer, who has since left the medical
school. The new federal law, he said, ``will be used by companies
to harass researchers. This is going to be a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williams, a spokesman for the five largest US tobacco
companies, said it was ``blatantly unfair'' to say the industry
would use the new law to harass researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that if researchers ``try to drive public policy,
then they should be prepared to have their data face rigorous
public review.''

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel and Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affliction'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Nolte and James Coburn.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar nominee Nick Nolte gives a searing, career-defining
performance in this soul-weary study of one of the walking dead.
Nolte plays a troubled New England cop whose ``afflictions''
include an angry ex-wife, a frightened young daughter, a boss who
belittles him and a roaringly abusive father (James Coburn, also
Oscar-nominated). 1 hour, 44 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Another Day in Paradise'' R (violence, profanity, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Woods and Melanie Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise is hardly the word for this too-familiar tale of four
lowlife crooks/addicts who form a kind of surrogate family. James
Woods and Melanie Griffith are the ``parents''; Vincent Kartheiser
and Natasha Gregson Wagner are the teens they ``adopt,'' sharing
their criminal expertise and their smack. The movie is the kind of
empty charade that depends on sensationalizing drug use to disguise
its vapidness. 1 hour, 32 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``At First Sight'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Val Kilmer, Mira Sorvino.
</P>
<P>
   Val Kilmer plays a blind man who regains his sight. But this
fact-based drama, loosely based on a metro Atlanta couple, never
finds its focus. Mira Sorvino plays Kilmer's new love, but the
chemistry between the stars is as bleak and gray as the wintry
setting. 2 hours, 8 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Blast From the Past'' PG-13 (profanity, sex, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser does another culture-clash, fish-out-of-water
flick, playing a guy who climbs into the '90s after spending all
his life in a bomb shelter. You wait for the high-concept comedy to
make some smart observations (or at least some decent jokes) about
the collision of the '60s and '90s. But the humor and the plot are
amateurish, leaving its cast flailing. 1 hour, 52 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   A multi-legged wonder. The newest computer-animated feature from
the makers of ``Toy Story'' is the eye-popping, witty tale of an
ant named Flik (voice of Dave Foley), who recruits a bunch of
circus bugs to battle evil grasshoppers (the chief villain is
voiced by Kevin Spacey). There's enough going on here to keep every
adult, child or arachnid vastly entertained. 1 hour, 34 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' PG-13 (profanity and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a true story, this legal thriller stars John Travolta
as a small-time personal injury lawyer who tackles two giant
corporations. Oscar nominee Robert Duvall is his cagey opponent.
Travolta is miscast and the movie can't quite decide what its focus
is. Still, it more than makes its case with intelligence and
old-fashioned Hollywood ``let us entertain you'' craft. 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' PG-13 (profanity, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alfre Woodard and Al Freeman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   This warm, funny, utterly engaging family film insists you can
go home again, even if you've never been there before. Alfre
Woodard stars as a messed-up Chicago single mom with two kids. Her
own mother (Mary Alice) ships her south to Mississippi to stay with
her uncle
</P>
<P>
   (Al Freeman Jr.) and try to get her life straight. 1 hour, 41
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett gives a luminous
portrayal, and Geoffrey Rush, also an Oscar nominee, gives her
sturdy support as court politics and intrigues swirl about. This is
a really good story. 2 hours, 4 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.''44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' Not rated but sexual themes and brief
nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   Three Oscar nominations. A brilliant reimagining of the final
days of gay British director James Whale. Whale, best known for his
classic horror movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died
mysteriously in 1957. Played here by the marvelous Ian McKellen
(best actor), he's an isolated, forgotten recluse who becomes
interested in the hunky new gardener (Brendan Fraser).1 hour, 35
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   Hilary and Jackie'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   Never quite hitting its intended crescendo, this real-life
psychological drama about the relationship between two musical
sisters still strikes some major chords. Oscar nominee Emily Watson
(``Breaking the Waves'') stars as Jacqueline du Pre, a world-famous
cellist who died in 1987 of multiple sclerosis. Rachel Griffiths,
also nominated, plays her sister, Hilary. 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``In Dreams'' R (violence and disturbing themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be called ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' meets ``The
Eyes of Laura Mars,'' a psychic woman (Annette Bening) is harassed
in her dreams by a child-murdering psycho. For at least an hour,
the movie is truly eerie and disturbing, but an overly long
encounter between Bening and the madman proves damaging. 1 hour, 40
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Oscar nominations including best picture, best actor and
best screenplay. An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of
a concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. Roberto Benigni's low-comedy slapstick
approach isn't entirely convincing and is often chillingly
wrongheaded. Subtitles. 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' R (profanity, brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine.
</P>
<P>
   British actress Jane Horrocks, who can belt out tone-perfect
impersonations of everyone from Judy Garland to Shirley Bassey, is
pretty much the whole show here. The rest of the film is a fairly
feeble show-biz fable in which her blowzy mom (Oscar nominee Brenda
Blethyn) and a seedy agent (Michael Caine) try to get this shy
recluse onstage. 1 hour, 30 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Message in a Bottle'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Two messages here: Old-fashioned romances still work, and Kevin
Costner needs an ego check. Badly. For a good while, the movie lets
us luxuriate in the pleasures of sailboats, sunsets, candlelit
dinners, etc. Plus, there's comic relief courtesy of Paul Newman
and Robbie Contrane. But the last 15 minutes are a lunkheaded
embarrassment and Costner (he co-produced) is to blame. 2 hours, 12
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Favorite Martian'' PG (violence, partial nudity and
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeff Daniels, Christopher Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   A big-screen remake of the '60s TV series, with the annoying and
unsubtle Christopher Lloyd as the Martian who camps in Jeff
Daniels' living room. The movie is cobbled together with cheesy
special effects and easy gags. But for kids, it's an OK
babysitter.1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' PG-13 (profanity, crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a renegade med student who believes the
rigid rules of health care could use a few laughs. It's ``Dead
Poets Society'' with lab coats. The laughs are good, but when it
tries to get serious (often), the flick is as deep as a bedpan. 1
hour, 56 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' R (violence, profanity, drug and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers vengeance thriller starring Mel Gibson. It's as
generic as its unnamed, dull gray city.1 hour, 42 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' PG (violence, intense themes)
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular animated musical epic that retells _ with some
embellishments _ the Book of Exodus. Val Kilmer is the voice of
Moses, God's choice to lead the Hebrew people from slavery in
Egypt. Ralph Fiennes speaks for the Pharaoh, Moses' ``adopted''
brother. Other talent includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and
a host of animators. The movie is visually impressive, insistently
reverential.1 hour, 39 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' R (profanity and brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Olivia Williams.
</P>
<P>
   This original prep school fable pits 15-year-old Max (Jason
Schwartzman) against a tycoon (Bill Murray) in a battle for the
love of a schoolteacher (Olivia Williams). The second film from
director Wes Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson proves that they
haven't lost the off-kilter wit and viewpoint they first showed in
``Bottle Rocket.'' 1 hour, 33 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' R (extreme violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon and Edward Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Oscar nominations including best picture. Part gung-ho
heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven Spielberg's superb
film shows us World War II as we've never seen it before. Tom Hanks
leads a courageous squad on a mission to find a private whose three
brothers have already been killed in combat.2 hours, 50 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   CQ KJ``Steam: The Turkish Bath'' Not rated but has adult sexual
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alessandro Gassman.
</P>
<P>
   Worth a dip. An Italian yuppie goes to Istanbul to dispose of
the property left him by his aunt. He intends to sell everything
and get home quickly, but once there, he's seduced. By the city, by
a warm-hearted Turkish
</P>
<P>
   family, by a new sense of himself and his sexuality. The plot is
soggily familiar, but as a love letter to Istanbul, it is quite
wonderful. Subtitles. 1 hour, 34 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' PG-13 (profanity, adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts play competing moms _ one
biological, the other step _ in this comedy/weepie that tackles
some complex ``blended family'' issues, then cops out by giving a
character a fatal disease. Still, the sturdy cast does much to
redeem the mush-headed script (add Ed Harris in the dishonest role
of doting dad who somehow never sees his kids). 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy'' R (sexuality, profanity, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stephen Rea, Billy Connolly and Bill Nighy.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliantly acted comedy with poignant undertones. Twenty
years after giving in to factions, jealousies and divine
intervention, a fictional '70s British rock group named Strange
Fruit attempts a reunion tour. The movie is both a celebration and
an elegy, telling us that rock 'n' roll dreams die hard. The
ensemble cast is terrific, with Bill Nighy a standout as the lead
singer.1 hour, 36 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' R (profanity and war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson
and Adrien Brody.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Oscar nominations including best picture. Less a war movie
than a meditation on life, death, love, hate, man and nature.
Terrence Malick puts his unmistakable stamp on the drama of an Army
division's struggle to capture Guadalcanal from the Japanese during
World War II. 2 hours, 50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally, alone with it, accidentally cracks it and is
thrust back in time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed
the Earth. 40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Varsity Blues'' R (profanity, sexuality, nudity,substance
abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Van Der Beek and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   James Van Der Beek plays a high school football player in this
insulting mix of beery teenage humor and rampant sexuality. 1 hour,
40 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' PG (sexual themes, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian Bannen and David Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   A broad, twinkly Irish comedy about what happens in a tiny
village when it's discovered that one of the residents is the
holder of a lottery ticket worth nearly $7 million. The movie is a
little too eager to please, a little too Lucky Charms Irish. But
the two leads, devilish old-pro codgers Ian Bannen and David Kelly,
are practiced charmers, and there are lots of winning little
moments along the way. 1 hour, 30 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   This Internet-era update of ``The Shop Around the Corner'' stars
Tom Hanks as a book-chain magnate and Meg Ryan as the small-store
owner he's putting out of business. Little do they know that
they're each other's e-mail sweethearts. ``Sleepless in Seattle''
director Nora Ephron gets the charm working again in a remake that
delivers. 2 hours. B
</P>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, you're not being paranoid. You are being watched.
</P>
<P>
   Everytime you log onto the Internet, you're probably helping to
build a dossier on yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The most sophisticated shopping sites on the Web keep track of
everything you buy, and analyze the information in an effort to
sell you still more goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites entice you with come-ons like free electronic mail
accounts, in exchange for personal information like your name and
telephone number. Still other sites don't ask you for anything, but
simply keep track of your electronic wanderings, using the in
</P>
<P>
   formation to create a personal profile that is a marketer's
dream.
</P>
<P>
   Scary? Some people think so.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year by Business Week magazine found that more
than three-quarters of those who shop on the Internet say they
would buy even more if there were better privacy safeguards. And
among those who didn't shop on line, privacy fears were the chief
reason they stay away.
</P>
<P>
   The popular computer network America Online created a national
furor last year when it released information about one of its
customers to the US Navy. Timothy McVeigh had posted, anonymously,
information on line that suggested he was gay. The Navy persuaded
AOL to violate its own privacy policy and reveal McVeigh's
identity, whereupon he was discharged from the service.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh was subsequently reinstated after a federal court
challenge, but the incident served as a startling illustration of
how much personal information is available on line.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of information can Web-based businesses collect and
how do they do it? The simplest method, and perhaps the most
misunderstood, is the ``cookie.'' A cookie is a small chunk of data
that is sent by a Web site to a visitor's computer. The cookie can
be used to store data that the visitor will need whenever he
returns to the site. For example, a visitor to the New York Times
Web site must get a password to sign in. But if he agrees, he can
also get a cookie that will ``remember'' his password. The next
time he visits the site, the Times computer will check his browser.
If the cookie is there, the visitor is instantly logged in, without
having to retype the password.
</P>
<P>
   Internet advertisers love cookies, because they make it possible
to control exactly which ads are displayed on a person's computer.
This is the business of companies like New York-based DoubleClick,
which attaches cookies to ads in order to create profiles of
millions of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Many commercial Web sites feature banner
ads linked to the DoubleClick network. When someone visits one of
these sites, his or her computer gets a cookie that notes the
particular ad being displayed. The cookie continues to track the
user, noting every visit to a site featuring DoubleClick ads. The
cookie tracks which ads the user clicks on for more information,
and which ads he or she ignores.
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, DoubleClick builds up a profile of the Web
surfer, which can be used to send ads specifically tailored to his
or her tastes. As a result, two different people visiting the same
Web page may see entirely different ads, depending on the content
of their DoubleClick cookies.
</P>
<P>
   To some, it might sound like Web users are being followed by
some virtual detective, but DoubleClick general manager Christopher
Saridakis says that cookies are not an invasion of privacy. ``It
really doesn't contain any information about the individual,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick doesn't know who you are or where you live. It just
knows that somewhere out there, Person X, likes football,Continued
on next page &QL; 
hates basketball and is interested in sport-utility vehicles.
Besides, DoubleClick allows consumers who don't want to be tracked
to opt out of the system. On request, they'll send out a cookie
that blocks all other DoubleClick cookies.
</P>
<P>
   In general, cookies pose little threat to your privacy. A cookie
can only be read by the Web site that installed it. Even if you
visit a fly-by-night Web site run by hostile hackers, they can't
learn anything about you by accessing your cookies. Indeed, most
cookies only contain a set of numbers that will be meaningless to
any other computer but the one that created the cookie.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for those who insist on avoiding them, most standard Web
browsers can be set to warn the user of incoming cookies so that
the user can opt to refuse them. Unfortunately, so many sites
install cookies that users will be bombarded with dozens of cookie
requests. To avoid this, some people use software tools with names
like InterMute and Internet Junkbuster that allow consumers to
block out nearly all cookies.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a price to pay for life without cookies _ some Web
sites won't let you in without one.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Evan Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, a
newsletter based in Washington, D.C., refuses all cookies as a
matter of principle. ``I don't see any benefit to me in allowing
them to place a cookie,'' he says. ``The benefit's all to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks acknowledges he's never heard of anyone suffering a
loss of privacy because of cookies, but he fears that could change
if companies find ways to link your cookie to a file of personal
information about you.
</P>
<P>
   It's already happening at hundreds of Web sites, where consumers
provide detailed personal information. Such information can be
combined with cookies to create a personalized customer profile _
or to reveal sensitive information to complete strangers.
</P>
<P>
   There are some advantages to personalization, however. An
example of it at its best can be found at eToys, a popular toy
retailing site. Toy shoppers can create a personal account at the
site that will keep a permanent record of everything they have ever
purchased there. The site also allows them to create a wish list of
toys they might want to buy in the future. It even has a calendar
that can send e-mail reminders of a child's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, like the popular bookseller Amazon.com, take
personalization even further. The Amazon site analyzes the books a
customer buys, and directs the customer to other titles that might
also be of interest. ``Their business model is based on getting
very detailed information on their customers and what they do,''
says Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what scares him.
</P>
<P>
   eToys vows never to sell the information it collects about its
customers. Amazon reserves the right to do so, but will keep
customer data private if the customer submits a request via e-mail.
But many other Web retailers make no such pledges. Under existing
law, they're free to sell any information about you, to anyone
willing to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the many Web sites that don't sell anything,
but still collect lots of personal data on visitors. Many sites
offer free Web pages and free e-mail service. But these services
aren't really free. They're provided in exchange for personal
information that can be used to build up a database of potential
customers. And consumers have no control over what happens to this
data.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most aggressive effort yet to compile information on
computer users was announced on Feb. 8. A California firm called
Free-PC.com is giving away computer systems to the first 10,000
customers who sign up for the company's free Internet access
service.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch. Customers must provide lots of personal
information _ name, address, age, marital status and so on. This
information will be used to beam carefully targeted advertisements
to each Free-PC.com user. In addition, the Free-PC.com system
tracks every site the user visits, adding this data to the person's
marketing profile. Users who frequently visit personal-finance
sites might see frequent ads for mutual funds or banks.
</P>
<P>
   Free-PC officials say they'll sell their data collection to
other companies, but will not include information that can be used
to identify individuals, like names and addresses.
</P>
<P>
   A survey taken last year by the Federal Trade Commission found
that only 14 percent of the 1,400 commercial Web sites surveyed
even had an official privacy policy to inform consumers about how
their personal data would be used. The Clinton administration has
warned Web-based businesses that unless they move aggressively to
provide better privacy guarantees, new federal laws are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Such laws may be inevitable because of events overseas. The 15
nations of the European Union have imposed very strict privacy
regulations on firms doing business inside its borders. For
instance, a European firm can't sell personal information about
customers to a third party without getting explicit permission from
the customer. Now the EU is threatening to limit the ability of
American companies, including Internet companies, to do business in
Europe unless the United States adopts equally tough privacy rules.
</P>
<P>
   American companies are scrambling to stave off regulation by
adopting voluntary privacy guarantees. TRUSTe, a nonprofit
organization in Palo Alto, Calif., certifies companies that pledge
to protect the privacy of Internet visitors. As of December 1997,
only 42 firms had signed up for TRUSTe certification. After
warnings from the federal government, the number jumped tenfold
last year, to 427 firms.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Scott, TRUSTe's executive director, says that reputable
Web sites are becoming much less willing to share information about
their customers. ``I think that the sites that are serious about
this have realized, hey, this is something we can't be cavalier
about,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   TRUSTe doesn't forbid members from sharing the information they
collect. Instead, the organization requires that certified
companies clearly inform visitors about how the firm will use any
information it collects. The idea is not to limit companies' use of
data, but to provide information so that consumers can make
informed decisions about whether to provide data.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether a voluntary program like TRUSTe will
satisfy the concerns of European regulators, who favor rigid legal
protections of consumer privacy. Besides, in the case of Timothy
McVeigh, AOL violated its own rules about releasing personal
information. Some privacy advocates think that only federal laws
will prevent such lapses.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott is convinced that as consumers become better informed,
businesses will have all the incentive they need to improve their
protection of personal data. ``If you're going to violate the trust
of your consumers,'' Scott says, ``I don't think you're going to be
in business a very long time.''

 &HT;    Awful `Blast' blows its chances
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   Just when he was getting serious recognition for his work in
``Gods and Monsters,'' along comes another of his fish-out-of-water
comedies. The first time around, he got thawed out of prehistory
and introduced to mall culture in ``Encino Man.'' Then he swung out
of the trees and learned to wear shoes in ``George of the Jungle.''
This time out, he has to acquaint himself with adult bookstores,
unmarried couples living together and that inescapable 1990s
accessory, a wisecracking gay sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Blast From the Past,'' a lame reworking of a way-tired
situation, Fraser plays Adam Webber, who lives in a pre-Flower
Power cocoon. The son of inventor Calvin (Christopher Walken) and
homemaker Helen (Sissy Spacek), Adam has spent his whole life in a
bomb shelter. That's because, through a couple of improbable plot
turns, Dad became convinced that Russia nuked the States and that
the only above-ground survivors are mutants. Because their shelter
is in Los Angeles, you can pretty much guess most of the West Coast
future-shock jokes once Adam hits the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a half-hour for him to get there. As Adam grows up by
increments, we see the Webbers watch a film of ``The Honeymooners''
over and over. They listen constantly to Perry Como, Helen starts
to hit the bottle a little, etc. You wait for writer Bill Kelly to
put an interesting spin on his hackneyed view of these people. And
you wait.
</P>
<P>
   Walken and Spacek are strong actors but not natural comedians.
They push the jokes hard, as though their effort will distract us
from seeing how weak the jokes are. Joan Allen and William H. Macy
brought similar '50s stereotypes to life in ``Pleasantville,'' but
it isn't as easy as it looks. And while ``Pleasantville'' also had
some cultural points to make, ``Blast'' squanders the chance to say
something astute ple fall in love and don't immediately fall into
bed. It's a movie that invites critics to shred it to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   And here's where that shredding comes . . . sort of. Let's talk
about ego. Not just star ego, or superstar ego, but Costner-size
ego. An ego that insists his character not only be tormented and
withdrawn, but also sensitive, heroic, a great cook, quick with his
fists and dress like a storybook lumberjack.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's plot combines two traditional genres: the
haunted-by-his-first-wife theme from ``Rebecca'' and the
city-girl/country-guy motif embraced by ``The Horse Whisperer'' and
``Six Days, Seven Nights.'' After finding the bottle, a vacationing
Theresa (Wright Penn), a date-deprived divorcee with a young son,
returns to her job working for a Chicago Tribune columnist (a
boisterous turn by Robbie Coltrane). When she tells him her story,
he turns it into a column, which in turn elicits loads of reader
response. Encouraged by her workplace pal (Illeana Douglas),
Theresa uses the feedbackituations. 2 hours, 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Old-fashioned romance never goes out of style, but
Kevin Costner badly needs an ego check.

EDITING HOME VIDEOS INTO CHERISHED MOMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 17 million US households that own both a camcorder and a
personal computer also own something else, according to Griffin Dix
Research: an average of 20 videotapes they rarely watch.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, as many of us with camcorders have found, is that
what seemed like endlessly fascinating graduation ceremonies,
Little League games and baby feeding sessions at the time we were
rolling tape turned out to be a little tedious on playback.
</P>
<P>
   Programs that plug into your personal computer to help you edit
down and jazz up your videos are becoming one of the hottest new
markets in home electronics. Dataquest, a multimedia
market-analysis firm, estimates that shipments of these products
rose from 471,162 units in 1996 to more than 1 million in 1997, and
probably more this past year.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen products priced for home use are on the
market, with new ones seeming to come out every month. They include
Ulead Systems' VideoStudio 3.0, Adaptec's VideOh!, Iomega Buz, Avid
Cinema (a Power Macintosh product), Dazzle Digital Video Creator,
and MGI Software's Videowave.
</P>
<P>
   One of the least expensive, versatile and klutz-forgiving
systems is Studio 400 by Pinnacle Systems, which went on the market
in May and normally retails for $199 or less.
</P>
<P>
   While some systems require you to undertake the frightening task
of opening up your computer to plug in a device that translates
tapes into digital bits for storage and editing on your hard drive,
Studio 400 uses a paperback-book-sized device that plugs into your
serial and parallel ports like a printer.
</P>
<P>
   To make it work, you need a Pentium-class computer running
Windows 95 or 98, a VCR that can be controlled by an infrared
remote and can be plugged in somewhere close to the PC, and a
couple of specialized cables to hook up the VCR and camcorder to
your computer.
</P>
<P>
   It's also worth checking at this Web page _
www.pinnaclesys.com/framesets/support.html _ to make sure your
camcorder will work with Studio 400. (Generally, Sony, JVC, and
Panasonic camcorders and all other camcorders that support 8mm tape
or have what is called a Panasonic 5 pin will work out, according
to Pinnacle.)
</P>
<P>
   Once everything is hooked up, you play back the tape. To
conserve memory, the system transfers to your computer memory a
lower-resolution version of the tape _ 160 by 120 pixels _ that
should take up no more than 150 megabytes per hour of tape.
</P>
<P>
   The program automatically determines the beginning of each
``scene'' on your tape, sensing when you stopped or paused the
camcorder while recording.
</P>
<P>
   The first frame of each scene shows up as a still picture in an
``album'' on your computer screen. Using your mouse, you drag
images to what is called the ``storyboard,'' recombining scenes in
whatever order you want and omitting the boring stuff.
</P>
<P>
   You can also add in up to 100 different transitions (the new
scene spins out of the old one, for example), fadeouts, 200
different styles of titles, as well as background music (classical,
country, jazz, rock, and so on) or your own voiceover.
</P>
<P>
   You can preview what different editing approaches will look like
before committing to them. When you have finished tweaking the
captured version of your tape, Studio 400 goes to work playing back
the actual version, inserting the special effects you have chosen
and outputting the whole package to your VCR tape. What comes out
is a full-resolution video. Or, if you have the hard-drive space,
you can keep a version on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Pinnacle also says you can use the system to create video to
send to other people by e-mail or post on a Web page and, if you
are daring enough, push the system to use as a sort of video phone
with someone else who has it.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it seems to be much simpler than some of the earlier
approaches to PC-based video editing, but it's not a piece of cake.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Buckingham, an analyst with International Data Corp.'s
desktop multimedia and graphics group, told Computer Dealer News in
a recent survey of the field that many people might find editing
programs a bit frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is, the PC is really not powerful enough for most
video applications, and users are not sophisticated enough,''
Buckingham told the trade magazine. ``Today's PC applications are
kind of like driving a car _ you go left, right, front back. You
add video, and it's like going from driving a car to flying a
plane, in that it requires experience and training to get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andy Fischer, senior analyst with John Peddie Associates of
Tiburon, Calif., asserts in a Pinnacle press kit that because of
its memory-conserving features, ``Studio 400 is the first product
to make basic video editing with transitions, voice- and music-over
and high-quality titling practical for consumers with typical home
computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that, like Hamburger Helper, the ultimate result
will depend heavily on the quality of the ingredients. Unless you
use a tripod and professional lighting, don't expect your videos to
come out looking like a network show _ but they might come out
looking as good as home video spliced into an evening newscast, and
certainly in a more brisk, entertaining package.
</P>
<P>
   Given the cost and complexity of using the system, it might make
a perfect self-serving ``gift'' for a group of siblings, cousins or
friends to give to a technophile: Slip it under Uncle John's
Christmas tree, then give him the treat of paring down your endless
family videos.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, as impressive and versatile as all of Studio 400's
features seem to be, my wife and I have discovered a highly
functional peripheral on our home entertainment system that can
accomplish the level of editing we find we really need.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the pause button, part of the no-name VCR my wife's
father bought her from a mail-order electronics house 12 years ago.
We hook up our camcorder to the TV set, pop in a tape to the VCR
and start recording, then pause the VCR tape when we think Aunt
Sylvia has probably seen enough of little Susannah spooning oatmeal
approximately into her mouth, unpausing before she performs her
next brilliant trick.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great way to turn 60 minutes of adoring parents who can't
stop the camcorder into 15 minutes of video for far-flung aunts,
uncles, and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   But undoubtedly many people far more skilled with electronics
than us will love the chance to trim, rearrange, and transition
their memories. Studio 400 could be a fun, reasonably priced way
for you to play professional videomaker.

ELECTRONIC BANKING GROWING DESPITE LOW-TECH GLITCHES

   Peter T. Szymonik's mailbox gets stuffed with bills, just like
everybody else's. But unlike most of us, Szymonik doesn't haul out
his checkbook and a roll of postage stamps to make his payments.
For Szymonik, a 35-year-old manager at Romac Emerging Technologies,
a consulting and outplacement firm in Manchester, Conn., going to
the bank means going to his home computer and logging onto the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been using on-line banking for almost three years now,''
says Szymonik, ``and would never go back to manual checks.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Bankers Association, about 625 of the
nation's 9,000 consumer banks presently offer some form of on-line
banking, which allows customers to carry out many common
transactions over the Internet, or by dialing into the bank's
private network.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, where Szymonik banks, was one of the first in the
nation to embrace on-line banking back in 1995. Bob Shay, executive
director of global electronic banking for BankBoston, says that
375,000 of his bank's 1.8 million customer accounts _ about 21
percent _ use some kind of on-line banking system. That customer
base, he says, is growing by 50 percent a year ``We're really being
lifted by the consumer move to the Internet,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the early on-line banking systems required dialing into
a private network run by the bank. But today, as millions of
Americans hop onto the Internet, many are finding it is simple to
interrupt an evening's Web surfing to drop by the bank. New York
City market researcher Jupiter Communications estimates that 18
million US households will be banking on line by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Money and computers go together well. For one thing, computers,
designed for record-keeping and number-crunching, are ideal for
keeping track of one's cash. But perhaps more important, money is
largely a computerized concept to begin with. For many years, most
of the world's money has existed, not as stacks of bank notes, but
as data bits stored within computer networks. At last, cheap home
computers and easy Internet access are enabling ordinary people to
handle their money with the same electronic efficiency as large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   On-line banking systems fall into two general categories. You
can sign up for a system, such as BankBoston's HomeLink or Fleet
Bank's Web Banking, that works with any standard Web browser. This
method lets you go on line from practically anywhere to get
up-to-date information about your finances. You can also use this
method to pay your bills and transfer funds among different
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks, including BankBoston, also let the customer
communicate with the bank through a popular money-management
program, such as Intuit Inc.'s Quicken or Microsoft Corp.'s Money
software. These banks have made arrangements to link their computer
systems to a network operated by Intuit.
</P>
<P>
   Users of Quicken and Money dial a number that connects them to
the Intuit network, or they can link up through the Internet. Then
they can download their latest banking data directly into their
software.
</P>
<P>
   But this method forces users to do their banking on the computer
where their banking software is installed. With Web-based banking,
any Internet-linked computer in the world will do. In addition, the
Web-based systems tend to provide more up-to-date information,
while data sent through the Intuit network is generally delayed by
about a day.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Web-based services make it more difficult to keep
permanent records of your data. Users must download a file
containing the data, then import it into a home-finance program.
For those who want an easy way to keep accurate records, it's
simpler to bank directly through their finance software.
</P>
<P>
   Many banks provide basic on-line services free of charge. You
can log on to verify account balances or see if a check has
cleared. But for many users, it's being able to pay bills on line
that makes computer banking worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Banks generally charge service fees for on-line bill payment,
though they will often make an exception for those with large
amounts on deposit. Customers who use a bank's own Web-based
banking system often pay less than those who use software like
Quicken. That's because it costs the bank more money to process
checks through the Intuit network.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with on-line bill payment isn't technology,
but the lack of it. In an ideal world, the entire process would be
electronic. Money would be transferred instantly from your bank
account to the company you're paying. In the real world, it hardly
ever works that way, because very few companies are equipped to
handle direct electronic payments. Instead, the bank must print out
a check and mail it. Ironically, these checks will often take
longer to arrive than if you'd mailed them yourself. Thus, you may
have to pay your bills earlier in the month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many companies ask you to return a coupon with your
check, to help them enter the payment into their computers. You
can't include these coupons when you pay on-line. Many consumers
have had bill payments go astray because of a missing coupon.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, this happens less often as more people use on-line
banking. Meanwhile, major companies are slowly moving toward
so-called ``electronic bill presentment'' systems, that will let
them send bills over the Internet and receive instant electronic
payments through consumer bank accounts. Jupiter Communications
estimates that 15 million households will pay bills this way by the
year 2002. It won't make bill paying any more pleasant, but at
least they won't clutter up the mailbox.

FINDING THE PERFECT SWEET FOR VALENTINE'S DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Will the chocolate you buy your Valentine melt in
his mouth like he melts your heart? Or will he end up in a
dentist's chair?
</P>
<P>
   Will they be as beautiful as she was the first time you saw her?
Or will they appear ``straightforward and dull, like a bad blind
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the National Confectioners Association estimates Americans
will spend more than $1 billion on candy this Valentine's Day, we
arranged a blind tasting of a dozen chocolate assortments, ranging
in price from as little as $5.99 a pound to as much as $43.20 a
pound. And no, when it comes to chocolate, you don't always get
what you pay for. At least not in our tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Champlain chocolates, made in Burlington, Vt., were the
run-away favorites, scoring 87.3 points out of a possible 100. At
$39.26 a pound (but sold in 11-ounce boxes for $27.64) they were
the second most expensive choice. The priciest chocolates in our
sampling, Belgium's Neuhaus at $43.20 a pound ($27 for a 10-ounce
box) ranked sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Godiva, available at nearly every classy department store, came
in second, nearly 20 points behind Lake Champlain. At $31 a pound,
Godiva is a less expensive high-end chocolate but watch out; if you
buy the box with the Valentine's ribbon and faux flower, you'll pay
$35 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Our Best Chocolate Buy came from Lindt, the only Swiss-made
chocolate assortment in the pack, which scored just behind Godiva
at 64.75 points but only costs $18.11 a pound. These beautifully
crafted chocolates looked appealing but most of the judges found
the samples too sweet to garner top honors.
</P>
<P>
   The most stunning in appearance were chocolate wedges from a
California company named Jerbeau. Unfortunately, these Art Deco
delights were a disappointment in the taste and texture categories.
The fillings were described as ``bland,'' ``too intense without
subtlety'' and ``lacking.'' As for texture, ``My dentist will like
this more than me _ I could chip a tooth,'' wrote one judge of the
candy's hard, thick chocolate shell.
</P>
<P>
   Also attractive were Nirvana chocolates. These Belgian-made
confections are available via the Internet at
www.nirvanachocolates.com or by phone at 877-INDULGE. This turned
into the love-it or hate-it collection for our judges and
subsequently scored in the middle of the pack. One judge described
her sample as ``delish, dark and lip-smacking'' while another said
he'd have been ``better off eating a Snickers.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, chocolate for Valentine's Day isn't only for the
women. According to a recent survey by the Chocolate Manufacturers
of America, 65 percent of men would like to receive chocolate, too.
We guess the other 35 percent are still looking for love.

THE ATM'S ONE-STOP FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the day hasn't arrived yet, it seems certain that before too
long kids in America will find it hard to believe you once had to
deal with a human being called a teller to get your money out of
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   With the way technology is evolving, a decade from now children
might find it impossible to imagine that there was a time when all
that automated teller machines gave out was money.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more banks convert to ATMs that use complex touch
screens to execute transactions instead of limited numeric keypads,
an amazing range of possibilities is opening up for the corner bank
machine.
</P>
<P>
   While machines that vend stamps and offer coupons are becoming
more common in Greater Boston, they are only the beginning: Prepaid
telephone cards, theater and movie tickets, ski-lift tickets, MBTA
passes, and gift certificates are among the many other products
banks may be offering.
</P>
<P>
   Besides alternative products, new ATMs could also offer access
to a wide range of information and services, such as trading stocks
and mutual funds, applying for loans and learning the latest news
headlines. ``There's a huge effort going on right now to do what we
call non-cash dispensing,'' says Randy Gearhart, director of ATM
development for BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   The key technological innovation driving expanded ATM use is the
growing prevalence of touch-screen computers, which allow people to
put their fingers on an electrically sensitive surface to select a
transaction from a menu on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The first generation of ATMs, using a 10-digit number pad and
buttons corresponding to four or eight preset actions, have been
necessarily limited to a short menu with options like withdraw from
checking or show balances.
</P>
<P>
   By moving to touch screens, banks can offer unlimited options
beyond just withdrawing money or transferring dollars among
accounts. BankBoston, for example, has moved to touch-screen
technology for more than 750 of its 1,600 ATMs. Those now serve
more than 60 percent of all ATM transactions, according to bank
officials.
</P>
<P>
   One approach is to program machines to have multiple displays
corresponding to financial transactions, ticket purchases, or
information requests.
</P>
<P>
   For the most complicated tasks, touch screens could be
programmed to display a 26-letter keyboard on the lower half of the
screen. That would allow people to use the ATM for complex requests
such as buying 500 shares of Consolidated Amalgamated or
reserv-Continued on next page &QL; 
ing two first-class tickets on the Tuesday flight to Bimini.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Shay, BankBoston's executive director of global electronic
banking, says the ``holy grail'' is to find a universally accepted,
fraud-proof medium for printing a broad range of tickets through
ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, banks would be able to get sports arenas, cinemas,
airlines and other businesses to accept a universal, printable
ticket that might include security features such as a watermark or
hologram to prevent forgery.
</P>
<P>
   While banks are only beginning to exploit ATMs, experiments now
underway suggest the boggling range of capabilities the machines
could soon offer:
</P>
<P>
   --Spanish banks using Diebold machines have begun selling
bullfight and opera tickets.
</P>
<P>
   --Cathay Pacific Airways has begun rolling out ATMs inside
jetliners that allow users to exchange currency or buy cards for
inflight entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   --In Charlotte, N.C., and Orlando, First Union Bank plans this
spring to roll out machines that register a photographic image of
people using the ATM instead of a card to verify their identity
when they cash a check.
</P>
<P>
   By establishing their identity over the phone the first time
they use the machine and having a picture taken, people will later
be able to cash checks on the spot by entering their Social
Security number and having their identity verified through
``biometric'' comparisons made by two cameras. However, customers
will pay a fee of up to $3 per $100 cashed.
</P>
<P>
   --Elsewhere in the world, including England and South Africa,
banks are developing technologies such as retina or thumbprint
scans as an alternative to requiring customers to carry a bank card
with an electronic strip.
</P>
<P>
   --Later this year, BankBoston expects to install modular
printers inside ATMs that will allow people to request, for an
as-yet-unspecified fee, an up-to-the-minute printed bank statement.
The printers will go behind panels that now have a slot the width
of a standard piece of office paper.
</P>
<P>
   --Singapore banks use ATMs to issue checks to customers as a way
of curbing mail fraud and theft of checks. While customers wait for
about 2 minutes, the machine prints up, binds and dispenses a
supply of 15 or 20 personalized checks.
</P>
<P>
   One limitation is that currently, most machines used by
BankBoston and other banks hold four cassettes. Normally, all four
hold money. In machines that sell stamps, one of the four cassettes
is converted to dispense stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The downside to converting cassettes to hold different products
is that it increases the frequency bank employees need to refill
the machine with money, as well as the risk someone trying to make
a withdrawal will find the machine out of service because it has
run out of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economics of getting rid of a cash cassette versus the
number of customers we would serve'' by offering other products
``haven't made a whole lot of sense so far,'' Gearhart says.
``There needs to be demand and there needs to be a business case
for doing it.''

COMPUTERS HELP TEACHERS KEEP IN TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's one of the mantras of education reform in
Massachusetts: better communication among parents, teachers, and
students.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been constant complaints that teachers have no
phones and parents have little time to converse during school
hours. And while teachers want to share lesson plans, they say it
is difficult to communicate with peers from isolated classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Computers that poured into schools during the last several years
were intended to help students learn. While a debate still reigns
over whether that is really working, the machines are now giving
teachers powerful access to parents, students, and each other
through an Internet provider designed only for Massachusetts
educators.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 21,000 teachers have signed up for the $25-a-year
MassEd.Net service, which gives them an e-mail account, personal
Web space and unlimited access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to reach teachers in the classroom,'' says Ed Biggs,
a fifth-grade teacher at the Batchelder School in North Reading. He
says parents now contact him through the service to discuss their
children's progress. He shares ideas, lesson plans, and suggestions
with other teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to drop a short message than to get in touch
with a teacher,'' by phone or other means, he says.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main components of the education reform effort _
getting teachers out of classrooms to share ideas _ has been one of
the largest stumbling blocks. Meanwhile, getting parents more
interested in their children's achievement also has been slow as
teachers have trouble getting in touch with parents during the work
day.
</P>
<P>
   MassEd.Net, which was started last year, is the first program of
its kind in the nation and gives teachers 24-hour free technical
support. The $25 annual fee compares to about $240 for the rest of
the public.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 80,000 educators in the state who are eligible
for the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say a teacher has a whole new curriculum and is teaching
ancient civilization and starting on ancient Egypt,'' says Greg
Nadeau, chief technology officer for the state Department of
Education. ``There are probably a handful of people in
Massachusetts who are trying to start the same unit but the teacher
will never meet them. Now she can send an e-mail to teachers in
certain schools. It transforms the way teachers communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   For David Chuckran, an advanced biology teacher and head of
science for the Bridgewater-Raynham Regional School District, the
system has helped him help students. This quarter, students are
writing about organ harvesting and they must cite at least five
Internet sources. Once students complete the paper they have the
option of sending it to him via e-mail, which gives them an
automatic two-day extension. Students who don't have computers at
home can use school or library computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all choose the e-mail option,'' says Chuckran. ``If they
have any problems as they are working on their papers they e-mail
me and I help them along and answer their quesitons. It's been a
fantastic way of working and interacting with students.'' In
addition, last month, Gov. Paul Cellucci announced a program that
will allow teachers to take college and professional development
courses on-line.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of next year, a grant will pay outstanding teachers
to post up to 1,000 lesson plans on a Web database that other
teachers can access. Eventually, teachers will be able to choose
lesson plans from other teachers. What's more, Nadeau says, they
will be paid for it, just as textbook companies are paid for books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will create a real marketplace of ideas . . . This will be
a richer source than all the textbooks,'' Nadeau says.

SHERRY TURKLE STUDIES THE HUMAN SIDE OF THE SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While most marketers are busy figuring out what e-commerce can
do for people, Sherry Turkle is more concerned about what it is
doing to people.
</P>
<P>
   Turkle, a professor of the sociology of science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has been called an
ethnologist of on-line life, a cybershrink, and the Margaret Mead
of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Exaggerations? Perhaps. But this much is true: As a pundit,
Turkle has carved a national niche for herself as an authoritative
commentator on the existential topic of how the Internet is
transforming people's behavior and sense of self. In 1995, Newsweek
magazine named her in its ``50 for the Future: the Most Influential
People to Watch in Cyberspace.'' In 1997, Time Digital Magazine put
her on its list of the top 50 ``Cyber Elite.''
</P>
<P>
   As millions of consumers flock on-line to do everything from
checking stock quotes to searching for that
</P>
<P>
   1955 Roy Rogers lunchbox, life on the Internet has taken on a
mystical aura. The fascination has led many Internet-watchers to
Turkle's doorstep in search of higher meaning.
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy the masses, she has dispensed humanist perspectives
on one of man's coldest creations. Her books _ ``The Second Self:
Computers and the Human Spirit,'' (Simon and Schuster, 1984) and
``Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet'' (Simon
and Schuster, 1995, $25) _ deal with how computers have changed the
way people interact with the world and view themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Turkle views the world of electronic commerce in philosophical
fashion. One of her recurrent messages: The Internet will not
replace stores, boutiques, shopping malls, and supermarkets.
Instead, browsing on-line will only whet people's appetite for the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Turkle points to ``City of Bits'' (MIT Press), a
book published by MIT colleague, William Mitchell. Viewers can read
the entire book on line for free. Instead of dampening sales,
Turkle posits that the on-line version has boosted sales of the
physical book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has increased the appetite for the book itself,'' Turkle
says. ``People wanted the experience of the book, its
functionality, its ease of maneuverability.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of the shopping experience. ``I sense myself as
a consumer who has access to many, many different kinds of media
for getting information,'' she says. ``I experience the product at
a store. I see it in a catalog in a setting I can fantasize about.
I can go on line to learn more about it, its ratings, its price
points. All this information goes into a purchasing decision, and
increasingly, we are becoming better and better at it. It's
changing the experience of being a consumer. People are becoming
connoisseurs of information.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who see the on-line buying experience as being too
cold, or too dehumanizing, Turkle says the criticism is a red
herring. ``Too often, the computer is compared to what it would be
like living in a small village. They imagine a cafe in France where
people meet daily and you come across the same cast of characters.
They set up a 19th-century ideal and compare the computer to it.
What we're really doing is confronting what we miss most in the
rest of our lives . . . As a mirror for society, it's a very
telling comment.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that yearning for the human touch that will preserve roles
and functions that ought to belong in the human domain.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate, she says, ``I was interviewing an 11-year-old
about artificial intelligence. He said, `When there are robots who
can perform all the jobs, people will still cook the food, run the
restaurant, and have families. I guess they'll still be the ones
who will go to church.' He was saying that you have to accept
computers for what they can do, but that there are still things
that only people can do, like form relationships and develop
spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkle is less sanguine, however, when it came to the subject of
on-line trading of stocks. Likening it to a ``casino atmosphere,''
she cautions against the addictive quality of stock trading that
can lead to financial ruin for individuals. She also worries about
how day trading, as the practice is called, can contribute to, in
fact feeds on, the volatility of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there will always be speculators,'' she says. ``But
as this phalanx of Americans move into day trading, you begin to
create a stock market that feels like a casino. It becomes a closed
game of winners and losers, increasingly disconnected from economic
life.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, Turkle is occupied with a more
down-to-earth topic than macroeconomics. As mother of a 7-year-old
daughter, Rebecca, Turkle is interested in how technology affects
children. Her current research topic: The Furby, a fuzzy,
computerized, mechanized doll that talks, blinks, sleeps and asks
to be fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the conversation is about how `smart' the Furby
is,'' says Turkle. ``But I think the story is not so much what's in
the Furby as what it triggers in the child.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Turkle has observed a crucial difference in how children
connect with a Furby versus a doll that behaves completely
predictably. ``This lack of predictability causes us to see them in
a different light,'' Turkle says. ``In the future, these toys can
socialize us into being used to the idea that machines are not
always predictable and shape the way we relate to them.''

JOE-MAX MOORE EYEING A BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe-Max Moore believes his fortunes are changing. And, he hopes,
the luck of the Revolution is about to take a similar turn.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has spent three frustrating seasons with the Revolution,
and he has had some difficult times with the US national team. But
Moore and Revolution teammate Imad Baba seem rejuvenated after
having spent the last month with the new-look US team, which upset
Germany, 3-0, in Jacksonville, Fla., Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US played extremely well, but it was strange seeing
Germany _ they didn't look themselves,'' said Moore, who entered as
a late substitute. ``I thought we had a good team all along, and we
proved it. It was great the US gained some respect in that game. It
was 3-0, and the score could have been worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Moore and Baba credited coach Bruce Arena with instilling
confidence in the US team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce has the right approach,'' Moore said. ``He told us to
pressure the ball because Germany is not the best in the world on
the ball in the back. The pressure made them cough up a few balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the World Cup, we were timid. But if we had played
aggressively, we would have done a lot better. I don't know how the
guy does it, but Bruce figures out a way to win. The younger guys
are fitting right in, he's playing people in the right positions,
and we're playing attacking soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution gathered for a sendoff party in Cambridge
Wednesday before boarding a flight to Pisa, Italy, where they will
prepare for the Major League Soccer season. They also hope to
change direction under coach Walter Zenga, who replaced Thomas
Rongen last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new year and anything can happen,'' said Baba, who made
his US debut in a 0-0 tie in Bolivia last month. ``I would have had
a chance to start against Chile (in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Feb. 21)
because they are calling only domestic players, but I am going to
stay with the Revolution in Italy. I'll just keep working hard, be
patient, and wait for my chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is going to be very organized and disciplined.
Defense is going to be a priority. But that is what the game
demands now _ there is not a player who doesn't play defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who has scored 25 goals in three seasons, will have a new
partner at striker _ either free agent Ze Rodrigues or Giovanni
Savarese, acquired from the MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say how we'll do until the first game, but we've
made some good changes,'' Moore said. ``I'm excited to start. To be
honest, this team has had some bad luck the first three years, and
this will be a chance to show what we can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no different this year. I thought we had a decent team
last year, but we couldn't figure out a way to win. This community
and these players deserve to win, and this is a fresh start and a
chance to turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have demonstrated little resourcefulness, except
with Zenga involved. So far, Zenga seems to be making the right
moves. Unlike previous offseasons, the Revolution have not
discarded valuable players without compensation or having a
suitable replacement set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter has given us a spark, both as a player and as coach,''
Moore said. ``You know me _ I'll do anything to win. And I'm ready
to give 100 percent to this team.''
</P>
<P>

`HOMICIDE' WEB SITE LINKS FANS TO CYBER PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's late, round midnight. You're scrolling through your
favorite news group, alt.newageritual, and you notice a posting
inviting you to an on-line spiritual revival. You click over to the
Webcast and witness what appears to be a human sacrifice: Right
there on your computer screen, a woman is bound, gagged, and
stabbed by some virtual shaman. What to do? Call the police? E-mail
your service provider? Run anti-voodoo software?
</P>
<P>
   We've seen a baby born on the Internet, witnessed open-heart
surgery, and, gasp, seen Victoria's Secret models walk the runway
in their scanties. Now ``Homicide,'' the NBC police drama set in
the streets of Baltimore, is introducing a serial cyber killer.
It's something of a first in entertainment: Tonight's episode has
been preceded with an on-line counterpart on the Web site,
homicide.com. Earlier this week, the site laid out the plot as part
of its innovative ``Second Shift'' series, an on-line drama
featuring the officers who work at the homicide unit when the
television cops are off duty. On the Web, the ``murder'' appears to
be virtual performance art, as if shock artist Chris Burden
performed his mutilation antics on line.
</P>
<P>
   But in this television episode, it turns out that the murder is,
in fact, real. There is what one detective calls a ``temporal
being'' _ that is, a dead body. When one voyeuristic witness finds
out that it wasn't a hoax, he stammers, ``Oh man, oh man, that's so
. . .'' _ a long pause _ ``it's so cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Homicide'' folks are on their way to a skillful merger of
the two media. The prelude on the Web serves as a sly appetizer,
with a few neat tricks that draw you into the story and leave you
hungry for more. The payoff comes in the television episode, where
the images from the Web site become clues to solving the murder.
The criminal is a hacker in more ways than one, spoofing the
investigators with fake e-mail addresses and other cyber-jinks.
Some of the detectives are savvy to cyberspace (Bayliss has his own
home page, but Giardello can't even use a calculator). As the
suspense grows, they learn to navigate what one character refers to
as the realm of the ``Internuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard-boiled detectives become hard-wired, and that's a good
thing. It's also exactly the kind of merger that executives in both
the television and Internet industries have been scrambling to
achieve. In Net speak, they call it convergence. Plenty of TV shows
have complementary Web sites, but for the most part, they're
digital fan clubs where folks can buy T-shirts and read bios of the
stars. ``Homicide'' goes a step further. ``I'd like the viewer at
home to see that NBC shows do not just begin and end with the
television tube,'' says Tom Hjelm, director of interactive
programming and executive producer for NBC Digital Productions.
``In the early days, we were seen as a pretty alien bunch,'' he
adds, referring to the on-line group. ``But now I'd like to see an
interactive writer or producer sitting down at the table when the
shows are conceived.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, limits to convergence. ``It's hard to do a
chase scene on line,'' says Ayelet Sela, ``Second Shift'' writer
and producer. ``But you can break down the fourth wall on line,
which you can't do on television.'' In past ``Second Shift''
stories, users could read the detectives' notes, search for clues,
play desktop sleuth.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Homicide'' has a loyal _ perhaps even obsessive _ fan
base, and viewers don't necessarily need streaming audio and video
as an incentive to watch the show. So what's the value for the
viewer? It makes the experience more immediate, giving you the
feeling that you have inside information before the show starts.
Interactive theater productions like ``Nicholas Nickleby'' were the
rage back in the '80s, precisely because they made audience members
feel as if they mattered. And early users of the Internet (back in
the days when you had to type in commands on a phosphorescent
screen) remember feeling as if they were members of a secret club
every time they logged on. It gives everyday Judys and Joes the
sense that they're a part of the program.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the networks? Why is convergence the Next Big
Thing? ``I would like to see us continue to build a business around
this,'' says Hjelm. ``Second Shift,'' after all, has a corporate
sponsor. Take a guess who it is. Think hard. Consider: You have to
use the Windows Media Player to access the video version on line,
and Macintosh users can only view a text version of the ``Second
Shift'' script.
</P>
<P>
   Did I hear you say Microsoft? You're a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence, as the witness said, is cool _ unless you're one of
those stubborn folks who continue to polish their Apple at home. Oh
well. The television episode was designed to stand on its own, but
the on-line segment certainly enhances the plot and it wraps up on
line next week. Will they do it again?
</P>
<P>
   Probably, says ``Homicide'' coproducer Sara Charno, adding,
``When eight-track tapes came out, everyone thought that was the
wave of the future. No matter what the medium, whether it's a movie
or television or the Internet, it's still about telling a story.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the wave of the future. Remember time capsules, those quaint
collections of memorabilia folks would bury in the ground to be
uncovered in the next millennium? Well, the folks at MIT's Sloan
School of Management have created a time capsule of their own,
which they say they are ``sealing in the cornerstone'' of the
school's updated Web site. (It's actually an icon on the site, and
the information is stored in the server.) The goal is to capture a
digital snapshot of the Internet as it exists today and have a few
laughs (and gasps) five years from now when the capsule is
reopened. The capsule covers a broad sociopolitical range, with Web
sites about e-commerce and merger mania, the impeachment
proceedings and anti-pornography campaigns, women's empowerment and
Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   MIT has also solicited predictions from folks like UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan and Governor Paul Cellucci (who makes obligatory
comments about education). For the rest of the year, browsers can
add their own prophecies to the capsule, which is at
mitsloan.mit.edu.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions by the likes of Martha Stewart and Bill Gates will
not be divulged until 2004, when the capsule is opened, and we're
holding our breath to learn what they have to say about wallpaper
and world dominance.

PRICE-BUSTING PCS BRING COMPUTERS TO THE MASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To judge by all the attention it has garnered, Apple Computer
Inc.'s sleek, colorful iMac might seem to be the most significant
high-tech hit of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. Another computer, introduced late last year
with almost no fanfare, is selling almost as quickly as the iMac
and may wind up playing a bigger role in the history of computing.
</P>
<P>
   It's called an eMachine. It's everything the iMac isn't:
bland-looking, technically unsophisticated, and cheap. Very cheap.
Some models cost just $500, including monitor. That's half the
price of the least expensive iMac.
</P>
<P>
   And that has made all the difference. Solely on the strength of
Sunday newspaper circulars and word of mouth, eMachine has become
one of the nation's best-selling computer brands, and a harbinger
of an era when personal computers will be as cheap and commonplace
as television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the beginning of what I'll call a structural
change in what PCs cost,'' said Stephen Dukker, chief executive of
eMachines Inc., the US-based, Korean-owned company that makes the
computer. ``There's a whole area of $800 to $1,500 machines that
are going to disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic cut in the cost of a computer could finally transform
the PC from a luxury into just another home appliance, making it
affordable to nearly everyone. That was Microsoft Corp.'s goal when
it bought WebTV, a company that makes a $300 box that pumps the
Internet into a TV set. Oracle Corp. also took a swing with its
Network Computer for the home. Neither product is a full-fledged
personal computer, and neither has been embraced by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But prices of computer parts such as processors, hard drives,
and memory chips have plunged in recent years, even as these
components become much more powerful. As a result, it is now
possible to make a true personal computer that is about as cheap as
a WebTV unit, but powerful enough to meet the needs of the average
user.
</P>
<P>
   That's eMachine's market, and by going after it, Dukker thinks
his company is helping to slice the computer industry into two
sharply defined segments: costly high-performance machines and
mass-market models.
</P>
<P>
   Mass-market PCs could also change the face of the Internet,
allowing users with lower incomes to join the mostly affluent
denizens of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Industry giants such as IBM Corp., Compaq Computer Corp., and
Dell Computer Corp. have long competed on price. But all have
costly sales and distribution channels to support, so they don't
want prices to fall too far, too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have offered PCs at similar prices as promotional
gimmicks. IBM had a $599 computer available in limited quantities
last Christmas. Other firms, such as PrecisionTec LLC of Costa
Mesa, Calif., offer ultracheap machines by mail order. But
eMachines' sole focus is the low-end market, and it has succeeded
in getting shelf space in many of the nation's leading electronics
retailers, including Circuit City and Best Buy. America Online, the
world's largest on-line computer network with 15 million members,
also features eMachines in its computer retailing forum.
</P>
<P>
   The company that makes eMachines was founded just five months
ago and expects to turn a profit this quarter. It hopes to sell as
many as 2 million computers this year and rake in $1 billion, which
would make it one of the fastest-growing companies in history.
</P>
<P>
   It all started with a long distance phone call. Dukker, a former
executive at retailer CompUSA, had moved to a rival firm, Computer
City. In June, when CompUSA announced it would purchase Computer
City for $275 million, Dukker's career prospects seemed dim.
Apparently the same thought occurred to Jung Koh, chief executive
of Korea Data Systems, a leading maker of computer monitors and an
old friend.
</P>
<P>
   Koh phoned Dukker and asked if he was interested in a possible
business venture. Why not? Dukker figured. ``I went off to Korea
and had some discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dukker served up an idea that had come to him a few months
earlier as the result of an experiment at Computer City. The
company ran a sale of ultracheap personal computers at $599 each,
for a limited time. Dukker wasn't surprised that the computers sold
quickly. But something else happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of these buyers was very different,'' he
recalled. When Computer City sold a typical $2,000 computer, 10
percent to 12 percent of the customers brought them back. But the
return rate on the cheap machines was much lower, 4 percent to 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal reason for the lower return rate,'' Dukker said,
``was the customer could afford the purchase.'' Time and again,
customers who had spent two grand would return a machine when they
saw it down the street for $100 less. Some would exchange an
expensive machine the week after they bought it, because an even
faster one was now available.
</P>
<P>
   But the buyers of cheap machines tended to be satisfied with
what they had. They didn't expect state-of-the-art performance, and
they knew they had a good price. So they kept the computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole behavior toward the machine became a whole lot more
like an appliance,'' said Dukker.
</P>
<P>
   That gave him an idea, one which Koh quickly embraced. Dukker
and Koh began discussions with TriGem, a Korean maker of computers
and computer parts, and drew up a business plan. Dukker believed
that if they could make the machines both cheap and reliable, the
low return rate would ensure a slim but acceptable profit margin.
</P>
<P>
   Incorporated in the United States, eMachines started business on
Sept. 1. By October, the company had begun making 150,000 computers
at a TriGem plant in Korea, with monitors supplied by KDS.
</P>
<P>
   Dukker worked his retail-industry contacts and persuaded the
Best Buy, Office Depot, Fry's, and MicroCenter chains to carry the
computers, but he was terrified. ``I was waking up in a sweat and
saying, `Oh, my God, I've got to sell 150,000 computers in the next
two months.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He needn't have worried. By year's end, consumers had purchased
180,000 of them. This quarter, eMachines aims to sell 300,000 more.
Market research firm Ziff Davis Infobeads of La Jolla, Calif.,
found that eMachine was the sixth-best-selling computer brand at US
retail stores in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing it with price,'' said Infobeads analyst Matt
Sargent. While ``eMachine's average price for the month of December
was just over $400 . . .the average price for the market was over
$1,000,'' Sargent said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers love the low price of the eMachines, but retailers
also love them because they sell so fast, Sargent said. PCs have
almost as short a shelf life as hamburger, and dealers lose money
unless they can move the merchandise quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, cheap is not enough. The eMachines have to work, and
work they do. They're far from state-of-the-art machines, but the
various models contain reliable low-end processors from National
Semiconductor Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., as well as
Intel Corp.'s cut-rate Celeron chips. A built-in graphics chip
comes from ATI Technology Inc., one of the industry leaders, and
hard drives are supplied by Seagate Technology Inc. and Korea's
Samsung Electronics Co.
</P>
<P>
   The eMachines haven't been on the market long enough to assess
their long-term reliability. But some early customers say they're
delighted with their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I buy another one? You bet!'' said Ruth Sams, a senior
programmer at Florida State University. Sams beefed up the memory
of her eMachine to 96 megabytes from the standard 32 megabytes and
put in a better graphics card, but figures she still saved money on
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Her eMachine will soon be obsolete, but so what? ``For $499,
I'll just keep upgrading every year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Freeman, an IBM employee in Longmont, Colo., picked an
eMachine when he needed a second computer at home. ``No system that
IBM offers can touch the price,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these computer-savvy buyers aren't the only customers.
Dukker says that 56 percent of eMachine buyers have never before
owned a computer, and 35 percent of them have household incomes
below $30,000. In his view, the eMachine is tapping a whole new
market, made up of people who could never before afford a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody is convinced there's a future in supercheap
machines. Brian Connors, IBM's general manager of consumer systems,
said his company would continue to stress overall product value,
rather than just a low sticker price.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that eMachines isn't even a year old yet. ``What
happens if eMachines goes away a month from now, two months from
now, a year from now? With IBM, you know we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM made the same argument in the 1980s when an unknown startup
called Compaq began offering knockoffs of IBM's then-dominant
desktop machines. Soon hundreds of other firms leaped into the
market for ``cloned'' PCs, savaging IBM's profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks eMachines alone will have a vast impact on the
market. But if the company can sell $500 computers at a profit,
others will certainly follow. And that would permanently reshape
the computer industry, whether the big boys like it or not.

IN AUSTRIA, RACING IS A NATIONAL COMMITMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colorado _ ``Immer Wieder Immer Wieder Oesterreich!'' You
hear it again and again and again . . .
</P>
<P>
   It is a kind of fight song that translates, ``Once More
Austria.'' It is sung by day at the slopes, at night in the bars,
again and again and again . . .
</P>
<P>
   It is not that people here are tired of the Austrians, whose
skiers dazzle on the slopes and dominate the World Alpine
Championships, World Cup, and just about every event in which they
compete.
</P>
<P>
   Both the skiers and their fans from the small Alpine nation
sandwiched between Germany and Italy are happy, high spirited, and
fun to be with. But a newspaper headline in an Austrian daily,
faxed to the Vail press room last Monday said it all: ``Where is
the Competition?''
</P>
<P>
   With three events to go, nine more medals to be won, it's
anyone's guess how much more the Austrians will take home from
these World Alpine Skiing Championships. At this point, they own 10
of 18 medals and are odds on to take a healthy chunk of the rest,
with a reasonable potential of winning six more.
</P>
<P>
   And while ski race fans who have poured into the Vail Valley by
the tens of thousands to watch the racing this month, there's a
hint of the kind of ennui heard among New York Yankees baseball
fans last summer. ``Ho hum, another win. Where can they go from
here?''
</P>
<P>
   So if the question remains as to whether any of the 21 other
nations can become a factor, a more fundamental one is how the
Austrians got to be so dominant.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Austria leads the Nations Cup with 1,060 points
over its nearest challenger, Norway, which has 380.
</P>
<P>
   Hermann Maier leads the overall World Cup men's standings, and
Austrians also hold five of the other top 10 spots. Women's overall
is led by Alex Meissinitzer, and the team holds four top 10 places.
</P>
<P>
   Austria leads women's downhill rankings, and the men occupy six
of the 10 top spots, though Norway's Lasse Kjus stands on top.
Austria has the top spot in every other discipline for both women
and men, and many of those lists have four to six Austrians in the
top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this year, Austrians been the first seven finishers in a
race, and in Innsbruck last Dec. 20, the men rewrote the history
books by taking the top nine places in a Super-G World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   While their lead over the perennially weaker ski teams may be
understandable, ski race fans are asking, where are the Swiss, the
Germans, the French?
</P>
<P>
   Swizerland once fielded dominant teams with champions such as
Pirmin Zurbriggen, Peter Mueller, Marisa Walliser, and Vreni
Schneider. Has the rest of the ski world dried up, or is Austria
just that much better?
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Germany's Katja Seizinger dominated the world of
women's speed events, but she and others have been swept away by a
foursome of hot Austrians _ Renate Goetschl, Michaela Dorfmeister,
Alex Meissnitzer, and Stefanie Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   Said Goetschl after her gold medal performance in the downhill
here this week: ``In our country, ski racing is the number one
sport. Every Austrian child grows up dreaming of being a great ski
champion, seen on TV all over the world. It is like basketball or
football in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, according to figures from ORF, the primary television
network in Austria, more than 2 million viewers watched live
coverage of Maier's gold medeal run in the downhill, and about the
same number watched the Austrian sweep of the Super-G and downhill
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone at home is watching the big races,'' said Goetschl.
``There will be big parties in everyone's home.''
</P>
<P>
   But again, how did Austria come to dominate the world of ski
racing so thoroughly? To some it is merely a question of cycles,
and the Austrians are on top at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   But those closer to the sport see a much deeper structural
reason. ``There is no team that puts in so much government money
and support,'' says Patrick Lange, a spokesman for the World Cup
tour, which was founded by his father, Serge, more than 25 years
ago. ``Look around at the races. They have more trainers and
coaches. Their country gives much more support to their skiers than
any other.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not just on the top levels of world competition.
According to Michaela Dorfmeister, an Olympic medalist who took a
silver medal in Sunday's downhill. ``Every kid competes when
they're ready, and the competition is very great. It is hard to
make the top. Every kid wants to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   How the Austrian Ski Federation once cut its star, Maier, and
then ignored him as he progressed in skiing may seem unclear in the
US, which produces so few ski racers of truly top rank. But the
adage about the Austrians _ that the top 10 skiers cut from the
national team could win races on World Cup _ is rarely in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Maier was unnoticed as he matured, but only that
before he exploded on the scene in 1997 winning every race he
entered, he was simply one more great Austrian ski racer who had to
fight his way up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real competition for the Austrians,'' says Bruce Gartner,
a former Austrian racer who now coaches the Canadian downhill team,
``is among themselves, making it onto the team for any given
event.''
</P>
<P>
   For the very top skiers such as Maier and Goetschl with high
World Cup points, there is no problem holding the spot. But while
most athletes in Vail came to race, the Austrians sent 14 skiers to
the Worlds with very few open spots.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while Maier, Hans Knauss, and Werner Franz hold three of
four spots on the downhill team, five skiers trained all week
competing for the single remaining slot.
</P>
<P>
   Spots are sometimes filled at the last minute. Because he had a
higher rank than Knauss, Christian Mayer was slotted to race the
Super-G Sunday. But Knauss who has been hot lately, was picked by
coaches ahead of Mayer without comment. He won the bronze medal.
``It's hard to look bad when your team is skiing the way they
are,'' says Gartner.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Austrians continue to rewrite the record books
every time out, no one is about to question the autocratic coaching
staff, the development team practices, nor even the strict pressure
that doesn't allow developing skiers to do anything else but ski.
</P>
<P>
   No one even seriously complains about hearing yet another day of
``Immer Wieder, Immer Wieder Oesterreich'' accompanied by an oompah
band and clanking cowbells at the finish of another
Austrian-dominated ski race.
</P>
<P>
   As chief of press John Dakin predicted some weeks back: ``These
Worlds could turn into an Austrian circus.''

DE LA HOYA ON EQUAL FOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oscar De La Hoya needed no reminders of what he will
be facing Saturday night, but they were only three seats away from
him at the Las Vegas Hilton so they could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   No more than a long jab away sat Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas
Hearns, two men who had a terrible confrontation in this city 18
years ago that forever defined who they were.
</P>
<P>
   After a long struggle, Leonard carried the day because Hearns
was carried from the ring. Forevermore, Ray Leonard was seen as the
No. 1 welterweight of his time and Hearns merely his backup. Now De
La Hoya approaches such a moment Saturday night when he tries to
defend the World Boxing Council welterweight title from the
challenge of an equal, former World Boxing Association champion Ike
Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   Although De La Hoya is the betting favorite, both men are
undefeated, just as Leonard and Hearns were that night, and both
have strong support from their partisans. Many believe Quartey will
prove too strong for a fighter who has already won five world
titles in four weight classes, just as people once believed Hit Man
Hearns would hammer out Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   This fight is being seen as the ultimate moment for De La Hoya,
the first real test of his mettle in a 29-fight career in which he
has won 17 title bouts and become the biggest non-heavyweight draw
in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Title bouts and ticket sales are not enough to satisfy fight
fans, however. Greatness in the ring must be measured by more than
that. It must be decided by an opponent as dangerous as you are.
</P>
<P>
   For perhaps the first time in his career, De La Hoya knows he
has such an opponent, so when he speaks of Quartey, it is with
respect, not faint praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be a man,'' De La Hoya said. ``I can just go in and
brawl, but is that the smart thing to do? I got to figure something
out, because if he connects, he can knock me out, and if I connect,
I can knock him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dangerous fight, but I wanted it. If I hadn't, I
would be fighting some schmoe. I needed this. I was losing my
focus. I need dangerous fights now to stay motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   When you are a five-time world champion by the age of 25,
finding motivation to face opponents you know you will overwhelm
does not come easy.
</P>
<P>
   Since he's already made millions, money alone can no longer
motivate De La Hoya, and his growing fame is not enough. Something
else is required now, after 29 straight wins _ the kind of moment
Leonard and Hearns can still recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1981, I had the pleasure of facing Thomas Hearns,''
Leonard said. ``He defined me as a fighter, and vice versa.
Saturday night will propel one of these guys to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya knows only one can go to that level. The other may do
well, as Hearns has, but Hearns can never be Leonard, because when
their night came, he was defeated. So, many victories later, that
still cannot be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being here with Ray Leonard brings back bad, bad, bad,
bad memories,'' Hearns said. ``It's just a hurting thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second fight (a draw many years later), everyone knows I
beat the everything out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Both laughed at that, but they were the laughs of one winner and
one loser, and each understood it.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya listened as the two spoke Wednesday, looking at them
and then at Quartey across the room, knowing one of them is now
destined to be Leonard and the other Hearns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't wait for this,'' De La Hoya said. ``I know what
kind of opposition I am facing this time. The six years I have been
in profesional boxing were all preparation for this night. This is
the first true test of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya knows that if he passes that test, he will
remain the Golden Boy, the Ray Leonard of his time. But if he does
not, he knows his fate as well.
</P>
<P>
   If he does not defeat Quartey, all that has preceded Saturday
night will be diminshed and he will become, like Thomas Hearns, a
silver medalist on the biggest night of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the danger,'' De La Hoya said flatly. ``I needed it.
Now we see what happens.''

BIDDER'S GRAND PRIZE IS DAN DUQUETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ I own Dan Duquette. He's mine. All mine. Bought him
myself. For a mere $1,050, I get to sit in Dan's Executive Box at
Fenway Park during a Red Sox game this season _ and I get to bring
three guests.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Maybe I'll bring Leroy and Shirley Vaughn, plus one of the
Hendricks brothers. Or maybe Jim Leyritz and his wife will be free
for hors d'oeuvres and drinks with Dan. Wonder if Butch from the
Cape would like to join us. The possibilities are endless.
</P>
<P>
   (italsOExcuse me, Dan, my beer's getting a little low. And while
we're watching Jose Offerman hit, could you bring Leroy and Shirley
some more pretzels, please?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   The event was the annual Genesis Fund Celebrity Ski Classic last
weekend at Attitash Mountain in North Conway, N.H. A Saturday night
live auction was among the weekend highlights, and it was there
that I succumbed to the temptation of checkbook journalism.
</P>
<P>
   As we stood around before dinner perusing the list of auction
items (golf with Jay Miller at the Cape, serving as Celtics ball
boy for a night, John Elway's autographed helmet), one entry jumped
off the page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let Fenway Park and Dan Duquette treat you like a VIP for a
day! You and three friends will be in Dan's box. You will also be
outfitted with Red Sox hats, shirts, and other goodies!''
</P>
<P>
   This was too good to be true. Generous Dan was offering up an
ultimate Red Sox fantasy, no doubt confident that the bid winner
would be either a wealthy nonfan trying to impress friends or a Red
Sox lifer who'd be ecstatic at the opportunity just to meet Dan and
watch a game with him.
</P>
<P>
   I had other ideas. Here was a chance to hold the elusive Sox
general manager hostage for three hours. This would be like hopping
on a Florida-bound aircraft and discovering J.D. Salinger in the
adjacent seat. I'd have three hours to break through the veneer and
learn the truth. Three hours to find out what makes the man tick.
And he can't get away.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy. The bidding (Channel 5's Mike Lynch was guest
auctioneer) started at $350. I was first to raise my arm. The Duke
was sitting at a nearby table, and I'm told he blanched. But I had
warned him. In the name of truth, justice, and making Duquette
squirm, it had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one other serious bidder, and I still believe he
was a Red Sox plant _ contracted to keep me away like those
cardboard cutouts who were hired to stand in line and obscure the
truth at the rigged Patriot public hearing in Hartford. The bids
went up in increments of $50, and I got a little nervous when we
cracked the four-figure barrier, but there was no going back by
then. When I topped my nemesis's $1,000 bid, he went to his dessert
fork.
</P>
<P>
   Going once, twice, sold.
</P>
<P>
   After my winning bid, Duquette started chasing every auction
item that would take him out of town this summer. I think Dan now
holds about eight tickets to Paris and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Too late. The Genesis Fund (a nonprofit organization that
provides for the specialized care and treatment of New England-area
children born with birth defects, mental retardation, and genetic
diseases) has $1,050, and I've got a signed note from Duquette that
reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``This letter entitles the bearer and three guests to attend a
Boston Red Sox home game in the evening as the guest of Red Sox
general manager Dan Duquette at a mutually agreeable date in his
Executive Box at Fenway Park in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   May 7 would be OK with me. That's the night Mo Vaughn makes his
return visit to Fenway with the Anaheim Angels. I'd also settle for
any night when Roger Clemens pitches. Or the All-Star Game _ if Mo
starts at first base for the American League Nine.
</P>
<P>
   I've yet to contact any of my friends who are lifelong Sox fans
and would gladly give me a new car for an opportunity to badger
Duquette for three hours during a Sox game. Of course, it wouldn't
be fair to make a profit or to take advantage of Dan's genorisity
toward a worthy charity.
</P>
<P>
   But it sure sounds like fun. It almost makes me wonder what it
would take to buy Bob Kraft for the night. Imagine eating shrimp
and drinking champagne in Bob's box, watching the Pats and the
Bills with my three pals Tom Finneran, Bill Parcells, and Ralph
Nader. The bidding for that one would probably start at $350
million.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only a dream. This is reality. And I own Dan
Duquette. Three friends and I. For one game.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)What about Robinson Checo, Dan? What were you thinking?
What about Statman? And Dwayne Hosey? Dan, I don't see any nachos
here. Do you see any nachos?(unitals)

VIDEO ALTERNATIVES TO THE OLD LOVE STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rhett and Scarlett, Rick and Ilsa, Yuri and Lara _ blah, blah,
blah. You've seen ``Gone with the Wind'' 1,000 times before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casablanca''? A million. ``Doctor Zhivago'' clocks in at
somewhere around 100, minus that time you fell asleep during Yuri's
trek across the Siberian wasteland. (Remember the ice in his beard?
Man, that's harsh.)
</P>
<P>
   Not to slag any of these cinematic exemplars, but let's get
real. You've watched the classic romances. You know what happens in
them. You've done them, baby. And come Valentine's Day, you'll be
looking for something a little bit different. The question is,
what?
</P>
<P>
   Here's the answer: 10 alternate rentals for Sunday viewing. Some
are old; some are new. Some are happy; some are blue. But all are
prime Valentine material.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best Brazilian-French romance based on an ancient Greek myth:
``Black Orpheus'' (1959). Orfeo and Eurydice, doomed as ever, lust
and lose each other amid the sensual swirl of a Rio carnival.
Unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best cool-jazz romance acted by cartoon dogs: ``Lady and the
Tramp'' (1955). Lady, a blue-blooded spaniel, falls for Tramp, a
rough-hewn mongrel. The spaghetti scene's a charmer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best prickly screwball romance featuring witty divorced people
who really seriously honestly do love each other: ``The Awful
Truth'' (1937). Cary Grant and Irene Dunne bicker, divorce,
sabotage each other's love lives and ... well, you know. Hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best platonic love story mixed with a lovely gay romance:
``The Object of My Affection'' (1998). Girl loves guy loves guy:
heartbreaking and smart.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best teen romance disguised as a goofball Scottish comedy:
``Gregory's Girl'' (1981). Gawky geek gets crush on gal, finds tru
luv elsewhere. Marv.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best touchingly unconsummated reverse-Cinderella romance:
``Roman Holiday'' (1953). Princess Audrey Hepburn slums it in Rome
for a day with inkslinger Gregory Peck. Yummy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best adult romance disguised as a Woody Allen movie: ``Annie
Hall'' (1977). Nervous Alvy woos Annie, in the mannishly dressed
form of Diane Keaton. Primo Woody, and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best snot-sobs-and-drool romantic tearjerker (old): ``Dark
Victory'' (1939). Bette Davis has cancer! George Brent loves her!
She dies!
</P>
<P>
   _ Best snot-sobs-and-drool romantic tearjerker (recent):
``Shadowlands''(1993). Debra Winger has cancer! Anthony Hopkins
loves her! She dies!
</P>
<P>
   _ Best, most exultantly romantic Shakespeare adaptation: ``Romeo
and Juliet'' (1968). Dreamy Franco Zeffirelli version, with actual
teen-agers in the leads. True beauty, indeed.

PATRIOTS NOT IN THE MARKET FOR HIGH-PRICED PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ While the Patriots waited for more
definitive news on running back Robert Edwards, who will be
transported to Boston from Honolulu this weekend for further tests
on his surgically repaired left knee at Massachusetts General
Hospital, coach Pete Carroll said Wednesday the team's salary cap
predicament prohibits spending big money on free agents and that
training camp and practices will become more physical.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that defensive end Ferric Collons, whose salary is
scheduled to skyrocket from $535,000 to $2.1 million, will be
released in the next 48 hours to create some room, and that Drew
Bledsoe's contract may be restructured to make it more cap-friendly
for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The team is $5 million-$10 million over the $57.288 million
salary cap for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Patriots are concentrating on re-signing center
Dave Wohlabaugh and defensive tackle Henry Thomas while hoping they
also can fit Larry Whigham, Tom Tupa, and Todd Collins on their
payroll after the free agent signing period begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the possibility the Patriots will designate
Wohlabaugh their tranistion or franchise player in hopes that would
deter other teams from pursuing him.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll wants Tupa back but doesn't know if the Patriots can
beat potential offers from other suitors, including the Jets and
the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa, considered one of the best punters in the NFL, was
somewhat miffed a deal with New England didn't get done earlier.
</P>
<P>
   There's growing speculation that Tupa won't take long to decide
to sign with his hometown Cleveland expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa was coached by Chris Palmer, the Browns head coach, in New
England and thinks highly of him. He even attended the press
conference at which Palmer was introduced as the Browns' coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots must also deal with their restricted free agents,
mainly linebacker Tedy Bruschi and kicker Adam Vinatieri. Both will
likely see big increases and will receive high tender offers of
more than $1 million. While Carroll would love to have Collins
back, he may not be able to keep both Bruschi and Collins and the
team may have to seek a linebacker in the draft to replace Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Besides releasing Collons, the Patriots won't re-sign defensive
lineman Mark Wheeler, and though they want wide receiver Vincent
Brisby to stay, he would have to agree to have his contract
downsized, which at present he's not willing to do.
</P>
<P>
   As for the running back situation, Carroll said the team is
already exploring free agent and trade possibilities in the wake of
Edwards's injury last week in Honolulu, which could keep him out
for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the Dolphins were close to a deal to acquire Tyrone
Wheatley from the New York Giants, which likely would make
restricted free agent Karim Abdul-Jabbar expendable in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   While Carroll sounds as if he doesn't think Scott Zolak will
return as backup quarterback, the coach spoke highly of him and
didn't want to rule out his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott won a big game for us against San Francisco, and then we
struggled the last two games,'' said Carroll. ``We'll look to see
if we can improve the competition in free agency. Last year we
explored some people who were out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they investigated Jim Everett, who was Patriots
offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese's quarterback with the Rams.
Everett could be a candidate in New England, as could former Boston
College quarterback Glenn Foley, whom the Jets are expected to
release. Foley played under Carroll with New York in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   There is also some uncertainty concerning left tackle Bruce
Armstrong. Two weeks ago, Patriots vice president of player
personnel Bobby Grier said Armstrong ``still has the quick feet to
be able to protect the quarterback from the quicker pass rushers.
Where he's lost a step is in his run-blocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll wasn't quite as direct Wednesday but said, ``As Bruce
enters the later stages of his career, he needs to have a heck of
an offseason. One of the things we want to do is really push him
through the offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is one of the few Patriots who do not take part in the
team offseason conditioning program, despite a $100,000 workout
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll also spoke of the Patriots' younger linemen making a
push for starting jobs in camp, mainly Ed Ellis, the 6-foot-6-inch,
325-pound tackle who may challenge Armstrong or Zefross Moss.
</P>
<P>
   As for his workout changes, Carroll cited the fact that the
Patriots are a young team who perhaps will be getting younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``With younger players,'' he said, ``you can't expect them to
have a backlog of experience to turn to; therefore, they need to be
put in the position to work as hard as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there will be more hitting in training camp, and
there's a chance Carroll will pick his spots and have the team
practice in pads more than once a week.

   Jim Knipfel was 12 when an uncle approached him at a family

   ``Back in 1977, nobody talked about genetics much, at least not
at funerals in small Wisconsin towns. And nobody then could have
predicted that the world would go dark on me while I was still a
reasonably young man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slackjaw'' is Knipfel's account of his experience with
retinitis pigmentosa, a disease that attacks the retina and the
rods and cones that turn light into vision. It is also an account
of rage and pride, punctuated with bouts of boredom, drinking,
petty theft, postmodern lit-crit, punk rock head-banging, and
undiluted self-destruction. In other words, it's a disease book
with an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Knipfel's grim honesty and punchy writing will be familiar to
anyone who has seen his column, ``Slackjaw,'' in The New York
Press, an alternative weekly, or in 'zines on the Web. The book
strings together tales of various cities, with Knipfel as main
character and tragic Greek chorister, taking refuge in alleyways,
bars, and even universities in his journey through Madison,
Minneapolis, Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York City. Wherever
Knipfel goes, however, unexorcized demons seem to follow. After a
gory suicide attempt while studying philosophy at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, he realizes his failing eyesight and
depression-cum-rage are permanently altering him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel my personality mutating in a radical way. I
wasn't the silent, smart kid anymore. I had reopened Dostoevsky's
`Notes from the Underground' and found that his narrator was
speaking all the things that had been pounding through my head _
the paranoia, the rage, the isolation, the fear. '' His
shrink-on-the-cheap gives him some gold-plated advice: Stop trying
to destroy yourself. Turn that rage around and go out and try to
destroy the world.
</P>
<P>
   Knipfel seems content to let the inner felon emerge. ``Something
in me, some high brick wall, crumbled at that moment, some heavy
force floated out of me. On the way back to my apartment that
bitter cold January evening, I balled up my gloved fist and punched
it through a series of windows in an abandoned warehouse. I was
starting to feel much better.''
</P>
<P>
   A shady friend named Grinch teaches him the art of targeted
violence, and gives him the nickname ``Slackjaw,'' which endures as
the title of his column years later. It's open to debate whether
Knipfel is slackjawed from drinking, overthinking, or from his own
passivity.
</P>
<P>
   With a philosophy degree and no discernible job skills, he
embarks on a graduate program at the University of Minnesota in
something called Comparative Studies in Discourse and Society _
``post-toastie criticism,'' as he puts it. While living in
Minneapolis, his somewhat warped relationship with Laura deepens.
When he gets kicked out of graduate school, he follows Laura to
Philadelphia, where he begins writing pieces for a newspaper called
Welcomat. His deepening rage is traced to a lesion on the temporal
lobe of his brain. Anticonvulsants seem to give him some relief,
and his career as a writer begins to take hold. He moves his
column, and angst, to Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Although his field of vision has narrowed and the light has
begun to dim, a terrifying stumble home from the grocery store in
the dark pushes him to the brink. ``It was a slow and agonizing
stretch of sidewalk, an entire block's worth, to my apartment. With
each step I hoped my foot didn't get wrapped in a tree root, a kid,
a front gate, or a garbage can.'' . Finally, it seems, Knipfel is
ready to deal. He gets a cane, and receives what he terms Blind Man
Training from perky agency workers. He streamlines his apartment
and hangs on to his job, two decided pluses for anyone on a mission
of self-annihilation. Knipfel is far too edgy to mellow. But there
may be a final irony in the fact that his blindness has made his
outward gaze at the world somewhat less baleful.

LAPIERRE'S WORKOUTS HELP BRUINS SHAPE UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE

<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Anson Carter thought getting back into the
lineup Tuesday against Edmonton would spare him.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Belanger wanted to know if there was some way to have the
lights at the Saddledome turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Don Del Negro joked that for a fee, he'd be willing to
pull the fire alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of assistant coach Jacques Laperriere, who
put eight Bruins through a grueling 90-minute workout here
Wednesday. Also known as the Marquis de Sade of hockey practice
coaches, Laperriere punished his charges through nonstop drills and
skating that left all of them breathless.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said that if it hadn't been for Laperriere's conditioning
regimen, he would not have felt as strong as he did against the
Oilers in a 2-0 Boston shutout. Carter, who missed 15 games because
of a badly sprained ankle, scored the Bruins' second goal on a
long-range slapper at 10:07 of the third period. Playing most of
the game with Steve Heinze and Joe Thornton, he logged 15 minutes
13 seconds of ice time over 21 shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's played a big part,'' said Carter of the dreaded
drills. ``As much as I hate getting killed by Lappy or Bobby
Francis after practice, the games are so much easier because I'm in
a lot better shape. Nobody really wants to be out there, but we
know at the same time that if we don't put in the work, when we get
a chance to go into a game situation, we won't be in shape enough
to take advantage of our opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said his balky ankle was tested in his first shift but
that overall, it and he held up well in his first game in more than
a month. The biggest beneficiary of Carter's return stands to be
Heinze, who has been in a prolonged scoring slump. At the start of
the season, Thornton was tabbed as the center on the No. 2 line
with Heinze and Carter. Thornton wasn't quite ready then. As the
second-year man was developing, Carter got hurt and Heinze was
bounced around with different combinations. Now, with Carter back
and Thornton much improved, it's possible that unit could emerge in
the role coach Pat Burns envisioned at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he's hoping that's how it works out. He said it has
been painful watching Heinze struggle so much. ``I think I help him
out and I think he helps me out a lot,'' said Carter. ``We're
pretty clear with each other. When I'm out there, he doesn't have
to do too much with the puck. He gets in the slot. I think his
mentality is he gets the puck and shoots the puck. I'll do the
dirty work in the corners. I'll get him in the puck and make the
plays. As long as he puts the puck in the back of the net, I'm
happy with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely tough, seeing him go from the second line to
the fourth line. He beats himself up. He puts so much pressure on
himself to score goals and help the team. I definitely do feel bad
for him when he's not doing well. I'll do whatever I can to pick
his spirits up and get him back on the right track. He's the type
of guy who if he scores one goal, the next thing you know, he has
10 in three or four games. Then he'll go maybe five or 10 without
scoring. We know those streaks are going to happen. It's just that
we have to limit the games in between his scoring goals and we'll
be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   As everyone has seen, including Carter, Thornton has gone from
an unsure youngster to a confident force. ``He's definitely playing
better,'' said Carter. ``We tried harping on that earlier in the
season: Use that big body and be strong on the puck down low, and
no one can control us. That's what is happening now. He's making
good plays down low and he's getting more room for himself because
teams can't handle him.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Darren Van Impe, who was crushed by a thunderous
check courtesy of Oilers right wing Georges Laraque in the first
period, remained in Edmonton Wednesday and was scheduled to return
home to Boston Thursday. The Bruins' medical staff felt Van Impe
would be better off giving his separated right shoulder a day to
calm down rather than subject it to a long flight so soon after the
injury. Van Impe is scheduled to see team doctor Bert Zarins when
he gets back. It's believed he will be sidelined for a significant
period . . . The team recalled defenseman Mattias Timander from
Providence. He is expected to join the Bruins in time for Thursday
afternoon's practice here . . . Forward Peter Ferraro, who took a
shot by defenseman Roman Hamrlik off the top of his left foot while
killing a penalty during the first period, is walking with the aid
of a cane. It's possible the foot is fractured. Ferraro said the
X-ray showed a line that could be a break, and if he doesn't feel
better in the next few days, he'll have the foot X-rayed again.

PIERCE HAS THE FINISHING TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It seems silly to say that Paul Pierce has been doing
anything for a long time. Pierce is 21. His NBA career is four
games old. He is about the same age as Rick Pitino's oldest son,
Michael.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, the temptation is to stop yourself when talking about
the Celtics rookie and long stretches of time. Really, what is ``a
long time ago'' for someone in his 20s? The early years of ESPN?
</P>
<P>
   For Pierce, the answer to that question is simple. Ask him how
long he has been doing certain things and he will tell you they
have been happening as long as he can remember. Pierce has been
having great fourth quarters as long as he can remember.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics fans know he had a 15-point fourth quarter against the
Cavaliers Saturday. They also know about his 11-point fourth
quarter against the Heat Tuesday. But Patrick Roy can go back
further.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a game against Dominguez High,'' said Roy, Pierce's
coach at Inglewood (Calif.) High. ``We were down 30-something in
the third quarter. I don't allow players to say much when they come
to the bench, but Paul said, `Give me the ball.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Roy gave it to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we were down 20 with about four minutes to go,'' Pierce
said Wednesday, recalling the game from his senior year. ``I was
able to string together some pretty unbelievable shots from long
range to get us back in the game. With a minute to go, we were down
3.''
</P>
<P>
   The story did not end perfectly. Inglewood lost the game. But
Roy knew Inglewood High would not be the final stop in Pierce's
basketball career. And Pierce? He isn't quite sure what he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said with a shrug. ``I guess . . . I guess
it's just a gift or something.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of gift that makes people change their stances.
Immediately. Before Antoine Walker saw Pierce play, he speculated
that the rookie would have a hard time starting. That thought ended
fast when Walker stepped on the court with Pierce last summer. And
on Tuesday night, the two were standing in front of a camera at
Miami Arena, smiling. They slapped hands a few times and laughed,
giddy about what they had just done to the Heat. Walker had 31
points, 10 rebounds, and at least three Walker Wiggles. Pierce had
19 points, 7 rebounds, and one chest bump with Walker. The Celtics
won, 108-101, and everyone wanted to talk about Kenny Anderson,
Walker, and the impressive rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that will keep him from greatness is himself,''
Pitino said of Pierce. ``You know, if he gets a big head. That's
the only thing. By the way, I don't think that will ever happen.
He's a humble young man and has it all together. ''
</P>
<P>
   The coach was not finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``He without question has what Antoine has, what Ron (Mercer)
has, what Kenny has. They are not afraid to do things. They're
risk-takers, and you like to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Paul could really be a great, great defensive
player,'' Pitino continued. ``He's so strong and so quick. His
timing is unbelievable. He's kind of an unusual guy. I haven't seen
too many guys like him, guys that all of a sudden catch the ball
and explode. He has uncanny ability that I've not seen too often in
my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino is 46. He was the Boston University coach before Pierce
was a year old. He had his first Final Four team before Pierce was
10. That may not be a long time, either. But for Pitino, it's long
enough to know that he likes what he sees.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mercer was expected to practice with the team Wednesday but did
not. Pitino said he didn't consider that a setback for the guard,
who has a sprained right knee. But the coach did say that Mercer
may not play on the West Coast after all. ``Maybe it will be the
Washington game (Feb. 21),'' Pitino said. ``We don't know right
now. We'll let (trainer) Ed Lacerte determine that.'' . . . Walker
got a day off from practice to rest his back. But Andy Enfield was
working with him on his free throws . . . The Celtics had their
highest grades of the season during the Miami game. Pitino uses a
20-step system to grade games. The Celtics were in the 70s Tuesday.
``If you can stay in the mid- to high 70s in the grading charts,
you're not only going to win but you're a good team,'' Pitino said.
The Celtics had a few games in the 80s last season.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is hard work!'' said Marge Bastos, feet firmly planted as
she wrestled with an show-stopping, 6-foot-tall flower arrangement
framed with bowed and tied branches she dubbed ``forsythia in
bondage.'' It was late at night and 41 centerpieces for a cocktail
party and 66 for President Clinton's fund-raising lunch at the Park
Plaza were still to be done, and her partner, Carlos Colon, was
vacationing in Puerto Rico. On the concrete floor, drifts of
discarded stems and foliage rose like a green tide.
</P>
<P>
   Though a successful florist, Bastos does not fit the standard
image of someone delicately arranging stems of lilies in a pretty
Back Bay flower shop. She has no store window decorated with
flowers and balloons. In fact she has no windows. And no retail
store.
</P>
<P>
   Bastos and Colon run their 15-year-old florist business
Columbine out of a chilly brick warehouse in South Boston around
the corner from Murphy's pub. They are part of an elite but
invisible strata of underground florists who see clients by
appointment only. More craftspersons than shopkeepers, they often
work out of gritty warehouses and lofts, elbow to elbow with the
city's commercial photographers and artists. Yet they provide the
flowers for some of the city's premier social events. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Too new to have a name &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The concept, which began in New York, is still new enough that
there's no standard name for it. Some call themselves studio
florists, or private florists, custom florists, or even warehouse
florists. What they have in common is invisibility and good
word-of-mouth reputations among people who are willing to spend as
much as $25,000 on flowers for a single event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for consumers at the top of the food chain,'' said
William Mizuta, a private florist who works in a 19th-century
former shoe factory on Harrison Avenue in the South End.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their low profiles, Boston's top studio florists, who
number fewer than a dozen, are hardly anonymous. Every major
caterer, hotel, and corporate event planner has their phone
numbers. Town &AMP; Country magazine's survey of the country's best
wedding florists cited both Columbine and Mizuta. Brides on urban
safari pick their way through industrial alleys to consult with
them.
</P>
<P>
   For private florists with such a following, eschewing retail
trade has many advantages. They don't need to maintain a pricey
address or an inventory. They have only to buy the flowers they
need for a particular job. And they don't have to deal with people
who wander in asking for a single red rose, or who want to know why
the $5 bouquet they bought last week died.
</P>
<P>
   In return, custom florists offer their well-heeled customers
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a bride engages us, our efforts are focused on her needs,
with a great deal of attention. She's not just dealing with a
salesperson. I will be there on the site and I will do the design
work,'' said Bastos. ``If you were a bride on February 14, would
you want to engage a flower shop where the phone was ringing off
the hook?''
</P>
<P>
   Pauline Runkle runs Florist Artistry out of a studio at
Manchester-by-the-Sea. ``I like it because I can concentrate on the
event I'm doing without any interruptions. I can't imagine how I
could do a good job if I was doing an over-the-counter business at
the same time.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Affordable rent &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marc Hall recently relocated his ``botanical design'' workspace,
Renaissance Garden, to an old factory building on Summer Street
near the Boston Design Center. ``I have 3,500 square feet at a very
affordable rent with easy access to highways. It's wonderful. I
like the very industrial edge. What we do is wet and dirty. Now I
don't have to worry about ruining hardwood floors because I'm
working on concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine's warehouse space looks charmingly if incongruously
rustic. Dried hydrangeas hang high overhead from copper piping and
a quaint window frame with battered blue-gray shutters from an old
church hangs over a workroom table. It takes a while to notice
there's no real window behind it, only a brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deal in illusion!'' Bastos said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Brides enjoy their excursions to urban warehouses, she said.
``People are savvy today. It's a fun expereience for them and they
feel they're getting something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Where florists rub shoulders with one another is at the
wholesale flower market on Albany Street, which opens at 3 a.m.
``It's very incestuous. You know who your competition is and who
you're bidding against for jobs,'' Bastos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very competitive,'' agreed Runkle. ``It's too bad we
don't have esprit de corps.'' She laughed. ``But of course we don't
get together _ we're all mavericks!''
</P>
<P>
   Not that studio florists work in isolation. For most jobs they
function as part of a team that often includes a caterer, linen
people, and, increasingly, an event planner and a lighting expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about doing events is that I like working on a large
scale,'' said Hall. ``I'm decorating a whole room instead of making
just one arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   Most studio florists stock a large assortment of decorations and
rental props, typically including portable gazebos, fiberglass
columns and urns, silver-toned candelabra, and trellises that can
help convert a hotel ballroom into a formal garden or a woodland
glade.
</P>
<P>
   Bastos will also dip ``cheap old baskets'' into a mix of plaster
and cement to create the look of stone. ``Weddings are getting more
grandiose,'' she said. ``The rise of the studio florist has been in
tandem with the explosion in event planners.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Concept's Boston pioneer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Tommy Rogers, who has since moved on to other
ventures, introduced the studio florist concept to Boston. He was
soon followed by Dominique Cambrio, Bastos, and Colon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us have worked for Winston's,'' said Bastos, who was
formerly a designer for the late Maynard Winston, the grand old man
of Boston floral design. Run today by his four sons, Winston's
Flowers maintains a 40,000-square-foot studio in a one-story
concrete industrial building on Southampton Street in the South End
in addition to its five retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to do everything out of our shops but because our
business and the demand for special-event flowers grew, we needed
an off-premise site. Now we have plenty of space,'' said David
Winston.
</P>
<P>
   Black, red, and purple flowers combined with chartreuse foliage
is the rage now, said Bastos, as she inserted some Black Magic
roses among those bound and tied forsythia branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every bride brings in Martha Stewart's wedding magazine, and
there's a photo of a bride in the current issue carrying a bouquet
of Black Beauty and Black Magic roses mingled together. It looks
really good,'' said Bastos.
</P>
<P>
   She paused. ``Of course, I was doing that before Martha.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, being a florist is no bed of roses.
</P>
<P>
   When Bastos hires strong young men to help her recut and prep
flowers and set up for a big party, ``they think it's going to be
fun and games. But they're exhausted at the end of a day. It's a
hard way to make a living. It's physical, stressful, and you're
dealing with expensive perishable items. I work all the time. But
it gets in your blood. I'm just happy I can make a living working
with flowers.''

LET THE CURE FIT THE GRIME THAT INVADES YOUR HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This winter seems to be the winter of our discontent, with the
invasion of soot, dirt, and all kinds of other black marks and
smudges that are driving some householders bananas. Most of these
smudges are not mold, which is another plague upon New Englanders.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt shows up on the walls and ceilings, but often in long, thin
stripes. They seem to be following the studs in the wall or the
joists in the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is dirt on the wall above the baseboard heaters.
</P>
<P>
   And, most puzzling and most annoying of all, soot appears for no
reason. And it is real soot, oily and very smudgy when you try to
wipe it off. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Those dirty stripes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ordindary dirt, the kind that shows up on the walls in those
funny stripes, is just that. How it occurs is another situation,
and condensation is the culprit. The studs behind the walls are
cooler than the wall itself, and water vapor that builds up in the
house condenses into water on those stud surfaces. The same thing
occurs on the joists above the ceiling. This can occur whether the
house is insulated or not, and while it is not as common as it was
in the days of coal-fired heaters, it still occurs.
</P>
<P>
   There is little water on those stripes; the wall may not even
feel wet, but it is enough moisture to attract dust, which lands on
the damp surfaces and stays there.
</P>
<P>
   The cure is to ventilate the house to keep down the amount of
water vapor in the air. The dirt can be washed off with a good mix
of detergent and water, although walls painted with latex paint can
be difficult to clean. Eventually, if washing does little good,
repaint.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing occurs above baseboard radiators. The warm air
rises, carrying dust with it, and brushes the wall. There may be no
moisture, but the speed of the moving dust tends to make it adhere
to the wall, creating the dirt. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Soot is another problem &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soot is another matter, and seems a mystery to householders.
</P>
<P>
   It can occur several ways: In a house with hot air heat with
oil, the heat exchanger has cracked, bringing soot into the house.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, you will smell burned oil, because the burner
is pouring its exhaust into that cracked exchanger, the fan is
distributing it throughout the house, and there is plenty of soot
with it. In that case, get a new furnace as soon as possible; that
burned oil smell contains carbon monoxide, a distinct hazard to
one's health. There is no cure but replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Lauchley Jr. of Houston took strong exception to this
solution, claiming in a letter that in forced hot air systems there
is always a positive air pressure inside the heat exchanger and
duct system when the system is operating and this positive pressure
precludes combustion products from entering the ducts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the positive air pressure would force the
combustion products to divert from the duct system and there would
not be adverse results for the occupants.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is your argument for your position?''
</P>
<P>
   Only that the handyman's heat exchanger cracked one cold winter
night and,by George, there was a strong odor of burned oil
throughout the house, plus soot around the air vents, which was
enough for the handyman to turn the system off and call for help.
And the help was to get a new furnace. The old furnace was just 20
years old, just out of warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one cause of soot and burned oil smell in the house
is the disconnection of the smokepipe from furnace to chimney. The
cure there, if the pipe has not rusted out, is to reconnect the
pipe. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Other sources of soot &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A house with a boiler and hot-water heat won't have the heat
exchanger problem, but sometimes soot appears for no other reason.
There is a reason. Heavy use of candles creates soot. The cure?
Burn fewer candles, or none at all.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of soot is a fireplace, especially if the damper
is closed before the fire is out.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened to Jim Ellsessar of Rutland (Mass.) who
called to say there was streaking above his baseboard heaters (hot
water radiators) and blackening in the hallway and even soot inside
the refrigerator and microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the refrigerator and microwave? Sheesh! That is
mind-boggling, but it indicates simply that soot and dirt can
penetrate anywhere, especially where there is a difference in air
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The oil man felt that the house was too tight (it's 4 1/2 years
old), said Ellsessar, who admitted that the fireplace damper was
closed before the fire was out.
</P>
<P>
   The oil man wanted to install a ``fan in a can'' in a basement
window, providing the burner with its own air source, said
Ellsessar. Good point. If the burner does not have its own air
source, it is pulling air out of the basement from outside and
possibly pulling air from the house, which would account for the
soot being pulled into refrigerator and microwave.
</P>
<P>
   It never hurts to provide a fuel burner with its own air.
Another way to do it is to run a duct from a window, ending up on
the floor in front of the burner. That way, the basement will not
get overly cold.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsessar made sure the fireplace damper was open when the fire
was going, then cleaned the refrigerator and microwave, and ``the
great soot invasion'' has not occurred again.
</P>
<P>
   The cure is to handle the damper properly and maker sure the
fireplace is working well, delivering exhaust up the chimney and
not into the house. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Right down the chimney &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the soot may appear even when the fireplace is not
going. It has to do with a downdraft in the chimney. This downdraft
is the phenomenon that brings smelly odors down the chimney, to the
annoyance of householders, and sometimes soot with it. It can
happen any time of the year, when the air pressure in the house is
lower than outdoors. The difference in air pressure does not have
to be much at all for air to draft down the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   One cure is to burn a fire in the fireplace, to get the air
moving up instead of down. But we can't do that all year long.
Therefore, you have to stop the downdraft; the damper in the
fireplace might not do it because the closure is loose.
</P>
<P>
   Tight glass doors can do it; so can a large piece of plywood set
tightly against the firebox opening. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The lighted lantern trick &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ed Grant of Beverly had another solution, which he gladly told
us about in a letter. He has a wood-burning stove set up against
his fireplace, with its own smokepipe going into the chimney; the
fireplace damper was removed, and a blank plate set against the
flue opening.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, got a stink from a downdraft when there was an air
inversion and the air outside was heavier than that indoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``My solution is simple, and it works great for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found an old kerosone lantern in my basement. I put two
firebricks on top of the ashes at the base of my stove, and placed
the lantern on the firebricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened the front door of the stove, lit a crumpled
newspaper, set it inside the stove, and closed the door. In a few
minutes, the draft was up the flue. I opened the front door and lit
the lantern.
</P>
<P>
   ``No smoke, no mess, no stink. After a few minutes, the top of
the stove gets a little arm, but never hot. If it gets cold
outside, I take the lantern out, have a wood fire going in just a
few minutes. I run the lantern with just an inch-high flame, which
for me works just right.''
</P>
<P>
   The handyman salutes you, Ed Grant, and so will a lot of people
with this problem. The lantern could work in an empty fireplace, as
well. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cooking oil, too &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy use of oil (any kind) in cooking will create soot, and the
soot can find a way to get into every room.
</P>
<P>
   One caller told the handyman some time ago that soot was
appearing in the first-floor apartment of his three-decker. The
handyman was stumped, until further conversation revealed that the
caller's tenant in the second-floor apartment was Thai, and she did
a lot of cooking with oil.
</P>
<P>
   At least we discovered why the caller's apartment was getting
sooty oil, but the solution was elusive. How can you ask a person
to stop cooking in his or her native style?

CASUALS' `KING' TRAVIS GETS SERIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A person has to have goals, and Chandler Travis _ Cape Cod-based
solo artist, singer-guitarist in the Incredible Casuals, and
frontman/namesake of the big band that is the Chandler Travis
Philharmonic _ mentions these two for 1999: to drink less beer and
to smoke less pot. But, he adds, when he does do these things he
plans ``to do them more intensely.''
</P>
<P>
   The bearded, scraggly-haired Travis is, by nature, a funny,
self-deprecating chap. He brings a sense of humor to his
performance _ in which he might appear barefoot and in pajamas and
strut down the length of the bar _ and he brings it to the table at
the Boston Globe cafeteria during a recent early evening chat.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the interview, during which more than a few
laughs have been had, Travis, 48, turns semi-serious and says, ``If
you could write a whole article without using the words `zany' or
`wacky' I would be ever so grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, can't do. But we can, at least, leave wacky-zany where
he's left it. The problem is, as Travis sees it, is that over the
years his humor has been overplayed and his music has been shorted.
Yes, he admits, ``there is a certain thread of silliness, but
there's a lot of serious work, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Silliness? Well, consider a self-mocking song the CTP does
called ``Chandler Travis, King of the World,'' in which Travis
himself wonders where Travis might be right now and conjectures,
``Probably in his private jet in France / Or maybe backstage right
now having sex with one of the waitresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Desiring to interject a semblance of balance into his career,
Travis has just released a solo album, ``Ivan in Paris,'' a
contemplative folk-pop disc that recalls the introspective side of
Elvis Costello. There's a old-timey feel, a cozy ambience, an
unhurried pace. It's not without wit and it's not without its
skewed moments, but for Travis it's a relative straight-shooter of
a disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea came from my sister,'' says Travis. ``She said, `Why
don't you make a record that's a little more, you know, mature?
That doesn't put people who are over 40 off somehow? Make an album
for your own (expletive) age group for a change.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Travis says, ``I have always written stuff like that, but in the
Casuals I get a chance to pretend I'm 18 as much as I want to. The
Casuals are kind of an age-retarded band. I don't mean that in a
bad way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make a ballad record,'' Travis says. ``And the
record I had in mind was `Interiors' by Rosanne Cash. I love that
album. I wanted to get something that had that kind of moodiness,
that was reflective. My goal was to have something that you could
play all the way through late at night and not have to jump up and
take anything off. I couldn't quite do that. I put together 50
minutes and it was a little bit dull, so I but in a couple that
were a little more up-tempo, just to make it so you could not get
bored.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am proudest of, of what I do, is the songwriting and
arranging. I love making a mess onstage too, but that's been
adequately covered.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chandler Travis Philharmonic, Travis's main performing
vehicle at present, is a more freewheeling, wild-eyed affair. The
band is two years old, usually has eight or nine players, and is
``pretty close to my heart,'' says Travis. The horn section swings;
there's an accordionist/mandolinist adding color. A CD, ``Her
Spanish Suitcase,'' is coming out shortly. (It's been ready for a
year, but financial trouble at the record company has delayed it.)
Chandler calls the CTP's music ``alternative Dixieland.'' They'll
play lounge songs, Pat Boone's ``Wang Dang Taffy Apple Tango Mambo
Cha-Cha-Cha,'' Duke Ellington's ``Transblucency.'' In concert,
affecting the persona of a madman, Travis will sing Glenn Styler's
``You Killed My Love'' with particular ferocity and choose a lucky
gal to sing the song to. They also play originals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would have started a horn band on purpose,'' Travis
says. `` It's always so non-rock 'n' roll. But this is leading me
into all sorts of things I would never dreamed of. It's geting me
closer to the idea of playing jazz, which I always felt inhibited
about. I'm not really a player, but I can write and arrange in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to be as a professional anachronism _ my stuff
is steadily, completely out of step with what's going on. But I
think it's a good post _ I think you need these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Incredible Casuals are Travis's longtime mainstay. They
began in 1978, after Travis and his partnerin the Travis-Shook band
split.
</P>
<P>
   The Casuals were originally going to be called the Susan Anton
People. Better minds prevailed. They are the Sunday afternoon house
band during the summer at the Beachcomber in Wellfleet, Mass. To
describe their sound, Travis likes to use the word ``omnipop,'' the
word coined by pal Terry Adams of NRBQ to describe eclectic
all-encompassing pop music. ``Noisy, fairly up-tempo,'' continues
Travis, of the Casuals.
</P>
<P>
   Travis says he's balanced the joy he gets from writing and
performing with the frustration of not having greater commercial
success. ``The thing I really learned in the Philharmonic, more
than ever, is that (the music) is its own reward. I've very proud
of what we do and I'd love to see it have a little more effect. I
don't know how to say it in a way that's not really, really, dead
pretentious, but you know, I feel like I can help.''

FINDING PLACES OF REFUGE TO WEATHER WINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The third definition of refuge in the American Heritage
Dictionary covers it: A source of help, relief, or comfort in times
of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, a time of trouble (and woe, for the Northern driver),
the gardener needs relief and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   I can take only so much mental and spiritual succor from gazing
at the green-and-white beauty of the snow-covered New England
landscape, which, truth be told, is more often brown with dead
foliage, mud, and certain unmentionables.
</P>
<P>
   Reading is an obvious outlet, and I spend much time catching up
on books and magazines. My subscription list has been steadily
pared to Horticulture, Garden Design, and Canadian Gardening (for
our windswept patch on Campobello Island).
</P>
<P>
   On trial (for me) this last year has been People, Places &AMP;
Plants, a Maine-based and -focused magazine in its fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   Editor and publisher Paul Tukey heavily indulges a passion for
profiling people, in this case gardening figures of Maine, which I
would classify as a rather narrow publishing niche.
</P>
<P>
   So would he, apparently, as the magazine has been broadening its
scope, geographically into the subjects (and markets) of
Massachusetts as well as topically with a heavier emphasis on the
places and plants of its title.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the early spring edition (it publishes five times a
year), I was struck, finally, that this seems to be becoming the
magazine I would publish if I were to publish one. Among its
offerings were a fairly thorough calendar of events, articles on
the wholesale operation of Pleasant View Gardens in Loudon, N.H.,
and day trips to public gardens in the Boston area, questions and
answers, an indoor gardening piece, ideas on perennial design, and,
of course, several profiles.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the mix, especially the cover piece, a profile on Roger
Swain, host of public television's ``Victory Garden,'' science
editor of Horticulture (to me, an unsurpassed magazine), author,
lecturer and purveyor of fact and common sense. Of course, I'm a
big, big fan of Swain, whom I consider to be a sort of gardening
Renaissance man. I would like to be Roger Swain (scientist,
gardener, decent chap), except for the red suspenders (though I now
have the figure for it) and beard (having grappled with grooming
one an eon ago).
</P>
<P>
   Swain's busy schedule takes him to most of the flower shows in
New England _ and those are another winter refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The three I will take in are the Rhode Island Spring Flower and
Garden Show in Providence, Feb. 18-21, the Portland Flower Show in
Maine, March 11-14, and the New England Spring Flower Show in
Boston, March 13-21.
</P>
<P>
   While disappointed in last year's Boston show, I am optimistic.
Besides, any bloom in winter is better than none, and I have never
failed to come away with ideas and inspiration. The scents alone
are worth admission, but I get that as part of membership in the
sponsoring Massachusetts Horticultural Society.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to another refuge, the society's library, in
Horticultural Hall across from Symphony Hall in Boston. Here the
19th century lives amid gorgeous woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   Lovely old balustrades front a walkway up a flight of stairs
from and encircling a large main room. Most of the stacks of books
(some preciously old, some gratifyingly new) are up there. The many
magazines, some rather esoteric (forest industry publications and
the like), are on the main floor. This is a place to browse and
study and relax. It is a treasure, and I love it.
</P>
<P>
   Two other treasures constitute winter refuges, the greenhouses
at Lyman Estate in Waltham and at Wellesley College.
</P>
<P>
   Small and old by some standards, each reveals pearls.
</P>
<P>
   At Lyman, the 1804 grape house holds grape vines and fruiting
citruses: lemons (including grapefruit-size Ponderosas) and limes
and oranges. It is delicious.
</P>
<P>
   The camellia house is the glory of the place, and now is the
time to visit. Maybe 100 feet long and 15 feet wide, it is fronted
with a bench of small camellias, red and pink and white and just
lovely. In the rear rise century-old camellias, trees festooned
with huge blossoms, some simple, with bright yellow centers, some
complex ruffles.
</P>
<P>
   The greenhouses at Wellesley College are more complex, covering
plant habitats from desert to rain forest to student projects in
propagation beds.
</P>
<P>
   They start with cacti and other succulents, which is a good jolt
from the ice and cold of the campus outside. The collection is in a
small greenhouse room, but it works because it mixes large and
small, some very small, plants.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical room is larger, with palms and other trees rising
high and giving a forest effect. A humid water room contains
papyrus and other wet-lovers, and a cool, dripping fern exhibit is
a delight.
</P>
<P>
   Winter requires refuge, and while each to his or her own, feel
free to share some of mine.

VALIDATE LOSS, ESPECIALLY IF COLLEGES SAY NO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the moments after Ben Flaim opened the oh-so-thin letter from
Dartmouth College that told him he had not been accepted, he
remembers being hit with a second disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing my mom said was, `Don't worry, it's not the
end of the world' ,'' says Flaim. ``To me, it was a big deal, a
very big deal, and here she was discounting my feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Flaim is now a very happy junior at Boston University. That he
remembers his mother's words three years later highlights a
developmental need that often escapes parents: A child who
experiences disappointment can't get past it unless she has the
chance to face it. Our first job is to acknowledge the loss, not
try to cheer her up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't validate feelings, you negate them. It comes
across as a lack of understanding: `Mom doesn't get it,' '' says
developmental psychologist John Dacey of Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   This is true for any age child, for any disappointment, but the
advice is especially relevant for parents of high school seniors.
With some time yet before college envelopes arrive, Harvard
developmental psychologist Janine Bempechat urges parents to set
the stage for the possibility of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that you need to be a pessimist _ ``I don't think
you're going to get in'' _ because a child hears that as, ``Dad
doesn't believe in me.' But, says Bempechat, ``You could say, `This
is a great thing to try for, but you'll still be the same great
person even if it doesn't work out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That reality dose is as important for parents as children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the problem for the child isn't her own
disappointment, but the parent's,'' says Karen Levin Coburn,
assistant vice chancellor for students at Washington University in
St. Louis. She urges parents not to be overly invested in any one
college, or for that matter, in anything a child strives for, from
private school to a slot on a sports team. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The burden of failure &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible burden when a child thinks he has failed
you,'' says Coburn. She is author of ``Letting Go: A Parent's Guide
to Understanding the College Years'' (Harper Perennial).
</P>
<P>
   For a teen, rejection from your first choice is more than a
horrible disappointment. ``He truly thinks his life is ruined,''
says psychologist Frances K. Grossman of Boston University. Dacey
says, ``He feels like a nonperson, a nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Our first instinct is to take that pain away and let them know
they are still a somebody. That's an important message, but not
just yet, says Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting when they are young, we tend to shield them from
disappointment. We distract them, we make something not happen.
That's a disservice,'' says Grossman. ``It doesn't give them the
coping skills they need for life's daily disappointments.''
</P>
<P>
   Begin the training early. ``If a 4-year-old isn't invited to a
birthday party, instead of saying, `We'll go skating that day and
have a better time than all those kids,' acknowledge that it feels
lousy. Help her to sit with the feelings and digest them: `You're
disappointed, aren't you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even if that's all you say, you have done something important:
established credibility. You're saying to your child, ``I know how
this feels, I understand you.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many parents are afraid to do this. ``They think
if they support a child's feelings, she'll think it really is a
catastrophe and not get beyond it. But kids don't work that way,
according to Dacey; they need to experience the present before they
can look to the future. There's also a difference between saying,
``Yes, you're right, this is as bad as you think it is,'' and, ``I
can understand how you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's subtle, but they hear it,'' Dacey says. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Controlled empathy &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The more you tolerate your child's sadness, the more you enable
them to, too. There are pitfalls, though. Empathize but not to the
point of taking over the disappointment. ``Don't go on and on about
how awful you feel,'' says Coburn. ``You rob him of his right to
feel badly.'' If you have a pattern of overreacting, he may not
even tell you he's upset. ``Your response can be frightening or
just plain aggravating,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean you can't be honest. ``It's OK to share your
disappointment as long as you do it in a way that also shows how
you're coping,'' says Grossman. In the case of a college rejection,
for instance, she might say, `` `I was hoping you could go there
because it's where I went, so I'm sad. But I'll get over it and
help you figure out the next step.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The way we handle our disappointments is critical, says
Bempechat, who is author of ``Against All Odds: How `At-Risk'
Students Exceed Expectations'' (Jossey-Bass). ``We're helping a
child develop a coping repertoire,'' she says. ``Whether we lash
out in anger or sit with a cup of tea and talk develops a different
mind-set in our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Dacey tells parents to be prepared to stay in the empathy mode
longer than we expect. ``It takes as long as it takes,'' he says,
two hours or two days. ``Don't be in a rush.'' If you have been
impatient in the past with a child who you think is too easily
crushed by setbacks, this strategy may enable him to move on more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A good rule of thumb is to wait until he's no longer furious or
crying. Crying, Dacey adds, is something parents should encourage,
even for boys. ``Tears are literally loaded with adreneline. The
crying expels the excess adreneline so you can think clearly
again,'' he says. Physical activity helps, too.
</P>
<P>
   Once she's calm, encourage her to talk: ``How are you feeling?''
``What are you thinking?'' ``I know you're not ready to talk now,
but whenever you are, I'm ready to listen.'' Be prepared for some
pretty strong, even dramatic answers, including from young
children: ``My life is ruined!'' ``I'll never have friends!''
``I'll never go to college!''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the feelings, rephrase them without judgment: ``You're
worried no one likes you, huh?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Empowering the child &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The last step is to empower a child by helping him see he has
choices still available. ``Sometimes this requires a new way of
thinking about something,'' says Dacey, whose newest book,
``Understanding Creativity'' (Jossey-Bass), covers that subject.
</P>
<P>
   Start with general comments: ``OK, let's dust ourselves off and
figure out options.'' Leave it to him to come up with actual
solutions, though. ``As soon as you say, `I always liked your
safety school better,' he'll discard the idea,'' says Coburn.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you can float ideas, as long as they are only
suggestions: ``What about visiting that school again?'' The more
thoughts on the table, the more in control a child begins to feel.
With college, for instance, Coburn says, ``Talk through the pros
and cons of second vs. third choice so a child feels like she can
go someplace else not by default but by choice.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ben Flaim, two things helped him almost immediately. After
he read his rejection letter, he took the train from his home in
Queens, N.Y., back to school in Manhattan to tell his guidance
counselor. ``The hour alone on the train gave me time to think,''
he says. Once there, the guidance counselor called Dartmouth to ask
what had been his downfall. It was his SATs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a concrete reason helped,'' Flaim says.
</P>
<P>
   Dacey endorses calling the school. ``Let's say you learn
enrollment is up 25 percent this year, as it is at BC, and that in
a different year, you might have gotten in. That can take the sting
out of rejection and even give you options: Maybe you want to
reapply next year,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week after his rejection, Flaim was accepted at BU, his
safety school. In hindsight, he says it was the best thing that
happened. ``At BU, I could major in English and minor in music. I
couldn't have done that at Dartmouth,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As good as things have worked out and as supportive as his
parents were about BU, there's one thing that nags at Flaim: ``I
was worried I wouldn't get into any college, I had no idea what
would happen to me, and here were my parents being really calm,
saying I'd get in somewhere. That took pressure off me so it was
helpful, but if they had just said, `I understand why you're so
upset,' that would have made it easier.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Nonverbal messages can be very supportive: a pat on the back,
a hug, a sympathetic facial expression.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't take it personally if your child gets on the phone with
his best friend to talk about his disappointment before he talks to
you. Anything that helps him process it is valuable.
</P>
<P>
   --If you have a history of being judgmental or unsympathetic,
tell a child of any age: ``I know last time you were disappointed,
I wasn't very supportive. I hope you'll try me again next time; I'm
going to try to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   --Relate setbacks you experienced as a child. Talk about what
happened and how badly you felt but don't moralize unless your
child asks you, ``So what did you learn?''
</P>
<P>
   --Whether you agree or disagree with your child's reaction to a
setback doesn't matter; the feelings are real to him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ Once a baby reaches 26-inches tall and shows an
interest in climbing, he is at risk for falling out of his crib,
according to research at Temple University. Crib manufacturers'
current recommendations say infants are safe in cribs until they
are 35 inches. The research suggests manufacturers increase the
side height of cribs.

INSULATING CRAWL SPACE IS A GOOD IDEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I like the idea of insulating the ceiling of my crawl space
to help make the floors above warmer. Someone said it was a bad
idea; that it would trap insects and moisture. Isn't the ceiling a
haven for insects and moisture anyway?
</P>
<P>
   KEVIN CONNOLLY, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. A crawl space, unventilated and unscreened, is likely to
harbor insects and moisture, which can be dealt with another way,
after you install the insulation, which is definitely the way to
go. It will reduce heat loss into the crawl space.
</P>
<P>
   After you do that you are not through. You must ventilate the
crawl space by keeping windows (if any) or other vents open from
April to November. In winter venting is not necessary because there
is less moisture in the crawl space. Also, put polyethylene plastic
on the ground; it will help keep water vapor there, where it
belongs. If you have no windows or vents, install some to allow
cross-ventilation, which will release any water vapor that gets in.
Most ``insects'' in such crawl spaces are spiders (technically not
insects), which are beneficial because they eat bugs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My one-piece, steel bulkhead with sides, steps, bottom, and
doors at the top is beginning to rust out, and it leaks like a
sieve when it rains. What can I do to stop the leaks?
</P>
<P>
   CARL DOUHAN, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Those steel bulkheads are great when new, but steel does not
last very long in such a situation, and even faithful maintenance
in keeping it painted will not help much. Make a proper repair by
digging it out and replacing it with an all-concrete (except for
the doors) bulkhead that can be dropped in the original opening
with a minimum of adjustment. If you do this, hope that the
connection betweeen the bulkhead and the foundation is tight; that
is where most bulkheads leak.
</P>
<P>
   A temporary expedient if you leave the steel unit in place is to
cut through the steel bottom and dig a hole as big as the area at
the bottom of the steps and about 12 inches deep. If the water
level underground is not too high, this hole _ a sump, really _
will collect and absorb water as it comes in, and prevent it from
flooding the basement floor. If this works, you can postpone
replacing the bulkhead.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   When Jonathan Nash of Holliston, Mass. asked how he could get
rid of Japanese bamboo, the handyman replied that the only real way
is to dig out the roots and to keep digging until it is gone,
because the roots are deep, clumpy (and heavy), and the plant
spreads by its roots. Really miserable stuff, and physical force is
the best way, the handyman opined.
</P>
<P>
   But not necessarily the only way, wrote Dr. James Kartell of
Chelmsford, Mass., a frequent helper in the handyman's eternal
search for solutions for beleaguered homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   Kartell had a similar problem and told us how he handled it:
``Dissolve 6 ounces of Round-Up Concrete in a gallon of water and
spray the leaves of the plants thoroughly. Repeat in two to three
weeks. Voila, goodbye Japanese bamboo forever. No root finding and
digging and repeat digging (which I previously got involved in). No
toxic residue because Round-Up biodegrades in a few days. It
works!''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Wolfe of Newton, Mass. had similar thoughts: ``Jonathan
Nash does not need a nuclear strike. I have the foolproof way of
getting rid of it (that's another way of saying I had it and now I
don't have it).
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the stuff grow during the summer. Around the end of July
or early in August when the growth cycle reverses, spray the leaves
with Ortho Kleenup. That is when the plant starts storing energy.
The Kleenup is systemic and will slowly go down into the root
system. The leaves will turn brown, but next spring about 90
percent will be gone. Continue this process for two, maybe three
years, and it will be all gone. Guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people at Mass. Horticultural told me about Kleenup, and
it works to perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, both. The handyman usually does not recommend
herbicides, but since both those mentioned seem to be safe, then
OK. Your ideas are going right into the handyman's dandy electronic
file for future reference.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Q. We plan to put in a new Corian countertop in our kitchen. Are
there any negatives about this material as a countertop?
</P>
<P>
   MARGARET &AMP; JOHN BRENNAN, Massachusetts
</P>
<P>
   A. No negatives, on Corian and its competitors, except cost. It
is expensive. I speak from experience, having had two Corian vanity
tops for at least 10 years. It resists absorption of stains, and
scratches can be sanded off with very find sandpaper or emory
cloth. Stains can also be sanded off with no adverse effects. You
can use cleansers or Scotch pads, but these will take longer to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Chips, I believe, can be filled with a liquid repair solution
and sanded smooth.

GOP SHOULDN'T FALL FOR DEMOCRATS' PLOY TO CENSURE CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is the Republican Senate leadership thinking? Why are they
even entertaining the idea of censure for President Clinton? What
do they think that they will gain? Whom do they think they will
appease?
</P>
<P>
   First of all, censure is never mentioned in the Constitution. As
David Broder wrote Tuesday, ``The Constitution provides only one
method of dealing with a lawless president: impeachment and
conviction, which means automatic removal.'' That's the letter of
the law. Republicans should abide by it.
</P>
<P>
   Second, censure would set a truly awful precedent. To quote
Broder again: `` . . . once censure enters the armory of
congressional punishments, the separation of powers is eviscerated
and the stage is set for future Congresses to use censure to club
the president or even the Supreme Court whenever a majority of
lawmakers wishes.'' Is this a precedent Republicans really want to
establish?
</P>
<P>
   Third, censure allows Democrats to have it both ways. They get
to vote down the articles of impeachment and simultaneously condemn
his conduct. That's a cozy arrangement, particularly when one reads
the actual language of censure being proposed by Senator Dianne
Feinstein of California.
</P>
<P>
   It reads, in part, ``the president gave false and misleading
testimony and impeded discovery of evidence in judicial
proceedings.'' The articles of impeachment say that he perjured
himself and obstructed justice. How can anyone vote for the former
if they do not believe the latter to be true?
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, the political dynamic changes once Clinton is acquitted.
Acquittal takes the onus off the GOP. For months now, the burden of
proof has been on Republicans and for good reason. A popularly
elected president should not be removed from office without cause.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Senate acquits Clinton, however, the onus shifts to the
Democratic Party. As Senator Paul Wellstone told The Washington
Post: ``The danger now is that it will appear that we don't care
about ethics and values.''
</P>
<P>
   This is why Wellstone and other Democrats are so anxious that a
resolution of censure be brought to a vote. Democrats don't want
Clinton removed from office, but they don't want to live with the
political consequences of letting him off the hook. They want
political cover, or as Senator Jay Rockefeller said on ``Meet The
Press'' last Sunday, ``I want to be able to say to myself and my
people, `What he did was wrong.' '' Republicans have no stake in
assuaging Rockefeller's and Wellstone's political pain.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth, the notion that Democrats can ``use'' a Republican
senator's vote for impeachment against him or her is laughable. The
vast majority of Americans believe that Clinton is a liar. The vast
majority of Americans believe his conduct in this matter was
immoral. The vast majority of Americans believe Clinton committed
perjury. And roughly half believe he obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   So what, exactly, are those fearsome Democratic attack ads going
to say? Senator John Chafee voted for conviction on obstruction of
justice because he's part of a vast right-wing conspiracy
determined to destroy our system of government? Senator Olympia
Snowe voted for conviction because she's a lunatic bent on
overthrowing the Democratic process? Is there a single person in
the states of Rhode Island and Maine who would believe such
charges? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that a resolution of censure would be popular with
influential media. The New York Times, The Washington Post, and
other editorial boards have all called on Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott to bring a censure resolution to the floor. But media
approval would be short-lived, to say the least. And Republicans
who worry about what New York Times editorial writers think should
get into a new line of work.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is over 150 newspapers across America have called on
President Clinton to resign. If all those editorial writers think
Clinton's conduct merits his resignation, it stands to reason that
it also merits his removal.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that in a very short time, Clinton will be gloating
over his great escape. Washington correspondent Tom DeFrank
reported in Sunday's New York Daily News that Clinton was already
``exuberant'' on the eve of the vote. ``There's no contrition for
what he's done,'' DeFrank quotes one ``dismayed'' presidential
counselor as saying, ``That's all just an act. He's only sorry he
got caught.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Democrats seeking censure know that Clinton has
used them to get what he wants, and that in so doing, he has, as
Wellstone told the Post, ``taken the soul out of the Democratic
Party.'' That's not a Republican problem. That's a Democratic Party
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Censure helps Democrats deal with this problem. Republicans
should suggest that if Democrats want to censure the president,
they do so at the next meeting of the Democratic National
Committee.

PROMISE HIM ANYTHING, BUT SHOW HIM THE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a tasty factoid to chew on along with your Valentine
bonbons: A survey of more than 5,000 men conducted by Men's Fitness
magazine reveals that men care more about how much money a woman
earns than anything, more than her looks, her intelligence, her
sense of humor, her capacity for friendship.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine commissioned the survey for its book, published
this week, ``Total Sex: Men's Fitness Magazine's Guide to
Everything Men Need to Know and Want to Know About Sex.'' The study
also found that the majority of men (52 percent) rate their sexual
technique as only ``adequate,'' and 45 percent say the same of
their ability to meet a partner's emotional needs during sex.
</P>
<P>
   The results may shed light on certain findings of a University
of Chicago sex survey of men and women, also released this week.
According to that study, more than 40 percent of women aren't
having any fun in bed and more than 30 percent aren't interested in
sex at all. (Does that add up to 70 percent of women who are
miserable? Or is the 30 percent a subset of the 40 percent? It's
unclear, at least from the accounts I read.) Maybe they're too
exhausted for sex because they're working overtime to make the kind
of income required to attract a man.
</P>
<P>
   What are we to make of the news that men care more about a
woman's income than her other attributes? Women have always been on
the lookout for what used to be called ``a good provider.'' Perhaps
it's not surprising that in these acquisitive, two-income,
three-car-garage times, men are looking for the same. But while
male and female roles may be shifting in some ways, it's men, by
and large, who feel the burden of Valentine's Day, a bogus holiday
if ever there was one, a poor excuse (apologies to Charles Dickens)
to pick a man's pocket once a year.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements for V-Day goodies, the odd pair of
heart-strewn boxer shorts excepted, all seem to be aimed at
persuading men to propitiate their personal love goddess with one
tribute or another. Men, proceed with caution down the commercial
road to romance. It's filled with wrong turns. For instance, a
small ad in the paper suggests a gift of a Valentine's Day
``special'' at a local spa, a cellulite treatment plus a body-fat
composition analysis. This is the sort of love gift most women
could live without, believe me. Don't say you weren't warned.
</P>
<P>
   I made the mistake of asking a friend if he planned to give his
new love anything for Valentine's Day. His face fell. He asked for
advice. I didn't have any to give. For men, Valentine's Day is a
minefield. Any gesture can be misinterpreted. A simple, traditional
gift like candy can lead to trouble, to a lot of unromantic
soul-searching. ``Why did he give me this 2-pound box of Godiva? Is
he trying to tell me something? Does he think I'm a hog?''
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry? Valentine-related jewelry tends to be ugly. Every time
she thinks about tossing it out it will remind her of you. Perfume?
Unless you know exactly what she likes, forget it. Sexy lingerie?
She'll know you're buying it for yourself because you'll naturally
be drawn to the more obvious items that are not only tawdry but
tend to itch. A stuffed animal? Only if she's below the age of
consent. Poetry? Tricky; definitely not Whitman's ``Leaves of
Grass.'' Flowers? They're bound to die. Like your love?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, in light of all this new and highly scientific sex data,
we should ditch the whole idea of Valentine's Day. Because if the
University of Chicago study is correct, most women won't be
interested no matter what a man may do in the name of love. And if
the Men's Fitness study is right, that Valentine token doesn't mean
he's lusting after you. It's your 401(k) plan that has stars in his
eyes. How romantic is that? Happy Valentine's Day.

WHY IDLING ENGINES ARE ILLEGAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I came out of aerobics class to find my car trapped by a truck
with its motor running. When the driver emerged from a store 10
minutes later, I politely suggested that he should shut his motor
off while making deliveries. The driver responded by backing his
truck up to my car, stepping on the gas, and inundating me with
foul-smelling blue fumes.
</P>
<P>
   I sat there, looking around through a cloud of exhaust. There
were two other trucks idling in this same parking lot. On the
street was another. Across the street were two more. When I stopped
to buy some groceries at my next stop, a delivery truck was idling
outside the store. I decided to speak to the manager. To my
surprise, he was on my side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truck fumes end up getting pulled into our store, especially
in the summer, and you can smell them,'' he said. ``I tell the
drivers to turn off their motors, but they don't always listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Marblehead is governed by Town Meeting and since it only takes
10 voters to get an item on the town warrant, I headed to Abbot
Hall to find out what I had to do to get the town to vote against
unnecessary idling. To my surprise, the woman behind the counter
had her own pet peeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you include buses,'' she said. ``Tour buses come to
see (Archibald Willard's painting) ``The Spirit of '76'' and they
sometimes leave the motor running. We have a sign requesting they
turn them off, but they don't always comply.''
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea how to write a town bylaw. When I called my state
representative, Doug Peterson, for advice, I was in for a surprise.
As it turns out, Massachusetts already has an anti-idling law that
comes with stern penalties _ a $100 fine for a first offense _ just
waiting to be enforced under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter
90, Section 16A.
</P>
<P>
   (a) All motor vehicles registered in the Commonwealth shall
comply with pertinent regulations of the Registry of Motor Vehicles
relative to exhaust and sound emissions.
</P>
<P>
   (b) No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit the
unnecessary operation of the engine of a motor vehicle while said
vehicle is stopped for a foreseeable period of time in excess of
five (5) minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There are only three exceptions _ (1) vehicles being serviced,
(2) vehicles for which engine-assisted power is necessary, such as
garbage trucks, and (3) vehicles in which engine power is needed
for an associated power need, such as construction equipment, or
tour buses keeping the bus warm for customers in very cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Marblehead Cancer Prevention Project decided to bring this
matter before the Board of Health. It was easy for us to make a
case that idling was a threat to public health because a recently
released EPA study reported that the air in 90 percent of the
census tracts in the United States contains ``unsafe levels'' of
eight previously unmonitored carcinogens, with the result that 20
million of us face a heightened risk of getting cancer. The EPA's
list of airborne carcinogens includes three toxic ingredients from
auto exhausts, and diesel engines, it turns out, legally emit even
more pollutants than their gasoline counterparts. The 1 in 10,000
risk means that just short of three Marbleheaders a year will get
cancer as a result of simply breathing.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was so scary that specific geographical data won't be
released until next year. It said, in effect, that if we bottled
this country's air, we'd have to put a skull and crossbones on the
label.
</P>
<P>
   Our Board of Health agreed to write to the Selectmen, asking
them to have the Marblehead police enforce the law. We met with the
chief of police, providing him with copies of the law, the Jan. 17
Globe article about the EPA air survey, and a pamphlet from the
state Department of Environmental Pollution called ``Clean Air and
Your Health.'' We discussed the best way to warn drivers that
Marblehead intends to enforce the anti-idling law, perhaps a
strongly worded notice to slip under the wipers of idling trucks
and buses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week we met with a very supportive Board of Selectmen.
</P>
<P>
   Without public transportation, it's almost impossible to reduce
our dependence upon cars, but all it takes to reduce unnecessary
truck and bus emissions is a simple turn of the key. I've never had
an issue that met with so much agreement from so many people.
</P>
<P>
   Why should all these vehicles be belching foul-smelling smoke
into our lungs when it's against the law?
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature has done its part. Now it's our job to
make sure our cities and towns enforce it.

ANYWHERE, ANYTIME PHONES

 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than three weeks ago, a team of adventurers reached the
South Pole after an overland trek by a new route _ and promptly
pulled out something that looked like an ordinary cell phone to
receive their congratulatory calls, by way of a satellite link.
</P>
<P>
   Such instant communication is a far cry from 1912, when Robert
Scott's team made it to the pole only to find that a rival team led
by Roald Amundsen had already reached it five weeks earlier. If
they had only known that their quest to be first to the pole was
already lost, they might have turned back and been spared their
tragic end out on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's getting to the point where it will be difficult to
be out of touch with the outside world, no matter where you are . .
. unless, of course, you choose to be.
</P>
<P>
   First came portable global positioning system or GPS devices
that could tell you exactly where you were; now, with the launch of
a satellite-based cellularlike phone service last November, there's
virtually no place left on Earth, even the poles, where you can't
just call someone instantly, using a pocket-sized phone.
</P>
<P>
   The first, and currently only, of these ``anywhere, anytime''
phone services to reach the market is called Iridium, a
66-satellite system owned by Motorola, Sprint, and other investors.
But Iridium won't be alone for long. At least two other companies
are about to introduce similar services, and others say they may
enter the competition before long.
</P>
<P>
   Why are companies lining up to invest the billions of dollars it
takes to start launching the required ``constellations'' of dozens
of satellites and the related ground equipment needed to create a
full-service satellite system?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our studies show there are 20 to 30 million potential
subscribers to this kind of service worldwide,'' says John
Cunningham, a spokesman for Globalstar, a satellite-based system
that expects to begin offering service by the end of this year.
Even if all the companies that have announced plans to enter this
market really did so, he said, ``we think there is much more
demand'' than they could meet.
</P>
<P>
   The basic principle is simple. Most of today's communications
satellites are in an orbit 22,300 miles up, where they appear
stationary over a point on the Earth and can be reached by antennas
over a large portion of the planet but require lots of power to
beam their signals back to the ground. Wireless phones, by
contrast, rely on thousands of local antennas that can only reach a
few hundred yards. The Continued on next page &QL; 
new systems use satellites in much lower orbits, such as
Globastar's 900-mile altitude. At that height, they are within
reach of small, cellularlike phones. (Most companies provide phones
that can also work with ground-based wireless systems as well.)
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for having the satellites in orbits within reach of
small antennas is that they cannot stay put over a given spot on
the ground. Instead, they go whizzing by, propelled by inviolable
laws of physics. That means that in order for every place on Earth
always to be within view of at least one satellite, there have to
be a lot of satellites up there. Globalstar will use 64 satellites,
Iridium has 66 (reduced from the originally planned 77 that caused
the system to be named after element number 77), and another
competitor called ICO, which plans service by late next year, will
use 10 satellites in a somewhat higher orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag for consumers is steep, at least so far; but then,
so was the price of the first generation of cellular phones.
Competition in the market is likely to drive prices down fast, just
as wireless phones have now become so inexpensive that they can
sometimes compete with regular wired phone service. But for the
moment, making a call on the Iridium system will require users to
plunk down about $3,000 for a phone, and then pay as much as $7 a
minute (depending on your location) for calls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you're planning to hike up Mount Everest, take a trek
across Antarctica or the Sahara, or sail singlehandedly around the
world, that may seem like a small price to pay for instant contact
_ something past generations of explorers never even imagined.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, the prices should come down substantially. ICO
says its handsets will sell for less than $1,000, but will not
quote a figure for its per-minute rate. Globalstar's Cunningham
says he can't predict the retail price of their phones, since his
company will sell them only to local service providers, not
directly to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the service itself, he says, will be close to the
roaming rates charged by many wireless systems: perhaps around
$1.50 a minute on average around the world. (Iridium says that in
some locations, its present service price is also in that range).
</P>
<P>
   But for some people, the price just won't matter. Take the group
that made the recent trek to the South Pole. Led by Peter Hillary,
son of Sir Edmund Hillary of Everest fame (who, in 1957, had also
reached the pole), the expedition was caught in blizzards along the
way that kept them tent-bound for days. When one member suffered
frostbite, he was able to get crucial medical advice by phone from
doctors back home.
</P>
<P>
   And when they finally got to the pole, the team almost
immediately received calls with messages from Australia's prime
minister and Queen Elizabeth II.

INTERNET CALLS: CHEAP, AND `FAT-FREE' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Robert Sanford of Massachusetts calls his daughter in
Florida, he doesn't use the regular phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford, using a basic telephone, routes his call over an
Internet system managed by AT&AMP;T and gets charged 7.5 cents a minute
no matter what time of day he calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple and the quality of the service is
excellent,'' says Sanford, an international business consultant.
``I was amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like every other business in America, telephone companies
are experimenting with the Internet. Their interest is in using it
as a vehicle for carrying phone traffic. So far the market is
relatively tiny _ sales of $500 million are forecasted for this
year _ but the efficiency of delivering phone conversations in the
so-called Internet protocol, or IP, format is attracting a lot of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is currently offering service in seven metropolitan areas.
IDT Corp., a Hackensack, N.J., Internet service provider, is
operating nationwide and has 250,000 customers. Qwest
Communications and Sprint are not in the Boston area yet, but they
are rolling out the technology.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the attraction is price. Howard McNally, an AT&AMP;T
vice president, calls Internet telephony fat-free long distance.
The price is low, from 5 to 7.5 cents a minute,For that, consumers
have to prepay their accounts with a credit card and dial 31
numbers to place a call.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials at companies experimenting with the
Internet, the current market is geared heavily toward budget-minded
customers and college students. ``Anyone who is frugal,'' McNally
says. ``It's the person who would drive across town to save 2 cents
on gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies are able to offer the low rates because they don't
have to pay the local phone company an access fee to start the
call. That saves about 2 to 3 cents a minute. The companies also
save on billing and customer service because calls are prepaid.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, customers prepay for their calls in $25, $50 or $100
chunks. They can arrange to have their credit card automatically
charged again when their balance runs low. To place a call, they
punch in a local access number, dial their home phone number, a
four-digit PIN number and then the number they are calling.
</P>
<P>
   Voice processing equipment at the local access number converts
the phone conversation into individual packets of digital
information that are then Continued on next page &QL; 
routed over the Internet to the area to which the phone call was
placed. Equipment there reassembles the packets of information,
routes the call back on to local phone lines to the person being
called. It all happens in a blink of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies route their calls over the public Internet, but
most companies are using private Internet networks. They say this
gives them more control over the routing and the quality of the
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in Internet calling has been steady but slow, primarily
because Americans seem reluctant to prepay for phone service. But
industry officials like McNally say the IP approach will pick up
steam rapidly as more and more calls are carried over cable wires
coming into homes.
</P>
<P>
   The IP approach is considered a more efficient way of routing
calls. Regular phone connections generally require a one-to-one
connection that occupies a fixed amount of space on the phone
network even if no one is talking. Under the IP approach,
information travels in packets down several different Internet
pathways to the ultimate destination, where they are reassembled.
The technique uses up less space on the network and allows more
calls to be handled.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, which is busy buying or partnering with cable companies,
plans to adopt IP for all calls it handles over cable wires coming
into customer homes. AT&AMP;T officials say the IP approach will allow
them to handle more calls efficiently and permit installation of
more lines into a single home at reduced cost. ``We're betting the
ranch on IP in the future,'' says AT&AMP;T spokesman Gary Morgenstern.

 &HT;    `Steam' steeped in subtle joys
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Steam'' doesn't generate much heat, but as its subtitle, ``The
Turkish Bath,'' suggests, it does make you feel sort of warm all
over.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with a death in Istanbul. A self-described ``Italian
adventuress'' has passed away and left everything to her nephew,
Francesco (Alessandro Gassman). He and his wife, Marta (Francesca
d'Aloja), are well-off yuppies who run an interior design firm in
Rome. While business is good, the marriage isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Francesco doesn't want to be bothered with his
inheritance. He never knew his aunt, and he couldn't be less
interested in Turkey. His plan is to go to Istanbul, sell
everything and get home to his damaged personal life and workaholic
professional life as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But once in Istanbul, he's seduced. By the city, by his aunt's
old letters, by the warmhearted Turkish family with whom she lived.
He finds a different sense of himself and his sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Central to Franceso's sea change is his discovery that his
aunt's property includes a hamam, a traditional Turkish bath she
restored decades ago to cater to her male friends. In one of her
letters, she describes it as ``a discreet and welcome shelter for
certain caprices.''
</P>
<P>
   But the place is in disrepair, hamams having gone out of fashion
in modern Turkey. The smart move would be to sell to the developer
who plans to bulldoze the entire neighborhood and erect a trade
center, complete with hotels, restaurants and a tennis center.
</P>
<P>
   But who ever does the smart thing in a movie? Especially in a
movie with a plot as soggily melodramatic and predictable as this
one. The main difference here is an interesting cultural twist.
Usually, it's an uptight American or Brit whose visit to the
European continent helps him reconnect with his more sensual,
integrated self. This time, a European goes to Turkey to do pretty
much

 &HT;    The real Wyatt Earp now a little less lost in mists of legend
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb.14.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends. By Allen
Barra. Carroll &AMP; Graf. $24. 336 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Hafford's saloon, at Fourth and Allen, you turned right
and walked 300 feet down Fourth to Fremont Street. A left at
Fremont, another short walk and you were at Fly's Photography
Studio. Not an auspicious site, but it was there, around 2 o'clock
on the afternoon of Oct. 26, 1881, in the silver-mining town of
Tombstone, Ariz., that the guns were pulled and the shots fired. It
was over in less than 30 seconds but has resounded, in film and
fiction, for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   The resonance of the myth requires that we believe _ or make
believe _ it actually took place at the O.K. Corral. The less
romantic truth is that it happened behind the corral, in a lot
beside a photography shop whose name does not conjure up images of
Wyatt Earp, brothers Morgan and Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday. Or,
for that matter, Burt Lancaster and Joel McCrea, Hugh O'Brien and
Kevin Costner, all of whom played Wyatt Earp in movies or on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Legend does not always survive by deed or hero alone. Sometimes
it needs a suitable address. Had Pat Buchanan, announcing his
presidential candidacy in Arizona in the 1996 Republican primary,
posed for pictures in front of Fly's Photography, not even the
sidearm strapped to his hip would have sent the message. He posed
where, on that long-ago autumn day, right stood up to wrong. ``The
Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,'' as Allen Barra writes in ``Inventing
Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends,'' ``is so much a part of
American folklore that scarcely a public confrontation of any kind
can occur without someone evoking it.''
</P>
<P>
   So American is the symbolism that others take its meaning as a
given. ``Cruising the Internet,'' Barra writes, ``I found a news
item about a U.N. official from Pakistan who accused the United
States of displaying `a Wyatt Earp attitude' in foreign affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunslinger was many things to many people
</P>
<P>
   Precisely what such an attitude might be is less than clear, if
only because Earp himself has been many things to many people.
Lawman of the Old West, cold-eyed avenger, con man, teetotaling
gambler and gunslinger, taciturn champion of frontier justice and a
devil with the women _ he was all, or most, of these things, and
posterity has made the most of it. John Wayne and Clint Eastwood,
as Barra writes, might have ``borrowed heavily from Earp's legend
in creating their screen personae,'' but ``Hollywood didn't create
the Wyatt Earp legend; it perpetuated and reinvented it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barra might seem an unlikely biographer of Earp. He is not a
historian of the Old West, but a sports writer and book reviewer
whose work has appeared in The Wall Street Journal and The New York
Times as well as the Journal-Constitution. He has a welcome bit of
the gadfly in him, and his prose, if occasionally careless, is
infectious and entertaining. (``Wyatt Earp didn't `associate' with
prostitutes and pimps; he lived with them. It was his business to
do so.'')
</P>
<P>
   Western folk heroes come and go, of course. No one any longer
wears coonskin hats in homage to Fess Parker's version of Davy
Crockett or carries a Buffalo Bill lunch box to school. Why, then,
should Earp not merely survive but thrive?
</P>
<P>
   He does so, Barra writes, because we have made him a potent
symbol, whether of moral resolve or crass opportunism. This is an
argument easier to make than to accept in its entirety, but in
Barra's hands it goes beyond forensics. He makes a convincing case
that we see in Earp what we want to see. It's easily forgotten that
in the '60s Earp was a bullying pol and, in Pete Hamill's words,
``a man who hustled towns and moved on with the railhead.''
</P>
<P>
   Author has an eye for the odd fact
</P>
<P>
   Barra's sympathies are with Earp, but he is no hagiographer. His
understated humor and his sense of the ironic make ``Inventing
Wyatt Earp'' part revisionist history and part disquisition on the
malleable meaning of legend, with impromptu forays into film
criticism. (Costner, in ``Wyatt Earp,'' is handsome enough, ``but
he never seems to completely inhabit the role.'')
</P>
<P>
   Not all of this rests comfortably in a book that on one page is
breezily summarizing anti-government sentiments in Arizona then and
now and, on another, speculating on the saloon life. But a reader
is continually surprised, even one whose interest in Wyatt Earp is
limited. Barra's enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, his eye
for human foible compassionate and his nose for the odd fact
irrepressible. Rumor had it, for example, that Earp's second wife,
Mattie, was once a Dodge City prostitute. Whatever the truth of the
matter, Barra notes that ``on the frontier it wasn't uncommon to
meet one's future spouse during a business transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   If a 30-second shootout near the O.K. Corral _ in which the
Earps and Holliday gunned down three cattle rustlers _ gets
somewhat lost in all this, it's part of the plan. The legend of
Wyatt Earp transcends the scant, disputable facts. Earp would
eventually leave Tombstone under a shadow, an accused horse thief
with a warrant out for his arrest, and ride off into the distant
mists where good and evil shade easily into another and sometimes
even trade places.

 &HT;    Pink, the now color in fashion
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb.14
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1957 movie ``Funny Face,'' actress Kay Thompson sang the
praises of pink, urging moviegoers to ``banish the black, burn the
blue and bury the beige. From now on, girls, think pink.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 40 years later, the fashion world is again tapping the
color pink as its latest shining star. Designers such as Donna
Karan, Bill Blass, Valentino, Ralph Lauren and Cynthia Rowley made
a point of painting their spring collections _ gowns, twin sets,
slip dresses, cargo pants and clogs _ in this fresh hue.
</P>
<P>
   One shade of pink that doesn't make the cut though, is bubble
gum pink, last popular in the 1980s. In its place are a variety of
possibilities: pale ballerina slipper pink, a rosy red pink, a
lavender-touched pink and even fuchsia, the most intense pink of
all.
</P>
<P>
   After several seasons of domination of the clothes racks by
gray, black and khaki, color in general _ limes, blues and oranges
_ will be big this season. But pink is red hot.
</P>
<P>
   So why pink and why now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pink, which is simply a lightened shade of red, comes back
about every four years,'' said Leatrice Eiseman, a color-trend
tracker in Washington state. ``The color is flattering to most skin
types. And it denotes good health, as in rosy red cheeks. But this
is the strongest pink has been in a long time. When hip designer
Helmut Lang, who loves black and gray, showed pink throughout his
entire collection, you know it's a hot color.''
</P>
<P>
   For New York color forecaster Margaret Walch, pink is the
quintessential feminine shade. ``It's the color of little girls and
flowers,'' she said, ``soft and feminine and appealing. Men only
wear pink in shirts. Therefore, pink is a woman's preserve. That's
why most love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walch, who is also associate director of the Color Association
of the United States, thinks pink is a playful, feel-good color.
``Today I am wearing a pink blouse, and when I'm in the pink, I
feel good about myself and how I look,'' she said. ``You will,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for the positive power of pink to update your wardrobe.
Pink looks terrific with all neutrals, including gray, navy, black
and white. It's especially effective with blue denim.
</P>
<P>
   But go slow in introducing this pastel into your closet. It's
best to use it as an accent, not as a head-to-toe look. For the
office, a pink straw handbag or long silky scarf adds just the
right color note. At night, go for a pink dress and wear silver or
gold sandals, not pink ones. If you want just a smidgen of pink
around your face, opt for earrings, pink pearls or barrettes with
pink flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps New York trend tracker David Wolfe gives the best reason
for wearing pink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men want women to look pretty and romantic, especially on
Valentine's Day,'' he said. ``Anything in pink fits this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   COLOR ME PINK
</P>
<P>
   New York makeup guru Bobbi Brown loves pink. ``Whenever I apply
a pink lipstick or blush to a woman, it's instant prettiness,'' she
says. ``The trick is finding the right shade.'' Brown shares her
thoughts on choosing the right pinks for your skin tone:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most women should avoid pinks that are too pale and pasty or
too dark, such as fuchsia. Select something between these extremes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A rule of thumb: The lighter your skin, the paler your
lipstick and blush should be. And the darker your skin, the deeper
the pinks should be. Look for a pink with plum tones.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Medium skin tones have the most flexibility. Choose light to
medium pinks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Olive skin tones look good in rosy pinks or brown pinks, not
dark plums.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you like bright colors, go for a bright pink. It looks good
on all skin tones.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Always wear the same shade of pink in your lipstick and blush.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You can make your own pink shade. Use an orange or red
lipstick, then outline your lips with a pink pencil.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  No shade is prettier on gray-haired women than pink. And, yes,
redheads can wear pink. Just stay in the pale tones.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  With a pink suit, try a bright red lipstick. It's unexpected
and fun.
</P>

 &HT;    Works explore variety of African-American experience
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 14.
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delving into a book is an entertaining and edifying way to
celebrate and reflect on the rich tapestry of African-American
history. A great way to start is with ``Sacred Fire: The QBR 100
Essential Black Books'' by Max Rodriguez, Angeli Rasbury and Carol
Taylor (Wiley, $22.95). Publisher Rodriguez and editor Rasbury of
QBR: The Black Book Review join forces with free-lance writer and

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Children of the Dream: Our Own Stories of Growing Up Black
in America'' by Lauren Holliday (Pocket, $24). The fourth in a
series of books that draws on autobiographical stories, diary
entries and personal essays by writers who came of age in times of
conflict. The stories in this volume document the lives of
African-Americans born after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963
``I Have a Dream'' speech.
</P>

 &HT;    Dense, lyrical celebration of art leaves priceless legacy
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 14.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iris Murdoch never was very good at self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Though she was one of the best novelists of the latter half of
the 20th century, she liked to say that she belonged in
literature's second league _ ``not among the gods like Jane Austen
and Henry James and Tolstoy.'' History may or may not prove her
correct.
</P>
<P>
   But at the time of her death Monday, at 79, Murdoch had been
catapulted into the public eye for something that had nothing to do
with artistic achievement. She had Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Though she was the author of 26 intellectually and emotionally
complex novels, though she had won Britain's prestigious Booker
Prize and been knighted by the queen, Murdoch's reputation had been
at something of a low simmer in recent years. But with the recent
publication of ``Elegy for Iris,'' an affecting memoir by her
husband, literary critic John Bayley, she gained the sympathy and
respect of an audience that might never have felt compelled to
furrow through her dense and demanding philosophical fiction.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of Princess Diana and People magazine, there was
something cosmically weird about arriving at work on a warm
February morning to discover that the demise of this big, brainy
writer had become the stuff of water-cooler conversation. Then
again, except for suicides and car crashes, there's nothing like a
slowly debilitating illness to ensure a writer's immortality.
</P>
<P>
   Keats and Kafka had tuberculosis. Flannery O'Connor had lupus.
Iris Murdoch lost her mind. What we should never forget is that
more than anything, they were terrific poets and storytellers.
</P>
<P>
   A student of philosophy, Murdoch began her novel-writing career
in 1954 with the concisely scripted, claustrophobically titled
``Under the Net.'' A slim read, it was clearly influenced by French
existentialists Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, she was penning implausibly plotted, 600-page
monsters that made her something of a latter-day Charles Dickens.
In ``The Philosopher's Pupil,'' ``The Good Apprentice'' and ``The
Green Knight,'' Murdoch had aligned herself with the great
19th-century British and Russian novelists whom she so admired, yet
distanced herself from.
</P>
<P>
   What made her so good?
</P>
<P>
   She was an unalloyed romantic, but she was never sentimental.
Her themes _ love and obsession, good and evil, fantasy and
reality, salvation and doom, the ebb and flow of nature and time _
were as all-encompassing as Shakespeare and the Bible. The most
painterly of writers, she was a virtuoso of color, detail, light
and shadow. Even in her most didactic mode, her prose was luminous
and lyrical. Bending the language into new shapes, she remained in
awe of its ineffable beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Dublin in 1919, Murdoch and her parents moved to London
when she was 9. By all accounts, she was a happy little girl, and
she hung on to that playfulness and innocence throughout her adult
life. But she was an only child, and you can see the vestiges of
that in her work, with its orphans and lonely, isolated souls. She
was intensely private, and secluded herself in her work.
</P>
<P>
   She married Bayley in 1956. Though much has been made of the
commodious proportions of her middle-age body, her bag-lady style,
she was reputed to be a woman of some experience in her youth. In
``Elegy for Iris,'' Bayley writes of her affairs with older,
godlike men. Such characters appear in many of her novels, which
are all about the tanglings and disentanglings of love. Without
love, Murdoch tells us again and again, we are nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, at the midpoint of her career, she wrote a midsize
novel that remains one of her very best: ``The Black Prince.'' It
is about a novelist who falls in love with his good friend's
teenage daughter. It is a meditation on literature, from Homer to
``Hamlet,'' a celebration of love in its most violent and tender
states.
</P>
<P>
   One cannot pick it up without being reminded of the range and
scope of Murdoch's genius. And now that she is gone, the final
words seem especially resonant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art is not cosy and it is not mocked. Art tells the only truth
that ultimately matters. It is the light by which human things can
be mended. And after art, there is, let me assure you all,
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   As cold and final as marble, it is a perfect epitaph.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Brock is a Journal-Constitution arts writer who reviewed
Murdoch's novels over the years.

 &HT;    DEBATE SHOWS OPENNESS WAS RIGHT CHOICE, HUTCHISON SAYS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bucking her own political party and Senate
tradition, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison has gained national attention
in recent weeks for leading an unsuccessful effort to let the
public and television cameras observe the final deliberations in
the impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Before spending a second long day in Thursday in a closed Senate
session, the Texas Republican discussed with correspondent Bob Dart
her losing battle and the looming conclusion to the impeachment
drama.
</P>
<P>
   Q. From what has gone on so far, do you think that the closed
deliberations are much different than open ones would have been?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Not not at all. I think the people would be proud to see
the debate that is going on. And I don't think the speeches would
be any different. And they're good. I think we have missed an
opportunity for historical purposes as well as current purposes to
have this record.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why was the openness issue so important to you?
</P>
<P>
   A. I had always felt that openness in government was an
expectation that people have. And as we have increased news sources
so that you are able to see things live and immediately, the idea
that we would revert back a rule that was made before senators were
elected by the public and before there was instant television is
incomprehensible to me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did your stint as a television correspondent in Houston three
decades ago affect your thinking?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, certainly. Having been in the news media, I understand
the importance of openness in government. But really I've watched
this evolve since my time of the state legislature when open
meetings laws were first passed. I've never operated in any other
way but with open meetings when they were official.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you heard much from constituents about this?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. There has been a good amount of interest, and people who
have called in have definitely been in favor of openness.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Splitting from many Republican leaders, you have emerged as a
much-televised national spokeswoman on this contentious issue. Has
it affected your relationships in the Senate?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I certainly understand when people disagree on issues,
and they understand my position. And many have told me that they
were torn about it. But one of the reasons given by some for voting
against opening the doors is that the debate would be prolonged
because more people would speak. Well, in fact, I don't think there
is one bit of difference in how long people are taking. And I think
we will end up in the exact same place as we would have if it had
been open. But the effect on history would have been much greater.
</P>
<P>
   Q. One argument against opening the session was that jury
deliberations are traditionally closed. Is what the Senate is doing
comparable to what a jury does?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's not like a deliberation. To try to equate this with just
a trial jury is to miss the point that this is a political process
by choice. The founders of our country who wrote our Constitution
decided not to have the Supreme Court be the trier of the president
of the United States. They specifically chose the Senate. And I
believe they intended for it to be part of the political process.
It's certainly quasi-judicial, but it's not completely judicial.
And I think people's expectations are that this would be an open
process when the fate of the president of the United States is at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will there be any political ramifications for either party _
good or bad _ over the Republicans having closed the deliberations?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, it was a mixed vote. I wouldn't say that it was the
Republicans who closed it. There were many Republicans who voted
for opening. I think it was a mistake, but I think it's certainly
not unprecedented. They were following the rule that has been on
the books for over a hundred years. I just thought it was time to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you decided how you're going to vote on conviction or
acquittal?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, I have. And I will be releasing that as soon as know
when the vote will be.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's your position on censure?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think censure is probably not an option at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you could get introspective for a bit, what has the
impeachment ordeal been like?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's been a historic moment in the country and certainly in
the Senate. It's only the second trial of its kind in our country's
history, but it's the first one for all of us. I think it was a
very strong Senate performance. We were able to conduct a full
trial with a full record and we're going to have a final vote. We
turned back motions to dismiss early and not to allow evidence ...
and I think that was the right decision. I believe the Senate has
come together in many ways. We have really consulted and debated
the process, and I think handled it well even though I disagree
with the closing of the deliberations. I think that was the only
part that was a real mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, I guess you all have spent a lot more time together
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's really bonded the Senate in many ways. Certainly
Republicans and Democrats have gotten to know each other better. I
think it has been a positive experience from the senatorial
inter-workings. There's no acrimony among Republicans and Democrats
or among Republicans who might disagree on the outcome. People
believe the votes are being made on the merits and according to
people's consciences. It has really been a positive experience over
all, although it has been a wrenching one.

NET OFFERS RELIEF FOR THOSE WITHOUT A VALENTINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANIEL J. VARGAS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It's Valentine's Day, and for some people, the big
day amounts to a little candy heart that says: ``You Are Alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for those in a relationship, there's the pressure of
gift-giving, dinner and obligatory roses.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure, says psychotherapist Dottie J. Miller, ``begins in
elementary school when we're forced to exchange Valentines,''
associating how many we get with self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, this day comes with its own matching set of emotional
baggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm single and the rest of the year I'm fine with it, but on
Valentine's Day I feel like something is wrong with me,'' said
Yvonne Benavidez, 30, of San Antonio. ``Valentine's Day is the only
time of the year when society makes you feel inadequate about being
so well-adjusted.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, she's not going solo.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lonely-hearts (and angst-ridden) club in cyberspace
where dozens of anti-Valentine's Day Web sites beat on, reminding
us that, as the song goes, ``love stinks, yeah, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   The creators of these sites and their confederates blame the
greeting card companies, the confectionery businesses and florists
for the mid-February blues. They share bad breakup stories, and
some are even inspired to pen anti-Valentine poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Cupid, the arrow-shooting, loincloth-wearing cherub, isn't
spared either. They'd like to try their marksmanship on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, Cupid rhymes with Stupid!'' reads a line from the
Anti-Valentine's Day Page
(www.netreach.net/(tilde)trishy/vday.html), which features a pink
heart cracking in two and links to other anti-Valentines Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Such angry prose doesn't surprise Kathy Bruni, a licensed
professional counselor who has counseled couples and singles for 10
years. She said the pressures of Valentine's Day can be so intense
that couples split up to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For couples, it can be a setup for conflict because of
idealistic, unattainable expectations that are reinforced by
society and the media,'' she said. ``Expensive gifts and fancy
places do not capture the essence of love. What it should be is a
day to honor your love and commitment to one another.''
</P>
<P>
   For singles, Bruni offered this advice: ``Remind yourself that
`being in a relationship makes you happy' is a myth. Look at the
divorce rate. It's also a myth that you need someone else to
complete you.''
</P>
<P>
   So phooey to that heart-wrenching ``You complete me'' line in
the movie ``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruni suggested that couples talk about their plans and focus on
more personal and less commercial expressions of love.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you do, don't overspend or demand something from your
partner. It can create resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be simple and yet profoundly moving and meaningful,''
Bruni said. ``Don't expect this fairy-tale day.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you're content to being anti-Valentine's Day, hit the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites offer hateful, even vengeful, tips. Others post song
lyrics: ``I can't make you love me, if you don't,'' (Bonnie Raitt).
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sample from the Valentine's Day Can Bite Me page
(www.angelfire.com/ma/avideto/vday.html): ``I'm not a single young
woman bent on giving grief to everyone else who is dating. I want
someone to tell me if I'm loved, of their own volition, not because
some fabricated greeting-card holiday sponsored by Hallmark compels
them.''

links with the past, but also frequently to save money. A result is
a city rich in architectural salvage, with fragments of buildings
grafted onto others or standing alone, offering a glimpse of what
otherwise might have been lost to history.

possible there could be a vote on the articles of impeachment
sometime late this afternoon, or this evening. But, he says that's
not likely. Lott says there are still some 37 senators who plan to

<P>
   The temperatures routinely used to sterilize surgical
instruments in British hospitals might actually help to spread the
deadly brain disease CJD, researchers in Scotland say. The finding,
however, could lead to more effective ways of disinfecting surgical
instruments contaminated by prions, the rogue proteins thought to
cause the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that surgeons' instruments might pass on new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or vCJD, the human form of BSE,
intensified last month with news that the infection is present
throughout the lymph tissue of victims, not just in the central
nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no sure way of sterilizing instruments
contaminated with prions, the discovery prompted calls for surgeons
to use disposable instruments for operations involving lymph
tissue. But so far the British government has not committed itself
because of the high costs.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is evidence that attempts to disinfect instruments by
``pressure cooking'' them at high temperatures in an autoclave
might do more harm than good. David Taylor of the Institute for
Animal Health in Edinburgh found that increasing the temperature of
the autoclave actually made it harder to destroy CJD prions.
</P>
<P>
   In one experiment, infected tissue samples were heated at 134 C
for 9, 18 and 30 minutes. The treated samples were not infectious.
However, when the experiment was repeated at 138 C, the tissue was
still infectious. In Britain, the standard temperature range for
autoclaving instruments is 134 to 138 C.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor believes the slightly higher temperature ``fixed'' the
prion, allowing chemical links to form that made the molecules more
stable. He is preparing his results for publication.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pepys, who specializes in the chemistry of brain disorders
at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School in London, says Taylor's
explanation ``involves a lot of speculation because we just don't
know enough about the agent that causes CJD yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But the suggestion doesn't surprise him. Even very small
temperature changes can cause changes in a protein molecule's
shape, he says. This might involve bonds that by themselves are
quite weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there were enough of them, perhaps hundreds, the effect
of strengthening the molecule could be dramatic,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taylor's work highlights the difficulty in inactivating
prions,'' says John Barbara, a microbiology consultant to Britain's
National Blood Authority. He says the findings strengthen the case
for developing ways of physically excluding prions from blood
products.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of surgical instruments, Taylor says that a strong
solution of sodium hydroxide for one hour followed by autoclaving
at 136 C for one hour is fairly effective. ``If we combine alkali
solutions with the right grade surgical steel that can stand up to
it, it will be possible to improve sterilization,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, he says that the only completely safe way to
deal with contaminated items is to throw them away. &QL;

stable. He is preparing his results for publication.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pepys, who specializes in the chemistry of brain disorders
at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School in London, says Taylor's
explanation ``involves a lot of speculation because we just don't
know enough about the agent that causes CJD yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But the suggestion doesn't surprise him. Even very small
temperature changes can cause changes in a protein molecule's
shape, he says. This might involve bonds that by themselves are
quite weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there were enough of them, perhaps hundreds, the effect
of strengthening the molecule could be dramatic,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taylor's work highlights the difficulty in inactivating
prions,'' says John Barbara, a microbiology consultant to Britain's
National Blood Authority. He says the findings strengthen the case
for developing ways of physically excluding prions from blood
products.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of surgical instruments, Taylor says that a strong
solution of sodium hydroxide for one hour followed by autoclaving
at 136 C for one hour is fairly effective. ``If we combine alkali
solutions with the right grade surgical steel that can stand up to
it, it will be possible to improve sterilization,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, he says that the only completely safe way to
deal with contaminated items is to throw them away. &QL;

   Trials of the world's first vaccine against persistent bladder
and urinary tract infections are due to begin in humans at the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   This follows successful animal studies in which the vaccine gave
complete protection against UTIs to three out of the four monkeys
that received it, according to the vaccine's developer, Sol
Langermann of MedImmune, based in Gaithersburg, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine targets Escherichia coli, the bacterium that
accounts for 85 percent of all urinary tract and bladder
infections, including cystitis. Recipients of the vaccine make
antibodies that prevent the bacteria from gaining their usual
foothold on the wall of the bladder.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other species of bacteria, E. coli cells are covered
with hairlike projections called pili. At the tip of its pili, E.
coli has adhesives, suckerlike proteins which clamp onto tissues
and enable the bacteria to establish an infection.
</P>
<P>
   Langermann and his colleagues discovered that one adhesive,
called FimH, enables E. coli to get a grip on the bladder wall.
``We've shown it's vital for infection,'' Langermann says.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine contains a synthetic replica of FimH. Vaccinated
animals make antibodies designed to trap the replica, but which are
equally capable of trapping FimH adhesives made by live E. coli
bacteria. With their ``suckers'' blocked, they cannot colonize the
bladder wall.
</P>
<P>
   MedImmune has submitted the results of its monkey experiments
for publication, and plans to begin clinical trials in women by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Women are more prone to such infections because their urethras
are much shorter, so bacteria can easily reach the bladder. By the
age of 30, half of all women have had at least one infection, and
of these, a quarter go on to have recurrent infections. But if the
vaccine lives up to expectations, that could be about to change. &QL;

DOCTORS SEEK MORE RESEARCH ON ERECTION SUPPLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: California, Hawaii)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Viagra, move over. A new dietary supplement
called ArginMax is being touted as a way to deliver an erection
without Viagra's sometimes unpleasant and potentially fatal side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   The supplement costs an estimated $40 to $50 a month to use but
isn't yet available in all areas.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians are awaiting more research on this latest herbal
remedy before they'll say if ArginMax, available on the Internet
and at 3,000 stores predominantly on the West Coast, is practical.
The supplement costs an estimated $40 to $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ArginMax requires taking six pills a day, divided into two
doses. While no prescription is required, you may need stamina to
keep up with that daily regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you want to take pills twice a day for something you
might only want to do two times a month?'' said Dr. James Barada,
an Albany urologist and a specialist in male sexual dysfunction.
``The whole food supplement market is making tens of billions of
dollars a year with unproven efficacy.''
</P>
<P>
   A small, initial research study designed by Dr. Andy Das, an
Albany Medical Center urologist, found that 89 percent of men
diagnosed with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction improved their
ability to have intercourse after taking ArginMax daily for four
weeks. Of those men, 75 percent reported improved satisfaction with
their overall sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians emphasize the results are still preliminary. The
pilot study involved only 25 men at the University of Hawaii
Medical College and didn't account for the placebo effect, a
phenomenon where the improvement is psychological and unrelated to
the medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Albany Medical Center is just one of a handful of sites selected
by the Daily Wellness Company of Mountain View, Calif., the
manufacturer of ArginMax, to participate in a larger clinical
trial, involving at least 150 men with diagnosed erection problems.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials hope that study will help differentiate their
product in a largely unregulated market. Dietary supplements do not
require approval by the Food and Drug Administration. ArginMax has
been available since last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about building credibility and consumer trust,''
said Dr. Hank Wuh, chairman of the Daily Wellness Company.
</P>
<P>
   The latest trial will include a placebo and will focus on men
with erectile problems who have had less than a satisfactory
response with Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viagra, while it's been very positive in the treatment of men
with erectile dysfunction, doesn't work with everybody,'' said Dr.
Ronald Kaufman, a professor of urology at Albany Medical College
and the principal researcher for the latest study, slated to start
within six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ArginMax contains the amino acid L-Arginine, a naturally
occurring substance that is believed to aid the body's production
of nitric oxide, a substance that allows smooth muscle relaxation
in the penis _ and enables a man to have an erection.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra, manufactured by Pfizer, works by preventing the natural
breakdown of nitric oxide, giving a man a better chance of
maintaining his erection throughout intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   While applauded by physicians as the first oral treatment for
impotence, Viagra has faced its share of problems since it was
approved for sale by the FDA last April.
</P>
<P>
   At least 69 deaths have been linked to the drug and Viagra isn't
recommended for use in men who are taking nitrates for heart
problems. Other side effects include blurred vision, headaches,
facial flushing, and indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very interested in non-drug therapies because of
all the scare tactics around Viagra,'' Barada said.
</P>
<P>
   So for those men who can't or don't want to use Viagra, he said
ArginMax ``is a reasonable alternative coupled with good health in
general.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it going to replace Viagra? Absolutely not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But record sales figures for Viagra show that there is a growing
and lucrative market in non-invasive treatments for sexual
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Until Viagra, many men with erectile dysfunction were reluctant
to seek help because most treatments required them to stick
themselves with needles, insert suppositories or use vacuum-style
devices.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the company's Website at www.arginmax.com, officials point
out that ArginMax doesn't work for everyone and is not ``an
aphrodisiac'' that will ``create uncontrollable sexual desire.''
</P>
<P>
   And though women may take ArginMax, there is no research showing
that it works. The company is currently designing a product
specifically for women, expected to be available for sale later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've taken ArginMax for four to six weeks at the
recommended dose and have noticed no effect in either sexual
fitness or physical stamina, then it probably doesn't work for
you,'' according to a disclaimer on the Website.
</P>
<P>
   Until more studies are done, it is uncertain how much people are
willing to pay to find out. The company won't disclose sales
figures. Wuh said the number of consumers trying the product over
the past year total ``tens, if not hundreds of thousands.'' The
company advises that people, including those with Parkinson's
disease or diabetes, consult their physician before taking
ArginMax.

EDITING HOME VIDEOS INTO CHERISHED MOMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 17 million US households that own both a camcorder and a
personal computer also own something else, according to Griffin Dix
Research: an average of 20 videotapes they rarely watch.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, as many of us with camcorders have found, is that
what seemed like endlessly fascinating graduation ceremonies,
Little League games and baby feeding sessions at the time we were
rolling tape turned out to be a little tedious on playback.
</P>
<P>
   Programs that plug into your personal computer to help you edit
down and jazz up your videos are becoming one of the hottest new
markets in home electronics. Dataquest, a multimedia
market-analysis firm, estimates that shipments of these products
rose from 471,162 units in 1996 to more than 1 million in 1997, and
probably more this past year.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen products priced for home use are on the
market, with new ones seeming to come out every month. They include
Ulead Systems' VideoStudio 3.0, Adaptec's VideOh!, Iomega Buz, Avid
Cinema (a Power Macintosh product), Dazzle Digital Video Creator,
and MGI Software's Videowave.
</P>
<P>
   One of the least expensive, versatile and klutz-forgiving
systems is Studio 400 by Pinnacle Systems, which went on the market
in May and normally retails for $199 or less.
</P>
<P>
   While some systems require you to undertake the frightening task
of opening up your computer to plug in a device that translates
tapes into digital bits for storage and editing on your hard drive,
Studio 400 uses a paperback-book-sized device that plugs into your
serial and parallel ports like a printer.
</P>
<P>
   To make it work, you need a Pentium-class computer running
Windows 95 or 98, a VCR that can be controlled by an infrared
remote and can be plugged in somewhere close to the PC, and a
couple of specialized cables to hook up the VCR and camcorder to
your computer.
</P>
<P>
   It's also worth checking at this Web page _
www.pinnaclesys.com/framesets/support.html _ to make sure your
camcorder will work with Studio 400. (Generally, Sony, JVC, and
Panasonic camcorders and all other camcorders that support 8mm tape
or have what is called a Panasonic 5 pin will work out, according
to Pinnacle.)
</P>
<P>
   Once everything is hooked up, you play back the tape. To
conserve memory, the system transfers to your computer memory a
lower-resolution version of the tape _ 160 by 120 pixels _ that
should take up no more than 150 megabytes per hour of tape.
</P>
<P>
   The program automatically determines the beginning of each
``scene'' on your tape, sensing when you stopped or paused the
camcorder while recording.
</P>
<P>
   The first frame of each scene shows up as a still picture in an
``album'' on your computer screen. Using your mouse, you drag
images to what is called the ``storyboard,'' recombining scenes in
whatever order you want and omitting the boring stuff.
</P>
<P>
   You can also add in up to 100 different transitions (the new
scene spins out of the old one, for example), fadeouts, 200
different styles of titles, as well as background music (classical,
country, jazz, rock, and so on) or your own voiceover.
</P>
<P>
   You can preview what different editing approaches will look like
before committing to them. When you have finished tweaking the
captured version of your tape, Studio 400 goes to work playing back
the actual version, inserting the special effects you have chosen
and outputting the whole package to your VCR tape. What comes out
is a full-resolution video. Or, if you have the hard-drive space,
you can keep a version on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Pinnacle also says you can use the system to create video to
send to other people by e-mail or post on a Web page and, if you
are daring enough, push the system to use as a sort of video phone
with someone else who has it.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it seems to be much simpler than some of the earlier
approaches to PC-based video editing, but it's not a piece of cake.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Buckingham, an analyst with International Data Corp.'s
desktop multimedia and graphics group, told Computer Dealer News in
a recent survey of the field that many people might find editing
programs a bit frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is, the PC is really not powerful enough for most
video applications, and users are not sophisticated enough,''
Buckingham told the trade magazine. ``Today's PC applications are
kind of like driving a car _ you go left, right, front back. You
add video, and it's like going from driving a car to flying a
plane, in that it requires experience and training to get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andy Fischer, senior analyst with John Peddie Associates of
Tiburon, Calif., asserts in a Pinnacle press kit that because of
its memory-conserving features, ``Studio 400 is the first product
to make basic video editing with transitions, voice- and music-over
and high-quality titling practical for consumers with typical home
computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that, like Hamburger Helper, the ultimate result
will depend heavily on the quality of the ingredients. Unless you
use a tripod and professional lighting, don't expect your videos to
come out looking like a network show _ but they might come out
looking as good as home video spliced into an evening newscast, and
certainly in a more brisk, entertaining package.
</P>
<P>
   Given the cost and complexity of using the system, it might make
a perfect self-serving ``gift'' for a group of siblings, cousins or
friends to give to a technophile: Slip it under Uncle John's
Christmas tree, then give him the treat of paring down your endless
family videos.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, as impressive and versatile as all of Studio 400's
features seem to be, my wife and I have discovered a highly
functional peripheral on our home entertainment system that can
accomplish the level of editing we find we really need.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the pause button, part of the no-name VCR my wife's
father bought her from a mail-order electronics house 12 years ago.
We hook up our camcorder to the TV set, pop in a tape to the VCR
and start recording, then pause the VCR tape when we think Aunt
Sylvia has probably seen enough of little Susannah spooning oatmeal
approximately into her mouth, unpausing before she performs her
next brilliant trick.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great way to turn 60 minutes of adoring parents who can't
stop the camcorder into 15 minutes of video for far-flung aunts,
uncles, and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   But undoubtedly many people far more skilled with electronics
than us will love the chance to trim, rearrange, and transition
their memories. Studio 400 could be a fun, reasonably priced way
for you to play professional videomaker.

SHERRY TURKLE STUDIES THE HUMAN SIDE OF THE SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While most marketers are busy figuring out what e-commerce can
do for people, Sherry Turkle is more concerned about what it is
doing to people.
</P>
<P>
   Turkle, a professor of the sociology of science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has been called an
ethnologist of on-line life, a cybershrink, and the Margaret Mead
of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Exaggerations? Perhaps. But this much is true: As a pundit,
Turkle has carved a national niche for herself as an authoritative
commentator on the existential topic of how the Internet is
transforming people's behavior and sense of self. In 1995, Newsweek
magazine named her in its ``50 for the Future: the Most Influential
People to Watch in Cyberspace.'' In 1997, Time Digital Magazine put
her on its list of the top 50 ``Cyber Elite.''
</P>
<P>
   As millions of consumers flock on-line to do everything from
checking stock quotes to searching for that
</P>
<P>
   1955 Roy Rogers lunchbox, life on the Internet has taken on a
mystical aura. The fascination has led many Internet-watchers to
Turkle's doorstep in search of higher meaning.
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy the masses, she has dispensed humanist perspectives
on one of man's coldest creations. Her books _ ``The Second Self:
Computers and the Human Spirit,'' (Simon and Schuster, 1984) and
``Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet'' (Simon
and Schuster, 1995, $25) _ deal with how computers have changed the
way people interact with the world and view themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Turkle views the world of electronic commerce in philosophical
fashion. One of her recurrent messages: The Internet will not
replace stores, boutiques, shopping malls, and supermarkets.
Instead, browsing on-line will only whet people's appetite for the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Turkle points to ``City of Bits'' (MIT Press), a
book published by MIT colleague, William Mitchell. Viewers can read
the entire book on line for free. Instead of dampening sales,
Turkle posits that the on-line version has boosted sales of the
physical book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has increased the appetite for the book itself,'' Turkle
says. ``People wanted the experience of the book, its
functionality, its ease of maneuverability.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of the shopping experience. ``I sense myself as
a consumer who has access to many, many different kinds of media
for getting information,'' she says. ``I experience the product at
a store. I see it in a catalog in a setting I can fantasize about.
I can go on line to learn more about it, its ratings, its price
points. All this information goes into a purchasing decision, and
increasingly, we are becoming better and better at it. It's
changing the experience of being a consumer. People are becoming
connoisseurs of information.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who see the on-line buying experience as being too
cold, or too dehumanizing, Turkle says the criticism is a red
herring. ``Too often, the computer is compared to what it would be
like living in a small village. They imagine a cafe in France where
people meet daily and you come across the same cast of characters.
They set up a 19th-century ideal and compare the computer to it.
What we're really doing is confronting what we miss most in the
rest of our lives . . . As a mirror for society, it's a very
telling comment.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that yearning for the human touch that will preserve roles
and functions that ought to belong in the human domain.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate, she says, ``I was interviewing an 11-year-old
about artificial intelligence. He said, `When there are robots who
can perform all the jobs, people will still cook the food, run the
restaurant, and have families. I guess they'll still be the ones
who will go to church.' He was saying that you have to accept
computers for what they can do, but that there are still things
that only people can do, like form relationships and develop
spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkle is less sanguine, however, when it came to the subject of
on-line trading of stocks. Likening it to a ``casino atmosphere,''
she cautions against the addictive quality of stock trading that
can lead to financial ruin for individuals. She also worries about
how day trading, as the practice is called, can contribute to, in
fact feeds on, the volatility of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there will always be speculators,'' she says. ``But
as this phalanx of Americans move into day trading, you begin to
create a stock market that feels like a casino. It becomes a closed
game of winners and losers, increasingly disconnected from economic
life.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, Turkle is occupied with a more
down-to-earth topic than macroeconomics. As mother of a 7-year-old
daughter, Rebecca, Turkle is interested in how technology affects
children. Her current research topic: The Furby, a fuzzy,
computerized, mechanized doll that talks, blinks, sleeps and asks
to be fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the conversation is about how `smart' the Furby
is,'' says Turkle. ``But I think the story is not so much what's in
the Furby as what it triggers in the child.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Turkle has observed a crucial difference in how children
connect with a Furby versus a doll that behaves completely
predictably. ``This lack of predictability causes us to see them in
a different light,'' Turkle says. ``In the future, these toys can
socialize us into being used to the idea that machines are not
always predictable and shape the way we relate to them.''

THEY'RE WATCHING YOU 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, you're not being paranoid. You are being watched.
</P>
<P>
   Everytime you log onto the Internet, you're probably helping to
build a dossier on yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The most sophisticated shopping sites on the Web keep track of
everything you buy, and analyze the information in an effort to
sell you still more goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites entice you with come-ons like free electronic mail
accounts, in exchange for personal information like your name and
telephone number. Still other sites don't ask you for anything, but
simply keep track of your electronic wanderings, using the in
</P>
<P>
   formation to create a personal profile that is a marketer's
dream.
</P>
<P>
   Scary? Some people think so.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year by Business Week magazine found that more
than three-quarters of those who shop on the Internet say they
would buy even more if there were better privacy safeguards. And
among those who didn't shop on line, privacy fears were the chief
reason they stay away.
</P>
<P>
   The popular computer network America Online created a national
furor last year when it released information about one of its
customers to the US Navy. Timothy McVeigh had posted, anonymously,
information on line that suggested he was gay. The Navy persuaded
AOL to violate its own privacy policy and reveal McVeigh's
identity, whereupon he was discharged from the service.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh was subsequently reinstated after a federal court
challenge, but the incident served as a startling illustration of
how much personal information is available on line.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of information can Web-based businesses collect and
how do they do it? The simplest method, and perhaps the most
misunderstood, is the ``cookie.'' A cookie is a small chunk of data
that is sent by a Web site to a visitor's computer. The cookie can
be used to store data that the visitor will need whenever he
returns to the site. For example, a visitor to the New York Times
Web site must get a password to sign in. But if he agrees, he can
also get a cookie that will ``remember'' his password. The next
time he visits the site, the Times computer will check his browser.
If the cookie is there, the visitor is instantly logged in, without
having to retype the password.
</P>
<P>
   Internet advertisers love cookies, because they make it possible
to control exactly which ads are displayed on a person's computer.
This is the business of companies like New York-based DoubleClick,
which attaches cookies to ads in order to create profiles of
millions of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Many commercial Web sites feature banner
ads linked to the DoubleClick network. When someone visits one of
these sites, his or her computer gets a cookie that notes the
particular ad being displayed. The cookie continues to track the
user, noting every visit to a site featuring DoubleClick ads. The
cookie tracks which ads the user clicks on for more information,
and which ads he or she ignores.
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, DoubleClick builds up a profile of the Web
surfer, which can be used to send ads specifically tailored to his
or her tastes. As a result, two different people visiting the same
Web page may see entirely different ads, depending on the content
of their DoubleClick cookies.
</P>
<P>
   To some, it might sound like Web users are being followed by
some virtual detective, but DoubleClick general manager Christopher
Saridakis says that cookies are not an invasion of privacy. ``It
really doesn't contain any information about the individual,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick doesn't know who you are or where you live. It just
knows that somewhere out there, Person X, likes football,Continued
on next page &QL; 
hates basketball and is interested in sport-utility vehicles.
Besides, DoubleClick allows consumers who don't want to be tracked
to opt out of the system. On request, they'll send out a cookie
that blocks all other DoubleClick cookies.
</P>
<P>
   In general, cookies pose little threat to your privacy. A cookie
can only be read by the Web site that installed it. Even if you
visit a fly-by-night Web site run by hostile hackers, they can't
learn anything about you by accessing your cookies. Indeed, most
cookies only contain a set of numbers that will be meaningless to
any other computer but the one that created the cookie.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for those who insist on avoiding them, most standard Web
browsers can be set to warn the user of incoming cookies so that
the user can opt to refuse them. Unfortunately, so many sites
install cookies that users will be bombarded with dozens of cookie
requests. To avoid this, some people use software tools with names
like InterMute and Internet Junkbuster that allow consumers to
block out nearly all cookies.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a price to pay for life without cookies _ some Web
sites won't let you in without one.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Evan Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, a
newsletter based in Washington, D.C., refuses all cookies as a
matter of principle. ``I don't see any benefit to me in allowing
them to place a cookie,'' he says. ``The benefit's all to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks acknowledges he's never heard of anyone suffering a
loss of privacy because of cookies, but he fears that could change
if companies find ways to link your cookie to a file of personal
information about you.
</P>
<P>
   It's already happening at hundreds of Web sites, where consumers
provide detailed personal information. Such information can be
combined with cookies to create a personalized customer profile _
or to reveal sensitive information to complete strangers.
</P>
<P>
   There are some advantages to personalization, however. An
example of it at its best can be found at eToys, a popular toy
retailing site. Toy shoppers can create a personal account at the
site that will keep a permanent record of everything they have ever
purchased there. The site also allows them to create a wish list of
toys they might want to buy in the future. It even has a calendar
that can send e-mail reminders of a child's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, like the popular bookseller Amazon.com, take
personalization even further. The Amazon site analyzes the books a
customer buys, and directs the customer to other titles that might
also be of interest. ``Their business model is based on getting
very detailed information on their customers and what they do,''
says Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what scares him.
</P>
<P>
   eToys vows never to sell the information it collects about its
customers. Amazon reserves the right to do so, but will keep
customer data private if the customer submits a request via e-mail.
But many other Web retailers make no such pledges. Under existing
law, they're free to sell any information about you, to anyone
willing to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the many Web sites that don't sell anything,
but still collect lots of personal data on visitors. Many sites
offer free Web pages and free e-mail service. But these services
aren't really free. They're provided in exchange for personal
information that can be used to build up a database of potential
customers. And consumers have no control over what happens to this
data.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most aggressive effort yet to compile information on
computer users was announced on Feb. 8. A California firm called
Free-PC.com is giving away computer systems to the first 10,000
customers who sign up for the company's free Internet access
service.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch. Customers must provide lots of personal
information _ name, address, age, marital status and so on. This
information will be used to beam carefully targeted advertisements
to each Free-PC.com user. In addition, the Free-PC.com system
tracks every site the user visits, adding this data to the person's
marketing profile. Users who frequently visit personal-finance
sites might see frequent ads for mutual funds or banks.
</P>
<P>
   Free-PC officials say they'll sell their data collection to
other companies, but will not include information that can be used
to identify individuals, like names and addresses.
</P>
<P>
   A survey taken last year by the Federal Trade Commission found
that only 14 percent of the 1,400 commercial Web sites surveyed
even had an official privacy policy to inform consumers about how
their personal data would be used. The Clinton administration has
warned Web-based businesses that unless they move aggressively to
provide better privacy guarantees, new federal laws are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Such laws may be inevitable because of events overseas. The 15
nations of the European Union have imposed very strict privacy
regulations on firms doing business inside its borders. For
instance, a European firm can't sell personal information about
customers to a third party without getting explicit permission from
the customer. Now the EU is threatening to limit the ability of
American companies, including Internet companies, to do business in
Europe unless the United States adopts equally tough privacy rules.
</P>
<P>
   American companies are scrambling to stave off regulation by
adopting voluntary privacy guarantees. TRUSTe, a nonprofit
organization in Palo Alto, Calif., certifies companies that pledge
to protect the privacy of Internet visitors. As of December 1997,
only 42 firms had signed up for TRUSTe certification. After
warnings from the federal government, the number jumped tenfold
last year, to 427 firms.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Scott, TRUSTe's executive director, says that reputable
Web sites are becoming much less willing to share information about
their customers. ``I think that the sites that are serious about
this have realized, hey, this is something we can't be cavalier
about,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   TRUSTe doesn't forbid members from sharing the information they
collect. Instead, the organization requires that certified
companies clearly inform visitors about how the firm will use any
information it collects. The idea is not to limit companies' use of
data, but to provide information so that consumers can make
informed decisions about whether to provide data.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether a voluntary program like TRUSTe will
satisfy the concerns of European regulators, who favor rigid legal
protections of consumer privacy. Besides, in the case of Timothy
McVeigh, AOL violated its own rules about releasing personal
information. Some privacy advocates think that only federal laws
will prevent such lapses.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott is convinced that as consumers become better informed,
businesses will have all the incentive they need to improve their
protection of personal data. ``If you're going to violate the trust
of your consumers,'' Scott says, ``I don't think you're going to be
in business a very long time.''

 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than three weeks ago, a team of adventurers reached the
South Pole after an overland trek by a new route _ and promptly
pulled out something that looked like an ordinary cell phone to
receive their congratulatory calls, by way of a satellite link.
</P>
<P>
   Such instant communication is a far cry from 1912, when Robert
Scott's team made it to the pole only to find that a rival team led
by Roald Amundsen had already reached it five weeks earlier. If
they had only known that their quest to be first to the pole was
already lost, they might have turned back and been spared their
tragic end out on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's getting to the point where it will be difficult to
be out of touch with the outside world, no matter where you are . .
. unless, of course, you choose to be.
</P>
<P>
   First came portable global positioning system or GPS devices
that could tell you exactly where you were; now, with the launch of
a satellite-based cellularlike phone service last November, there's
virtually no place left on Earth, even the poles, where you can't
just call someone instantly, using a pocket-sized phone.
</P>
<P>
   The first, and currently only, of these ``anywhere, anytime''
phone services to reach the market is called Iridium, a
66-satellite system owned by Motorola, Sprint, and other investors.
But Iridium won't be alone for long. At least two other companies
are about to introduce similar services, and others say they may
enter the competition before long.
</P>
<P>
   Why are companies lining up to invest the billions of dollars it
takes to start launching the required ``constellations'' of dozens
of satellites and the related ground equipment needed to create a
full-service satellite system?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our studies show there are 20 to 30 million potential
subscribers to this kind of service worldwide,'' says John
Cunningham, a spokesman for Globalstar, a satellite-based system
that expects to begin offering service by the end of this year.
Even if all the companies that have announced plans to enter this
market really did so, he said, ``we think there is much more
demand'' than they could meet.
</P>
<P>
   The basic principle is simple. Most of today's communications
satellites are in an orbit 22,300 miles up, where they appear
stationary over a point on the Earth and can be reached by antennas
over a large portion of the planet but require lots of power to
beam their signals back to the ground. Wireless phones, by
contrast, rely on thousands of local antennas that can only reach a
few hundred yards. The Continued on next page &QL; 
new systems use satellites in much lower orbits, such as
Globastar's 900-mile altitude. At that height, they are within
reach of small, cellularlike phones. (Most companies provide phones
that can also work with ground-based wireless systems as well.)
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for having the satellites in orbits within reach of
small antennas is that they cannot stay put over a given spot on
the ground. Instead, they go whizzing by, propelled by inviolable
laws of physics. That means that in order for every place on Earth
always to be within view of at least one satellite, there have to
be a lot of satellites up there. Globalstar will use 64 satellites,
Iridium has 66 (reduced from the originally planned 77 that caused
the system to be named after element number 77), and another
competitor called ICO, which plans service by late next year, will
use 10 satellites in a somewhat higher orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag for consumers is steep, at least so far; but then,
so was the price of the first generation of cellular phones.
Competition in the market is likely to drive prices down fast, just
as wireless phones have now become so inexpensive that they can
sometimes compete with regular wired phone service. But for the
moment, making a call on the Iridium system will require users to
plunk down about $3,000 for a phone, and then pay as much as $7 a
minute (depending on your location) for calls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you're planning to hike up Mount Everest, take a trek
across Antarctica or the Sahara, or sail singlehandedly around the
world, that may seem like a small price to pay for instant contact
_ something past generations of explorers never even imagined.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, the prices should come down substantially. ICO
says its handsets will sell for less than $1,000, but will not
quote a figure for its per-minute rate. Globalstar's Cunningham
says he can't predict the retail price of their phones, since his
company will sell them only to local service providers, not
directly to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the service itself, he says, will be close to the
roaming rates charged by many wireless systems: perhaps around
$1.50 a minute on average around the world. (Iridium says that in
some locations, its present service price is also in that range).
</P>
<P>
   But for some people, the price just won't matter. Take the group
that made the recent trek to the South Pole. Led by Peter Hillary,
son of Sir Edmund Hillary of Everest fame (who, in 1957, had also
reached the pole), the expedition was caught in blizzards along the
way that kept them tent-bound for days. When one member suffered
frostbite, he was able to get crucial medical advice by phone from
doctors back home.

   And when they finally got to the pole, the team almost
immediately received calls with messages from Australia's prime
minister and Queen Elizabeth II.

THE ATM'S ONE-STOP FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the day hasn't arrived yet, it seems certain that before too
long kids in America will find it hard to believe you once had to
deal with a human being called a teller to get your money out of
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   With the way technology is evolving, a decade from now children
might find it impossible to imagine that there was a time when all
that automated teller machines gave out was money.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more banks convert to ATMs that use complex touch
screens to execute transactions instead of limited numeric keypads,
an amazing range of possibilities is opening up for the corner bank
machine.
</P>
<P>
   While machines that vend stamps and offer coupons are becoming
more common in Greater Boston, they are only the beginning: Prepaid
telephone cards, theater and movie tickets, ski-lift tickets, MBTA
passes, and gift certificates are among the many other products
banks may be offering.
</P>
<P>
   Besides alternative products, new ATMs could also offer access
to a wide range of information and services, such as trading stocks
and mutual funds, applying for loans and learning the latest news
headlines. ``There's a huge effort going on right now to do what we
call non-cash dispensing,'' says Randy Gearhart, director of ATM
development for BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   The key technological innovation driving expanded ATM use is the
growing prevalence of touch-screen computers, which allow people to
put their fingers on an electrically sensitive surface to select a
transaction from a menu on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The first generation of ATMs, using a 10-digit number pad and
buttons corresponding to four or eight preset actions, have been
necessarily limited to a short menu with options like withdraw from
checking or show balances.
</P>
<P>
   By moving to touch screens, banks can offer unlimited options
beyond just withdrawing money or transferring dollars among
accounts. BankBoston, for example, has moved to touch-screen
technology for more than 750 of its 1,600 ATMs. Those now serve
more than 60 percent of all ATM transactions, according to bank
officials.
</P>
<P>
   One approach is to program machines to have multiple displays
corresponding to financial transactions, ticket purchases, or
information requests.
</P>
<P>
   For the most complicated tasks, touch screens could be
programmed to display a 26-letter keyboard on the lower half of the
screen. That would allow people to use the ATM for complex requests
such as buying 500 shares of Consolidated Amalgamated or
reserv-Continued on next page &QL; 
ing two first-class tickets on the Tuesday flight to Bimini.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Shay, BankBoston's executive director of global electronic
banking, says the ``holy grail'' is to find a universally accepted,
fraud-proof medium for printing a broad range of tickets through
ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, banks would be able to get sports arenas, cinemas,
airlines and other businesses to accept a universal, printable
ticket that might include security features such as a watermark or
hologram to prevent forgery.
</P>
<P>
   While banks are only beginning to exploit ATMs, experiments now
underway suggest the boggling range of capabilities the machines
could soon offer:
</P>
<P>
   --Spanish banks using Diebold machines have begun selling
bullfight and opera tickets.
</P>
<P>
   --Cathay Pacific Airways has begun rolling out ATMs inside
jetliners that allow users to exchange currency or buy cards for
inflight entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   --In Charlotte, N.C., and Orlando, First Union Bank plans this
spring to roll out machines that register a photographic image of
people using the ATM instead of a card to verify their identity
when they cash a check.
</P>
<P>
   By establishing their identity over the phone the first time
they use the machine and having a picture taken, people will later
be able to cash checks on the spot by entering their Social
Security number and having their identity verified through
``biometric'' comparisons made by two cameras. However, customers
will pay a fee of up to $3 per $100 cashed.
</P>
<P>
   --Elsewhere in the world, including England and South Africa,
banks are developing technologies such as retina or thumbprint
scans as an alternative to requiring customers to carry a bank card
with an electronic strip.
</P>
<P>
   --Later this year, BankBoston expects to install modular
printers inside ATMs that will allow people to request, for an
as-yet-unspecified fee, an up-to-the-minute printed bank statement.
The printers will go behind panels that now have a slot the width
of a standard piece of office paper.
</P>
<P>
   --Singapore banks use ATMs to issue checks to customers as a way
of curbing mail fraud and theft of checks. While customers wait for
about 2 minutes, the machine prints up, binds and dispenses a
supply of 15 or 20 personalized checks.
</P>
<P>
   One limitation is that currently, most machines used by
BankBoston and other banks hold four cassettes. Normally, all four
hold money. In machines that sell stamps, one of the four cassettes
is converted to dispense stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The downside to converting cassettes to hold different products
is that it increases the frequency bank employees need to refill
the machine with money, as well as the risk someone trying to make
a withdrawal will find the machine out of service because it has
run out of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economics of getting rid of a cash cassette versus the
number of customers we would serve'' by offering other products
``haven't made a whole lot of sense so far,'' Gearhart says.
``There needs to be demand and there needs to be a business case
for doing it.''

RED ROCK CANYON OFF VEGAS' BEATEN PATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It gleams brilliantly in red, causing all who
encounter it to stare, as if mesmerized by an open flame.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not some neon monstrosity, promising ``shrimp
cocktail, $1.99'' in front of a casino on the Las Vegas strip.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the setting sun provides the wattage, a freak of geology
the dramatic blaze of color.
</P>
<P>
   Red Rock Canyon, while only a few miles away from the man-made
gorge of electric light that is Las Vegas Boulevard, offers a stark
contrast to the frenetic rhythms of the strip _ and an alternative
to Nevada visitors who don't get a surge of adrenaline pondering
laws of probability.
</P>
<P>
   The canyon, a national conservation area administered by the
Bureau of Land Management, teems with desert history and crawls
with current-day escapists.
</P>
<P>
   It lies directly west of the city, in a crook of the Spring
Mountains, which were aptly named. More than 40 springs and catch
basins gurgle forth in this 197,000-acre desert oasis. Not
surprisingly, long before modern dams and aqueducts, life clung
resolutely to these hills: American Indians more than 1,000 years
ago, then Spanish adventurers in search of gold, operators of a
stagecoach route in the 1800s, later wealthy ranch recluses such as
Howard Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it has been claimed by those in search of back-country
recreation or simple reflection. During a three-day visit in
mid-January, I encountered walkers, joggers, bicyclists,
rock-climbers, hikers and horseback riders. I found families
spreading out picnic lunches atop great sandstone boulders and
couples _ perhaps as an antidote to the scrupulous climate control
of the casinos _ sunning themselves on rocks like lizards.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the payoffs can be quite unexpected. After two days
spent hiking deep into ravines and riding a horse high onto a
ridge, I decided to check out a children's hike and a
wheelchair-accessible path. I was stunned by the rewards: a
petroglyph (ancient Indian carving on a rock) and a pictograph
(ancient painting on rock).
</P>
<P>
   The canyon area is like that _ full of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first is its proximity to Las Vegas. The drive is all
of 24 miles from the heart of the strip, requiring about 35 minutes
because of the creep through massive freeway construction at the
15/95 interchange north of town.
</P>
<P>
   So much of the drive is spent in suburbs or
suburbs-in-the-making that you'll probably wonder if you've taken a
wrong turn somewhere. But about five miles past the last bulldozer
on West Charleston Boulevard (which becomes Highway 159 and follows
the old stage route), the luminescent red of the canyon comes into
view.
</P>
<P>
   The details of how this place came into existence are as jumbled
as the geology itself. To simplify, cracks and crusts and thrusts
and plates violently rearranged themselves many millions of years
ago, such that red sandstone, tan sandstone and gray limestone
marbled the area like a cake.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is dazzling. The most dramatic sight is a towering
swath of red sandstone that faces southwest, just inside the park
entrance (daily fee is $5 for vehicles, $2 for motorcycles). The
scene is particularly dramatic in the late afternoon, as the
setting sun fires the rock face.
</P>
<P>
   A 13-mile scenic driving loop courses through the park, but most
of the visitors seem to linger here, no matter how tight their
sightseeing schedules.
</P>
<P>
   There are multiple ways to explore Red Rock Canyon. I chatted
variously with backpackers, rock-climbers, bicyclists and one
rather masochistic jogger: staggered with fatigue after running
trails, she took the briefest of breaks before taking on the scenic
drive itself. Because it is so close to the housing tracts of west
Las Vegas, tourists don't exactly have the place to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Given the history of the region, horseback and foot transit
seemed the most appropriate methods of exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Rock Canyon Riding Stables offer a half-dozen or so
trail rides from a makeshift corral area just down Highway 159 from
the park entrance. On the phone, the reservations clerk had piqued
my interest with her description of the Fossil Ridge ride. ``You'll
climb up the side of a mountain, where you'll see some fish
fossils, some caves and some unusual rock formations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I embarked early one morning with my guide, Gary Plumlee, a
former history major at Oklahoma State University who briefly
worked the rodeo circuit before settling here.
</P>
<P>
   We saw no fish fossils. We saw no caves. We saw no particularly
unusual rock formations. But we did climb up the side of a
mountain. The view from the top of the ridge was so impressive that
I really didn't mind much that this ride fell so short of its
billing.
</P>
<P>
   The ridge commanded most of the park area, and the panorama had
my attention wandering. Plumlee frequently snapped me back to my
senses with his unique running commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid to give Red a kick to get him to keep up,'' he
said. ``He's like a kid or a woman _ he'll do whatever he can get
away with.''

ELECTRONIC BANKING GROWING DESPITE LOW-TECH GLITCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter T. Szymonik's mailbox gets stuffed with bills, just like
everybody else's. But unlike most of us, Szymonik doesn't haul out
his checkbook and a roll of postage stamps to make his payments.
For Szymonik, a 35-year-old manager at Romac Emerging Technologies,
a consulting and outplacement firm in Manchester, Conn., going to
the bank means going to his home computer and logging onto the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been using on-line banking for almost three years now,''
says Szymonik, ``and would never go back to manual checks.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Bankers Association, about 625 of the
nation's 9,000 consumer banks presently offer some form of on-line
banking, which allows customers to carry out many common
transactions over the Internet, or by dialing into the bank's
private network.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, where Szymonik banks, was one of the first in the
nation to embrace on-line banking back in 1995. Bob Shay, executive
director of global electronic banking for BankBoston, says that
375,000 of his bank's 1.8 million customer accounts _ about 21
percent _ use some kind of on-line banking system. That customer
base, he says, is growing by 50 percent a year ``We're really being
lifted by the consumer move to the Internet,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the early on-line banking systems required dialing into
a private network run by the bank. But today, as millions of
Americans hop onto the Internet, many are finding it is simple to
interrupt an evening's Web surfing to drop by the bank. New York
City market researcher Jupiter Communications estimates that 18
million US households will be banking on line by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Money and computers go together well. For one thing, computers,
designed for record-keeping and number-crunching, are ideal for
keeping track of one's cash. But perhaps more important, money is
largely a computerized concept to begin with. For many years, most
of the world's money has existed, not as stacks of bank notes, but
as data bits stored within computer networks. At last, cheap home
computers and easy Internet access are enabling ordinary people to
handle their money with the same electronic efficiency as large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   On-line banking systems fall into two general categories. You
can sign up for a system, such as BankBoston's HomeLink or Fleet
Bank's Web Banking, that works with any standard Web browser. This
method lets you go on line from practically anywhere to get
up-to-date information about your finances. You can also use this
method to pay your bills and transfer funds among different
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks, including BankBoston, also let the customer
communicate with the bank through a popular money-management
program, such as Intuit Inc.'s Quicken or Microsoft Corp.'s Money
software. These banks have made arrangements to link their computer
systems to a network operated by Intuit.
</P>
<P>
   Users of Quicken and Money dial a number that connects them to
the Intuit network, or they can link up through the Internet. Then
they can download their latest banking data directly into their
software.
</P>
<P>
   But this method forces users to do their banking on the computer
where their banking software is installed. With Web-based banking,
any Internet-linked computer in the world will do. In addition, the
Web-based systems tend to provide more up-to-date information,
while data sent through the Intuit network is generally delayed by
about a day.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Web-based services make it more difficult to keep
permanent records of your data. Users must download a file
containing the data, then import it into a home-finance program.
For those who want an easy way to keep accurate records, it's
simpler to bank directly through their finance software.
</P>
<P>
   Many banks provide basic on-line services free of charge. You
can log on to verify account balances or see if a check has
cleared. But for many users, it's being able to pay bills on line
that makes computer banking worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Banks generally charge service fees for on-line bill payment,
though they will often make an exception for those with large
amounts on deposit. Customers who use a bank's own Web-based
banking system often pay less than those who use software like
Quicken. That's because it costs the bank more money to process
checks through the Intuit network.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with on-line bill payment isn't technology,
but the lack of it. In an ideal world, the entire process would be
electronic. Money would be transferred instantly from your bank
account to the company you're paying. In the real world, it hardly
ever works that way, because very few companies are equipped to
handle direct electronic payments. Instead, the bank must print out
a check and mail it. Ironically, these checks will often take
longer to arrive than if you'd mailed them yourself. Thus, you may
have to pay your bills earlier in the month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many companies ask you to return a coupon with your
check, to help them enter the payment into their computers. You
can't include these coupons when you pay on-line. Many consumers
have had bill payments go astray because of a missing coupon.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, this happens less often as more people use on-line
banking. Meanwhile, major companies are slowly moving toward
so-called ``electronic bill presentment'' systems, that will let
them send bills over the Internet and receive instant electronic
payments through consumer bank accounts. Jupiter Communications
estimates that 15 million households will pay bills this way by the
year 2002. It won't make bill paying any more pleasant, but at
least they won't clutter up the mailbox.

Las Vegas: `` he'll do whatever he can get away with.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; We passed a jumble of sun-baked boulders. ``If you come back
in summer, that would be a good place to find rattlesnakes _ if you
were looking for them.''
</P>
<P>
   We ultimately returned to the valley floor, where some padding
seemed to be added to the ride to get it up to its one-hour,
15-minute promise: We passed by the lot where I'd parked my car,
past a cluster of trash dumpsters, around the lower corral, left at
an idle backhoe, around the empty industrial wire spools ...
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're keen on getting astride a horse _ or you'd like to
take in some dramatic views without having to do the walking
yourself _ this recreational option can't be recommended. It's a
bit pricey (my ride was $69, the popular rim canyon ride is $89)
and, obviously, it doesn't always deliver on such promises as
fossils and caves.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking in Red Rock Canyon proved to be much more gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   At the park visitor's center, just past the fee-payment kiosk,
you can pick up a free flier that includes a map and detailed
directions to no fewer than 23 hikes. The trailhead parking areas
are well-marked along the scenic drive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular starting points is Sandstone Quarry,
perhaps because of the eye-catching confluence of red and tan
sandstone. A rock face near the parking lot is dramatically
two-toned, and exploration opportunities abound.
</P>
<P>
   During my midweek visit, I found most of the hiking trails to be
infrequently traveled. Because the park is so easily accessed from
the Las Vegas strip, it gets a great number of visitors, but most
arrive in gambler's garb and don't venture more than 100 or so feet
off the road.
</P>
<P>
   When I set out for the base of Turtlehead Peak, for example, I
didn't see another soul after I was a quarter-mile up the trail.
</P>
<P>
   The trail was rated strenuous, and it wasn't long before it
began living up to its billing. At one point, it skirted a ravine
that climbed toward the Turtlehead Peak saddle. The view from here
was spectacular, the scenic loop drive through the park just a
faint squiggle on the desert floor below. Then the trail dropped
down into the ravine itself.
</P>
<P>
   There were no switchbacks to ease the ascent. Heck, after a
while there was no trail, just a scramble over rocks, roughly
approximating a climb up the Monte Carlo's fire escape. After an
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   No self-respecting Spanish soldier of fortune would put himself
through this, unless it had been verified that one of the Seven
Cities of Cibola was at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   More moderate alternatives are the hike from Sandstone Quarry to
Calico Tanks or the hike from White Rock Springs to Keystone Thrust
Fault.
</P>
<P>
   The latter requires a drive up an undeveloped and extremely
rocky road, such that in the parking area at the end of the road
you find only trucks, four-wheel drive vehicles and rental cars.
The hike's payoff is a convergence of red, tan and gray rock in a
small canyon, but this sight is probably best viewed in the
morning. By afternoon, the clash of colors is muted by the long
shadows of Hogback Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   On the second half of the scenic drive, few cars seem to stop,
perhaps because their occupants spent most of their allotted time
at that gash of red rock just past the visitor's center. But this
portion of the route, along the base of the richly textured Spring
Mountains, should not be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that I found the pleasant surprises in the
children's walk and the wheelchair path. Both are found along a
road spur to Willow Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Discovery Trail is seven-tenths of a mile round
trip and presents only gentle climbing. It might be wise to stop at
the visitor's center first so you'll be able to respond to the
inevitable questions. One instant, for example, you're walking amid
tan rocks, and the next you're traversing bright-red dirt. The
trail is immaculately maintained, with rocks fashioned into stair
steps for some climbs, and your little explorers will find a
flowing creek and a waterfall that was just a dribble down a cliff
face when I visited.
</P>
<P>
   But the real highlight is the petroglyph. It's impossible to
miss, since archeology students who are examining it have
constructed a barricade around it to prevent current-day social
Neanderthals from defacing it. Carved into a rock face is a stick
figure, about 24 inches tall, which appears to be raising its arms
above its head, as if to signal some alarm. (Avoid the shrimp
cocktail?)
</P>
<P>
   The wheelchair route, meanwhile, is at the Willow Springs picnic
area. About 100 feet of concrete pathway has been constructed,
taking in a pictograph and an agave roasting pit _ a Jacuzzi-sized
earthen mound where ancient residents used to cook rabbit, tortoise
and bighorn sheep.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp eye will spot the pictograph, which is about eight feet
off the ground on the wall of a rock shelter, directly above a sign
urging visitors to leave it alone. Six palm prints are visible.
Archeologists believe they were made 800 years ago by Anasazi
Indians who dipped their hands into a homemade paint and pressed
them to the rock.
</P>
<P>
   Red Rock Canyon certainly will let you feel as if you're a long
way from the Vegas strip. If you let it.
</P>
<P>
   On my first day, as I walked out of a canyon toward Sandstone
Quarry, I encountered three balky hikers, one of whom asked, in
evident annoyance, ``Is there anything to see up there?'' At the
time, we were standing in a dry creek bed, surrounded by red and
tan canyon sides, radiant in the late-afternoon sun, with yucca,
manzanita and scrub oak providing accents of greenery.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to say, ``Look around you.''
</P>
<P>
   But didn't. Obviously, in Red Rock Canyon, discovery,
appreciation and a sense of wonder are only accomplished on an
intensely individual level.

   When Robert Sanford of Massachusetts calls his daughter in
Florida, he doesn't use the regular phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford, using a basic telephone, routes his call over an
Internet system managed by AT&AMP;T and gets charged 7.5 cents a minute
no matter what time of day he calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple and the quality of the service is
excellent,'' says Sanford, an international business consultant.
``I was amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like every other business in America, telephone companies
are experimenting with the Internet. Their interest is in using it
as a vehicle for carrying phone traffic. So far the market is
relatively tiny _ sales of $500 million are forecasted for this
year _ but the efficiency of delivering phone conversations in the
so-called Internet protocol, or IP, format is attracting a lot of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is currently offering service in seven metropolitan areas.
IDT Corp., a Hackensack, N.J., Internet service provider, is
operating nationwide and has 250,000 customers. Qwest
Communications and Sprint are not in the Boston area yet, but they
are rolling out the technology.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the attraction is price. Howard McNally, an AT&AMP;T
vice president, calls Internet telephony fat-free long distance.
The price is low, from 5 to 7.5 cents a minute,For that, consumers
have to prepay their accounts with a credit card and dial 31
numbers to place a call.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials at companies experimenting with the
Internet, the current market is geared heavily toward budget-minded
customers and college students. ``Anyone who is frugal,'' McNally
says. ``It's the person who would drive across town to save 2 cents
on gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies are able to offer the low rates because they don't
have to pay the local phone company an access fee to start the
call. That saves about 2 to 3 cents a minute. The companies also
save on billing and customer service because calls are prepaid.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, customers prepay for their calls in $25, $50 or $100
chunks. They can arrange to have their credit card automatically
charged again when their balance runs low. To place a call, they
punch in a local access number, dial their home phone number, a
four-digit PIN number and then the number they are calling.
</P>
<P>
   Voice processing equipment at the local access number converts
the phone conversation into individual packets of digital
information that are then Continued on next page &QL; 
routed over the Internet to the area to which the phone call was
placed. Equipment there reassembles the packets of information,
routes the call back on to local phone lines to the person being
called. It all happens in a blink of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies route their calls over the public Internet, but
most companies are using private Internet networks. They say this
gives them more control over the routing and the quality of the
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in Internet calling has been steady but slow, primarily
because Americans seem reluctant to prepay for phone service. But
industry officials like McNally say the IP approach will pick up
steam rapidly as more and more calls are carried over cable wires
coming into homes.
</P>
<P>
   The IP approach is considered a more efficient way of routing
calls. Regular phone connections generally require a one-to-one
connection that occupies a fixed amount of space on the phone
network even if no one is talking. Under the IP approach,
information travels in packets down several different Internet
pathways to the ultimate destination, where they are reassembled.
The technique uses up less space on the network and allows more
calls to be handled.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, which is busy buying or partnering with cable companies,
plans to adopt IP for all calls it handles over cable wires coming
into customer homes. AT&AMP;T officials say the IP approach will allow
them to handle more calls efficiently and permit installation of
more lines into a single home at reduced cost. ``We're betting the
ranch on IP in the future,'' says AT&AMP;T spokesman Gary Morgenstern.

CHILLED OUT AND ACHING FOR SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Maybe it's because my new house has no furnace
and I can't remember a colder winter in the 23 years I've lived in
California. Maybe it's something else, something mystical or at
least spiritually evolved.
</P>
<P>
   All I know is, for the first time in my adult life, I ache for
spring.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of revealing some innermost psychological secrets, I
admit that, until now, I have never held spring in all that high a
regard. Certainly not as high as the majority of the human race
does, not to mention so many poets and songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   And this was true even when I lived in the Midwest and East,
where winter means frozen windshield wipers and everybody going
outside dressed up like the Michelin tire man.
</P>
<P>
   Now, autumn, I could always get excited about. It has texture
and depth and contradiction: Days grow short, leaves die, but
school starts and wine goes into bottles for that old abracadabra.
</P>
<P>
   Spring, though, always struck me as a lightweight, incessantly
chirpy, without profundity. It's nice, sure, but ...
</P>
<P>
   This year, something is different. The prospect of spring
inspires the sort of positive anticipation I've rarely experienced
since adolescence. (Negative anticipation, on the other hand,
fairly typifies the landscape of my adulthood.)
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, I am actually aware of the infinitesimal
lengthening of the day. I don't mean I've just noticed that it
stays light a little longer, I mean I feel the days growing. Inside
my own neuro-muscular system. And this awareness stirs in me _
well, um _ hope.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the buds.
</P>
<P>
   Before this year, when I saw pink or white buds on bushes or
trees, I thought only, ``That's nice.'' The near-instantaneous
appearance of yellow acacia all over town had an even worse effect.
Brushing my hand through their feathery softness, I'd think,
``Yeah, you're gorgeous, but you're doomed. Come the next rain,
you'll be splattered all over the sidewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, I have a bud jones.
</P>
<P>
   I can't keep my eyes off a 25-foot prunus tree that grows in
front of my neighbor's house. The pale pink of its buds _ some
already opened into tiny flowers _ keeps making me think of a
baby's fingers. Each branch seems a symbol of new life, innocence,
almost unlimited potential.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, the phenomenon could be just the result of having to
warm a house all winter with an oven and two kilowatt-guzzling
space heaters. But it might signify a more substantial change.
Perhaps I've finally joined the human race and the poets or at
least reached an age and an accumulation of experience that allow
me to respond to the subtle profundities of spring.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the net effect has me optimistic as all get-out and
absorbed with thoughts of rebirth and new beginnings. So, in that
spirit _ and unaccustomed as I am to membership in the Fan Club of
Spring _ I offer this excerpt from Swinburne's ``Atalanta in
Calydon,'' written in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   For winter's rains and ruins are over;
</P>
<P>
   And all the season of snows and sins;
</P>
<P>
   The days dividing lover and lover,
</P>
<P>
   The light that loses, the night that wins;
</P>
<P>
   And time remembered is grief forgotten,
</P>
<P>
   And frosts are slain and flowers begotten,
</P>
<P>
   And in green underwood and cover
</P>
<P>
   Blossom by blossom the spring begins.
</P>
<P>
   Is that nice or what?
</P>
<P>

COMPUTERS HELP TEACHERS KEEP IN TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's one of the mantras of education reform in
Massachusetts: better communication among parents, teachers, and
students.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been constant complaints that teachers have no
phones and parents have little time to converse during school
hours. And while teachers want to share lesson plans, they say it
is difficult to communicate with peers from isolated classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Computers that poured into schools during the last several years
were intended to help students learn. While a debate still reigns
over whether that is really working, the machines are now giving
teachers powerful access to parents, students, and each other
through an Internet provider designed only for Massachusetts
educators.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 21,000 teachers have signed up for the $25-a-year
MassEd.Net service, which gives them an e-mail account, personal
Web space and unlimited access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to reach teachers in the classroom,'' says Ed Biggs,
a fifth-grade teacher at the Batchelder School in North Reading. He
says parents now contact him through the service to discuss their
children's progress. He shares ideas, lesson plans, and suggestions
with other teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to drop a short message than to get in touch
with a teacher,'' by phone or other means, he says.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main components of the education reform effort _
getting teachers out of classrooms to share ideas _ has been one of
the largest stumbling blocks. Meanwhile, getting parents more
interested in their children's achievement also has been slow as
teachers have trouble getting in touch with parents during the work
day.
</P>
<P>
   MassEd.Net, which was started last year, is the first program of
its kind in the nation and gives teachers 24-hour free technical
support. The $25 annual fee compares to about $240 for the rest of
the public.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 80,000 educators in the state who are eligible
for the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say a teacher has a whole new curriculum and is teaching
ancient civilization and starting on ancient Egypt,'' says Greg
Nadeau, chief technology officer for the state Department of
Education. ``There are probably a handful of people in
Massachusetts who are trying to start the same unit but the teacher
will never meet them. Now she can send an e-mail to teachers in
certain schools. It transforms the way teachers communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   For David Chuckran, an advanced biology teacher and head of
science for the Bridgewater-Raynham Regional School District, the
system has helped him help students. This quarter, students are
writing about organ harvesting and they must cite at least five
Internet sources. Once students complete the paper they have the
option of sending it to him via e-mail, which gives them an
automatic two-day extension. Students who don't have computers at
home can use school or library computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all choose the e-mail option,'' says Chuckran. ``If they
have any problems as they are working on their papers they e-mail
me and I help them along and answer their quesitons. It's been a
fantastic way of working and interacting with students.'' In
addition, last month, Gov. Paul Cellucci announced a program that
will allow teachers to take college and professional development
courses on-line.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of next year, a grant will pay outstanding teachers
to post up to 1,000 lesson plans on a Web database that other
teachers can access. Eventually, teachers will be able to choose
lesson plans from other teachers. What's more, Nadeau says, they
will be paid for it, just as textbook companies are paid for books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will create a real marketplace of ideas . . . This will be
a richer source than all the textbooks,'' Nadeau says.

   Strange lumps of matter on the outskirts of our Galaxy may be
stars from a bizarre ``mirror sector'' of the Universe, say
physicists in the United States and Australia. Although these stars
could be burning fiercely in the prime of their lives, the laws of
physics that govern them would make them invisible to human eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Such stars could also be home to mirror planets and maybe even
mirror organisms that have adapted to see their mirror world, yet
are blind to ours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what these life forms would be like, but it's a
possibility,'' says Rabindra Mohapatra of the University of
Maryland at College Park.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion concerns more than a dozen so-called MACHOs,
clumps of matter that seem to be on the fringes of the Milky Way.
Although invisible, their gravity bends light from background
stars, betraying their presence. But no one knows what they're made
of. With masses about half that of the Sun, they're too heavy to be
failed stars known as brown dwarfs. Aging stars called white dwarfs
are a possible candidate. But astronomers see no sign of the heavy
elements that white dwarfs would have shed into space in earlier
phases of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mohapatra and his colleague Vigdor Teplitz have suggested
that MACHOs are made of a weird kind of mirror matter generated in
the big bang. The idea of mirror matter, first suggested in the
1980s, is that every particle in nature has an elusive, unseen
partner. Mirror particles would bolster theories of how the four
forces in nature acted as one in the early Universe.
</P>
<P>
   Mirror matter would come with its own unique set of laws. It
would feel the force of ordinary gravity, and could clump into
mirror stars and planets. But its versions of the strong, weak and
electromagnetic forces would be different from those we know.
Although mirror stars would burn through nuclear fusion just like
normal stars, they would not emit photons, so they would be
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Mohapatra and Teplitz say the case for a mirror sector is backed
by data from experiments that suggest the three known neutrinos can
``mix'' and flip from one type to another. Some experiments hint
that the three particles are mixing with a fourth kind _ perhaps
from the mirror world. Assuming that's true, the researchers have
used neutrino data to calculate the strength of forces in the
mirror world. From this, they predict that the maximum mass of a
stable mirror star would be about half a solar mass _ just right to
explain the MACHOs.
</P>
<P>
   The physicists, who have submitted their work to Physical Review
Letters, say further experiments with neutrinos may help confirm
their theory. Robert Foot of the University of Melbourne, who has
independently come to similar conclusions, suggests another test.
If a mirror star exploded, it would emit a burst of neutrinos. This
could be detected, but the ``phantom'' explosion would be
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a possibility,'' Mohapatra says. However, he says there
are hints that nuclear reactions would burn stellar fuel faster in
the mirror world. It's possible that any mirror stars _ even small
ones _died young and collapsed into black holes long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be correct,'' says Charles Alcock of the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California, one of a team that has
discovered MACHOs. However, he thinks the idea is speculative and
difficult to test. ``I don't expect any of us, in our lifetimes, to
be able to confirm this.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``When my time comes,'' King Hussein said, ``I hope it will be
like my grandfather's _ and like Yitzhak Rabin's.
</P>
<P>
   It was November 1995 at the funeral of my husband, Yitzhak, and
this was the first time since the death of his grandfather that
King Hussein had set foot in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   His bold comment reflected the personal history of the family of
the king. In July 1951, when he was just 16, King Hussein saw his
grandfather, King Abdullah, gunned down at the Al-Aqsa mosque in
Jerusalem by an Arab assassin who feared the king was trying to
make peace between the Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   For my husband's funeral, 87 heads of state had landed at
Ben-Gurion Airport. President Bill Clinton and former Presidents
George Bush and Jimmy Carter also attended the funeral. Most of the
leaders wore yarmulkes, but King Hussein wore a traditional
Jordanian red-checkered kaffiyeh.
</P>
<P>
   So moving were the king's words: ``My sister, Mrs. Leah Rabin,
my friends, I had never thought the moment would come like this
when I would grieve the loss of a brother, a colleague and a friend
_ a man, a soldier whom we respected as he respected us.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lived as a soldier,'' His Highness continued, ``you died
as a soldier of peace, and I believe it is time for all of us to
come out, openly, and to speak our piece, here today and for all
the times to come ... Let's hope and pray that God will give us all
guidance, each in his respective position, to do what he can for
the better future that Yitzhak Rabin sought with determination and
courage ...
</P>
<P>
   After the burial service, everyone filed past us. I shook hands,
I kissed them as they came to console us, sharing our unspeakable
pain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On July 25, 1994, a very hot and humid day, King Hussein,
President Clinton and Yitzhak had signed, on the White House lawn,
a declaration that ended an official state of war between Israel
and Jordan. Just before the signing ceremony, I met King Hussein
and his wife, Queen Noor al-Hussein, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   I was standing beside Vice President Gore's wife, Tipper, when
the queen and I were introduced. The Princeton-educated queen, the
daughter of an American airline executive, struck me as both
articulate and surprisingly down-to-earth.
</P>
<P>
   (I was even more impressed when Yitzhak and I were guests of the
king and queen of Jordan, and Queen Noor personally served us at
the table as a special gesture of respect.)
</P>
<P>
   Resolving the agreement with Jordan meant that soon Jews from
all over could at long last visit Petra _ the dream of many young
people who literally risked being killed just for a glimpse of the
spectacular red rock formations.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't wait to see it. ``Your Majesty, are you aware how
much Israelis always wanted to visit Petra?'' I remember saying to
Queen Noor at this first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, do you know how worried we are already?'' she replied.
She was making reference to the Israeli reputation for ``storming''
tourist sites. Months later, before the opening of an important
bridge between our countries, Queen Noor sent me the most beautiful
gold pin with a relief of the red rock of Petra.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein and Yitzhak addressed the U.S. Congress on July 26.
In his speech Yitzhak noted, ``Only a 70-minute journey separates
these cities, Jerusalem and Amman _ and 46 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Yitzhak was invited to meet King Hussein alone
at his hotel. Shortly before the meeting, an unexpected message was
delivered: Would Mrs. Rabin please join us? Of course I came along,
figuring that Yitzhak and the king would talk while the queen and I
would spend time together, but I was surprised when His Majesty
asked me to join the three of them. They were to discuss the
financial implications of the Israeli-Jordanian treaty. I quickly
realized that the queen was totally aware of the issues, and I was
pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   We spent an amiable hour together. The Friday night after we'd
returned from our trip, we were sitting in the living room of our
Tel Aviv apartment when the phone rang. It was the king calling
from his airplane, en route from Washington to London, thanking
Yitzhak for his insight and his friendship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion in 1970, at a holiday reception, I had
encountered Andrew Mossbacher, chief of protocol in the U.S.
Department of State. We were at the home of a Nebraska congressman,
and Mossbacher told me he was invited that night to a dinner in
honor of King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Two months earlier, in September 1970 _ ``Black September'' _
the Jordanian army had clashed with PLO guerillas in Jordan. Many
PLO leaders _ but not Yassir Arafat _ were advocating the overthrow
of King Hussein and the establishment of a Palestinian state inside
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein decided to strike back decisively. Meanwhile Syria
threatened to send tanks into Jordan, and the United States was
concerned that the king's government would fall. The United States
wanted to rally support for King Hussein. Israel was the conduit to
send a preemptive warning to Syria to keep their tanks out of
Jordan, but eventually Jordan did all this by itself.
</P>
<P>
   I told Mossbacher, ``Please tell King Hussein that you and I met
at a cocktail party and I asked you to give him my regards, and to
say that we Israelis very much admire his courage and determination
in his struggle with the PLO.'' Perhaps it wouldn't do any good,
but it certainly could do no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Very early the next morning, Mossbacher phoned to say, in his
deep voice, ``Mrs. Rabin, we all have our problems. Perhaps King
Hussein has more than we do. You made the man happy last night. He
was so excited that, when I escorted him to his car, he repeated,
`Please don't forget to give the Rabins my heartfelt thanks and
best wishes.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Israeli Day of Independence in May 1995,
Israeli television presented a dialogue between King Hussein and
Yitzhak in Aqaba. Before the interview, we at last visited Petra.
We were a large group, including our children, and Petra was even
more magnificent than I expected.
</P>
<P>
   One walks down the narrow path between sheer red rock faces. The
limestone cliffs surrounding you almost obscure the sky, their
fantastic shapes rich in pinks, reds and grays. At the end of the
path is a clearing with a marvelous temple carved out of the pink
limestone.
</P>
<P>
   But the real excitement was to be found in what God, not man,
made. Yitzhak enjoyed the monumental scenery of Petra, but he may
have savored more the implication of Israelis now being able to see
Petra freely for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, 1995, Yitzhak appeared on Larry King's television
show on CNN, along with President Clinton, King Hussein, Shimon
Peres and Yassir Arafat. The interview reflected the rapport these
men now shared.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was to be a dreadful day. But as Yitzhak walked off the
speaker's platform at the rally of Nov. 4, 1995, he heard the love
and blessings of hundreds of thousands of voices, young and old,
too long silent, now ringing out as one, urging him forward in the
name of peace. Descending the stairs to his waiting car, I am sure
his thoughts, as always, turned to the hard work of the days ahead
_ to Syria and beyond. But a nobody with a 9mm Beretta and a mind
littered with hate interrupted the song of his life _ and my world,
our world, was never to be the same.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the months following Yitzhak's death, the nation paid tribute
by naming many structures and facilities in his memory. On Jan. 6,
the trauma unit of Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital was renamed the
Rabin Trauma Unit. King Hussein attended; it was his first visit to
Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   I expressed my thanks to the whole trauma unit team, who had
been by Yitzhak's side that fateful night of Nov. 4 from the first
moment he was brought there to the very last, when they realized
they could do no more. The shock had been enormous _ to have the
prime minister brought in in critical condition, trying everything
possible to save him, and then having to make the decision to take
him off life support and declare him dead.
</P>
<P>
   I should have thanked them that night in November for their
efforts, but I was dazed _ I just was not thinking at all. Finally,
in a clearer moment, I expressed my gratitude for King Hussein's
presence by quoting scripture: ``Blessed be he by coming and by
leaving us on his way home.''

<P>
   KEY LARGO, Fla. _ Leadership groups in the newspaper industry
have agreed to mount an aggressive campaign to increase readership
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will be led by the Newspaper Association of America
(NAA); the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE); NMC (the
Newspaper Management Center of Northwestern University); and the
McCormick Tribune Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to develop an industry-wide campaign came at the
end of a two-day readership conference here.
</P>
<P>
   NAA Chairman Richard D. Gottlieb, president and CEO of Lee
Enterprises of Davenport, Iowa, said a plan for specific steps will
be developed by May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this issue must be tackled by our industry head-on.
Readership will increase when all of our industry joins forces,''
Gottlieb declared.
</P>
<P>
   Readership, referring to the number of people who read a
newspaper as opposed to the number of people who buy it, is
measured by research companies using random surveys. From those
surveys, marketing firms extrapolate numbers that the researchers
say represent total readership.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Sturm, president and CEO of NAA, will coordinate
development of these options in collaboration with ASNE, NMC and
other organizations within and outside the newspaper industry.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to focus on readership builds on an initiative of
the McCormick Tribune Foundation, begun in 1997 with a steering
committee involving NAA, ASNE and NMC. In 1998, Gottlieb asked the
steering committee to design the Readership Summit to precede the
1999 winter meeting of the NAA Board of Directors. The foundation
is the underwriter of the summit collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Incoming ASNE President N. Christian Anderson III, publisher of
The Orange County Register in California, and incoming ASNE Vice
President Richard A. Oppel, editor of the Austin
American-Statesman, voiced their commitment to the industry
initiative.

   NY-ARCHITECTURAL-SALVAGE (New York) _ In New York, odd bits and
pieces of the older structures _ gates, railings, sculpture panels,
statues, columns, even whole walls _ have been saved from the
wrecker's ball and incorporated in new designs, usually to preserve
links with the past, but also frequently to save money. A result is
a city rich in architectural salvage, with fragments of buildings
grafted onto others or standing alone, offering a glimpse of what
otherwise might have been lost to history.

WOMEN PLEDGES TO USE TOBACCO DAMAGES FOR EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A former heavy smoker who had her first
cigarette at a high school dance and went on to develop lung cancer
has vowed to put a $50 million punitive damages award against the
Philip Morris Cos. into programs to keep children from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a person who doesn't want to see the next generation
die,'' said Patricia Henley, a 52-year-old grandmother who was
awarded the damages against the tobacco giant Wednesday in San
Francisco Superior Court. ``It's a victory for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict came one day after the jurors ordered the company to
pay Henley $1.5 million in compensatory damages to cover medical
bills, pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   If the rulings on compensatory and punitive damages stand, the
total award would be the largest to date in a tobacco liability
lawsuit filed by an individual smoker. Other awards have been
overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Henley, who lives in Eagle Rock, Calif., said she didn't
want any of the money. She wants to start programs in elementary
schools that teach children ``what's in a cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she also wants to put the money toward fighting asthma
and other smoking-related diseases in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said initially that I would never take a nickel of their
blood money,'' Henley said. ``I'm not a martyr. I did what any
other person who totally comes to recognize that poison is being
sold for profit would do.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury returned the verdict after deliberating just 3 1/2
hours.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Philip Morris said the nation's largest tobacco
company would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly disappointed the jury didn't return a defense
verdict,'' said Bill Ohlemeyer, the company's lead lawyer. ``The
amount of the award speaks to the jury's potential sympathy or even
hostility toward Philip Morris, as opposed to deciding the case on
evidence in the courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cheryl White, Henley's lawyer, said the jury was swayed
during the five-week trial by voluminous documentation showing that
the company knew of the ill effects of tobacco and looked the other
way. She said it also was apparent to the jury that the company
targeted young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's clear that the average citizen when you
present them with the facts and industry's own documents ... they
are horrified by what they see,'' White said. ``Since the documents
are out there, and juries get to see them, the industry is not
going to be able to get away with murder any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley, who was diagnosed last year with inoperable lung cancer,
alleged the tobacco company hooked her on cigarettes after she
began smoking at age 15.
</P>
<P>
   After years of smoking Marlboro-brand cigarettes, she said
called Philip Morris about 10 years ago to ask about the dangers of
tar and nicotine. She said the company suggested that if she was
worried she should switch to Marlboro Lights.
</P>
<P>
   She did. It didn't make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up smoking twice as much,'' Henley said.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4, 1998, Henley, a three-pack-a-day smoker, was
diagnosed with cancer. After chemotherapy treatments, the cancer is
in remission. But she said she feared the cancer would return
``with a vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel sorry for myself, but I live in fear of the next
day,'' she said. ``I don't want anybody to go through what I went
through.''
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, Henley's lead lawyer, Madelyn Chaber, told the
Superior Court jury to send the company a message ``that the price
of human life cannot be calculated into the cost of doing
business.''

CLINTON COULD SAVE HIS LEGACY IN WANING DAYS OF TERM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With impeachment clouds cleared away, President
Clinton has a chance to put his presidency into overdrive and
salvage some of the legacy he values so highly.
</P>
<P>
   But the odds are daunting, political experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Although the president's job-approval ratings have hovered at a
high 65 percent throughout his impeachment ordeal, the public
judgment of Clinton the man has been much lower. For example, a Los
Angeles Times poll last month showed 75 percent of respondents said
that Clinton does not share their values.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, ``historians will take proper note of a
perfectly decent, probably above average, policy record for this
president,'' said Charles O. Jones, a political science professor
at the University of Wisconsin. ``But the historical record is also
full of scandals and judgments even by members of his own party
that he acted recklessly and reprehensibly. So his achievements
will forever have an overlay of scandal and questions about his
personal character.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, Republican lawmakers still smarting from their
public relations defeat in the impeachment battle may be in no mood
for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a poisoned atmosphere which is not conducive to
working together,'' said George Edwards III, director of the Center
for Presidential Studies at Texas A&AMP;M University. ``It reinforces
partisanship which is already strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to try and regain legislative momentum by
focusing on a mix of broad, sweeping issues such as fixing Social
Security and the small-bore, focus-group-tested initiatives he
favors. Among his more recent offerings: Combating childhood
asthma, providing support for foster children beyond age 18, and
background checks on purchasers of firearms at gun shows and flea
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans worry that the drawn-out impeachment saga
has eroded their public support five years after they seized
control of Capitol Hill. For this reason, GOP lawmakers may be more
disposed to bargain with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Republicans ``have good reasons to produce in these
last two years _ the president for obvious reasons, the Republicans
to show they can do more than investigate and impeach,'' said
Jones. ``The fact that Clinton is a lame duck doesn't necessarily
mean he can't get something done with this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperation could yield legislation reviving Social Security and
Medicare and regulating managed-care health plans. These would be
compromise victories, but enough for Clinton to build the
non-impeachment side of his legacy a little higher, just as they
would show that the Republican-led Congress can produce legislative
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation in which there's no mutual respect between
the two branches of government, but there may be mutual self
interest,'' said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar and senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, Hess said, face the very real prospect of losing
control of Congress in the 2000 election. Republicans maintain a
razor-thin six-seat margin in the House, five seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fear of hanging is what they're up against,'' Hess said. The
21 months between now and Election Day 2000 are ``fraught with
political peril for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is emerging from a bruising battle that could have ended
the careers of many other politicians. Considering that, his
political strength is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   That strength shows up in ways that make Republicans nervous.
</P>
<P>
   In a Time/CNN poll last month, 50 percent of those questioned
said they trusted Clinton more than Republicans in Congress on the
issue of taxes (while 35 percent said they trusted Republicans
more).
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the GOP's proposal to cut taxes across the board
10 percent, Clinton wants to target tax cuts to middle-class
families facing education or child-care expenses, or supporting
elderly or disabled relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cutting has been a traditional Republican issue.
</P>
<P>
   The same poll showed that 56 percent said they trusted Clinton
more than Republicans on Social Security (with Republicans scoring
31 percent), 51 percent favored Clinton on tobacco policy
(Republicans 28 percent), and 59 percent favored Clinton on
education (Republicans 29 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Chances for accommodation between Clinton and Congress are
strengthened by the fact that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ind., are both
practical conservatives with little stomach for the stiff
ideological confrontations that marked the era of now-departed
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing this despite Clinton, not because of Clinton,''
said Stephen Wayne, a government professor at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approach to Congress _ particularly the House _ is
guided by contradictory impulses. On the one hand, he paused during
his State of the Union speech to shake Hastert's hand, a bipartisan
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, his rage over the House impeachment vote is
inspiring him to work hard to win a Democratic majority in the
House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legislative track record in 1998 was far from
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   According to Congressional Quarterly's annual study of voting
patterns, the administration prevailed in just 51 percent of the
154 House and Senate votes where the White House took a position.
</P>
<P>
   That compares unfavorably to other presidents in their sixth
year in office: Dwight Eisenhower (76 percent), Richard Nixon (59.6
percent in 1974, the year he resigned amid the Watergate scandal)
and Ronald Reagan (56.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lost the biggest vote of all in 1998, the Dec. 19 House
vote to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   One threat to a Clinton-Congress accommodation is the
conservatives' enduring dislike of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's conservative wing and its grass-roots supporters, a
source of much party activism and cash contributions, demanded
impeachment. Already suspecting their leaders of betrayal in their
budget dealings with the White House, Republican conservatives
almost certainly will view with suspicion any post-impeachment
accommodation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   These activists ``hate Clinton and they're the ones who have the
most to say in (Republican) primaries because they're the ones who
show up to vote,'' Edwards said. ``That explains why Republicans
persisted in impeachment, and that's not going to end'' now that
impeachment is over.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Edwards said, don't look to GOP conservatives to help
Clinton secure his legacy.

NEW HOTELS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LAS VEGAS _ In addition to the Four Seasons, several other
hotels are due to open in Las Vegas over the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   Mandalay Bay: The theme will be Polynesian, accented by a
10-acre water park that will include a sandy beach, a wave-making
machine that figures to attrack bodysurfers and a swim-up shark
tank. The hotel and casino, owned by Circus Circus Enterprises
Inc., will be at the extreme south end of the strip, next to the
Luxor. It will feature 3,700 rooms and a 12,000-seat entertainment
arena. Scheduled opening: March 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Venetian: Getting difficult to find open space on the strip?
Simple. Create your own. This hotel and casino is going up on the
site of the Sands, which was imploded in 1996. The Las Vegas trend
of replicating famous world sites continues here, as a grand canal
will stretch 1,200 feet to transport visitors along a 90-store mall
_ accompanied by singing gondoliers, of course. Every room in the
hotel will be a suite, with 3,036 of them planned in the first
phase. Scheduled opening: April 13.
</P>
<P>
   Paris: Just what the desert needs _ a 50-story Eiffel Tower
(half the height of the original), hard by replicas of the Arc de
Triomphe, the Paris Opera House and even the River Seine. The tower
will feature a restaurant at 100 feet and a glass elevator carrying
you to an observation deck at the top _ 540 feet up. Not enough? An
enormous hotel ballroom will be modeled after the Hall of Mirrors
at Versailles. This hotel and casino will be located adjacent to
Bally's, another Hilton property. Scheduled opening: fall.
</P>
<P>
   Aladdin: Another major implosion _ of the original Aladdin, in
1997 _ will make way for a new 2,600-room hotel and its casino,
plus a 1,000-room music-themed hotel and a 7,000 seat performing
arts center. The hotel and casino will attempt to transport you
back to ancient Arabia (watch out for a lawsuit from Disney), with
a 450,000 square foot marketplace to lure shopaholics. Expected
opening: spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Off the strip: In northwest Las Vegas, the Resort at Summerlin
is due to open in April. It will feature five golf courses, and its
spa will be nearly as big as its casino. ... In Henderson, Nev., on
the north shore of man-made Lake Las Vegas, Hyatt is building a
terraced, hillside hotel and casino. Designed with a Mediterranean
theme, the property is targeted to open early next year. &UR;

FOUR SEASONS HOTEL AN OASIS FROM THE HUBBUB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
( Editors: Note italics in 2nd graf. Has sidebar slugged
VEGAS-HOTELS). 
 
  
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LAS VEGAS _ The construction workers were on their hands and
knees, carefully laying marble for yet another new hotel on the Las
Vegas strip.
</P>
<P>
   They were not, however, replicating some temple or statue or
fountain from Greek antiquity. This would be a lobby floor. A
marble lobby floor that met the simple,
distinguished, &UR; (ITALICS) &LR; tasteful &UR; (END ITALICS) &LR;  standards of a
Four Seasons resort.
</P>
<P>
   The redefinition of Las Vegas continues apace. Now this city
that so long has celebrated the big, bold and bombastic feels the
market is ripe for a stately hotel that does not believe it needs a
casino in its lobby to survive.
</P>
<P>
   You may not have heard all the details yet. The prevailing
perception of the Four Seasons Las Vegas is that it will be little
more than an appendage of the throbbing, Polynesian-themed Mandalay
Bay Resort &AMP; Casino _ with the properties scheduled to open
concurrently on March 2 at the south end of the strip, next to the
Luxor.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true the Four Seasons will occupy the upper floors _
35 through 39 _ of the Mandalay's burnished-gold tower, it was
evident on a recent tour of the construction site that the Four
Seasons has taken great pains to establish a separate and distinct
identity.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby, two stories tall and destined to reflect a
Mediterranean theme, has been grafted onto the tower on the
opposite side of the Mandalay's main entrance; it will be accessed
by its own driveway through lush greenery.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby is a considerable structure, with 26,000 square feet
of functional space. The hotel will have its own bars, restaurants,
fitness center and even its own pool _ discreetly screened from
Mandalay's water park (which will include a wave-making machine) by
a thick stand of foliage. And it will have its own elevators,
whisking guests directly to those upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be a 424-room hotel with 35-story views,'' said
spokeswoman Lori Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Mandalay tower is roughly in the shape of a three-winged
washing machine agitator. The Four Seasons has constructed spacious
suites at the wing tips, and the effect is spectacular: 180-degree
views that will allow some well-heeled guests to take in the
sunrise from the living room and the sunset from the bedroom. In a
three-bedroom configuration, with a third view up the heart of the
strip, that suite will set you back $3,000 a night ($1,500 for one
bedroom). The Four Seasons' standard room will range in price from
$200 to $700 nightly.
</P>
<P>
   The design elements and appointments, meanwhile, conform to the
Four Seasons stndard: oversized bathrooms with marble vanities and
gleaming brass fixtures; fluffy terry-cloth robes, down pillows and
floor-to-ceiling windows in the rooms; plus the Verandah Cafe just
off the lobby, which will offer a rarity in this city _ outdoor
dining.
</P>
<P>
   No Las Vegas hotel has ever gotten a five-star or five-diamond
rating, according to Nevada Magazine. This one appears to be
striving to be the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons' objective was to create an environment
convenient to a casino without having all that chaos full in the
face of hotel guests. Accordingly, it is marketing itself as the
first nongaming hotel on the strip. That might be a bit of a
stretch, since it shares Mandalay's tower and ownership (Circus
Circus Enterprises Inc.). Also, according to the Las Vegas
Convention and Visitors Authority, the Tally Ho operated as a
nongaming hotel on the strip some 30 years ago before adding a
casino and eventually becoming the Aladdin.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, two hotels just off the strip do not have casinos _
the Alexis Park on Harmon Avenue and the Courtyard by Marriott on
Paradise Road. The Alexis Park, which, on a recent two-night stay,
was found to be a bit tattered and have poor service, has filed an
application to add a casino.
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons looks forward to standing apart from its strip
brethren. ``We think people will walk into the lobby just to
experience a hotel without a casino,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   That a market was perceived for this kind of traveler is a
significant development for Las Vegas, and perhaps part of a
growing trend. The area, confronted with competition from river
boat and Indian gaming (particularly in California in the latter
case), has broadened its appeal, undergoing a recent infusion of
fine art, highbrow entertainment, celebrity chefs and exclusive
shopping. The hope is to be perceived as a corporate and resort
option, not just a gamblers' mecca.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the transition of Las Vegas,'' said Kennedy. ``There is a
movement toward being an entertainment capital. Some of the most
prestigious names in food are here _ it's no longer the image of
all-you-can-eat buffets and 99-cent breakfasts. There is upscale
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotels are starting to be more sensitive to that.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Four Seasons is going to the bank on it.

ROMANOV FAMILY TREASURES ON DAZZLING DISPLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Fact box included.)  
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ One minute, the senses are assaulted by clanging
bells, flashing lights and the garish spectacle of a Brazilian
carnival being played out right there on the floor of the casino.
The next _ after passage through a door, a metal detector and
another door _ the ambience changes so abruptly you feel the need
for Dramamine.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if you have stepped into the hushed, reverential
atmosphere of an exhibition hall. All around you are treasures from
Russia's Romanov dynasty. Thrones, gowns, uniforms, Faberge pieces,
elaborate porcelain dishware. Some of it has never been outside
Russia before.
</P>
<P>
   This is a manifestation of Las Vegas' ongoing wrestling match
with its identity: A well-earned reputation for all that is crass
collides with a kind of nouveau riche pursuit of class. A shotgun
marriage, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio Suite Hotel &AMP; Casino, the carnival-themed behemoth just
off the strip, might seem an unlikely place for the exhibition of
``Treasures of Russia,'' more than 1,150 items of art and history
from Peterhof Palace, the czars' summer retreat that lies just
outside St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rio, at about the midpoint of the exhibit's run (open
through April 15), has pulled it off in impressive fashion. Thus
far, about 2,000 visitors a day have put aside their cards, chips
and winnings long enough to take a 45-minute stroll through the
exhibit and survey the lavish lifestyle of people who hit the
jackpot by virtue of birth.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas doesn't seem to mind if outsiders find incongruity in
all of this. The city laughs along with jokes at its expense and
has long since shed any inferiority complex.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who cringe at the thought of a fake Statue of
Liberty sharing the same few blocks with a fake pyramid, a fake
Riviera and, soon, a fake Eiffel Tower and fake canals of Venice
need not fear for the presentation of these museum pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio painstakingly re-created various rooms of Peterhof so
that objects might be viewed not in a static environment but in one
that might closer simulate the original settings for the pieces.
Designers from the Rio visited Peterhof, then attempted to
replicate ceilings, walls and floors of various rooms and galleries
of the palace. In several rooms, there is even Disneyland-like
light pouring in through windows that ostensibly face out on
gardens or the Gulf of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   To enhance the realism, an audio tour _ narrated by Charlton H_
is available. As Heston's patriarchal stage voice describes what
you're seeing, dishes clink, chairs scrape, and characters speak in
heavily accented English that sounds a bit like comedian Yakov
Smirnoff with a cold.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit pieces envelop you in the history of the dynasty,
and leave a strong impression as to the beauty _ and the
unconscionable excess _ of the imperial appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Macdonald, manager of publications for KCET in Los
Angeles, is fluent in Russian and led tours to the Soviet Union in
the 1980s and early '90s. ``When we'd walk through the armory
chamber and the palaces, the most common remark I heard was, `No
wonder they had a revolution.'''
</P>
<P>
   The treasures, he added, ``were beautiful but obscene,
especially with the knowledge that 99 percent of the people were
living in miserable squalor.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the items on display at the Rio:
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!A silver dressing table that belonged to Empress Elizabeth
when America was just a string of British colonies.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!The nightshirt Paul I was wearing in 1801 when he was
beaten to death in his bed chamber in a palace coup.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!The ink well used by Nicholas II to sign his letter of
abdication in 1917, not long before he and his wife and children
were slaughtered by Bolsheviks.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!A Faberge egg, the Chanticleer, on loan from the Forbes
Magazine Collection in New York. Of the 44 Faberge eggs known to
exist today, it is believed to be the largest (an important
distinction in this city). A rooster popped out of the top, flapped
its wings and crowed when it was presented to Dowager Empress Marie
Feodorovna in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!The cards and playing chips that Catherine the Great
favored for her after-dinner games of chance _ again, a fitting
inclusion for Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!A brooch with rubies and sapphires the size of salmon
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!And plates. Plates upon plates. Some 350 porcelain pieces
are on display in a gallery titled ``Dining With the Czars.''
Elaborately painted. Trimmed in gold. Appearing utterly
inappropriate to bear anything that would go into your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   It's an altogether impressive display. But this is, after all,
Las Vegas, which curbs pretension at the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the ``Treasures of Russia'' exhibit was host to a
wedding. It turns out that Tommy Spain, a professional poker player
from Atlanta, was in town to participate in a poker tournament at
the Rio. And get married, of course. He was accompanied by Tatyana
Golub, who had just emigrated to the U.S. from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Why not stage the ceremony amid the czarist treasures?
</P>
<P>
   The line of exhibition visitors was held up for a bit, a local
minister arrived, and the Rio even hired models who dressed as
Peter the Great and Catherine the Great _ who not only escorted the
bride and groom down the aisle and stood by them during the
ceremony, but actually signed the marriage certificate as
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding took place in a re-created gallery from the
Monplaisir Palace, with paintings of Dutch and Flemish masters
framing the bizarre scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not understand this,'' said the obviously confused bride,
who speaks little English and plans to revive her career as a
pediatrician after she and her new husband relocate to Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Golub hails from Orenburg, which is in Siberia. It was natural
to wonder if any of her forebears starved to death while the
imperial court was gorging itself off those plates at Peterhof, but
it didn't seem the appropriate place to ask.

waiting to see the Russian art.

   Chairs and risers and two fake decorative Greek columns (don't
ask) were hastily taken down, but another Rio employee soon arrived
with reassuring words.

   ``The people are backed up clear across the casino,'' he said
into a walkie-talkie. ``But it's all right. I've got Peter and

RED ROCK CANYON OFF VEGAS' BEATEN PATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Runs with factbox slugged VEGAS-GO) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It gleams brilliantly in red, causing all who
encounter it to stare, as if mesmerized by an open flame.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not some neon monstrosity, promising ``shrimp
cocktail, $1.99'' in front of a casino on the Las Vegas strip.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the setting sun provides the wattage, a freak of geology
the dramatic blaze of color.
</P>
<P>
   Red Rock Canyon, while only a few miles away from the man-made
gorge of electric light that is Las Vegas Boulevard, offers a stark
contrast to the frenetic rhythms of the strip _ and an alternative
to Nevada visitors who don't get a surge of adrenaline pondering
laws of probability.
</P>
<P>
   The canyon, a national conservation area administered by the
Bureau of Land Management, teems with desert history and crawls
with current-day escapists.
</P>
<P>
   It lies directly west of the city, in a crook of the Spring
Mountains, which were aptly named. More than 40 springs and catch
basins gurgle forth in this 197,000-acre desert oasis. Not
surprisingly, long before modern dams and aqueducts, life clung
resolutely to these hills: American Indians more than 1,000 years
ago, then Spanish adventurers in search of gold, operators of a
stagecoach route in the 1800s, later wealthy ranch recluses such as
Howard Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it has been claimed by those in search of back-country
recreation or simple reflection. During a three-day visit in
mid-January, I encountered walkers, joggers, bicyclists,
rock-climbers, hikers and horseback riders. I found families
spreading out picnic lunches atop great sandstone boulders and
couples _ perhaps as an antidote to the scrupulous climate control
of the casinos _ sunning themselves on rocks like lizards.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the payoffs can be quite unexpected. After two days
spent hiking deep into ravines and riding a horse high onto a
ridge, I decided to check out a children's hike and a
wheelchair-accessible path. I was stunned by the rewards: a
petroglyph (ancient Indian carving on a rock) and a pictograph
(ancient painting on rock).
</P>
<P>
   The canyon area is like that _ full of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first is its proximity to Las Vegas. The drive is all
of 24 miles from the heart of the strip, requiring about 35 minutes
because of the creep through massive freeway construction at the
15/95 interchange north of town.
</P>
<P>
   So much of the drive is spent in suburbs or
suburbs-in-the-making that you'll probably wonder if you've taken a
wrong turn somewhere. But about five miles past the last bulldozer
on West Charleston Boulevard (which becomes Highway 159 and follows
the old stage route), the luminescent red of the canyon comes into
view.
</P>
<P>
   The details of how this place came into existence are as jumbled
as the geology itself. To simplify, cracks and crusts and thrusts
and plates violently rearranged themselves many millions of years
ago, such that red sandstone, tan sandstone and gray limestone
marbled the area like a cake.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is dazzling. The most dramatic sight is a towering
swath of red sandstone that faces southwest, just inside the park
entrance (daily fee is $5 for vehicles, $2 for motorcycles). The
scene is particularly dramatic in the late afternoon, as the
setting sun fires the rock face.
</P>
<P>
   A 13-mile scenic driving loop courses through the park, but most
of the visitors seem to linger here, no matter how tight their
sightseeing schedules.
</P>
<P>
   There are multiple ways to explore Red Rock Canyon. I chatted
variously with backpackers, rock-climbers, bicyclists and one
rather masochistic jogger: staggered with fatigue after running
trails, she took the briefest of breaks before taking on the scenic
drive itself. Because it is so close to the housing tracts of west
Las Vegas, tourists don't exactly have the place to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Given the history of the region, horseback and foot transit
seemed the most appropriate methods of exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Rock Canyon Riding Stables offer a half-dozen or so
trail rides from a makeshift corral area just down Highway 159 from
the park entrance. On the phone, the reservations clerk had piqued
my interest with her description of the Fossil Ridge ride. ``You'll
climb up the side of a mountain, where you'll see some fish
fossils, some caves and some unusual rock formations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I embarked early one morning with my guide, Gary Plumlee, a
former history major at Oklahoma State University who briefly
worked the rodeo circuit before settling here.
</P>
<P>
   We saw no fish fossils. We saw no caves. We saw no particularly
unusual rock formations. But we did climb up the side of a
mountain. The view from the top of the ridge was so impressive that
I really didn't mind much that this ride fell so short of its
billing.
</P>
<P>
   The ridge commanded most of the park area, and the panorama had
my attention wandering. Plumlee frequently snapped me back to my
senses with his unique running commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid to give Red a kick to get him to keep up,'' he
said. ``He's like a kid or a woman _ he'll do whatever he can get
away with.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; We passed a jumble of sun-baked boulders. ``If you come back
in summer, that would be a good place to find rattlesnakes _ if you
were looking for them.''
</P>
<P>
   We ultimately returned to the valley floor, where some padding
seemed to be added to the ride to get it up to its one-hour,
15-minute promise: We passed by the lot where I'd parked my car,
past a cluster of trash dumpsters, around the lower corral, left at
an idle backhoe, around the empty industrial wire spools ...
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're keen on getting astride a horse _ or you'd like to
take in some dramatic views without having to do the walking
yourself _ this recreational option can't be recommended. It's a
bit pricey (my ride was $69, the popular rim canyon ride is $89)
and, obviously, it doesn't always deliver on such promises as
fossils and caves.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking in Red Rock Canyon proved to be much more gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   At the park visitor's center, just past the fee-payment kiosk,
you can pick up a free flier that includes a map and detailed
directions to no fewer than 23 hikes. The trailhead parking areas
are well-marked along the scenic drive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular starting points is Sandstone Quarry,
perhaps because of the eye-catching confluence of red and tan
sandstone. A rock face near the parking lot is dramatically
two-toned, and exploration opportunities abound.
</P>
<P>
   During my midweek visit, I found most of the hiking trails to be
infrequently traveled. Because the park is so easily accessed from
the Las Vegas strip, it gets a great number of visitors, but most
arrive in gambler's garb and don't venture more than 100 or so feet
off the road.
</P>
<P>
   When I set out for the base of Turtlehead Peak, for example, I
didn't see another soul after I was a quarter-mile up the trail.
</P>
<P>
   The trail was rated strenuous, and it wasn't long before it
began living up to its billing. At one point, it skirted a ravine
that climbed toward the Turtlehead Peak saddle. The view from here
was spectacular, the scenic loop drive through the park just a
faint squiggle on the desert floor below. Then the trail dropped
down into the ravine itself.
</P>
<P>
   There were no switchbacks to ease the ascent. Heck, after a
while there was no trail, just a scramble over rocks, roughly
approximating a climb up the Monte Carlo's fire escape. After an
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   No self-respecting Spanish soldier of fortune would put himself
through this, unless it had been verified that one of the Seven
Cities of Cibola was at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   More moderate alternatives are the hike from Sandstone Quarry to
Calico Tanks or the hike from White Rock Springs to Keystone Thrust
Fault.
</P>
<P>
   The latter requires a drive up an undeveloped and extremely
rocky road, such that in the parking area at the end of the road
you find only trucks, four-wheel drive vehicles and rental cars.
The hike's payoff is a convergence of red, tan and gray rock in a
small canyon, but this sight is probably best viewed in the
morning. By afternoon, the clash of colors is muted by the long
shadows of Hogback Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   On the second half of the scenic drive, few cars seem to stop,
perhaps because their occupants spent most of their allotted time
at that gash of red rock just past the visitor's center. But this
portion of the route, along the base of the richly textured Spring
Mountains, should not be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that I found the pleasant surprises in the
children's walk and the wheelchair path. Both are found along a
road spur to Willow Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Discovery Trail is seven-tenths of a mile round
trip and presents only gentle climbing. It might be wise to stop at
the visitor's center first so you'll be able to respond to the
inevitable questions. One instant, for example, you're walking amid
tan rocks, and the next you're traversing bright-red dirt. The
trail is immaculately maintained, with rocks fashioned into stair
steps for some climbs, and your little explorers will find a
flowing creek and a waterfall that was just a dribble down a cliff
face when I visited.
</P>
<P>
   But the real highlight is the petroglyph. It's impossible to
miss, since archeology students who are examining it have
constructed a barricade around it to prevent current-day social
Neanderthals from defacing it. Carved into a rock face is a stick
figure, about 24 inches tall, which appears to be raising its arms
above its head, as if to signal some alarm. (Avoid the shrimp
cocktail?)
</P>
<P>
   The wheelchair route, meanwhile, is at the Willow Springs picnic
area. About 100 feet of concrete pathway has been constructed,
taking in a pictograph and an agave roasting pit _ a Jacuzzi-sized
earthen mound where ancient residents used to cook rabbit, tortoise
and bighorn sheep.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp eye will spot the pictograph, which is about eight feet
off the ground on the wall of a rock shelter, directly above a sign
urging visitors to leave it alone. Six palm prints are visible.
Archeologists believe they were made 800 years ago by Anasazi
Indians who dipped their hands into a homemade paint and pressed
them to the rock.
</P>
<P>
   Red Rock Canyon certainly will let you feel as if you're a long
way from the Vegas strip. If you let it.
</P>
<P>
   On my first day, as I walked out of a canyon toward Sandstone
Quarry, I encountered three balky hikers, one of whom asked, in
evident annoyance, ``Is there anything to see up there?'' At the
time, we were standing in a dry creek bed, surrounded by red and
tan canyon sides, radiant in the late-afternoon sun, with yucca,
manzanita and scrub oak providing accents of greenery.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to say, ``Look around you.''
</P>
<P>
   But didn't. Obviously, in Red Rock Canyon, discovery,
appreciation and a sense of wonder are only accomplished on an
intensely individual level.

`TANGO': WITH SIZZLING TANGOS, WHO NEEDS A PLOT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no slight to the lovers seen in Carlos Saura's thrilling
``Tango'' to say that the kissing seen here is less torrid than the
dancing. As in ``Flamenco,'' Saura means to capture the essence of
a dazzling dance tradition, and he does so in a film that wafts
dreamily through countless forms of tango magic.
</P>
<P>
   As shot by Vittorio Storaro with all the nuance and fluidity
such an undertaking demands, ``Tango'' offers transfixingly
beautiful glimpses of the dance and all the wide range of emotions
it can conjure. This Argentinian-Spanish co-production is a very
deserving recipient of a best foreign film Oscar nomination this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Saura doesn't need much of a plot here, not with Storaro's
visual agility and the spirit of an ``All That Jazz'' to capture
the spirit of the dance and its erotic energy. All he needs is a
moody central character _ a director, of course _ who starts to
plan an elaborate tango production while his ideas visibly unfold
around him.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome, brooding Mario Suarez (Miguel Angel Sola) has only
to turn on a wind machine on an empty set, for instance, to send
costumes swaying, bring to life a dressing room full of beautiful
women and send two of them into a tango of taunting seduction.
</P>
<P>
   Using screens, silhouettes, color filters and at one point even
choreography that simulates the reign of terror in a police state,
the film finds artful ways to turn each tango encounter into
something new.
</P>
<P>
   Mario's having been painfully abandoned by his wife (Cecilia
Narova) and his growing fascination with Elena Flores (Mia
Maestro), a sylph of a dancer who happens to be a gangster's
girlfriend, is all the film needs to spin its web. Incorporating
the ballet dancer Julio Bocca and several tango stars into its
let's-put-on-a-show action, it stages a decorous tango at a dance
party, a furiously angry tango between Mario and his ex (this
unfolds in his imagination), a tango of bitter jealousy and one of
first love.
</P>
<P>
   Even children are consumed by the dance as Mario remembers his
boyhood, in which the tango, of course, played a significant role.
</P>
<P>
   And as part of the production being staged, the film includes a
rousing gang tango danced by two groups of men, ``West Side
Story''-style. Two male soloists dance a fiery duet as the film,
ever seeking new ways to emphasis the dance's sensuality, hears
nothing but the rustle of costumes and the maneuvering of feet.
</P>
<P>
   While Sally Potter's ``Tango Lesson'' struggled hard for a
pretext and kept its director tiresomely at center stage, this film
enlists a variety of different dancers to color its different
scenes. Eyes locked, bodies tensed, moves in perfect unison, they
need only display this dance's hypnotic blend of liquidity and
fury, only revel in its dizzying complexity and split-second
timing, to burn up the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tango'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned)). It
includes brief, implicit sexual situations and dancing that leaves
everything yet nothing to the imagination.
</P>

`GOD SAID `HA!'': WHEN LIFE SENDS LEMONS, YOU CAN SURVIVE THE
PITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walloped by twin medical calamities and spiraling domestic
chaos, the actress Julia Sweeney (``It's Pat!'') elected to laugh
instead of cry. As she describes it in her one-woman show ``God
Said `Ha!''' she went from ``a divorce made in heaven'' to what was
supposed to be solo domestic bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Then her brother, Mike, learned he had lymph cancer, and her
parents came to stay with her, turning on all the audio equipment
in the house and saying things like ``Julie, the light is out and I
found another bulb, but I didn't know if you wanted it screwed in
some special way.'' Ms. Sweeney's way of making peace with all this
has been making others laugh about it, too.
</P>
<P>
   She has directed the film version of ``God Said `Ha!''' on a
single, homey-looking set that invites the viewer to settle down
and listen to the reminiscences of a friend: a friend named Job. In
a monologue that carefully balances her brother's ordeal with comic
relief, she begins by describing her parents in fond, rueful
detail.
</P>
<P>
   (She told friends that her father was in Indian land law, but
``what I didn't tell them was that my dad wasn't exactly on the
side of the Indians.'') Though she keeps the camera at such close
range that her actorly flourishes can seem exaggerated, Ms. Sweeney
summons her parents so fondly that's it's easy to share her
affection for them, and her desire to run off to college all over
again, just to get away from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens when your brother gets cancer and your entire
family moves in with you?'' she recalls asking in the self-help
section of a bookstore. ``Where is (italics)that(end italics)
book?'' Such sardonic humor sustains her even when she herself
receives a cancer diagnosis, prompting Mike to suggest that Julia
was jealous of his being in the ``cancer spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Her description of her own medical problems includes invading a
laboratory to pick up her test reports and glimpsing ``big
Tupperwares filled with lungs'' along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The monologue inevitably deepens as the seriousness of Mike's
condition becomes dire, but Ms. Sweeney's account of his death is
mournfully dignified without losing its sense of the absurd. Three
days after losing her brother, she underwent a hysterectomy, and
even that had its humorous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who repositioned her ovaries lost track of one in the
process. (``Don't worry, it's going to turn up eventually,'' she
was told.) And the possibility of childbearing now would have to
include a surrogate mother. ``Oh, great!'' Ms. Sweeney says. ``Now
I have to meet a guy (italics)and(end italics) a girl!''
</P>
<P>
   ``God Said `Ha!' '' is quick-witted and funny without betraying
the sadness of the events described. Nor does Ms. Sweeney exploit
these hardships like a comic strip-mining life for material.
</P>
<P>
   Her mix of hard-won wisdom and amazing resilience keeps the film
honest. On screen as on the stage it lets her share an all too
believable ordeal with grace and good humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``God Said `Ha!''' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).
It includes mild profanity.

`THE TRIO': LIFE IN GERMAN TRAILER (IS THAT A MENAGE A DREI?) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How about this for a new design for living? A father and
daughter fall in love with the same young man, who makes himself
readily available to both. After much anguished breast beating, the
three figure out how to live happily ever.
</P>
<P>
   Their menage a trois is carried on in a cramped old trailer
where they live in domestic squalor, tooling around Germany earning
a hand-to-mouth existence as pickpockets.
</P>
<P>
   That's the far-fetched premise of Hermine Huntgeburth's
unconvincing but well-acted comedy ``The Trio.'' Once its
characters have declared their sexual intentions, this German film,
which opens Friday in Manhattan, doesn't really know where to go
next.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins as a kind of low-rent ``La Cage aux Folles.''
Zobel (Gotz George), a macho gay man in his late 40s, lives an
itinerant life with his pretty, tomboyish daughter, Lizzie
(Jeanette Hain), and his lover Karl (Christian Redl).
</P>
<P>
   Karl, who is losing his hair along with his youth and his zest
for life, fervently wishes to quit his Gypsy-like existence and
settle into a semblance of bourgeois comfort. Zobel and Karl are
continually bickering. Zobel has a wandering eye, and he has to
wheedle a reluctant Karl into putting on a dress and slithering
seductively to the sounds of the Temptations singing ``My Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Lizzie, Zobel's child by a fleeting union decades earlier, seems
perfectly comfortable with her domestic circumstances. Like a
polished vaudeville act, she, her father and Karl have perfected
pickpocket routines, which they put into practice at airline,
railroad and bus terminals.
</P>
<P>
   In one of their most successful scams, one of the men pretends
to be blind and solicits help from a stranger, whose pockets are
emptied while offering assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Everything changes after Karl is hit by a speeding car and
lingers in the hospital near death. Enter Rudolf (Felix Eitner), a
hunky young thief recruited by Lizzie to be Karl's temporary
replacement. Rudolf learns his craft quickly.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, both Lizzie and Zobel have their eye on him.
Lizzie, the first to make a move, throws herself at Rudolf, who
accedes to her frenzied assault. Shortly after that, Rudolf seduces
the very willing Zobel.
</P>
<P>
   During the few weeks Rudolf allows himself to be shuttled
between the two, both of whom are voraciously possessive, the movie
becomes a darkly amusing trailer-trash version of a bedroom farce.
But once Lizzie catches Rudolf in the shower with her father, the
game is up. At this point, ``The Trio'' abruptly runs out of comic
steam.
</P>
<P>
   The film's crucial lapse is the character of Rudolf. Besides
being an eccentric who keeps a pet snake and writes poetry, he
seems to have no other qualities except availability.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay offers nary a clue as to why he would put himself
in such a perilous and uncomfortable situation. Is his need for
family that desperate? Or is he simply a Mephistophelean construct
in a contemporary moral fable?
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Trio'' has the trappings of realism, it offers no
convincing psychological or social raison d'etre for Rudolf's
blithe omnisexuality. It remains a titillating premise without an
explanation.
</P>

GLOOMY ECONOMIC NUMBERS JUST DON'T ADD UP, AUTHORS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things are not as they appear.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that is what a Dallas economist and a longtime
business reporter have concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In their new book, Dallas Federal Reserve Bank economist W.
Michael Cox and Dallas Morning News reporter Richard Alm directly
contradict most market analysts and news media.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are they optimistic about the U.S. economy, but they
also surmise that we've all been better off economically for quite
a while. And it's not just the rich; according to the way they read
the numbers, even the poor are better off than they were 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   This different interpretation of economic statistics is crucial
to Cox and Alm's basic premise. They believe that most of their
brethren in economics and journalism are reading the wrong numbers,
or at best, are presenting an incomplete economic picture.
</P>
<P>
   They aim to set the record straight, as they see it, in ``Myths
of Rich and Poor: Why We're Better Off Than We Think'' (Basic
Books, 256 pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   ``The central purpose of this book is to demonstrate that a
pervasively negative view of the economy doesn't square with
reality,'' Cox and Alm write. ``We acknowledge at the outset the
economy's blemishes, but we don't see poverty, inequality, or other
deficiencies as the defining characteristics of our times.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the true buying power of hourly wage workers has declined
a whopping 15 percent during the past 20 years. But the authors
produce a compelling argument for looking beyond the hourly wage
figures to take a broader view of American living standards.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers say average people are making less than before, but
the authors ask why Americans are spending more. Consumption in
this country has risen significantly during the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Homeownership is at an all-time high, with 66 percent of
dwellings being owned by the people who live in them. We're buying
more cars, too. For every 100 people of driving age, Americans own
94 cars. Twenty-six years ago, it was 53.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant spending also is up 26 percent from a generation ago,
and overall service spending has increased 83 percent from the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Even savings and consumer debt _ two statistics customarily used
to illustrate baby boomers' dire financial position _ are not as
dire as they appear, Cox and Alm suggest. Stock market investing
has soared during the '90s, for example, and consumer debt is still
roughly 5 percent of net financial assets, about where it was in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   So if hourly wages are going down, where is the money coming
from to spend more? Cox and Alm suggest looking at total
compensation packages, which are full of dental plans, stock
incentives and other nonmonetary benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, nonmonetary benefits as a percentage of wages have
increased by a third since 1970,'' they write. ``The average worker
is better off than his or her counterpart in the early 1970s, with
a cumulative gain in total compensation of more than 17 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Other statistics provide another seldom-viewed piece of the
economic picture. In 1947, the authors' numbers show, U.S.
households spent more on goods than services. In other words, the
chicken was the most costly part of a chicken dinner. Today,
Americans spend more on services than goods, which means that more
chicken dinners are eaten in a restaurant or toted home in a
bucket.
</P>
<P>
   With armloads of statistical data, presented in a readable
format, Cox and Alm take on other economic ``myths,'' including
layoffs, imports and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Of the latter, they write that although the poverty rate has
increased slightly during the past 30 years, to 13.3 percent, the
poor are still better off in terms of material possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps most astonishing of all, poor households of the 1990s
in many cases compared favorably with an average family in the
early 1970s in owning the trappings of middle-class life,'' Cox and
Alm write.

 &HT;    PUBLIC TO HAVE FUZZY VIEW OF FINAL VOTE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ TV cameras will be rolling, but the public won't
have a clear picture of the Senate impeachment trial's historic
finale.
</P>
<P>
   As the senators stand at their desks and, one by one, declare
whether President Clinton is guilty or not guilty, the camera will
provide only a distant, gauzy shot of the entire chamber.
</P>
<P>
   It will focus on the clerks as they call the roll and record the
responses. The faces and expressions of the senators will be barely
discernible.
</P>
<P>
   The camera angle for votes is dictated by longstanding Senate
requirements for TV coverage. An appeal by the Capitol's broadcast
press gallery failed to persuade the Senate Rules Committee to make
an exception for the verdicts on the two impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult'' to change the rules, said Rules
Committee spokeswoman Tamara Somerville, adding that a two-thirds
majority vote by the full Senate would be required.
</P>

   Even when no vote is in progress, tight restrictions on the
chamber's nine cameras forbid showing anything but the area where
someone is speaking. In one brief shot on the opening day of the
trial, the cameras did pan the chamber to show the senators sitting
at their desks. But that has not been repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got phone calls,'' said Dave Bass, manager of the Senate
recording studio. ``I was made aware of my mistake.''

<P>
   The Norway, a football field long and 111 feet wide, is a grand
old liner.
</P>
<P>
   It was commissioned in 1957 as the SS France, and it has an air
of elegance in its sumptuous dining rooms, lounges and salons,
where one might expect to see a tuxedoed Cary Grant sharing a glass
of bubbly with Deborah Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   It's different from the new and trendier cruise ships that ply
the Caribbean these days. Not as glitzy, or, as some might say,
``tacky.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 1,000 cabins are more spacious than those on most of
the newer cruise ships. It is fully air-conditioned, with
individual controls in each room. Each room has a full bath with
shower, a color television and a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Many suites have sitting rooms and minirefrigerators.
Housekeeping was superb. We never saw our room attendant, but the
beds were always made in the morning and turned down in the evening
with chocolates on the pillow. The end of the toilet paper always
was folded to a point, as if magically.
</P>
<P>
   The ship features wide, glass-enclosed decks, a throwback to
when the SS France traveled the chilly North Atlantic routes
between New York, Southampton and Le Havre _ back when great ships
were a means of transportation rather than a destination.
</P>
<P>
   There are nine bars and lounges, and a casino. Smoking
throughout the Norway is segregated simply. The port, or left, side
is smoke-free. The starboard side welcomes smokers.
</P>
<P>
   For the sports- and health-minded there are two pools, hot tubs,
a fitness and aerobics center, jogging track, basketball/volleyball
court, golf driving, skeet shooting and a Roman spa.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, the dining experience alone justifies the cost
of cruising. All meals are included in the price; alcoholic
beverages are extra.
</P>
<P>
   The food on the Norway was uniformly superb.
</P>
<P>
   Seafood was plentiful aboard ship, and nearly every meal,
especially breakfast, included heaping mounds of wonderfully smoked
and nonfishy-tasting Norwegian salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Every meal included a vegetarian menu and an
800-calories-or-less spa cuisine menu, though most people go in the
opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Can't decide from the choice of three appetizers? Get them all.
</P>
<P>
   You want three entrees and four desserts? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   One evening over coffee, we casually mentioned to our waiter
that we were probably too tired to stay up for the midnight
chocoholic buffet, a truly sinful experience. Within two minutes a
large tray of several dozen chocolate morsels magically appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The captain's farewell dinner was particularly memorable.
</P>
<P>
   It began with crab cocktail, paper-thin slices of smoked duck
breast drizzled ever so lightly with a burgundy-pear-blueberry
chutney. It continued with broiled Caribbean lobsters; angel-hair
pasta tossed with shrimp, mussels and tarragon; and flaming steak
Diane.
</P>
<P>
   The gustatory orgy, which would have daunted even Elvis,
concluded with a baked Alaska, strong coffee and a Cuban cigar
savored under the stars as we loosened our belts, kicked back and
wondered what the landlubbers were doing just then.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day Eastern Caribbean cruise included stops at the
French/Dutch island of St. Martin and two of the U.S. Virgin
Islands, St. John and St. Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin is a study in contrasts. The French side is prettier
and is where the tourists go to play, eat, drink and relax. The
commercial activity is on the less attractive Dutch side, where
tax-free, duty-free shopping attracts hordes of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The French side offers several beaches, all with white sand,
clear blue water, swaying palm trees, soft island breezes, tall
cool drinks, a European (that means ``nude'') beach, and irritating
locals hawking wares and services to the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Every few minutes they would walk by selling beads,
hair-braiding and massages.
</P>
<P>
   Many water sports were available, but they were not cheap. Jet
Skis, for instance, go for $40 for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Drink prices at the beach on the French side were $2 to $2.50
for a beer, mixed drinks $3 to $4. A so-so lunch of grilled chicken
or fish with rice, veggies and a small salad was about $14.
</P>
<P>
   Over on the Dutch side in the town of Phillipsburg, food and
beverage prices were about half those on the French side. And
everywhere you looked there was a whole lot of buying and selling
going on.
</P>
<P>
   The island offers everything imaginable _ clothing, electronics,
jewelry, liquor, art, you name it _ tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry is touted as costing 15 to 20 percent less than what it
would cost in the States, but buyers should be careful unless they
really know something about jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Dickering over prices was expected at smaller shops and with
sidewalk vendors.

 &HT;    DEBATE, QUESTIONS REMAIN AS LEGACY OF LEWINSKY SCANDAL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (k) commentary categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican campaign to force President Clinton
from office over the Monica Lewinsky scandal is expected to end
Friday in failure, defeated as much by good times and public
relations as by all the president's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   It will take the country months, however, to fully recover from
the year-long trauma of Monicagate.
</P>
<P>
   For while the Senate can dispense with impeachment by acquitting
Clinton of charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, there can
be no simple up or down vote on the vexing questions raised by the
president's conduct and the country's deeply divided reaction to
it.
</P>
<P>
   What's clear for now is that the entire episode has sorely
tested the foundation of American democracy _ its political,
judicial and media institutions _ reaffirming, for the most part,
its elemental strength.
</P>
<P>
   It has laid bare a vast ideological chasm between those who
excuse the president's behavior and those who see such tolerance as
one more milestone along a ruinous journey toward a national state
of moral decay.
</P>
<P>
   And it has undercut the potential and promise of a historic
president who was, by many measures, the greatest politician of his
generation, the first American leader of the post-Cold War era and
the chief executive entrusted to lead the last remaining superpower
into the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   Decades from now, historians may still debate the toll this
scandal has taken on the country and its place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   They may still be divided over whether the scandal has revealed
a chink in the national character or instead demonstrated the
resilience of government by the people and its reliance on the
great, stabilizing ballast of an informed electorate freely
expressing its will.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the court of history decrees, its jurors will remember
that Bill Clinton was no rogue hack who crashed the White House
gates on his own unyielding terms, but rather the twice-elected
precise political reflection of the nation he served, for good or
ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''The retention of William Jefferson Clinton in office says far
more about who we are than what he became in office,'' said
Jonathan Turley, professor of constitutional law at George
Washington University in Washington. ''I am truly uncertain about
who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from lending clarity to the national purpose, the Lewinsky
scandal has left the country puzzled and polarized by profound
questions that will haunt the national psyche for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   --Is it asking too much, for example, to expect the president of
the United States to exemplify the better instincts of the public
he serves, rather than to stand as a living testament to its many
shortcomings?
</P>
<P>
   --Must the communications and information revolution that's
remaking the world become a tool for prying into private lives,
stripping the entire culture of the secluded spaces where
civilization and personal initiative begin? And, if not, will a
vocal minority of self-appointed morals police lay siege to the
American political system forged in revolution and secured by those
who've borne the cost of freedom, often paying with their lives?
</P>
<P>
   --Have Americans lost the ability to distinguish between the
essentials of genuine leadership and the trappings of simple
celebrity? Can the media tell the difference between the two?
</P>
<P>
   --And, most important of all, what sort of tone has been set for
the next generation, in a country whose greatest resource has
always been its fidelity to ideals?
</P>
<P>
   The Senate impeachment trial has provided no clues, nor has its
end lifted the fog of ill will the scandal has sown.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe Clinton should be removed from office for his
conduct have been thrown into a funk.
</P>
<P>
   Those who regard his impeachment as folly are still cranky that
the charges ever went to trial at all and that Clinton's legacy
will forever bear the stain of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will certainly see vindication in the Senate action. And
while the White House has vowed not to gloat, private celebrations
are already planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever you see in public,'' one administration official
said, ''behind closed doors the staff is going to have one hell of
a party.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-thirds of the country that has stood by Clinton
throughout his year of scandal will find some relief as well.
</P>
<P>
   Among the third of the country peeved that Clinton has once
again slipped the noose, however, moods could turn decidedly dour.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regardless of what the president says, his continued presence
in the Oval Office will inevitably cause a sense of terrible loss
for millions of Americans,'' said Turley. ''For those of us who
believe the president has disgraced his office, every day after the
Senate trial will become more difficult to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in a scandal that has produced no obvious winners, the
country has kept faith with the institutions of American democracy.
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken at the first of the year by the Princeton-based
Gallup Organization found that 76 percent of the country remains
confident in the federal government's ability to cope with
international problems, up from 63 percent last year. And 61
percent have faith in Washington's ability to address domestic
issues, up from 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While millions of Americans will disagree with the Senate's
verdict, the process was followed pretty much as outlined in the
Constitution. As a result, a series of institutions played their
intended role _ from the Office of the Independent Counsel, to the
House Judiciary Committee, to the full House and, finally, the
Senate _ and no single entity was permitted to hijack the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has done what he has to do, without exerting
authority he doesn't have. The Congress has done what it has to do,
without exerting authority it doesn't have. And I think the
Judicial branch has come in and asserted itself when it's had to,''
said Randy Wright, who teaches eighth-grade civics at Liberty
Middle School in Ashland, Va. ''It reminds us that each branch has
its duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the genius of American democracy is that
whatever damage Clinton has inflicted is limited to his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing he has done will prevent his successor from defining the
character and qualities of a new administration two years from now,
just as 42 others have done so far.
</P>
<P>
   The Republic has survived the impeachment of Bill Clinton. It
will endure long after he's gone.

UNDATED: sidewalk vendors. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not so at the Ralph Lauren store, at Tommy Hilfiger, the Delft
pottery shop, and the larger and more-established of the hundreds
of stores dealing in jewelry, electronics and liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban cigars were readily available, but again, it pays to shop
around. Most range from $3 to about $20, but from store to store
the prices of identical cigars varied.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin does not have much of a local cuisine. It's fairly
Americanized. Mickey D is there. So is the Colonel. Burger King,
too. Hot dogs, hamburgers, pasta, grilled chicken dishes are
common. There were several Indian restaurants offering fare similar
to that found in Indian restaurants in Texas, but nothing truly
special.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising the back streets, we found the kind of place we like.
It was identified by a crudely painted sign that simply said,
``Eat.'' It was clean, with a half-dozen Formica tables and a menu
posted on a sheet of paper taped to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   For $4, diners had their choice of baked chicken, stewed ox
tail, stewed goat or creole pork chops with rice, black beans,
coleslaw and fried plantains for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was obviously homemade. It was good to taste honest
food that hadn't been chipped, chopped, freeze-dried, canned or
frozen. Good things come to those willing to be a little daring.
</P>
<P>
   St. John is the smallest, quietest and most virginal of the
three U.S. Virgin Islands, taking in only 21 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   The Virgin Islands National Park takes up two-thirds of the
island; the beaches are immaculate and the water clear blue.
</P>
<P>
   Trunk Bay is the most popular beach and features a renowned
underwater snorkel trail. Snorkel equipment can be rented at the
beach. There is a $4 per person beach user fee that includes use of
restrooms and showers.
</P>
<P>
   From the quiet, pristine St. John, St. Thomas is just a
20-minute ferry ride away, but a world apart.
</P>
<P>
   Up in the hills overlooking the bays and cays are many quiet
roads and mansions, but down in the town there is a maddening roar
of power shoppers in overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the stores are filled with everything imaginable. All
manner of currency was accepted, but dollars were the obvious
favorite. Everybody, except for sidewalk vendors, took plastic.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of five minutes in one jewelry store, one nearby
shopper dropped more than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those uninterested in shopping can easily find interesting
little restaurants and bars amid the back streets. There's a Hard
Rock Cafe smack in the middle of all the shops, if that's your
thing.

<P>
   One taxicab trolling a back street in St. Martin had a decal
with 6-inch-tall letters on the windshield that said: ``Love Me
Tender.''

   The back window of course said: ``Love Me True.''

   Back on board the Norway, there was a peace on the water rarely
found elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The gentle rocking and the sea air were strangely both calming
and exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   No land in sight. The vastness of the open water _ particularly
at night, as the sky provided a light show urban dwellers rarely
see anymore _ was humbling. The problems of home and work that had
once seemed so important now seemed as remote and as insignificant
as they truly are.

   FYI
</P>
<P>
   Seven-day cruise rates vary according to season and amenities.
Double occupancy at peak season for what's called a superior deluxe
suite with sitting area, king-size bed, full bath, minirefrigerator
and floor-to-ceiling windows is $2,519. An inside stateroom, very
similar to a standard motel room with private bath, is $1,269.
</P>
<P>
   Rates are about $200 less during the nonpeak season.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line offers weekly cruises from Houston, which
it calls it's Texaribbean service.
</P>
<P>
   Outside cabins (those with windows) start at about $950 per
person, double occupancy for a seven-day cruise. Three-day quickies
go for about half that.
</P>
<P>
   Many special rates and promotional offers are available
throughout the year. For information, check with your travel agent,

GOOD READING FOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH _ OR ANY TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you can tear your kid away from the television when she's not
bent over a stack of homework, celebrate Black History Month with a
good read. Experts at local bookstores and libraries provided
armloads of suggested fiction and nonfiction works for all ages and
ethnicities. We've whittled their recommendations down to eight
great works, from historical fiction to poetry, from folk tale to
biography. Four are new, and four have been pleasing young readers
for years.

   ``A Band of Angels: A Story Inspired by the Jubilee Singers''
</P>
<P>
   By Deborah Hopkinson
</P>
<P>
   Illustrated by Raul Colon
</P>
<P>
   This historical fiction work for young readers warmly tells the
tale of the Jubilee Singers, Fisk University's traveling, spiritual
vocal ensemble, whose concert proceeds kept the all-black school
from folding in its early years. The story, which follows the life
of the narrator's great-great-grandmother Ella, is based on the
real-life story of Ella Sheppard Moore, who was born a slave in
Nashville, Tenn. Her father buys her freedom but then dies, leaving
the 15-year-old poor but not without hope. In 1868, she arrives at
Fisk with $6, a gift for piano playing and an inspiring amount of
determination.

   ``The Invisible Princess''
</P>
<P>
   By Faith Ringgold
</P>
<P>
   ``Long ago, in the tiny Village of Visible, way down in the deep
Deep South, there lived two slaves called Mama and Papa Love.'' So
begins this original African-American fairy tale, written and
gorgeously illustrated by a Caldecott Honor winner. Ringgold weaves
the tale of the Invisible Princess, sent by the Lady of Peace to
bring freedom to the plantation slaves, but then cruelly snatched
away from Mama and Papa by the Prince of Night. She reappears one
day to the plantation owner's blind daughter, and so begins the
beginning of the end of the terrible dark days of slavery.

<P>
   Caldecott Honor winner Tom Feelings wanted to create a book that
would inspire kids ``growing up in an environment where
indifference and hostility are bullets aimed straight at the core
of their spirits.'' The illustrator started with his own sketches
of people from Africa and the United States and then asked
African-American writers to respond to the images. The final result
is this book, containing poems by African-American writers
including Maya Angelou, Langston Hughes and Walter Dean Myers.
``Publishers Weekly'' called the collection ``a unique and moving
collaboration that celebrates the sustaining spirit of African
creativity.''

   ``The Slave Dancer''
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Fox
</P>
<P>
   This historical novel tells the tale of a 13-year-old New
Orleans boy who is kidnapped and put on a slave ship, where his job
is to play his fife while the captives dance to keep their muscles
strong. The book does not shy away from the realities of slavery, a
fact that has led to debate over whether the material is
appropriate for children. Nevertheless, in 1974, the book won the
Newberry Award for the most distinguished children's book of the
previous year.

NOLTE HAS THE GIFT OF MAKING SEEDY CHARACTERS TOO COMPELLING TO
FORGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent cover of the Village Voice, a photo of Nick Nolte,
his face blotchy with ruin, stares out at you. You might be afraid
to touch it for fear of contracting something. It reminds us that
Nolte is the last actor of a certain generation, a man who will
heedlessly throw himself into a role and into off-set recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte certainly doesn't show any vanity in ``Affliction,'' the
bleak character study of a cop, for which a weather-beaten Nolte
received a Best Actor Oscar nomination Tuesday. But maybe the
biggest intersection of Nolte's on-screen and off-screen life was
his turn in the intermittently brilliant adaptation of Peter Gent's
tragicomic football novel ``North Dallas Forty.''
</P>
<P>
   As wide receiver Phil Elliott, Nolte is as swollen as the
Pillsbury Doughboy, his body a snarl of lumpy cartilage. His skills
and talent ensure that he will get the job done, despite
appearances to the contrary. It's the same thing with Nolte. Rather
than whittle himself into a sinewy cliche, Nolte chose to go the
opposite way; he gained weight to make himself sloppy, an visual
joke in a locker room full of six-pack abdomens.
</P>
<P>
   Someone once said that if John Wayne could act, he would be Nick
Nolte. Nolte's broad-beamed physicality, combined with his
unflinching ability to show a turbulent inner life, makes him
probably the best American screen actor
</P>
<P>
   his generation. (At 57, his generation includes Jack Nicholson,
Robert Redford and Warren Beatty.) Also the canniest, since Nolte
is that rare combination of movie star, actor's actor and hustler.
</P>
<P>
   To get a movie made out of ``North Dallas Forty,'' a favorite
book of his, Nolte simply floated rumors to the show business trade
magazines that he was starring in the movie and that it was about
to begin production. His phone started ringing off the hook with
calls from interested producers.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte first came to audience attention in 1976, after starring
as a teen-ager with a wild hair in the miniseries ``Rich Man, Poor
Man.'' He was 35 when he made this breakthrough, which came after
years of solid stage work and a few lame exploitation pictures. But
he took off and never looked back. In ``Who'll Stop the Rain?,''
Nolte burned himself down to sheer will to play the Zen mercenary
Ray Hicks. Much of his best work has gone unseen by most audiences,
because Nolte pushed himself into parts that he desperately wanted
to play. Such as ``Heartbeats,'' an overromanticized version of the
lives of Beat pioneers Neal Cassady (Nolte) and Jack Kerouac (John
Heard) that was so glossy each vowel seems to have been dipped in
caramel.
</P>
<P>
   Even Nolte must realize that his most notable acting work goes
unnoticed. Unfortunately, when he tries to pick a crowd-pleasing
role, his instincts are laughable. In the morose romantic comedy
``I Love Trouble,'' in which he plays an affably competitive
reporter against Julia Roberts' ... well, affably competitive
reporter, he grins and he looks as if he needs a week's sleep. He's
not so good an actor that he can get away with being dishonest.
``Trouble'' followed ``Blue Chips,'' a role for which millions of
dollars were shoveled at him. In ``Chips,'' in which he plays a
corrupt Bobby Knight-like basketball coach under the direction of
the ham-fisted William Friedkin, Nolte is reduced to sputtering and
shouting. He ends up looking like that ``Village Voice'' cover
photo.
</P>
<P>
   In ``48 HRS,'' Nolte ends up screaming, with veins popping out
of his neck, because there was no character written for him to
play, while Eddie Murphy lands softly on his stand-up's finesse.
(The roles were originally written for Clint Eastwood and Richard
Pryor.) Still, it may be one of the best examples of chemistry that
Nolte has shown in the movies. That is, until ``Down and Out in
Beverly Hills,'' in which a devastated Nolte _ a soulful, homeless
enigma _ connects with Richard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler. In this
remake of Jean Renoir's ``Boudu Saved From Drowning,'' Nolte
burrows so deeply into the role _ he lived on the streets for
several weeks before shooting began _ that he seems to have
barnacles on his eyelids.
</P>
<P>
   When a role calls for transformation from the inside, and a
discarding of actor's vanity, there are few better than Nolte. In
``Under Fire,'' as a marauding photographer, he's all reflex,
swiveling with his cameras to catch the disintegrating Nicaragua
around him. Or in the finest, and least-seen, performance of his
career, ``Life Lessons,'' the Martin Scorsese-directed segment of
the movie ``New York Stories,'' he's a tortured, obsessive artist
whose romance with his young assistant (Rosanna Arquette) has
ended. Nolte's overwhelming physical presence gives the piece a
foundation, and his charged, haggard figure gives it life. With
anger and heartbreak eating at him, he looks like a bull struck by
lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Nolte's at his best when he exposes the mulish boy in a
man's body _ an adult wrecked by his inability to lead his life
like a grown man. This warring, contradictory element can be found
in all of his most important work _ his performances in ``North
Dallas Forty, Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Under Fire, Who'll
Stop the Rain?'' and, most recently, in ``The Thin Red Line'' and
in ``Affliction,'' the Paul Schrader film that got Nolte his first
Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Noisy, pained and lost, Nolte plays a man scarred by paternal
abuse. He's a decent, brutish figure who can't think his way out of
anything. It's an American contradiction, made all the more
disturbing because Nolte _ unlike Tom Hanks or Bruce Willis _
refuses to make the little boy in him appealing. (And all the more
the more tragic because he looks old enough to know better.) He's
anxious and lonely. But in the case of ``Affliction,'' he's not
alone. Audiences are finally coming out to see him at his finest.

BLUE SUEDE CRUISE: RIDING THE WAVES WITH ALL THE KING'S MEN _ AND
WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by LINER-NORWAY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT SEA WITH THE KING _ There, out on the bow of the grand ocean
liner, arms outstretched, you can almost see him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the King! I'm the King of the world! ... Thank you ...
thank you very mush.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a way, he is.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis really is everywhere, if not in bloated body, at least in
spirit, and that included aboard the SS Norway the week of Jan. 8 _
Elvis' birthday, as all true fans know _ as it undertook a weeklong
cruise tribute to the once and forever King.
</P>
<P>
   For many, perhaps 80 percent of the 1,800-plus passengers, it
was simply a happy coincidence. But for the rest of the travelers,
their mutton-chop sideburns, glittering shirts and Priscilla
big-hair dos gave away an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Lines sold it as ``The Love Me Tender'' cruise,
with a week of Elvis music, Elvis movies, Elvis tribute performers
(what we used to call impersonators), meetings with the TCB Band,
the Flying Elvi and general revelry in all things Elvis, including
noshing on fried peanut butter-and-banana sandwiches, which as all
true fans know was the Big E's favorite snack.
</P>
<P>
   A highlight of the week was the opportunity to meet and
reminisce with the TCB Band, the group that formed in 1969 and
stayed with the King until his alleged death in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The band was put together by lead guitarist James Burton of
Shreveport, La., a veteran of ``Louisiana Hayride,'' who also
played backup for Ricky Nelson for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was Burton who was approached by Elvis in 1969 and asked to
put together the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me and said he was tired of making movies and wanted
to get back to performing,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton brought in Jerry Scheff on bass, and two Texas musicians,
drummer Ronnie Tutt of Dallas and pianist Glen Hardin, who goes
back to the days of Buddy Holly and the Crickets.
</P>
<P>
   Tutt, who studied music at the University of North Texas, said
Elvis posed some challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like playing drums for a stripper. You never knew what
he was going to do, and you had to watch his every move.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutt said he had to study karate to be able to anticipate Elvis'
moves during his karate period.
</P>
<P>
   One-time Elvis bodyguard Gary C DeBaca, a Nashville police
officer, offered different insights into Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   He said he remembered one officer whose sole responsibility was
to watch Elvis sleep. It seems the King was a sleepwalker.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, C DeBaca said he remembered Elvis as funny and
spontaneous. Like the time they were stopped at a red light in the
limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvis put the window down at a red light and asked the girls
in the car next to them if they knew the way to the Grand Ole Opry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would freak them out,'' C DeBaca said. ``Thing is, he was
always so nice and personable.''
</P>
<P>
   To the fans on the Love Me Tender cruise, such conversations
were an opportunity to touch the King secondhand, and to take many
photographs, often of each other.
</P>
<P>
   There is something peculiar about Elvises taking pictures of
Elvises taking pictures of Elvises. It's like Elvis cubed.
</P>
<P>
   Another anticipated high point of the cruise was to have been a
demonstration by the Flying Elvi, a team of jumpsuit-clad sky
divers done up to look like you know who, but they failed to get
their act off the ground. It seems their parachutes were lost by
the airline.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the Love Me Tender cruise was all that it
had promised. Except, that is, for the most serious of fans.
</P>
<P>
   And fans don't get much more serious than Kirk Moore, a retired
Idaho highway worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked on the ship, I was expecting to be greeted by an
Elvis,'' said Moore, who sported Elvis hair, Elvis sideburns, Elvis
sunglasses and an Elvis T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked like this all my life _ ever since third grade.
I've been a fan for 52 years,'' said Moore, 52.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he was expecting wall-to-wall Elvis, all Elvis all
the time, Elvis and nothing but Elvis, and he was ``a little
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tasso Rummell, who devises and promotes Norwegian Cruise Line's
theme cruises, said it's a juggling act trying to please those who
take a cruise specifically for the theme and those who simply
booked a cruise, unaware of any theme.
</P>
<P>
   Rummell said the big-band and jazz cruises are the most popular
theme cruises Norwegian offers, with about 80 percent of the
passengers on those cruises there specifically for the music. Other
popular theme cruises are country/western week and sports cruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to have options. We have to have the production
shows and things for other people,'' Rummell said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Elvis theme: ``We thought it would be unique,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rummell said Graceland, which owns the rights to most things
Elvis, restricted memorabilia items to be sold, and the performers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things Graceland insisted on was ``no jumpsuits,''
and tasteful Elvis ``tribute performers'' (you can't call them
impersonators anymore).
</P>
<P>
   The cruise featured three tribute performers who performed
nearly every day of the cruise. Mike Albert, an Elvis tribute
performer based in Canton, Ohio, even brought his own fans.
</P>
<P>
   Rummell said he's not sure if an Elvis-themed cruise would be a
yearly event.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to keep it fresh,'' he said, but he added that he
believed it was a successful theme cruise and that there would
likely be another one.
</P>
<P>
   As for those fans for whom there wasn't enough, it should be
remembered that ``fan'' is short for ``fanatic.''
</P>
<P>
   For everyone else it was simply a fine time, thank you very
mush.

`PARTY MONSTER': A PARTY THAT ENDED IN A HORROR SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)``Party Monster'' was televised last June as part of
the Cinemax ``Reel Life'' series. Following are excerpts from Ron
Wertheimer's review, which appeared in The New York Times on June
18, 1998. The film, released by World of Wonder Productions, opens
commercially Friday in Manhattan.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes of fame? Michael Alig's were followed by 10 to
20 years in prison. His is a morality tale for this complicated
age: the details are luridly clear, but the moral is what you make
it.
</P>
<P>
   Alig was the magnetic, flamboyant leader of the cadre of
Manhattan ``club kids'' who flocked to the drug-basted bacchanals
he organized at clubs like the Limelight. By the time the Limelight
was padlocked by federal drug agents in 1995, his bizarre world was
unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Then it blew apart. In 1997, at 31, he was convicted of
manslaughter for the brutal death of one of his troupe, a man known
as Angel who was Alig's sometime roommate and drug supplier.
</P>
<P>
   This story is vividly told in ``Party Monster,'' an hourlong
documentary by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato.
</P>
<P>
   Video verite is the ideal medium for Alig. Much of his
Roman-candle existence was already on tape. He and his hundreds of
anonymously intimate friends strutted for the camera nightly. They
shed clothes, consumed drugs and gleefully submitted to arrest;
it's all shown here, skillfully alternated with later interviews.
</P>
<P>
   (The directors' only serious misstep was including a few
blue-tinted re-enactment scenes that undermine the project's
authenticity.)
</P>
<P>
   Here are former club kids still in awe of what they saw and did.
Here is Alig's mother, who seems sad but only because the joy ride
is over. And here is Alig himself. He has traded his downtown duds
for a Rikers Island jumpsuit, but he also wears the mischievous
grin of a boy who has gotten away with ... what? Murder?
</P>
<P>
   No, he says with a giggle: he had to plead to manslaughter; if
they get you for murder, you don't get a VCR in prison.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager in South Bend, Ind., Alig knew he was different
(being gay was just part of it) and delighted in watching the
bloodiest horror films. He came to New York City, found the night
life and quickly dropped out of college to work as a party
promoter.
</P>
<P>
   A platoon of young people were drawn to his tainted
effervescence. In exchange for drinks and drugs, they dressed up in
high-heeled drag or a bright-yellow chicken suit to help keep the
customers satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The media doted on Alig, who was dependably outrageous on cue. A
young woman named Glitsie recalls seeing him on ``Geraldo'' when
she was 12. ``I thought, `My gosh, that's what I want to do,''' she
says, still wide-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   Another recruit was Andre Melendez, the Angel who strutted at
the soirees in a black biker's cap and feathered wings.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the parties pulsating, Alig began reaching back to his
beloved horror movies, reveling in fake violence and blood. But
life and fantasy became tragically enmeshed.
</P>
<P>
   After Melendez was killed in a fight over debts and heroin, Alig
and a friend hacked up the body and threw it into the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Alig fled with Glitsie, who stuck by him when he was racked by
drugs or the lack of them. But when part of Angel's body washed up
on a Staten Island beach, the accomplice confessed. The party was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have scary dreams about Angel,'' says Alig, who appears
serenely comfortable with himself. ``But nothing I can do will
bring him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Glitsie never lost her childlike devotion to Alig, which
probably saved his life. But not hers. She died of a drug overdose.

THERE'S A MESSAGE HERE, AND IT'S ROMANTIC (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Novelist Nicholas Sparks looks like a happy guy _ so happy that
he risks being tagged with an adjective like ``chipper.'' Perhaps
you'd be happy, too, if your first novel (''The Notebook'') sold
for $1 million, or your second one, ``Message in a Bottle,'' was
snatched up for a movie while it was still in galley proofs.
Especially if, like Sparks, you're only 33.
</P>
<P>
   There's one way to get a rise out of Sparks, though, even if the
smile never completely leaves his face: Suggest to him that in the
'90s, romance is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is absolutely a crock,'' Sparks says adamantly.
``I think romantic love exists _ in fact, I think it exists more
than most people realize. Everyone says 50 percent of marriages end
in divorce. True _ it's a true statement. But every year, 50
percent succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks' ebullience and glass-half-full outlook belie some of the
more tear-jerking elements of his work, which are on full display
in ``Message.'' The movie version, which opens today in a
strategically timed Valentine's weekend release, stars Robin Wright
Penn as a Chicago Tribune researcher and divorced mother who
stumbles across the titular message and becomes so entranced by its
moving words that she tracks down its author (Kevin Costner) in
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   They ease into a cautious romance, but Costner's character has
to overcome lingering feelings for his dead wife, to whom he wrote
the note in the bottle. Paul Newman co-stars as Costner's dad, who
pushes the new romance along.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks believes that the art of writing love letters is very
much alive, and not necessarily dependent on bottles or E-mail.
Twists on epistolary romance run through both books; in ``The
Notebook,'' an old man reads from his notebook to his former lover,
who now has Alzheimer's disease, to try to jar her memory of their
long-ago romance. For Sparks, words of love hit close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I fell in love writing letters,'' says Sparks, who
has been married for 10 years to a woman he met on spring break in
Florida. He was a student at Notre Dame; she went to the University
of New Hampshire. ``I would write my wife(-to-be) three letters a
day, every day, and send them to her, and I guess that's how she
knew I was serious, not just some spring-break guy. ... She
probably got, I don't know, maybe 300 letters _ love letters,
friendship letters, `What I'm doing today' letters. So that's how
we fell in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Romance seems to run in Sparks' family. ``The Notebook'' was
inspired by his grandparents; ``Message'' by the pain his father
endured after Sparks' mother died. Sparks' own romantic history has
been one of commitment; he and his wife married right after
college, seven years before the $1 million deal for ``The
Notebook.'' After selling the book, he traveled to New York to
thank his editor and his agent, but his first thought was of his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the diamond district, and I bought my wife a new
wedding ring,'' he says. ``I came home, made her dinner, lit some
candles, had some music playing, and I got on my knees and asked
her to marry me again.''
</P>
<P>
   For a guy so unabashedly romantic, Sparks is positively
left-brained when it comes to real-life messages in bottles. He's
fascinated not by the messages, but by the bottles and the journeys
that they take over the years. He even threw one off the Santa
Monica Pier when he was 7, asking for a response from whoever found
it (he never heard from anyone). If he tossed out a bottle today,
he says, he'd probably try to track it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go out on a boat maybe 20 miles offshore so that you'd
know it's not going to wash up right away,'' he says. ``And then I
would try to write, in as many languages as I could, the same
message, which would be, essentially, `I'm conducting an
experiment. If you find this bottle, please write down where you
found it, then seal the cork back up with wax and throw it out
again so that the next person can find it.' And then put six or
seven slots there, and when the slots are full, have the last
person make contact. I think it would be neat to see where a bottle
went.''

SCHUMER SAYS HE'LL VOTE TO ACQUIT, ATTACKS CLINTON PROBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Charles Schumer told the Senate Thursday that
he will vote to acquit President Clinton of perjury and obstruction
of justice and he attacked the Rutherford Institute for pursuing
what he said was Clinton's well-known ``personal weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a rookie Democratic senator from New York who voted
against impeachment in December when he was a House member, said,
``My decision will not come as a surprise,'' adding that he made up
his mind about the president's innocence last September.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's actions to conceal his extramarital affair with
Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, ``were wrong and arrogant,''
they did not justify removing him from office, Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   In a six-page statement delivered during closed-door
deliberations, Schumer told Senate colleagues that he had reviewed
``boxes of evidence'' associated with the case and concluded that
Clinton did not lie before a federal grand jury, as the House
alleges in the perjury impeachment article.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was lawyerly, at best, in his grand jury testimony,''
Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning the obstruction of justice charge _ considered the
stronger of two charges _ Schumer said the case presented by the 13
House managers was ``weak, stitched together by circumstantial
evidence and not-provable assumptions about what was in the
president's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Removing the president would do more damage to the country
than leaving a flawed president in office,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a staunch Clinton supporter, said there was evidence
that the president had lied in his civil deposition in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment case. However, the House declined to
impeach Clinton for perjury in that deposition.
</P>
<P>
   In the run up to that vote, all 100 senators are allowed to make
a single 15-minute presentation to colleagues during closed-door
deliberations over the president's fate that began on Tuesday.
Schumer was one of several senators who spoke on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While the transcript of the deliberations is secret, some
senators have released their remarks to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Schumer attacked the conservative Rutherford
Institute, which helped finance Paula Jones' lawsuit, as
``zealots'' who sought to ``exploit a personal weakness that people
knew the president had.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to exploit Clinton's ``weakness,'' Schumer asserted
that the Rutherford Institute used the Jones lawsuit as a launch
pad to investigate Clinton's private life ``to the point of
obsession and use it to bring him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's affair with Lewinsky was uncovered by Jones' lawyers.
The perjury and obstruction charges against the president involve
his attempts to conceal the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer also criticized Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel
who investigated Clinton, asserting that Starr behaved ``like a
special prosecutor, not the even-handed, down the middle counsel
the law required.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator said that Congress should change the law that
allowed Paul Jones' lawsuit against a sitting president to move
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president, even is he or she is a saint, will be sued
25 times if we don't change the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are to blame for using criminal accusations and
allegations of scandal ``to win the political battles and
ideological differences we cannot settle at the ballot box,''
Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the successful Democratic assault on Sen. John Tower,
R-Texas, President Bush's first choice as defense secretary who
came under intense opposition during the confirmation process in
1989 for alleged alcohol abuse and womanizing.
</P>
<P>
   Tower ``was ruined in a political feeding frenzy that was meant
to shame him,'' Schumer said.

CLINTON COULD SAVE HIS LEGACY IN WANING DAYS OF TERM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 14)   (EDS: INSERTS new grafs 10-12 with Gramm, Grassley)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With impeachment clouds cleared away, President
Clinton has a chance to put his presidency into overdrive and
salvage some of the legacy he values so highly.
</P>
<P>
   But the odds are daunting, political experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Although the president's job-approval ratings have hovered at a
high 65 percent throughout his impeachment ordeal, the public
judgment of Clinton the man has been much lower. For example, a Los
Angeles Times poll last month showed 75 percent of respondents said
that Clinton does not share their values.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, ``historians will take proper note of a
perfectly decent, probably above average, policy record for this
president,'' said Charles O. Jones, a political science professor
at the University of Wisconsin. ``But the historical record is also
full of scandals and judgments even by members of his own party
that he acted recklessly and reprehensibly. So his achievements
will forever have an overlay of scandal and questions about his
personal character.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, Republican lawmakers still smarting from their
public relations defeat in the impeachment battle may be in no mood
for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a poisoned atmosphere which is not conducive to
working together,'' said George Edwards III, director of the Center
for Presidential Studies at Texas A&AMP;M University. ``It reinforces
partisanship which is already strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to try and regain legislative momentum by
focusing on a mix of broad, sweeping issues such as fixing Social
Security and the small-bore, focus-group-tested initiatives he
favors. Among his more recent offerings: Combating childhood
asthma, providing support for foster children beyond age 18, and
background checks on purchasers of firearms at gun shows and flea
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans worry that the drawn-out impeachment saga
has eroded their public support five years after they seized
control of Capitol Hill. For this reason, GOP lawmakers may be more
disposed to bargain with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Republicans ``have good reasons to produce in these
last two years _ the president for obvious reasons, the Republicans
to show they can do more than investigate and impeach,'' said
Jones. ``The fact that Clinton is a lame duck doesn't necessarily
mean he can't get something done with this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Republican Senators seemed anxious to put impeachment
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're back here (after a recess), you're never going to
know that this was an impeachment trial,'' said Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa. ``We're going to be buddy, buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said: ``If anything, (impeachment) has
brought us all together. In the end we're going to pass more bills
in record time than we've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperation could yield legislation reviving Social Security and
Medicare and regulating managed-care health plans. These would be
compromise victories, but enough for Clinton to build the
non-impeachment side of his legacy a little higher, just as they
would show that the Republican-led Congress can produce legislative
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation in which there's no mutual respect between
the two branches of government, but there may be mutual self
interest,'' said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar and senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, Hess said, face the very real prospect of losing
control of Congress in the 2000 election. Republicans maintain a
razor-thin six-seat margin in the House, five seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fear of hanging is what they're up against,'' Hess said. The
21 months between now and Election Day 2000 are ``fraught with
political peril for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is emerging from a bruising battle that could have ended
the careers of many other politicians. Considering that, his
political strength is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   That strength shows up in ways that make Republicans nervous.
</P>
<P>
   In a Time/CNN poll last month, 50 percent of those questioned
said they trusted Clinton more than Republicans in Congress on the
issue of taxes (while 35 percent said they trusted Republicans
more).
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the GOP's proposal to cut taxes across the board
10 percent, Clinton wants to target tax cuts to middle-class
families facing education or child-care expenses, or supporting
elderly or disabled relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cutting has been a traditional Republican issue.
</P>
<P>
   The same poll showed that 56 percent said they trusted Clinton
more than Republicans on Social Security (with Republicans scoring
31 percent), 51 percent favored Clinton on tobacco policy
(Republicans 28 percent), and 59 percent favored Clinton on
education (Republicans 29 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Chances for accommodation between Clinton and Congress are
strengthened by the fact that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ind., are both
practical conservatives with little stomach for the stiff
ideological confrontations that marked the era of now-departed
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing this despite Clinton, not because of Clinton,''
said Stephen Wayne, a government professor at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approach to Congress _ particularly the House _ is
guided by contradictory impulses. On the one hand, he paused during
his State of the Union speech to shake Hastert's hand, a bipartisan
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, his rage over the House impeachment vote is
inspiring him to work hard to win a Democratic majority in the
House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legislative track record in 1998 was far from
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   According to Congressional Quarterly's annual study of voting
patterns, the administration prevailed in just 51 percent of the
154 House and Senate votes where the White House took a position.
</P>
<P>
   That compares unfavorably to other presidents in their sixth
year in office: Dwight Eisenhower (76 percent), Richard Nixon (59.6
percent in 1974, the year he resigned amid the Watergate scandal)
and Ronald Reagan (56.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lost the biggest vote of all in 1998, the Dec. 19 House
vote to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   One threat to a Clinton-Congress accommodation is the
conservatives' enduring dislike of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's conservative wing and its grass-roots supporters, a
source of much party activism and cash contributions, demanded
impeachment. Already suspecting their leaders of betrayal in their
budget dealings with the White House, Republican conservatives
almost certainly will view with suspicion any post-impeachment
accommodation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   These activists ``hate Clinton and they're the ones who have the
most to say in (Republican) primaries because they're the ones who
show up to vote,'' Edwards said. ``That explains why Republicans
persisted in impeachment, and that's not going to end'' now that
impeachment is over.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Edwards said, don't look to GOP conservatives to help
Clinton secure his legacy.

`BLAST FROM THE PAST': FAMILY LEAVES 1962 NUCLEAR SHELTER AND FINDS
FALLOUT FROM SOCIAL CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Blast From the Past'' tells the not automatically funny story
of a family so nuclear that it scurries into its fallout shelter in
1962 and spends 35 years underground. By the time the squeaky-clean
Webbers resurface, the sights of graffiti, barbed wire, urban
decay, a porn shop and a transvestite prostitute convince them
that, as the father puts it, ``society as we know it has totally
collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Webber shelter is a jaunty monument to kitsch,
and the Webbers themselves are an appealingly batty crew. Calvin
(Christopher Walken) is the film's funniest character, a
``borderline nutcase'' fond of Dr. Pepper served hot.
</P>
<P>
   He's the gung-ho mad scientist who has dreamed up a shelter
suitable for farming, shuffleboard and watching television as if
nothing had gone amiss above ground. (The Webbers have mistaken a
plane crash for a nuclear disaster.)
</P>
<P>
   This enables his wife, Helen (Sissy Spacek), to putter about a
kitchen full of turquoise appliances and hit the apparently endless
supply of cooking sherry, a once-sunny homemaker stuck underground.
</P>
<P>
   The Webbers have raised a strapping hunk named Adam, who has
retained his wide-eyed innocence while growing up to be Brendan
Fraser. ``I wish I could meet a girl,'' he sighs on his 35th
birthday, only to have his father wisecrack: ``One that doesn't
glow in the dark, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Hugh Wilson (``The First Wives Club'') and
written by Wilson and Bill Kelly, ``Blast From the Past''
inevitably gives Adam an Eve. Sent upstairs into the world on a
reconnaissance mission, he meets a hard-boiled, jaded babe played
by Alicia Silverstone, who introduces Adam to her gay friend Troy
(Dave Foley).
</P>
<P>
   Together, Eve and Troy teach Adam how to wear a black leather
blazer and, as they coach him, ``look unimpressed,'' which makes
for all the attitude that Adam needs. The film forgets its more
amusing underground subplot for a long stretch of time while Adam
and Eve get acquainted.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Silverstone, in Mary Pickford ringlets, often winces and
grimaces to express emotion, strengthening the impression that
tough-talking Eve is indeed a pain. Besides, although she is the
film's dewy-eyed creature, it's Fraser who once again plays the
ingenue.
</P>
<P>
   Here is yet another role (as in ``Encino Man'') that has him
emerging from oblivion into gee-whiz innocence, adored by a camera
that ogles his every move. It's a mode that certainly looks dopey
here compared to his first-rate performance in ``Gods and
Monsters,'' but his presence is enough to keep ``Blast From the
Past'' going.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser is even seen recruiting two beautiful women for a wild
jitterbug number meant to bring down the house, while Ms.
Silverstone's Eve pouts on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while this comedy strives for teen-age appeal above
ground, it's mostly the fallout shelter notion that makes for the
laughs, especially when the Webbers' mysterious arrival prompts an
amusingly burned-out neighbor (Joey Slotnick) to make them the
center of a religious cult hallowing Calvin's words (``Don't touch
my elevator!'').
</P>
<P>
   The production and costume designers from ``Boogie Nights''
guarantee much retro chic and visual wit to accompany the story's
wildest notions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blast From the Past'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It includes sexual references and profanity.

`MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE': SENDS NOTES TO SEA?; THIS MAN IS A CATCH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)

<P>
   Theresa Osborne (Robin Wright Penn) is one of those lonely,
beautiful, high-powered career women who, as movies of the late 90s
like to tell us, would secretly be happier digging clams with the
right wise, down-to-earth lonely guy.
</P>
<P>
   One misty morning on Cape Cod, she begins to get her wish.
Theresa is jogging on the beach when she finds that a soulful note
has washed ashore, carefully enclosed in a vessel of green glass.
The prose is waterlogged but the paper is not.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing his thoughts to a woman named Catherine, the sender
has declared: ``You came into my dream last night with that smile
that always held me like a lover, rocked me like a child.''
Fascinated, Theresa takes the missive back to her office in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   An ``Allies Invade France'' headline framed on a wall indicates
that she works for a news organization, but all anybody at this
would-be Chicago Tribune office ever talks about is romance. ``So
honest!'' somebody sighs, when the note is read aloud.
</P>
<P>
   All Theresa has to do is trace the typewriter, analyze the cork
and study Atlantic currents to discover that the message has come
from the Outer Banks of North Carolina and was written by a
sailboat builder named Garret Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Garret is played by Kevin Costner, who should avoid all future
roles that call for overalls and goggles and who this time crosses
the line from teasingly laconic to stodgy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man talks about as much as a fish,'' Garret's scene-stealing
father (Paul Newman) says about his son, and it's true. Costner's
Garret seems as likely to have written ``Bleak House'' as the
achingly sensitive notes he sent out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Message in a Bottle,'' a prettily torpid film with the warm
glow of a hazelnut coffee commercial, is adapted from Nicholas
Sparks' best seller. It's a novel that not even the most devoted
bookworm is likely to hunt down after seeing the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Directed at a lulling pace by Luis Mandoki, written with
colorless predictability by Gerald DiPego (``You know, on the boat
today ... I had a good time, too'') and adroitly beautified by
Caleb Deschanel (the cinematography even incorporates a rainbow),
it makes for a trancelike experience that is broken occasionally
when somebody on the screen speaks.
</P>
<P>
   The best film version of such a story remains ``The Horse
Whisperer,'' in which both two- and four-legged characters had more
complexity than anyone does here.
</P>
<P>
   While it would be insulting _ to women _ to think of ``Message
in a Bottle'' as a women's picture, it's not one liable to lure
anyone else. For one thing, men aren't known to seek out love
stories in which cuddling is the preferred form of sex.
</P>
<P>
   But when Theresa ventures to North Carolina to meet Garret, she
finds a lovelorn guy who misses his late wife (to whom the notes
were addressed) so badly that he still keeps her paints, brushes,
dried flowers and canvas shoes as part of his casually masculine
home decor.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Garret can cook a romantic dinner for two, sail by
moonlight and merrily engage in a barefoot mini-marshmallow fight
(the first scene of its kind, to my knowledge) on the beach. Garret
is so frankly calculated to please female viewers that he even
plays with a toy at the dinner table the first time he meets
Theresa's son.
</P>
<P>
   What happens, by the numbers, is that Theresa enjoys an idyllic
first visit to North Carolina, having packed a sizable, becomingly
simple wardrobe even though she wasn't planning on a long stay. And
Theresa puts a twinkle into the eye of Garret's sardonic father,
although Newman makes it utterly clear that he had one in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Then, having sailed and cuddled, Theresa and Garret part.
Theresa returns to Chicago changed forever, and languishes there
until Garret decides to visit her. When Costner lumbers bashfully
into the Tribune office, the screenplay calls for one of Theresa's
friends to pass her a note reading, ``What a babe.''
</P>
<P>
   But the message in a bottle, unbeknownst to Garret, is now in
Theresa's night table drawer. And when it finally comes to light _
well, let's just say that the film does have its few moments of
conflict, and that they are duly accompanied by pouring rain.
</P>
<P>
   The rest should not be described here, except to say that a
climactic sailing sequence may bring on wistful memories of
``Waterworld.'' That, at least, had elements of the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Though Costner's Garret is seemingly the film's main attraction,
it is Ms. Penn who gracefully carries most scenes and remains a
pleasure to watch despite the stalled story line. Strong and
appealing, she makes Theresa enough of a vibrant, spirited heroine
to dispel thoughts that this is actually the tale of a depressive
and a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Coltrane and Illeana Douglas, like Newman, give the film
a shot of subsidiary verve as Theresa's office friends, though Ms.
Douglas' role is the most threadbare in the movie. Wearing jeweled
insects and flowers in her hair is the only personality trait that
the film allows her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Message in a Bottle'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It includes mild profanity, cuddling in bed and one wan
sex scene made even less passionate by a soundtrack ballad.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A pillar of Rushmore Academy on the extracurricular front _
chess, astronomy, debating, bee-keeping, fencing, double-team dodge
ball and drama being a few of the activities he heads with
mercurial aplomb _ 15-year-old Max Fischer (Schwartzman) is cutting
corners in his classes, all of which he is flunking.
</P>
<P>
   Elevate those grades, he is told, or adios. ``Couldn't we just
let me float by?'' Max asks.
</P>
<P>
   Max is at Rushmore solely for the entrepreneurial charge he gets
from running everything on campus. Those inclinations amuse and
attract an eccentric local steel baron named Blume (Murray), who is
Rushmore's primary benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   A dispirited figure, the middle-aged Blume has an undefined
longing to try things differently, which, despite the age
difference, makes him a natural soul mate for the unorthodox Max.
</P>
<P>
   Soon they both fall in love with Miss Cross (Ms. Williams), a
first-grade teacher, and become rivals as if they were
contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   After one of his schemes finally gets him tossed out of
Rushmore, Max sets up shop at Grover Cleveland High School. But
life doesn't come together for anybody until a spectacular
production of Max's explosive (literally) new play, set on a
Vietnam battlefield. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Max gets slugged a couple of times, not undeservedly,
and there is some other generally inconsequential pushing and
shoving. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX No sex is depicted, but there is frequent and frank mention
of various sex acts. &QL;

   PROFANITY Strong and fairly frequent. &QL;

<P>
   PG-13 86 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Laney Boggs (Ms. Cook, a star of ``Dawson's Creek'') is the kind
of teen-ager who wakes up her little brother in the morning by
reminding him that in Mexico children his age have already been up
for three hours sewing clothes for corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Laney, in short, is a bit on the intense side. In art class, her
work, which is innovative and striking, runs toward subjects like
rioting in Mogadishu. ``Darkness rocks,'' she tells someone.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an attitude calculated to charm her classmates, two of
whom suggest that she commit suicide. That in turn has made an
angry recluse of Laney, who usually skulks off after school to
paint for hours in her basement refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly for someone who thinks so little of herself,
her appearance follows suit: mousey and concealed behind huge
horn-rimmed glasses and nondescript garments. This makes her
perfect material for a bet between Zack, the class Adonis (Prinze),
and a sneering friend of his named Dean (Walker).
</P>
<P>
   Zack, it seems, has lost his girlfriend, Taylor, the lascivious,
self-adoring class bombshell (Ms. O'Keefe), to an MTV idol
(Lillard) she met on vacation in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   To regain face, he accepts a challenge to take a seemingly
unattractive girl of Dean's designation and turn her into the prom
queen.
</P>
<P>
   And so the movies mount yet another Pygmalion project. Zack
approaches Laney at the fast-food restaurant where she works and
asks her out. ``Stalking is illegal in all 50 states,'' she tells
him. Later they develop a mutual attraction, but true togetherness,
if indeed that is to be attained, remains several misunderstandings
away. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX As is increasingly the case with films about teen-agers,
there is more sex than perhaps parents expect. The ardent Taylor
goes to bed with her new boyfriend, though he seems less than
interested. There are also frequent sexual references. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Not much but full strength. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-9 The answer is no for the very young. Older children in
this bracket are probably also on the young side. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12 Parents should decide, but there's nothing too
damaging. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP The film is obviously a natural for teen-agers. &QL;

`NOVEMBER 1916': A GRAND LITERARY EDIFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be said, in an effort to put matters into
perspective, that the Soviet dictator Leonid Brezhnev would one day
be dimly remembered as a Russian politician during the era of
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. In fact, matters turned out to be more
complicated. Brezhnev is a bad memory, but Solzhenitsyn, the great
dissenting author of ``Cancer Ward'' and ``The Gulag Archipelago,''
whom Brezhnev pushed into an exile that lasted 20 years, is hardly
a universally celebrated figure either.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Solzhenitsyn has outlived the centrality he had when
moral criticism was an act of enormous courage, and he has not
helped his cause by his recourse to dyspeptic commentaries on the
inadequacy of secular, liberal culture.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the publication of ``November 1916,'' the second
volume of Solzhenitsyn's three-book cycle, ``The Red Wheel,'' could
help rehabilitate a tarnished hero. ``November 1916,'' which
follows the publication of ``August 1914,'' the first in the ``Red
Wheel'' series, by almost a decade, is an impressive
accomplishment, and H.T. Willets has ably translated it from the
Russian. True, it has a fusty quality about it, its specific
ingredients more or less what one familiar with the sprawling
historical genre would expect. Certainly it is overlong and
contains too much talk and not enough action. Moreover, as in
``August 1914,'' Solzhenitsyn intersperses his story with long,
dense historical explanations that not only require a good deal of
specialized knowledge to assimilate but also slow the novel's
dramatic momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The Solzhenitsyn of ``November 1916'' is a long way from the
cranky, semi-mystical ideologue that he has sometimes seemed to be.
The work is an enormous literary palace teeming with life and
intellectual passion, a grand edifice of history and character in
the Tolstoy tradition. Indeed, ``November 1916'' is not ``War and
Peace,'' but some of the same adjectives could be used to describe
both books: ambitious, panoramic yet intimate, prodigiously
researched, invested with a strong sense of verisimilitude. One
senses that for the many dozens of characters who appear in
Solzhenitsyn's 1,014 pages, November 1916 must actually have been
something like the way it is described in this all-embracing book.
</P>
<P>
   A kind of political fable frames Solzhenitsyn's broad-shouldered
tale. The central action reveals the inability of a self-absorbed,
wishful liberalism to respond effectively to the condition of a
country being bled white by war and facing the dread menace of a
revolution that will utterly destroy the old order.
</P>
<P>
   ``November 1916'' in this sense depicts two opposing points of
view, two modes of action. On the one side are various members of
the Russian elite: academics, doctors, forward-looking officers in
the Czar's army. This portion of Russian society strives to find
some formula by which the corrupt and incompetent ancien regime
(incarnated by the meddlesome czarina and her mystical spiritual
guide, Rasputin) can be overthrown even as the elite remains in
power. On the other is Lenin, shown living in exile in Zurich,
Switzerland, waiting for his chance and using his implacable and
trenchant logic to foment the civil war that will eradicate the old
order and give him vastly greater power than the czar ever dreamed
of.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Probably the most important of Solzhenitsyn's many characters is
Georgi Vorotyntsev, an army colonel who has spent the war at the
front and has come to believe that Russia will destroy itself if
the war continues. Vorotyntsev goes to St. Petersburg to meet with
Aleksandr Guchkov, a leading military officer (and historical
figure) who, in Solzhenitsyn's account, tried to drum up support
among the senior generals for a coup d'etat.

   Vorotyntsev has long conversations with the Kadets, Russia's
liberal reformers, and eventually with other military leaders,
including Gruchkov, but he finds nobody who shares his view that
the only salvation for Russia is to get out of the war. Many
opinions are eloquently expressed as Vorotyntsev makes his rounds,
but most eloquent of all is his own description of the slaughter
taking place at the front, a slaughter that goes on while Kadets
and senior generals alike speak to each other in nonexperiential
generalities.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Vorotyntsev's soldier's-eye view of the war is stunning
in its concreteness, an impressive piece of historical
reconstruction. We, the readers, moreover, believe him and his dire
predictions for the future of Russia because Solzhenitsyn has
already taken us to the front in his opening chapters. We have seen
for ourselves, as it were, how a routinized absurdity and the
superiority of the German enemy have made the legendary courage of
the Russian soldier almost obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose task is it to prevent the conflagration from engulfing
Russia?'' Vorotyntsev at one point asks Gruchkov and another
officer. ``Who has to be on the alert, to forestall the elemental
forces, who if not ourselves, the leaders of Russian society, the
strong and active? It is our duty. And it is also in our interest
politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Vorotyntsev's conservative clarity is matched
only by the revolutionary clarity of Lenin, whose genius was to
perceive what the liberal intelligentsia did not: that the way to
topple the old order was to push workers and soldiers into
rebellion, not to fight the war more effectively but to stop
fighting the war altogether. ``What the proletariat needs is civil
war,'' Lenin tells his followers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in contrast with Solzhenitsyn's characters, we know
what happened a year later, when Lenin did come to power, and in
the decades after that. And our knowledge lends Solzhenitsyn's
story a piquancy that can only come from watching people marching
toward a tragedy that they could avoid if only they knew what we
know. One of the most powerful of Solzhenitsyn's chapters concerns
an underground Bolshevik operative in St. Petersburg named
Aleksandr Shlyapnikov, whom we see striving to foment a general
strike among munitions workers. We know from the glossary of
historical figures at the end of the book that Shlyapnikov was a
close collaborator with Lenin but that he was expelled from the
Central Committee in 1922 and eventually died in Stalin's purges.
</P>
<P>
   Shlyapnikov's eventual fate underscores the extent of the
political calamity that Russia was careering toward in November
1916, when concerted wise action by the Russian liberal elite might
still have changed the course of history. Solzhenitsyn in this
sense has drawn a realistic, deep and expansive portrait of
intelligent and even courageous individuals caught in the web of a
tragic history.
</P>
<P>
   ``November 1916'' is a fable centering on human intractability
that promises to stand the test of time.

   NEW YORK _ New York has never been a one-neighborhood art town.
And in the late 1990s, with the contemporary market feeling stable
again, if not exactly bullish, the territory is dividing up in
interesting ways.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea probably still qualifies as a boomtown. But its real
estate prices are now stratospheric and the new new frontier may
lie in the hardscrabble studios and galleries of Brooklyn and
Queens, a likelihood underscored by the recently forged alliance
between P.S. 1 in Long Island City and the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Uptown, anchored by 57th Street, has been holding steady, with
few notable comings or goings, although there is some fresh and
intriguing activity farther north in both Harlem and East Harlem.
And then there's SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years the enclave bounded roughly by Houston
and Canal streets and by Sullivan Street and Broadway has been an
international clearinghouse for important trends and ideas as well
as a commercial hub, though its pivotal status has changed.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons. The influx of shops and restaurants
resulted in soaring rents and crowded streets. It also meant a
decline in cachet. The mainstream art world of the late 1990s has
made much of the alliance between art and popular culture,
particularly fashion. But when declasse boites and boutiques with
the wrong kind of labels moved in next door, galleries couldn't get
away fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Now the streets on a Saturday are thick with shoppers, and the
windows of vacated galleries are full of clothes and pricey
knickknacks. But the notion that SoHo has become an art-world ghost
town is mistaken; obituaries are not in order yet.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 galleries are still in place. Some are lightweights;
others, like Pace and Gagosian, solid blue chip. Still others, like
Deitch Projects, Feature and American Fine Art, are among the most
consistently innovative in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, the area is home to the bulk of Manhattan's
alternative spaces, including the Drawing Center, Artists Space,
Printed Matter, the Alternative Museum, Exit Art/The First World
and the Puffin Room, as well as Art in General and Apex Art just to
the south, and the American Indian Community House north of
Houston. Chelsea may have Dia, but SoHo does too, at least in the
form of two venerable, separate installations by Walter De Maria,
``Broken Kilometer'' (1979) and ``New York Earth Room'' (1980).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, two of the city's vital museums are SoHo fixtures: the
New Museum of Contemporary Art (with a David Wojnarowicz
retrospective now on view) and the Museum for African Art, which
sit almost side by side on Broadway. The Guggenheim SoHo is also
there, sort of. Its galleries are closed for renovation and will
reportedly reopen in reduced form later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   In short, even a downsized SoHo remains dynamic. And with time
and a few more departures and arrivals, it might even assume
something like the fringe character it started with three decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Museum for African Art
</P>
<P>
   The Museum for African Art would certainly be a jewel in the
crown of any neighborhood. Blessed with handsome galleries designed
by Maya Lin, its landmark series of thematic exhibitions have made
history by shattering the old trophy-show model for exhibiting
non-Western art.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the museum's energies noticeably cooled and a
sense of drift set in, evident in, among other ways, an
over-reliance on visiting collection shows. (One is, in fact, on
view now.) But a new administration is in place, some lively
projects are on the books, and the current exhibition, ``A Sense of
Wonder: African Art From the Faletti Family Collection,'' is
ravishing.
</P>
<P>
   The focus is on Yoruba art of Nigeria, an endlessly rich
tradition sampled here in sculptures ranging from 19th-century
ivory staffs to the carved figure of a Roman Catholic nun dating
from the late 1950s, attributed to the artist Otooro. From other
sources come a serene Dan mask; a nature spirit, as tall and thin
as a sapling, made by the Western or Central Ijo people, and a
thrilling gathering of Ethiopian material, including processional
crosses and painted altarpieces.
</P>
<P>
   The show has an excellent catalog by Mary Nooter Roberts and
Allen F. Roberts, who are imaginative thinkers and scholars. Also
there, in the museum's downstairs galleries, is ``Landscapes of the
Soul: Women of the African Diaspora, Photographs by Chester Higgins
Jr.'' Higgins is a photographer for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Kelly Gallery
</P>
<P>
   Two photography shows in galleries also have museum-scale
ambitions, though of different kinds. One, ``James Casebere:
Self-Constructed Realities: 1975-1990'' at Sean Kelly Gallery, is a
substantial mini-retrospective of work by an influential
contemporary innovator in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Casebere works in a special subdivision of setup photography,
shooting table-top models he fashions from paper, Styrofoam and
other materials. The earliest pictures here, from 1975 when he was
22, are of domestic interiors: a kitchen with a giant fork stuck
through the refrigerator, a tiny electric fan sitting next to a
giant socket, a bedroom with furniture tossed about. Next come
nocturnal scenes of Wild West camps, Gothic houses and a
Hopperesque store window. A 1990 image of a long white factory wall
anticipates the artist's more recent series of chapel-like prisons
cells.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Casebere combined Constructivist purity and
Surrealist dissonance. The results recall theater sets (the stage
designs of Gordon Craig come to mind), but also childhood fantasy
worlds built from blocks, where existential unease is soothed and
controlled through miniaturization. Casebere has referred to the
philosopher Michel Foucault in connection with his prison pictures,
but Gaston Bachelard's ``Poetics of Space'' is apt reading for this
fine show, which would do any museum proud.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Thread Waxing Space and Holly Solomon
</P>
<P>
   A museum does lie behind Barbara Pollack's ``Family of Men'' at
Thread Waxing Space. The show replicates in careful detail the
installation of ``The Family of Man'' exhibition at the Museum of
Modern Art in 1955. But in place of the photographs chosen by
Edward Steichen to present a universalized essay on the human
condition, Ms. Pollack hangs blown-up snapshots of her husband and
son.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is versatile, and she does a nice job with it. Here
the family album, recording the humdrum pleasures and irritations
of daily life, is raised to monumental scale, while the unrealistic
ideals of domestic heroism that Ms. Pollack grew up with are
brought down to size.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is filtered through a technique Ms. Pollack has
developed that involves shaking and waving a hand-held Polaroid to
produce blurry, half-abstract images. This style is effective in
giving the installation visual cohesion and a certain grandeur.
When applied to Ms. Pollack's individual portraits, like those at
Holly Solomon, it feels less purposeful, though the illusion of
bloodied flesh it produces is not without its allure.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of flesh, while at Thread Waxing Space, don't overlook
the exhibition devoted to the Boston-based performer and filmmaker
Luther Price, known for his hand-edited Super 8 films. One film,
``Sodom,'' created from recycled porn clips found in a Dumpster,
rates high in certain underground film circles, where Price's name
is mentioned with those of Kenneth Anger and Jean Genet.
</P>
<P>
   Thread Waxing Space will screen several of his films on the
evenings of Feb. 26-28, and the Museum of Modern Art will show
three on Feb. 25. But one can get at least a clue to their content
in film stills and tapes in the gallery show, ``Luther Price:
Imitation of Life,'' which mixes images of hard-core sex, open
wounds, spring flowers and a concert performance by the Carpenters.
In the annals of outrageousness, Price could be major.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan/Eckman
</P>
<P>
   The Surrealist Hans Bellmer (1902-75) has long been a stellar
presence in the rarefied pantheon of outrageousness, and a
gathering of his drawings at Nolan-Eckman is one of the high points
of a SoHo Gallery tour. Bellmer is best known for his photographs
of trussed dolls and dismembered mannequins, and the aura of
debased sexuality they radiate suffuses these drawings, which date
from the 1930s to the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Executed in hair-fine lines of graphite or ink, colored with
pastels whisked and smudged on like makeup, they are astonishing
creations. In them the human body is rendered as a kind of
palpitating erotic ornament: a fantasia of gears and bolts in one
case, pleats and folds in another, tangles of hatchwork in a third,
all accented with the occasional ribbon or breast or protruding,
high-heeled foot. Virtuosic isn't the word for this art: it has a
breathless, loony, entranced sexual finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Gagosian and Lehmann Maupin
</P>
<P>
   David Salle is one of several contemporary artists who have
gained mileage from using sex in their work, and he is now
represented by two shows of new paintings in SoHo. Salle's big,
controversial success in the 1980s was followed by a slump from
which he has started to bounce back, though how far he has bounced
is the question.
</P>
<P>
   His signature style is still in place: forthright brushwork, a
multi-panel format and a narrow vocabulary of pictorial ingredients
from which the soft-core erotic figures of women in his earlier
work are now conspicuously absent.
</P>
<P>
   `` Lucky'' at Gagosian Gallery, which has by far the stronger of
the two shows, is characteristic of the new series. It consists of
a horizontal top panel depicting busts of angels amid a shower of
Robert Rymanish white strokes, a vertical panel with a still life
of dead fish on a plate, and a third panel in which a spectral
guitar and a raindrop-filled orange star seem to float over a
bleached-out image of a modernist living room.
</P>
<P>
   What it all means is hard to say, but reading anything concrete
into Salle's work is probably an uphill endeavor. One of the most
attractive things about his art is that it projects the distinct
impression of being about ideas without offering a ready proof that
any ideas are actually there.
</P>
<P>
   At present he looks to be still on the comeback trail, and if he
stays there, that's all right. Some of the paintings, with their
pleasureless surfaces and maladroit, rush-job look, aren't good;
but others really broadcast something, a star-power spark of
self-assurance and a chill, romantic mystery. In any art form,
unevenness of performance can generate its own kind of energy.
Whole careers are built on it. Salle's may prove to be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Feature
</P>
<P>
   At Feature, Sam Gordon, 26, has come through with one of the
best painting shows of the season. The pieces, with a single
exception, are small and intensively worked. Surfaces have been
painted and scraped (some have the crackled look of parchment),
drawn on with pencil or ballpoint pen, and layered with collage.
</P>
<P>
   Each one is packed with contradictory activity. Geometric forms
are rendered in illustrational 3-D; cursive patterns are painted in
flat goldlike manuscript illuminations. Diagrammatic shapes suggest
occult symbols (stars, labyrinths, tantric emblems) or banners (a
Confederate flag in one case). A flaming fist may derive from a
tattoo design or a decal; a comic book-style road zigzagging into
the distance mixes with the tracery of peacock feathers, chain-link
rings and a passage of glowing, rainbow-hued color.
</P>
<P>
   The results suggest a species of hermetically coded folk art but
have a physical airiness and an urbane breadth of reference. Best
of all, they don't seem to be attached to any particular ``now.''
The psychedelic '60s are here as much as the '90s. The largest
piece in the show leaves something of a question mark about where
Gordon will go with scale. Whatever he does, he's on an independent
track, and one looks forward to watching where it will take him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Exit Art/The First World
</P>
<P>
   Independence is the defining institutional impulse of
alternative spaces. And those in SoHo have steadfastly honed to the
ideal. Some, like the Drawing Center and Apex Gallery, are between
shows at this writing. Artists Space has lined its walls with the
unbound pages of a soon-to-be-published history of its 25 years,
though the display is up only through Saturday. But at Exit Art an
ambitious, somewhat chaotic exhibition titled ``Paradise 8'' is
halfway through its run.
</P>
<P>
   For the occasion, the gallery invited eight New York-based
curators to cook up separate themes, select the artists, and
install the results together. Some of the mini-shows, like those
organized by Pip Day, Ingrid Schaffner and Henry Urbach, are
self-contained. Others meander through Exit Art's capacious space.
To keep the enterprise open-ended, the show is slated for periodic
reconfiguration and a second opening on March 3.
</P>
<P>
   What's on view is worth a visit, partly to see different
curatorial ideas in action but mostly for the art itself. Martha
Wilson and Dominique Nahas kept their lists short, but each has
chosen an artist _ Alice Wu (selected by Ms. Wilson) and Emily
Ripley (by Nahas) _ doing inventive things with fabric and fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Schachter integrates his many selections into Exit Art's
cafe. Dan Asher has provided ``Prozac'' table umbrellas, Brendan
Kass the prettiest hamburger painting imaginable, and the
artist-to-watch Lawrence Seward a scary doughnut sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Sirmans and Odili Donald Odita were especially generous
with their invitations and provide some top-notch entrants. Sirmans
selected Dario Robleto, Edgar Arceneaux and Laylah Ali, while Odita
tapped established figures like Dan Devine (whose inside-out car is
an exhibition high point) and others still underknown in New York,
like the California artist Rolo Castillo, represented by plastic
purses with silk-screen religious pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Printed Matter
</P>
<P>
   Printed Matter, long one of the city's prime outlets for
artists' books, has an engaging archival survey titled ``Bay Area
Dada: Before Punk and Zines.'' Organized by John Held Jr., it
examines the post-hippie, pre-punk art that flourished in San
Francisco from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its leaders, like Bill Gaglione and Tim Mancusi, were
East Coast migrants. Others like Irene Dogmatic, Polly Ester
Nation, Anna Banana and Buster Cleveland were from the West Coast.
The group esthetic was heavy into black humor, evident in
publications like Flush Art, The New York Weekly Breeder, Nitrous
Oxide and the sendup of Life Magazine titled Vile.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the artists had ties to Fluxus and to the artist Ray
Johnson. The show includes a tribute to Johnson, supplementing his
current Whitney Museum retrospective, and from it one gets a keen
sense of what his lifelong dedication to ephemerality, cultural
community, verbal overload and serious whimsy was all about.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Harvey Gallery
</P>
<P>
   For an even closer encounter with Fluxus, one can do no better
than to drop by the Emily Harvey Gallery, which is itself a bit of
SoHo history. Signal events associated with the movement took place
in this space (including George Maciunas' cross-dressed 1978
wedding). And Ms. Harvey has devoted herself for the last 18 years
to showing art by Fluxus members.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Geoffrey Hendricks, has a solo show on view, his
first in New York in two decades. The work is sweet, romantic, a
little oddball, with sculptures fashioned from nautical instruments
and tools, and views of the night sky painted on slate roof tiles
from the artist's Nova Scotia farm. There's a Ray Johnson tribute
here, too: a small boulder, hauled from under the Sag Harbor Bridge
near where Johnson died, and inscribed ``Nothing,'' the word
Johnson often applied to his own art.
</P>
<P>
   Art in General
</P>
<P>
   Back to alternative spaces, Art in General, just south of SoHo,
offers ``Spaceship Earth,'' a group show organized by Mary Ellen
Carroll, Allen Frame and Omar Lopez-Chahoud. The theme, something
to do with Buckminster Fuller and the future, is vague, but the
artists are strong. Robert Blanchon, Fatimah Tuggar, Francis
Magnotta, Kristin Lucas, Cara Perlman and Alan Wiener all make an
impression. Wiener also has a fine solo show of his abstract
plaster sculptures at Feature.
</P>
<P>
   The Puffin Room and Tricia Collins Contemporary Art
</P>
<P>
   At the Puffin Room, one of SoHo's newer nonprofits, a group show
titled ``Straight No Chaser,'' organized by Christine
Louisy-Daniel, celebrates Black History Month. The work is up and
down, but a life-size plaster figure of Marcus Garvey by Gabriel
Koren, Amir Bey's copper-and-nail reliefs, Lisa Collado's collage
of stamps and photographs, and Sol Sax's altarlike installations
stand out.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of the occasion, Tricia Collins has paired Walker
Evans' 1936 photographs of black churches with James Perry Walker's
pictures of Southern churchgoers taken in the 1970s and '80s, a
poignant combination.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward Gallery
</P>
<P>
   Among other shows with a historic bent is a roundup of prints
from the 1970s and '80s by Robert Indiana at Woodward. Indiana has
always resisted easy slotting, and partly for that reason has
fallen out of sight. But he's a true original, a very ``American''
artist of a kind that seems barely to exist anymore, and these
prints, with their charged colors and sonorous and aggressive
texts, indicate that he is due for reappraisal.
</P>
<P>
   Bose Pacia Modern
</P>
<P>
   At Bose Pacia, a compact gallery specializing in modern Indian
art, an exhibition titled ``The Early Masters: Rare Paintings of
the Bengal Renaissance'' encapsulates, with slight but exquisite
works, a key moment in India's early-20th century art. In the
1930s, Abanindranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose and Jamini Roy, among
others, tried to create a painting free from colonial British
styles. Their efforts are best exemplified in Roy's adaptations of
folk themes, but paradoxically the most lively work in the show is
by the poet Rabindranath Tagore, who had no nationalist agenda and
moved from botanical still lifes to geometric abstraction with
uninhibited zest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Basilico Fine Arts
</P>
<P>
   Natural history is the subject of one of Tony Matelli's
ultra-realistic sculptures at Basilico, which shows two
test-version homo sapiens trying to return to a less stressful
evolutionary past: one retrofits the other with a fake tail. And a
second work, a four-foot-high figure of woman-as-sex-object, is
equally antediluvian, at least in sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the key to all this lies in the show's invitation card,
which includes one of Gustave Courbet's early self-portraits as a
crusading Enemy of the Bourgeoisie. Matelli seems to be assuming,
at least partly tongue in cheek, a similar role. He's obviously
trying to push some buttons, but politically incorrect images are
all the rage just now, and nothing causes all that much fuss.
Still, his intentions are dubious in an interesting way, and for
sheer freakishness (he did vomiting Boy Scouts last time around),
he's still a step or so ahead of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Kaplan and Anton Kern Gallery
</P>
<P>
   Women get a say of their own elsewhere. Solo shows of
photography by Beverly Semmes at Susan Inglett, and by Laura London
at Caren Golden Fine Art, as well as a collaboration between Rita
Ackerman and the Argentine-born artist Ana Axpe at the Swiss
Institute, offer nuanced approaches to the subject of female
self-regard.
</P>
<P>
   And the women in ``Oldnewtown,'' a multinational group show
organized by the artist Liam Gillick at Casey Kaplan, weigh in with
some of the best entries, including Kai Althoff's accordionlike
painting, a stitched fabric mushroom by Cosima von Bonin, and, in
what Gillick has dubbed the ``art corner'' of the show, paintings
by Pae White and Christina Mackie, the latter's consisting of a box
of watercolors open on a piece of cut canvas on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The boys are all right, too. Simon Periton's wickedly pretty
paper cutouts are a treat, as are Keith Farquhar's high-gloss
drawing with Magic Marker and refrigerator magnets, Andreas
Schulze's paintings of black-eyed peas and an episodic Lothar
Hempel installation that suggests it might be fun to see more of
what he's up to.
</P>
<P>
   All these artists are young, and the Kaplan Gallery, with its
smart, offbeat, always unprogrammatic exhibition schedule, is
relatively new (it opened in 1995). The same can be said of Anton
Kern Gallery, which has been in town for just over two years.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan recently confirmed his intention to remain in SoHo. And
Kern, who is the son of the German artist Georg Baselitz, has
committed himself to the neighborhood in a major way. When another
gallery in his building, Wooster Garden, left for Chelsea (where it
will reopen as Brent Sikkema), Kern took over the space and knocked
down a wall to double his area. That's a vote of confidence of a
kind SoHo needs these days, and for the moment a critical mass of
art world institutions, public and private, veterans and newcomers,
are still willing to provide it.
</P>

HOME VIDEO: DESPITE SNEERS, DIVX FORMAT IS GAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For sheer lack of good wishes at the start of a venture, it
would be hard to top the debut of Divx, an alternative form of DVD
that many in the video industry have done nothing but lambaste
since the concept was announced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, as if to tweak its tormentors, Divx (pronounced
DIH-vix) has shown surprising early strength. Of about 1 million
DVD players sold, approximately 100,000 are Divx machines, a large
number, especially given the fact that most Divx players are sold
only at roughly 585 outlets of Circuit City, the chain that
principally supports Divx.
</P>
<P>
   The basic objection to Divx is that it confuses consumers at a
time when they are showing signs of taking to DVD in large numbers.
Divx is different from regular, or ``open,'' DVD. Because Divx
disks contain an extra level of copy protection, they require a
different kind of player.
</P>
<P>
   Regular DVD machines cannot play Divx disks, but Divx machines
can play regular DVD disks, which is an advantage. But Divx also
requires a rather complicated and, in the view of many potential
DVD buyers, intrusive rigamarole to play the disks.
</P>
<P>
   All videos, of course, are either rented or bought. Regular DVDs
can be rented, but with prices in the $15 to $20 range and a
variety of extra features on most disks, they are primarily meant
to be bought.
</P>
<P>
   Built on the assumption that people don't want to buy most
movies, Divx is a rental medium. At the outset of the transaction,
however, one ``buys'' the disk for $4.49, in effect renting it to
play any number of times within 48 hours. After that, the disk
deactivates, so to speak, and can be thrown away, thereby avoiding
a return trip to the video store. An additional $3.25 buys two more
days of play and $15 to $20 buys the disk outright.
</P>
<P>
   There are no extra features on a Divx disk. ``At $4.49, you
can't have too many bells and whistles,'' said Josh Dare, a Divx
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Divx records transactions via a telephone line attached to the
player and bills viewers by credit card for extended use. ``Some
people say Divx isn't for them because of the phone line or the
sense of Big Brother,'' Dare said. In principal, though, the
privacy issue is no different with cable or satellite pay-per-view
systems.
</P>
<P>
   To play Divx disks, the machine has to be registered and
connected to a central computer that monitors transactions. So far,
though, many buyers are delaying the registration. That indicates
they might be using the players to play only regular DVD disks. But
Dare said that most buyers eventually register and that they are
stocking up with Divx disks. ``So they aren't buying $4.49
coasters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One vital requirement for any kind of DVD is that movies appear
at the same time they do on videotape, which so far hasn't always
been the case. As a rental medium, Divx may have an advantage with
a few big films that are priced for rental on videocassette.
</P>
<P>
   One recent example is ``There's Something About Mary,'' which
Fox released last week as a rental title with a retail price of
$109. The film was also issued on a Divx disk, but it won't be on
regular DVD for months until Fox drops the VHS price.

   NEW VIDEO RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   ``The Governess''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1840s a gentleman scientist named Charles Cavendish (Tom
Wilkinson) and his daughter's governess, Rosina da Silva (Minnie
Driver), freeze their passionate affair in ``salt fixed''
photographs. But around them all is change. From an affluent family
of Sephardic Jews who lost their money after her father was
murdered, the strong-willed Rosina disguises her roots to better
get along in virulently anti-Semitic times. A puritanical Scot,
Charles strives to deny his passion, pointing up the painful
differences between their two traditions in a film that itself,
Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, ``leaves a lasting
after-image.''
</P>
<P>
   1998. Columbia Tri-Star. $99.36. 114 minutes. Closed captioned.
Release date: Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practical Magic''
</P>
<P>
   Witchery goes super-cute with Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman
in the roles of Sally and Gillian Owens, two broomstick-straddling
sisters who sparkle with a toss of their glossy manes even when the
sorcerygets rough. Thanks to an old curse, men have a way of dying
after getting involved with Owens women. Sally settles down with a
nice guy, only to have him hit by a truck. Gillian, the high
stepper of the pair, dispatches a bad apple of a boyfriend (Goran
Visnjic), who rises from the hole they dig for him in the back yard
of their absolutely knockout Victorian homestead. But even the
black arts are chic in a bubble-brained movie that is ``nothing but
a guilty pleasure''(Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Warner. $107.37. 105 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.
Release date: Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snake Eyes''
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane named Jezebel is bearing down on an Atlantic City
hotel and casino called the Millennium. The title fight is on,
though, pumping streams of adrenaline through Rick Santoro (Nicolas
Cage), the building's maniacally active security chief. Trotting
around the arena glad-handing one and all, fielding cell phone
calls from his wife and his girlfriend, Rick is so wired he hardly
notices when the secretary of defense is assassinated right in
front of him. After diving into conspiracy, Brian De Palma's film
slows considerably to allow Rick to develop some character, but it
just ``gets sillier and more exaggerated in the self-parodying ways
De Palma's movies often do'' (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1998. Paramount. $104.16. 99 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
Release date: Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooting Fish''
</P>
<P>
   Major plot turns are dispensed with in 10 or 15 seconds of
babble in Stefan Schwartz's frantic film about two supposedly
lovable con men (Dan Futterman and Stuart Townsend) and their Girl
Friday (Kate Beckinsale). Their particular scam involves a
voice-recognition computer, which they sell but don't come across
with. One of the fellows is smugly rakish and glib, the other
fumbling and heartfelt. ``What does it all ad up to? Not much''
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Fox. $100.96. 109 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release at one time, appeared on television or been on
videocassette in earlier editions.
</P>
<P>
   `ANNA' _ Every year for 13 years, starting in 1980, Russian
filmmaker Nikita Mikhalkov (``Burnt by the Sun'') sat down with his
daughter Anna, who was 6 when the project began, and asked her the
same five questions: What do you love the most? What do you hate
the most? What scares you the most? What do you want more than
anything? What do you expect from life?
</P>
<P>
   He then interwove her annual responses with clips from
propagandistic newsreels and his own fictional films (most notably
``Oblomov,'' about a feckless 19th-century Russian nobleman, a
perpetual daydreamer who came to symbolize the inertia of the
late-czarist empire) into a documentary that seeks to parallel the
girl's growth with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 1996. New
Yorker. $89.95. 99 minutes. Russian with English subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   `POINT OF ORDER' _ In 1964, Emile de Antonio, then an artist's
agent, and Dan Talbot, the owner of the New Yorker Theater, made a
documentary drawn from 188 hours of television coverage of the 1954
Army-McCarthy hearings. Both sides get in plenty of licks, with the
senator orchestrating an early media circus, the Army charging Sen.
Joseph McCarthy's aide Roy Cohn with angling for special favors for
his friend, Pvt. G. David Schine, and the investigation flying off
in all directions. New Yorker. $89.95. 97 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   `THE THIN RED LINE' _ Not Terrence Malick's ``Thin Red Line''
now in theaters, but, for the first time on tape, Andrew Marton's
1964 adaptation of James Jones' novel set on Guadalcanal, starring
Keir Dullea and Jack Warden. Scimitar. $9.95. 99 minutes. &QL;

FEINSTEIN SAYS DOUBTS WILL LEAD HER TO VOTE FOR ACQUITTAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she will vote
against both articles of impeachment because House prosecutors
failed to prove ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' that President
Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in the Monica
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I deplore the circumstances that have brought us to
this point, I do not believe they present a clear and present
danger to the functioning of our government,'' Feinstein said
during closed-door deliberations on the Senate floor Wednesday. Her
office released a copy of her statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, this president, who has been a good president for
the people of the United States, should not be convicted and
removed from office,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, whose vote for acquittal was expected, has carved out
a major role in the impeachment finale by touting censure as an
alternative to conviction. She has formed an unlikely alliance with
Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, to build support for a censure
resolution, though it appeared Thursday that their effort was
doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment, Feinstein said, is a grave step envisioned by the
Constitution's framers as a last resort when a president's actions
threaten the function of government.
</P>
<P>
   Given that high threshold, ``I do not believe the House
(prosecutors) established beyond a reasonable doubt that this
president is guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein cited the charge that Clinton encouraged Lewinsky to
file a false affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit. House prosecutors relied on Lewinsky's testimony to prove
this charge, but Lewinsky herself said that Clinton never told her
to lie and that the two of them never discussed the contents of her
affidavit, Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One may speculate that the president encouraged her to lie,
but quite simply the point hasn't been proven,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Charges that Clinton conspired to hide gifts he gave Lewinsky
and worked with confidant Vernon Jordan to find her a job also were
marked by contradictory testimony and evidence bolstering a more
innocent interpretation of events, Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   She took dead aim at Republican handling of the impeachment
process, saying GOP House members ``prematurely released'' grand
jury testimony to the public and failed to call key witnesses
during impeachment hearings before the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   While she was ``appalled'' by Clinton's characterization of
Lewinsky as a stalker in a conversation with White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal, ``the fact that this is a popular,
well-respected president (who) has strong support must be
considered.'' In the international arena, removing Clinton would be
``de-stabilizing,'' Feinstein added.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein devoted part of her floor speech to the push for
censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's behavior was immoral, deplorable and
indefensible,'' Feinstein said. ``It sent the wrong message to the
nation and our children.''
</P>
<P>
   While it does not threaten the security and stability of the
nation, Clinton's behavior does warrant ``strong condemnation and
censure, and there should be a formal means for senators ... to
express this condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Censure would not be a legal judgment, but rather a
``legislative measure'' through which senators could express
``moral conclusions'' on Clinton's conduct, and thereby send a
message ``to the people of our nation, especially its youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's California colleague, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.,
also said Thursday that she would vote to acquit Clinton. But
unlike Feinstein, Boxer said she opposes censure.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer told reporters she is concerned that a Senate debate over
censure could eat into the chamber's legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about it becoming the dominant issue in the Senate,''
she said. ``I'm worried it could take too much time away from other
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican opposition to censure is growing, presenting a high
hurdle to Feinstein and other censure advocates. Moving a censure
resolution to the floor would require two-thirds of the Senate _ 67
votes _ to suspend Senate rules, Feinstein said. ``I would hope at
the appropriate time these votes would be present,'' she said.

ANTIQUES: A DESIGNER WHO DREW LIKE WRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Wis., Ill.)   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Lloyd Wright may be America's most talented and revered
20th-century architect, but he didn't get up on that pedestal all
by himself. We are slowly learning about the gifted artists who
contributed to his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Museum of Our National Heritage, in Lexington,
Mass., opens ``Designing in the Wright Style: Furniture and
Interiors by Frank Lloyd Wright and George Mann Niedecken,'' which
focuses on one of Wright's little-known collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   Niedecken (1878-1945), a painter, furniture designer and
decorator, had a role in several Wright commissions between 1902
and 1918. Flea market aficionados take note: pieces by Niedecken
are a new collecting category.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's curator, Cheryl Robertson, the director of
exhibitions at the museum, organized a show in 1981 at the
Milwaukee Art Museum on Niedecken's career and has written a book
in conjunction with the new show.
</P>
<P>
   You might well ask, George who?
</P>
<P>
   Niedecken was born in Milwaukee, the son of a German-American
merchant. At 19, he enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of
Chicago, when it had an innovative decorative arts curriculum,
overseen by Louis Millet, a close friend of Wright's mentor,
architect Louis Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1899 Niedecken did the Grand Tour, spending years traveling
and sketching his way through Germany, Austria, England, France,
Switzerland and Italy. He studied art in Berlin and Paris, with the
Moravian graphics designer Alphonse Mucha, and he visited with Otto
Wagner, co-founder of the Secession, in Vienna. He became familiar
with the British Arts and Crafts movement, French Art Nouveau,
Viennese Secession and German Jugenstil long before Wright did.
</P>
<P>
   When Niedecken returned to Milwaukee in 1902, Wright hired him
to draw renderings a few days each week. Like his fellow architect
Josef Hoffmann in Vienna, Wright believed in the concept of total
design. He thought that the architecture and interior design of a
building should be a seamless work of art.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robertson wrote: ``Wright usually drew in plan and
elevation, relying on assistants to make presentation drawings in
three-dimensional perspective that were used to sell architectural
and furnishings concepts to clients. Sometimes the house and
furniture designs were rendered as watercolor paintings with
contextual elements like foliage or flower arrangements, sculpture
or ceramics, or even carpet or art-glass suggestions invented by
the artist to enhance the pictorial appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Niedecken first collaborated with Wright on the Susan Lawrence
Dana residence in Springfield, Ill. For the commission, Niedecken
created, and signed, a stylized fresco of sumac, goldenrod and
purple asters. Ms. Robertson wrote that Wright ``clearly admired''
the drawing for the mural, ``since he placed it in the center of an
artfully composed photograph'' of the studio library.
</P>
<P>
   In 1905 Niedecken married, and in 1907 he opened an
interior-architecture firm, Niedecken-Waldbridge, with his
brother-in-law in Milwaukee. But he continued to do Wright
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Wright bristled when his assistants got too
independent. ``A lot of us were fired for doing freelance work on
the side,'' recalled Edgar Tafel, an architect who worked with
Wright from 1931 to 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Alofsin, a professor of architecture at the University
of Texas at Austin and the author of ``Frank Lloyd Wright: The Lost
Years: 1910-1922,'' said that in 1910 ``Wright went through a
fundamental crisis, which was compounded by the fact that the young
people who worked with him so closely at the beginning were
starting to leave and to go off on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   But relations with Niedecken were smoother. ``Wright wasn't
overly generous in giving credit to those who worked with him, but
I think this was a wonderful collaboration with Niedecken,''
Alofsin said.
</P>
<P>
   Niedecken contributed to 11 more Wright commissions, providing
``fabrication and installation of furniture, textiles, lighting
fixtures and other decorative arts, which he and Wright designed
jointly or individually,'' Ms. Robertson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   For the Avery Coonley House, in Riverside, Ill., Niedecken
designed a large fireplace mural with delicate birch trees and fern
fronds, some occasional tables, desks, rocking chairs and
upholstered club chairs.
</P>
<P>
   For the untrained eye, it's hard to tell the difference between
a Wright and a Niedecken. For experts like David Hanks, who
organized ``Frank Lloyd Wright and the Living City,'' a show that
opens in Glasgow on Feb. 18, it's easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wright designs tend to be simpler and less polished than
Niedecken's,'' he said. ``Wright was stronger, more direct.
Niedecken was more detail-oriented and had more finesse.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1909 Wright planned to go to Europe and asked Niedecken to
carry out the interior schemes for two major Midwestern projects:
the Frederick Robie House in Chicago and the Meyer May House in
Grand Rapids, Mich. Ms. Robertson said in an interview, ``Most of
the Robie House furniture is by Niedecken.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1916, Wright designed a house for the Frederick Bogk family
in Milwaukee. But his designs for the interior were evidently not
accepted by the family. Ms. Robertson quoted a contemporary letter
from a Bogk friend: ``Mrs. Bogk called on Mr. George Niedecken of
Milwaukee, a man who had worked with Mr. Wright several times and
knew his ideas and inclinations. He designed and decorated all the
furniture with beautiful feeling, so that it would harmonize with
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1918, Wright had opened an office in Los Angeles, and he and
Niedecken never collaborated again. Niedecken stayed in Milwaukee
and focused on the historical revival styles that came into vogue
after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Wright drawings and antiques cost a fortune. Max Protetch, a New
York gallery at 511 W. 22nd St., for example, is selling a 1905
Wright aerial view of the Clark House in Oak Park, Ill., for
$150,000. And on Dec. 10, in its sale of 20th-century decorative
arts, Christie's sold a copper urn from the Dana House for
$288,500; the high estimate was $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even Wright reproductions are expensive. Cassina, an Italian
firm in New York at 155 E. 56th St., sells authorized reproductions
of the Aurora sideboard of 1912 from the William Greene House for
$6,890; of the Barrel Chair from the Martin House of 1937, for
$1,475, and of the Coonley House dining room chair of 1907 for
$970, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Niedecken antiques are cheaper and are recognized only by the
cognescenti. John Toomey, a Prairie School dealer in Oak Park, sold
a pair of Niedecken leaded-glass bookcases in December for $9,500
apiece, but other sharp-eyed collectors are still finding
unidentified Niedeckens in thrift shops. Wright might know the
difference, but your friends won't.

`MY FAVORITE MARTIAN': THE RETURN OF A TV ALIEN AND HIS ANTENNAE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pixilated pixels and other up-to-the-minute moviemaking magic
manage the neat feat of turning the big-screen, resurrected ``My
Favorite Martian'' into an amiable family entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In this updated version of the CBS sitcom, which lasted from
1963 to 1966, Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara (now a television newsman
rather than a newspaper reporter) and Christopher Lloyd as the
visitor from another planet who is given the name Uncle Martin,
take over the roles played by Bill Bixby and Ray Walston.
</P>
<P>
   But in one of the happy and logical little jokes that lend a
disarming charm to the new comedy, directed by Donald Petrie,
Walston turns up once again in a welcome guise.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels and Lloyd are deft comedians; Daniels in his understated
fashion and Lloyd with a gift for eccentricity that served him so
well as Doc Brown in the ``Back to the Future'' series. So they
play off each other neatly when the three-eyed, three-stomached
Martian, who crash-lands in the vicinity of Santa Barbara, Calif.,
hides in the trunk of Tim's car and eventually becomes his house
mate, usually in human guise.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Uncle Martin'' has tried to erase any signs of his
arrival on Earth, enough evidence remains to set government
bloodhounds on his trail and to arouse dreams of glory not only in
the decent Tim but also in some of his more ambitious colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Lending spice to the mix are Elizabeth Hurley as the spoiled,
British-educated dimwit daughter of Tim's boss, who is as
determined to discourage any romance between them as he is to
foster her career as an on-air reporter, even though she can't
really distinguish between such words as preconception and
contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Hannah, as Lizzie, one of the television station's
technical crew, turns out to be Tim's true friend, and Wallace
Shawn as Dr. Coleye (perhaps as in E. coli), a scientist bent on
capturing and examining an alien from outer space, is Tim's
nemesis. But a good deal of the fun in this tale of the Martian's
sojourn on Earth, is provided by Zoot, his polymorphic space suit.
</P>
<P>
   Zoot, with a high-spirited life of its own and a figurative
mouth that seems to have trained at the tongues of Robin Williams
and Bert Lahr, spends a lot of time in washing machines, swills
detergents and invests the proceedings with plenty of welcome
mischief. That is not to overlook Uncle Martin's binge in a seaside
ice cream shop or the car chase in which Martian magic shrinks an
old Plymouth to proportions that enable it to escape government
vehicles into a sewer and beyond the reach of the deadly
Roto-Rooter sent after it by implacable agents.
</P>
<P>
   Travel from Mars to Earth is an amazing feat, but not much more
remarkable than reviving a sitcom that had been dead for a third of
a century.
</P>

OSCAR'S OMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ What happened to ``The Truman Show''?
</P>
<P>
   The drama, directed by Peter Weir and starring Jim Carrey as a
man who slowly realizes that his life is a television show, was
considered a virtual certainty as an Academy Award nominee. Carrey
was widely assumed to be an Oscar contender as best actor.
</P>
<P>
   But when the nominations were announced this week by the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the movie was not among
contenders for best picture, nor was Carrey on the best actor list.
The movie did earn nominations for Weir as director, Ed Harris as
best supporting actor and Andrew Niccol for original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Several Hollywood marketing executives and producers were almost
united in explaining why the academy snubbed ``The Truman Show.''
They said that while some newspaper and magazine critics lavishly
praised the movie, people in Hollywood didn't quite get what all
the hoopla was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a critics' phenomenon, and the town never liked the
movie,'' one top producer said.
</P>
<P>
   A studio marketing executive said that an oft-heard comment
about the movie was that it was overpraised, and that there may
have been a glimmer of resentment by actors of Carrey's relatively
effortless leap from comedy to drama. The actors branch of the
academy selects the acting nominees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Carrey's chances of an Oscar nomination may have
been hurt by his winning a best actor prize at the Golden Globes,
which were awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association on
Jan. 20. The deadline for academy voters was Jan. 29, and many
people cast their ballots in the final week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been, `OK, he got the Golden Globe, that's
enough,' '' the marketing executive said.
</P>
<P>
   There were some other surprising omissions from the nominations.
Bill Murray in ``Rushmore'' and Jane Horrocks and Michael Caine in
``Little Voice'' were ignored. And ``Beloved,'' based on the novel
by Toni Morrison, was nominated only for its costume design.
</P>
<P>
   In the foreign film category ``The Celebration,'' a Danish
movie, was seen as almost a sure contender. It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best picture nominees are expected to benefit
commercially before the awards presentation on March 21, notably,
``Shakespeare in Love,'' which is expanding nationwide this
weekend, and ``The Thin Red Line,'' which has so far fared
modestly.
</P>
<P>
   By last weekend its box office was only $30.6 million, compared
with ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which has taken in $194.6 million
since its summer release.
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s and 70s James Coburn was a top Hollywood star.
His roles in ``The Great Escape,'' ``Charade'' and ``The
Americanization of Emily'' were followed by the two espionage
spoofs, ``Our Man Flint'' and ``In Like Flint,'' and then the hit
satire ``The President's Analyst.'' For a while Coburn could do no
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the late 70s, and his career collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1979 to 1989 I had arthritis; I couldn't work hardly at
all,'' said Coburn, who was nominated for an Academy Award as
supporting actor for his role in ``Affliction.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the 80s Coburn said: ``I did a lot of voice-overs.
That paid the bills. I kept going to doctors. They didn't know how
to deal with it, didn't know what caused it. I finally realized I
had to heal myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn spent the decade struggling to take charge of his
treatment. He endured periods of fasting, deep tissue massages,
special diets, colonics, allergy tests, meditation, laying on of
hands, medical experimentation and the use of an electromagnetic
machine to quell the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that consumed about 12 years, interspersed with an
occasional job,'' he said. ``The first 8 to 10 years were really
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the 90s Coburn was back on his feet and looking for work,
his arthritis apparently arrested. He took some relatively small
roles in ``Maverick,'' ``Sister Act 2'' and ``The Nutty Professor''
and in the Home Box Office satire ``The Second Civil War.'' Then
Paul Schrader, who directed and adapted ``Affliction'' from the
novel by Russell Banks, offered Coburn the choice role of Pop
Whitehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The part is a bleakly atypical one for Coburn. The character is
an abusive drunk who leaves a terrible legacy to his son, played by
Nick Nolte, who was also nominated for an Academy Award, as best
actor. The two men giddily spoke over the telephone on Tuesday
morning, shortly after the Oscar nominations were announced.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made almost 85 films; I started working in 1958 in movies
and television,'' said Coburn, 70. ``I guess I finally got one
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said he based part of his performance on his good friend
Sam Peckinpah, the director of ``The Wild Bunch'' and other films,
who died in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peckinpah was a working alcoholic, as he called himself,''
Coburn said. ``His genius would last about four hours a day. I was
privy to a lot of his machinations and inner workings. It wasn't
the way he showed his alcoholism but the way he didn't show it. You
couldn't tell. And that's what I wanted to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Affliction'' Coburn was cast as a mob boss in the new
Mel Gibson film, ``Payback.'' He said with a laugh, ``I've usually
played senators, a doctor occasionally, corporate types.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that decades ago Hume Cronyn gave him the best advice he
ever got about appearing before the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me technique; he taught me how to respond to a
director,'' Coburn said. ``He taught me how to use my energy. If
you're shooting a close-up, you don't need to use your whole body.
Just your face, your head. It's the application of energy, focusing
on whatever part of the body you're using. It's a very external
technique. But then you apply that, with whatever talent you have,
and hopefully it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said that in the 80s, even during his bleakest moments of
medical treatment and experiments, he never quite lost hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``My aim was to get back to work again,'' he said. ``Otherwise
you sit down, get in a wheelchair and give up. That wasn't my game.
My game was to get through it. You have to have an objective. And
my objective was to get my life going again. And you know what?
It's going great.''
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Coburn, Patricia Neal is also making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Neal is, for some moviegoers, forever identified as Gary
Cooper's co-star in King Vidor's grandiose 1949 drama, ``The
Fountainhead,'' adapted from Ayn Rand's philosophical novel.
</P>
<P>
   But she has also been a critics' favorite in the Elia Kazin
classic ``A Face in the Crowd,'' as well as ``Breakfast at
Tiffany's,'' ``Hud'' (for which she received an Academy Award) and
``The Subject Was Roses.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Neal, 73, is one of the stars of a new Robert Altman
comedy-drama, ``Cookie's Fortune,'' opening on April 9. She has
barely worked on the screen in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants me,'' she said with a laugh. ``They don't think
I'm interested. Well, I am interested. I love to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Neal spends most of her time in her apartment on the Upper
East Side of Manhattan or at her home on Martha's Vineyard. She
said she also led cruises sponsored by the Theater Guild to locales
like the Amazon, Turkey and Greece, and Alaska. ``I do some acting,
I make my speech, oh it's a lovely thing to go on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Altman, who has known Ms. Neal for years, cast her after he
attended a party given for her by one of her daughters, Lucy Dahl.
``He said there was a part for an 85-year-old woman in his movie
and thought he could make me look a little older,'' Ms. Neal said.
``I got a wig, a fantastic makeup man, and it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Altman said: ``She's a marvelous actress and always has been.
Once she came along, we kind of tailored the part for her. She's
the first person I thought of.''
</P>
<P>
   The film stars, among others, Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Chris
O'Donnell, Liv Tyler, Charles S. Dutton and Lyle Lovett. It
involves the death of an eccentric elderly Mississippian, played by
Ms. Neal, and its effect on her extended family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love acting,'' Ms. Neal said. ``I don't even realize the
camera is turning. I was one of those people born to be an actress.
I remember being about 11 and going to church to give a monologue,
and I said to myself, `This is what I want to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Neal has not had an easy life. At 38, while pregnant, she
suffered three massive hemorrhagic strokes that almost killed her.
Then one of her daughters died from measles. And there was a
crippling accident to a son.
</P>
<P>
   She was married for 30 years to the author Roald Dahl; she said
in her autobiography that he was cold and arrogant. The couple, who
had four surviving children, divorced in 1983. Dahl died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Neal walks with a bit of a limp, but seems to have largely
recovered from her strokes. She hopes ``Cookie's Fortune'' will
soon bring some movie offers, she said. And she's extraordinarily
optimistic about her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I'm alive is astonishing,'' she said.

A PASSPORT TO THE ARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Airport terminals need an identity, says Wendy Feuer,
the former director of Arts for Transit, an arm of the Metropolitan
Transit Authority, who is now a consultant to public art projects
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feuer's latest endeavor involves commissioning art,
temporary and permanent, for Terminal 4 at the Kennedy
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Terminal 4, the airport's International Arrivals Building in the
1950s, is being demolished in stages and rebuilt. The $1.2 billion
project, designed by the original architectural firm, Skidmore,
Owings &AMP; Merrill, is scheduled for completion in early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Terminal 4's developers, known as JFK IAT, are a private
consortium run by Schiphol U.S.A., a subsidiary of the Dutch
company that operates the airport in Amsterdam; LCOR Inc., a
developer, and a unit of Lehman Brothers, the securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``An airport isn't `no place' anymore,'' Ms. Feuer said. ``The
latest thinking is that it is important to focus on a person's
experience arriving, knowing that you have arrived not any place
but this place.''
</P>
<P>
   One work of art that had always adorned Terminal 4, even in its
old incarnation, was ``Flight,'' a large hanging Calder mobile from
1957. It will be rehung in the new terminal's departure area.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, travelers can see temporary shows on the second
floor of the terminal, among them three photography exhibitions:
scenes of the Brooklyn Bridge by the Turkish-born artist Burhan
Dogancay; works by Stanley Greenberg from his book ``Invisible New
York: The Hidden Infrastructure of the City,'' and historic
European bridges by the Dutch artists Paul Gofferje and Trudy
Nijman.
</P>
<P>
   These and other shows will continue for several months. Other
artists _ the sculptors Deborah Masters and Harry Roseman and the
interdisciplinary design team of Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo
Scofidio _ are creating permanent site-specific commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The New York photographer Richard Pare is documenting the
terminal's construction, and his photographs will be permanently
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The artists were chosen by a panel made up of architects from
Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill, executives representing the developers,
and Ms. Feuer.
</P>
<P>
   The artworks will be displayed in the arrivals areas and the
immigration hall. Among the most striking will be ``Travelogues,''
created by Diller &AMP; Scofidio. Lining corridors 1,200 and 600 feet
long will be suspended stainless steel panels with movielike
screens that will flash changing images of suitcase interiors.
</P>
<P>
   Suitcases are ``a highly edited version of one's home or
travels,'' according to the artists. The screens are meant to evoke
a fantasy of what may be inside other people's suitcases, as
travelers walk down the one-way corridor toward the customs and
immigration area.
</P>
<P>
   Roseman's project consists of trompe l'oeil curtains made from
cast concrete, and Ms. Masters is creating 20 vignettes of gritty
New York scenes.
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The popular Jackson Pollock retrospective that closed on Feb. 2
at the Museum of Modern Art helped increase the museum's membership
by 25 percent, raised attendance and improved sales in the gift
shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The daily attendance figure of 4,070 even surpassed our
`Picasso and Portraiture' show, which brought in 3,800 people a
day,'' said Elizabeth Addison, the Modern's deputy director for
marketing and communications. ``Forty-five percent of the visitors
were from out of town and more than half cited the show as their
reason for coming to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The retrospective seemed to attract some big spenders. The
museum's sales of Pollock-related merchandise like catalogs,
scarves, posters and CDs totaled about $2 million. About one in
five visitors paid $4 to rent the show's Acoustiguide.
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived as director at the Baltimore Museum of Art a
year ago, Doreen Bolger decided that one of her first projects
would be to renovate and reinstall the wing that houses the Cone
Collection of 19th- and 20th-century masterpieces, which includes
about 500 works by Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   The wing has been closed since Jan. 27 while its walls were
painted a buttery yellow and the works are rehung. When it opens on
Sunday, those familiar with the former installation may be
startled: the metal strip frames on the Matisses have been replaced
by ornately carved wood and cast-plaster gilded frames that the
Cone sisters had originally put on the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around 1986, when the Cone collection was reinstalled, the
traditional frames were taken off and replaced with simple strip
frames, which people then felt were less distracting,'' Ms. Bolger
said. But the old-fashioned frames highlight the paintings, she
said, making them more inviting.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings will be on view through April 18. Then the wing
will close for more renovations until the fall of 2000. ``The wing
needs a new roof and some structural work as well as more
storage,'' Ms. Bolger said. The galleries will be re-configured to
evoke a more domestic setting.
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Drawing Center in SoHo has named its new director. She is
Catherine de Zegher, a curator, writer and editor who was the
co-founder of the Kanaal Art Foundation in Kortrijk, Belgium, and
its director for 11 years. She succeeds Ann Philbin, who left last
month to become director of UCLA at the Armand Hammer Museum of Art
and Cultural Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn Kramarsky, a member of the center's board, said that Ms. de
Zegher's ``extensive experience developing international
exhibitions will enrich and expand the programs at the center.''

BIG SALES FOR WILLY LOMAN 
NEUWIRTH SPEAKS 
LEAVING THE MOUNT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Mass.)   (mk) 
 By JESSE MCKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Electrified by strong reviews, the Goodman Theater's
revival of Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman'' exploded out of
the box-office blocks Thursday morning, tallying more than $240,000
in sales by 2:30 p.m. Producers were predicting the one-day take
would easily top $350,000, a terrific start for a straight play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big,'' said Rocco Landesman, president of the Jujamcyn
Theaters, one of the show's producers. ``It's bigger than `Angels
in America,' which is the biggest thing I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Angels'' finished its two-year run in 1995 in the red. And
the $1.7 million ``Death'' will face its own challenges, including
a finicky automated set, which stalled for several moments on
opening night.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the words of Willy Loman, the play seems ``well
liked'' by ticket buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Bebe, Bye-Bye
</P>
<P>
   In late December, when Bebe Neuwirth left the cast of ``Over and
Over'' at the Signature Theater Company in Arlington, Va., rumors
were rife about the circumstances of her departure.
</P>
<P>
   In Internet chat rooms and on Broadway bar stools, people
whispered that there had been heated arguments and threats between
her and the director, Eric Schaeffer. Speculation was fueled by
silence from Ms. Neuwirth and a statement from the theater that
``artistic differences'' were the reason for the split. Schaeffer
denied the acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rumors grew. In January, a transcript purported to be
the final conversation between Schaeffer and Ms. Neuwirth, filled
with profanities and insults, was being faxed and e-mailed around
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   All of it, Ms. Neuwirth says, was untrue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no blow-up,'' she said in a lengthy interview on
Tuesday. ``Absolutely no blow-up.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``I have a terrible temper. But I did not lose it
there.'' She said she had not seen the purported transcript, but
dismissed it as a hoax. She added that she was insulted that
someone would make her out to be ``a terror,'' and portray
professional actors as ``temperamental babies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like this happens, people like to imagine a
wildly dramatic exit,'' she said. ``And the person doing the
cursing is always the performer.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Ms. Neuwirth says, the decision to leave the cast of
``Over and Over'' was mutual and ``in the interest of everyone
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone says, `I'm developing this in this way and you may
not be the right person for the part,' I completely respect that,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I adore John Kander and Fred Ebb,'' she said of the composer
and lyricist. ``And I think it's a beautiful score.'' When asked
for her opinion on Schaeffer, however, she said she had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gamble, a spokesman for the Signature Theater, said
Schaeffer had no comment on Ms. Neuwirth's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over and Over'' opened last Thursday to lukewarm reviews. The
Washington Post said the show was ``a collection of related bits,
many of them clever, a few of them lovely, some of them just
bewildering.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion of the conversation with Ms. Neuwirth was her
imminent return as Velma Kelly in ``Chicago'' for five weeks,
beginning on Feb. 20. Ute Lemper, who has filled the role since
September, is beginning preparations for the show's Las Vegas debut
on March 2.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Neuwirth, who left ``Chicago'' in September, said she never
thought she would return. But for two weeks in January, she filled
in for Ms. Lemper, who had flu and laryngitis and could not
perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little afraid, in the way you are when the memory of
something is so precious to you,'' she said. ``But it was a
blast.''
</P>
<P>
   Since September, Ms. Neuwirth has shot several independent
films, including ``Getting to Know You,'' shown at Sundance last
month.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the unpleasant innuendo about ``Over and Over,'' Ms.
Neuwirth said there was a silver lining to her departure from the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said I have to turn 40 in Paris,'' said Ms. Neuwirth,
whose birthday is New Year's Eve. ``So right after the decision was
made, I got on the phone to Air France.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughed and added, ``I highly recommend New Year's in
Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Final Curtains
</P>
<P>
   Ending a 20-year association with a literary landmark,
Shakespeare &AMP; Company, one of North America's largest Shakespeare
festivals, has announced that it will leave its home at the Mount
in Lenox, Mass., once the home of the novelist Edith Wharton, at
the end of the 2003 season.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been based at the 50-acre estate in the
Berkshires since its founding in 1978. Since then its summer season
has grown to include four theaters, attracting some 36,000 visitors
a year.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last several years the company has been involved in a
dispute over the lease with the property's landlord, Edith Wharton
Restoration Inc. The restoration society has maintained that the
theater company's presence _ and the large audiences _ were
hindering efforts to restore the site and were causing more damage
to the already well-worn property. The theater company denies this,
and countered that it was the restoration society that was
neglecting the property.
</P>
<P>
   Despite court-ordered mediation in 1997 and several subsequent
efforts at a deal, the latest offer from the restoration society,
made in September, included an extension on only one 108-seat
theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have liked to find some way to work this through in our
present abode,'' said Tina Packer, the company's artistic director.
``But the 108-seat theater couldn't work for us. It would be a
10-fold shrinking of our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Copeland, the restoration society's director, said
Shakespeare &AMP; Company had outgrown the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of their different programs can't fit on this property,''
she said. ``It's not really bad news. They've grown and are
prospering.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither group seems to be saddened at the divorce. Officials at
the theater company say it is already raising money for its new
home, it hopes nearby. Ms. Copeland, meanwhile, says the theater
company's leaving may make it easier to raise money for a
restoration of the site.

CLEVER `BLAST FROM THE PAST' IS FUNNY, FRESH AND SWEET-NATURED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser is having a very good year. ``Gods and
Monsters,'' in which he co-stars with Ian McKellen, is a critical
triumph and well-deserving of its Oscar nominations.
</P>
<P>
   His new film, ``Blast From the Past'' is a sweet-natured movie
that hits more than it misses because of the talent, affability and
modest charm of the Cornish College of the Arts graduate and
``George of the Jungle'' star.
</P>
<P>
   There have certainly been a slew of films that transport an
innocent from one era into another _ ``Iceman'' thrust a caveman
into the 20th century, ``Back to the Future'' worked the reverse
angle, sending Michael J. Fox back to the 1950s, and ``Late for
Dinner'' became a sleeper success with its story of two men who are
frozen and then thaw out 20 years later. Even ``The Truman Show''
twisted the theme, tossing an unsuspecting soul into chaos and
forced to find himself _ and real love _ in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Though director Hugh Wilson, who had a surprise hit with ``The
First Wives Club,'' works from some fairly shopworn material (which
he also co-wrote), ``Blast From the Past'' is well cast and will
appeal to young and old alike.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, brilliant scientist
Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) erects an exact replica of his
San Fernando Valley house deep within the Earth. And when an error
causes Calvin and his pregnant wife, Helen (Sissy Spacek), to
believe the bomb has leveled L.A., they retreat down under where
Helen gives birth to their son, Adam (Fraser).
</P>
<P>
   This idealistic child will be raised listening to Perry Como,
watching Jackie Gleason's ``The Honeymooners'' and being instilled
with respect for everyone, regardless of race, religion or sexual
preference.
</P>
<P>
   Adam is 35 when he's dispatched to the surface to gather
supplies. With a list from his mother that specifies visits to the
local grocery store, and most important, the nearest liquor store,
Adam embarks upon the adventure armed only with a stack of baseball
cards, $3,000, and some ``worthless'' AT&AMP;T and IBM stock
certificates. And in his first encounter with a violent, miserable
not-so gardenlike Eden called Los Angeles, he meets Eve (Alicia
Silverstone).
</P>
<P>
   Eve's had a different kind of upbringing: She's weathered a
broken home, a string of bad relationships and lives with her savvy
gay roommate Troy (Dave Foley). When Adam asks Eve for help in
deciphering this new world, the two must find a way to reconcile
innocence, experience and a fast-growing attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of ``Blast From the Past'' is smart, fast-paced
and fun, and Sissy Spacek is a riot as Adam's budding-alcoholic,
June Cleaver-esque mom. It's also a nice change of pace to see
Walken playing something other than a gangster, thug or killer.
</P>
<P>
   And though the second half deteriorates into neatly wrapped up
plot points and too-convenient, fateful meetings, Fraser manages to
waltz off with the film, elevating it above its tidy contrivances.
In a tricky role that demands a fine balance between strength and
naivete, he makes us believe Adam is truly a guy desperate to find
his place in a world he's never before known.
</P>
<P>
   He contributes a graceful ease as well as his own radioactive
sex appeal, helping ``Blast From the Past'' transcend the familiar
plot to become something clever, funny and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Blast From the Past. Directed by Hugh Wilson. Written by Wilson,
Bill Kelly. Cast: Brendan Fraser, Alicia Silverstone, Christopher
Walken, Sissy Spacek, Dave Foley. New Line Cinema. 112 minutes.
Rated PG-13 for sexual themes, language.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

 &HT;    Atlantans' whodunits in running for Edgars
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta lawyer Ira Genberg apparently had the right
idea when he turned to Marcel Proust for inspiration instead of
John Grisham when he wrote ``Reckless Homicide.'' Genberg's debut
novel, about the legal aftermath of a fatal plane crash, has been
nominated for an Edgar Allan Poe Award as best first novel by an
American author.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta writer Walter Sorrells also was nominated for an Edgar
for best paperback original, but you won't find his name on the
list. Sorrells used the pseudonym of Ruth Birmingham to write
``Atlanta Graves,'' a whodunit about a stolen painting and murder.
</P>
<P>
   In the best novel category, nominees are ``Mr. White's
Confession'' by Robert Clark, ``Blood Work'' by Michael Connelly,
``Beyond Recall'' by Robert Goddard, ``The Last Days of Il Duce''
by Domenic Stansbury and ``A Likeness in Stone'' by J.A. Wallis.
Other nominees in the best first novel category are ``Cold Day in
Paradise'' by Steven Hamilton, ``Numbered Account'' by Christopher
Reich, ``Nice'' by Gen Sacks and ``A Criminal Appeal'' by D.R.
Shanker.
</P>
<P>
   Best paperback original nominees in addition to ``Atlanta
Graves'' are ``Butcher's Hill'' by Laura Lippman, ``Zen Attitude''
by Sujata Massey, ``The Widower's Two-Step'' by Rick Riordan and
``Murder Manual'' by Steven Womack.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina writer Jerry Bledsoe's ``Death Sentence'' was
nominated as best fact crime book.
</P>
<P>
   Winners will be announced April 29 in a Mystery Writers of
America ceremony at the Sheraton New York Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Magical mysteries: When Phillip DePoy first attempted to write
mysteries, he read all the masters, from Poe to Raymond Chandler.
But his greatest inspiration was the Argentine author Jorge Luis
Borges, considered one of the founding fathers of magical realism
in literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stories are little metaphysical mysteries,'' says DePoy,
48, who recently moved from Atlanta to St. Simons Island (Ga.).
``He had a big influence on my writing.''
</P>
<P>
   That influence is evident in DePoy's Zen detective, Flap Tucker.
A sleuth who uses meditation instead of a gun, Flap fights crime
with his best friend, Dalliance Oglethorpe, owner of the nightclub
Easy on Ponce de Leon. The building used to be an Easy Lube, but
the letters for Lube fell off and the sign was never changed.
</P>
<P>
   In DePoy's third novel in the series, ``Easy as One, Two,
Three'' (Dell, $5.99), Flap and Dalliance head into the mountains
of North Georgia to find a missing girl. Fifty years earlier,
another girl disappeared and was never found, although many swear
they have seen her ghost wandering the paths of Black Pine
Mountain. Flap's quest takes him into the company of religious
snake handlers and into forests where old tragedies are unearthed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The setting is very important in establishing the mood of a
story,'' says DePoy, who's directing a play, ``Deja Vu,'' for the
Georgia Ensemble Theatre in Roswell. ``I lived on the Foxfire
property in the mountains for a while in the early '80s and got to
know the area well.''
</P>
<P>
   DePoy says he has drawn on his theater experience to create
believable dialogue and keep the plot moving. Pacing is just as
important in novels as it is in plays, he adds. ``You don't want
the audience to get bored and walk out. Or quit reading.''
</P>
<P>
   DePoy will sign his book at 7 tonight at Chapter 11 Discount
Bookstore at Ansley Mall, 1544 Piedmont Ave. N.E. (Ga.),
404-872-7986.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New edition: Rosemary Daniell's ``Fatal Flowers: On Sin, Sex
and Suicide in the Deep South'' has won the first Palimpsest Prize
sponsored by Hill Street Press in Athens (Ga.). The press opened
nominations for the new book award last fall by inviting
booksellers and readers to recommend their favorite out-of-print
books to be reprinted. First published in 1980, ``Fatal Flowers''
is a memoir that deals with Daniell's attempt to come to terms with
her mother's suicide and her role as a Southern woman. Miriam
Center of Savannah, who nominated the book, will receive $100, and
her favorite bookstore, Regina's Books in Savannah (Ga.), will
receive $500 in free copies. A new edition of the book will be
published in the fall.'

 &HT;    Places in the heart: 10 Southern resorts do right by romance
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 14.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So what's your idea of romance?
</P>
<P>
   A crackling fire at a cozy English-style country estate in the
Tennessee hills? A sybaritic soak in White Sulphur Springs water in
the Allegheny Mountains? A chilled bottle of champagne and the
aroma of fresh or-chids in a tony haven by the Atlantic? A stroll
beside a rushing mountain stream in a North Georgia hardwood
forest?
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's watching daylight turn to dusk while rocking in
sync on a terrace high above Asheville, N.C. A moonlight carriage
ride around an antebellum plantation in South Georgia. A table for
two in the sumptuously elegant dining room of a landmark country
inn in the foothills of Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the scene for romance is simple at upscale resorts in
the Southeast. Scattered throughout the region are ritzy retreats
where _ for a price _ every day can be Valentine's Day. These
aren't the most affordable options; they're the creme de la creme
and, heck, what's money compared to l'amour? Every now and then you
just have to say those three little words: Charge it, please.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the 10 resorts we offer as a sampler box of sinfully
rich chocolates _ it may be hard to pick just one. But, oh, what a
selection.

 &HT;    Windsor courts its fans, but hotel's not the Taj
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 14.
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The mantra of the Windsor Court Hotel is details,
details.
</P>
<P>
   Details such as the 175 roses flown in from South America every
Friday and placed in a priceless antique urn in the lobby. The $8
million collection of English art and antiques adorning common
rooms. The afternoon tea poured in Wedgwood china cups and
accompanied by homemade scones and tarts. The martinis served on
silver trays and mixed in individual silver shakers.
</P>
<P>
   And how's this for detail: When my husband and I sat down to
dinner in the Grill Room, a waiter approached and said: ``Good
evening. We have three kinds of water to offer you: Evian, San
Pellegrino and our own bottled spring water.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people probably don't need three kinds of water to feel
pampered (my answer was, ``Whichever is the most like tap''), but
it was a nice touch.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this make the Windsor Court in downtown New Orleans the
best hotel in the world? Yes, according Conde Nast Traveler, which
recently asked 37,000 readers to pick their favorite hotel on Earth
by rating rooms, service, food and location. The Windsor Court won
by scoring more than 90 percent in all four categories.
</P>
<P>
   But after a weekend at the hotel, I am not convinced. There's
something about the sound of ``best hotel in the world'' that
conjures up images of a castle by the sea or a pasha's palace in
the East. It makes you hope for a bed so lavishly dressed you think
you're sleeping at Buckingham Palace. A marble bathroom the size of
your living room at home, with a basket full of luxurious soaps and
shampoos by the Jacuzzi tub. At the best hotel in the world, you'd
have a private balcony with cushioned teak loungers and a view of
something fabulous _ the Taj Mahal or a rocky coastline. Of course,
the food would be exquisite and the service so attentive it would
feel like you were the only person in the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Windsor Court is a very nice place to stay, with a
location on the edge of the French Quarter that can't be beat and a
restaurant that is undoubtedly one of the finest around, my
experience didn't rise to that fantastical realm. As a matter of
fact, I have stayed in two places recently that surpassed it on all
levels _ the Soho Grand Hotel in New York and Las Alamandas on
Mexico's Pacific Coast. My brother, who has stayed at the Windsor
Court a few times, prefers the Mandarin in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The Windsor Court was built in the 1980s and designed by the
same architect (Morris Aubry Architects of Houston) responsible for
the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead. The two look a lot alike from the
outside, and the ornate, English-style lobby feels familiar as
well. But unlike the Ritz-Carlton, which I love, the Windsor Court
leaves me a little flat.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, there's something about being in New Orleans and
not staying in a historic inn that seems like blasphemy. It felt
wrong to be in a modern, 324-room hotel with an English motif in
this old-flavored French city.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for many people, especially the business travelers
who make up most of the Windsor Court's clientele, that is
precisely the appeal. For the business traveler, 24-hour room
service, a fax machine in every suite and a restaurant famous for
power meals three times a day is more tempting than a four-poster
bed and a pretty courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   Let's call the decor a matter of opinion. The next problems I
had would irritate most discerning travelers. Although we were
upgraded from a junior suite to a huge suite with wonderful views
of the Mississippi River, our room, designated nonsmoking, reeked
of cigar smoke. When we complained, the valet offered to move us,
and when we declined _ it seemed like a bother for just one night _
he offered to bring in an air purification system while we were at
dinner. Unfortunately, it didn't work: The room still smelled when
we returned late that night.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that could happen anywhere. More surprising was the
furniture in the suite, which was a little worn and out of date. I
was told later that we were in an unrenovated room and was shown a
renovated one. It was much nicer, with up-to-date fabrics and lamps
and softer lighting replacing the harsh fluorescent fixtures we
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I am picky, but I found it amazing that, although we had a
small kitchen, there was no coffeemaker. There were goodies by the
bathtub _ which was not a Jacuzzi _ but they weren't any better
than those at less luxurious hotels. And the terry-cloth bathrobes
in the closet were so scratchy I wasn't even tempted to steal one.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, service is what the hotel claims is its most
distinctive feature, yet when I called down to the concierge for a
razor, it took an hour to arrive. I was already dressed, so I told
the man it was too late. He apologized, but no relief was offered.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was that mysterious comment by the head
concierge, Patrick Rodigou. I asked him to recall some of his most
outrageous requests from guests, and he explained that while he
gets a lot of high-maintenance guests, he knows how to handle them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could spend half a day on one guest, so you have to
control the guest from the beginning,'' he said. ``If they want you
to find something, give them the phone numbers instead of calling
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure guests want to hear the concierge is looking for
ways not to fill their needs. And it sounds like it runs contrary
to the No. 1 item in the ``Visions and Values'' card employees
carry in their pockets: ``Anticipate and fulfill with a positive
attitude the needs of our guests, including their unexpressed
wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you are President Clinton or Rod Stewart _ both of whom
have stayed here _ the hotel becomes a very different place, one
worthy of world-class status. I was shown a $3,000-a-night
penthouse suite _ a spectacular seven-room, three-bathroom spread
complete with well-furnished balconies overlooking both the city
and the river, a baby grand piano, antiques, books and a bar
stocked with the guest's favorite beverages before arrival. Clinton
took a liking to a set of antique German books in the suite, and he
was able to buy them. Stewart likes his tea poured from a porcelain
pot, so one is brought out each time he visits. Now, that's
service.
</P>
<P>
   And the penthouse even has a coffeemaker in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The Grill Room, which is an indulgent experience even when
ordering a $50 bottle of bordeaux, must become sublime when a guest
orders one of the more expensive bottles from the hotel's cellar,
which claims to be the South's largest. It's possible to spend
$10,000 on a bottle of wine, or almost $19,000 on a magnum of
champagne. A sommelier walks around the restaurant with a silver
cup around his neck to taste the more expensive bottles before
pouring them. Our wine did not merit such treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are plenty of amenities for the rest of us. The
Grill Room's food, while more expensive than anywhere else in the
city, deserves its five-star Mobil rating. The menu is not very
Louisiana _ not much in the way of gumbos or etouffees _ but I had
fois gras that nearly made me swoon, followed by the best lobster I
have ever eaten in a nice restaurant. (Lobster cracked yourself and
eaten in a Maine seafood shack beats it, but that's not a fair
contest.)
</P>
<P>
   The swimming pool, open and heated all year with an underwater
music system, is the biggest I have seen outside of a spa or
country club.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing not rated by the Conde Nast Traveler readers but
definitely an amenity is the price. Off season, which is summer and
around Christmas, you can get a suite for as little as $200. We got
a special deal _ $395 for a suite and dinner for two in the Grill
Room. That seemed like a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusion? The Windsor Court's status as best in the world
might be open for debate, but the Grill Room's reputation as one of
the country's best restaurants is well-deserved.

 &HT;    DEBATE SHOWS OPENNESS WAS RIGHT CHOICE, HUTCHISON SAYS
 &HT;    Eds: Restores dropped word ``we'' in graf 18.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bucking her own political party and Senate
tradition, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison has gained national attention
in recent weeks for leading an unsuccessful effort to let the
public and television cameras observe the final deliberations in
the impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Before spending a second long day in Thursday in a closed Senate
session, the Texas Republican discussed with correspondent Bob Dart
her losing battle and the looming conclusion to the impeachment
drama.
</P>
<P>
   Q. From what has gone on so far, do you think that the closed
deliberations are much different than open ones would have been?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Not not at all. I think the people would be proud to see
the debate that is going on. And I don't think the speeches would
be any different. And they're good. I think we have missed an
opportunity for historical purposes as well as current purposes to
have this record.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why was the openness issue so important to you?
</P>
<P>
   A. I had always felt that openness in government was an
expectation that people have. And as we have increased news sources
so that you are able to see things live and immediately, the idea
that we would revert back a rule that was made before senators were
elected by the public and before there was instant television is
incomprehensible to me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did your stint as a television correspondent in Houston three
decades ago affect your thinking?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, certainly. Having been in the news media, I understand
the importance of openness in government. But really I've watched
this evolve since my time of the state legislature when open
meetings laws were first passed. I've never operated in any other
way but with open meetings when they were official.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you heard much from constituents about this?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. There has been a good amount of interest, and people who
have called in have definitely been in favor of openness.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Splitting from many Republican leaders, you have emerged as a
much-televised national spokeswoman on this contentious issue. Has
it affected your relationships in the Senate?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I certainly understand when people disagree on issues,
and they understand my position. And many have told me that they
were torn about it. But one of the reasons given by some for voting
against opening the doors is that the debate would be prolonged
because more people would speak. Well, in fact, I don't think there
is one bit of difference in how long people are taking. And I think
we will end up in the exact same place as we would have if it had
been open. But the effect on history would have been much greater.
</P>
<P>
   Q. One argument against opening the session was that jury
deliberations are traditionally closed. Is what the Senate is doing
comparable to what a jury does?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's not like a deliberation. To try to equate this with just
a trial jury is to miss the point that this is a political process
by choice. The founders of our country who wrote our Constitution
decided not to have the Supreme Court be the trier of the president
of the United States. They specifically chose the Senate. And I
believe they intended for it to be part of the political process.
It's certainly quasi-judicial, but it's not completely judicial.
And I think people's expectations are that this would be an open
process when the fate of the president of the United States is at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will there be any political ramifications for either party _
good or bad _ over the Republicans having closed the deliberations?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, it was a mixed vote. I wouldn't say that it was the
Republicans who closed it. There were many Republicans who voted
for opening. I think it was a mistake, but I think it's certainly
not unprecedented. They were following the rule that has been on
the books for over a hundred years. I just thought it was time to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you decided how you're going to vote on conviction or
acquittal?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, I have. And I will be releasing that as soon as we know
when the vote will be.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's your position on censure?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think censure is probably not an option at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you could get introspective for a bit, what has the
impeachment ordeal been like?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's been a historic moment in the country and certainly in
the Senate. It's only the second trial of its kind in our country's
history, but it's the first one for all of us. I think it was a
very strong Senate performance. We were able to conduct a full
trial with a full record and we're going to have a final vote. We
turned back motions to dismiss early and not to allow evidence ...
and I think that was the right decision. I believe the Senate has
come together in many ways. We have really consulted and debated
the process, and I think handled it well even though I disagree
with the closing of the deliberations. I think that was the only
part that was a real mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, I guess you all have spent a lot more time together
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's really bonded the Senate in many ways. Certainly
Republicans and Democrats have gotten to know each other better. I
think it has been a positive experience from the senatorial
inter-workings. There's no acrimony among Republicans and Democrats
or among Republicans who might disagree on the outcome. People
believe the votes are being made on the merits and according to
people's consciences. It has really been a positive experience over
all, although it has been a wrenching one.

 &HT;    MCCAFFREY PRAISES MEXICO'S WAR ON DRUGS, RAISES CONCERNS OVER
COLOMBIA
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 600 words.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ U.S. anti-drug czar Barry McCaffrey on Thursday
expressed serious concerns about the ``explosion'' in drug
production in Colombia, but praised Mexico for its increasing
cooperation in the war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the Mexican president when he characterizes drugs
as the biggest threat to national security,'' said McCaffrey,
speaking at a luncheon here attended by educators, politicians, and
Latin diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Mexican government is serious about wanting to do
something about the drug problem,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday(2/15), McCaffrey will join President Clinton on a
visit to Mexico for meetings with President Ernesto Zedillo. The
issue of Mexico being used as a major throughway for drug
trafficking into the United States is expected to be a primary
topic of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting comes just two weeks before the Clinton
administration must give its recommendation to the U.S. Congress of
which countries have been cooperative partners in the war against
illegal drugs. Under U.S. law, Clinton must annually review the
cooperation of Mexico, Colombia and other countries that are either
used for drug production or drug trans-shipment. Countries that
aren't ``certified'' as fully cooperating can lose certain economic
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Following the administration's recommendation for certification,
which must be made by March 1, the Congress must then confirm the
certification within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has been certified as fully cooperating each year since
Congress mandated the process in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to certify Mexico again this year, but the
Washington Post on Wednesday reported that the president is bracing
for a concerted effort in Congress to overturn the certification.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey has never been a big fan of the U.S.' unilateral
certification process -- a feeling echoed strongly in Mexico. He
reiterated hopes Thursday that the United States will eventually
``bury'' the law and adopt a multilateral approach that allows
other countries to evaluate U.S. efforts to fight drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCaffrey said Mexico's making progress in its
anti-drug battle despite a police force that was once ``riddled
with corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes some 15 years to build a good police force,'' he
said, adding that Mexico needs ``another 10 years or more'' to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey also pointed to the Mexican government's recently
announced plan to spend $400 million to $500 million over the next
three years to buy new planes, ships, radar and law enforcement
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McCaffrey painted a very different picture of
the anti-drug war in violence-plagued Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said that cultivation of cocaine jumped 26 percent in
that South American country in 1998, with signs of an increase in
opium production there as well.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that 50 percent of all heroin consumed in the United
States is now produced in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   He countered this with the recent progress made in Peru, where
coca production has plummeted by 52 percent over the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia presents a special case in that 40 percent of the
land area is no longer under the government's control,'' McCaffrey
said.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Colombia has been fighting a powerful offensive by
Latin America's oldest and largest rebel group. Much of the
country's countryside is now controlled either by rebels or
paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said the United States has been inadequate in its
support of Colombia, which received more than $250 million in U.S.
aid last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton granted a waiver to Colombia certifying that
country by invoking national interest even though it failed to make
the grade.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey refused to comment on whether he would recommend
Colombia's certification this year.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the Caribbean -- an increasingly important transit
area for Colombian drug smugglers shipping heroin and cocaine to
the United States -- McCaffrey said he's seen no credible effort in
Haiti to stop a surge in drug smuggling there. He's also seen no
evidence that the Cuba's communist government is involved in drug
smuggling, a charge often made by the Cuban exile community in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey's visit here came just days after Clinton proposed
$17.8 billion in anti-drug funding as part of his new budget.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the government's new National Drug Control Strategy
is to reduce drug use and availability by 50 percent by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   About 6 percent of the U.S. population uses illegal drugs,
although McCaffrey emphasized Thursday that the level of drug use
among 12- to 17-year-olds declined slightly in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the new budget is $50 million for the Immigration
and Naturalization Service to implement the Integrated Surveillance
Information System, or ISIS, which incorporates infrared cameras
with ground sensors to aid the Border Patrol in anti-smuggling
efforts on the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes three truck X-ray systems to examine commercial
cargoes in trailers entering the United States at Laredo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interdiction resources will increase significantly in 1999,''
McCaffrey said. But ``prevention and treatment remain our plan's
central components.''

`MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE' NEVER QUITE CONNECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Noted film critic James Agee once contended the riskiest of all
filmmaking endeavors is the romance. If it doesn't work just right,
the failure is so obvious that its creators will invariably find
themselves the object of ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   That could be the fate of those involved with ``Message in a
Bottle,'' the big-budget film version of Nicholas Sparks'
bestseller. It's filled with big names, gorgeous scenery and
high-minded romantic intentions but ends up just this side of
sappy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly a bad movie, and it has some sparkling
movie-star moments, but it just doesn't completely click. We never
fall in love with its love affair, and it seems so long (though
it's actually just over two hours) and slow-paced that the
experience often feels like life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about Theresa (Robin Wright Penn), a divorced
mother and romantically unfulfilled research assistant at the
Chicago Tribune, who, while on a New England vacation, finds a
bottle washed up on the beach with a letter written by an anonymous
man to the woman he loved and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Taken by the sincerity and sensitivity of the prose _ and
wondering, no doubt, why she's never met a man so deeply in love
with her _ she takes the letter back to Chicago, shows it to her
boss, and convinces him to let her use her researching skills to
track the author down.
</P>
<P>
   In no time, she discovers Garret Blake (Kevin Costner), a
shipbuilder living in a small town on the North Carolina coast with
his crusty father (Paul Newman). It seems Garret's wife died two
years earlier, and he wrote the letter as an act of
grief-management self-therapy.
</P>
<P>
   She stays on, and gets to know his tortured personal history.
But Theresa, of course, doesn't tell him why she is so interested
in him, and the inevitable love affair that develops is under a
certain false pretense. What will he do when he finds out?
</P>
<P>
   As this plays out, the bright spot in the movie is Robin Wright
Penn. She's immensely appealing from beginning to end, and _ since
she's the main character and emotional focus of the script _ it
might have been a big, star-making part for her had the movie
worked a little better.
</P>
<P>
   Newman also has his winning moments as Garret's match-making
father, but, frankly, he seems rather self-conscious in the
supporting part, as if he doesn't exactly know what to do with
himself now that he's officially (after the failure of last year's
``Twilight'') stepped down from above-the-title stardom.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all its beautiful faces and postcard photography
(by Caleb Deschanel, one of Hollywod's best) the movie seems
hopelessly contrived: it's so consistently unbelievable every step
of the way, in fact, that it's impossible to suspend disbelief and
make the emotional investment the story requests.
</P>
<P>
   (My favorite unbelievable moment comes near the end when Theresa
finally overcomes her writing-phobia to tell her romantic history
in the pages of the Tribune. Her editor likes it so much that the
next we see her she's moving from a cubicle in the rear of the
library into an office the size of Donald Trump's. Oh, sure.)
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Kevin Costner has never seemed so weak or uncharismatic
on film. Even in turkeys like ``Waterworld'' and ``The Postman,''
he was a living spark of stardom amidst the ruins. Here, he's so
dull _ and has so little chemistry with his co-star _ that it's a
mystery how her character could possibly fall in love with him.
</P>
<P>
   Message in a Bottle. Directed by Luis Mandoki. Screenplay by
Gerald DiPego, from the novel by Nicholas Sparks. Cast: Kevin
Costner, Robin Wright Penn, Paul Newman, John Savage. Warner Bros.
126 minutes. Rated PG-13 for a few bedroom scenes.

 &HT;    MCCAFFREY PRAISES MEXICO'S WAR ON DRUGS, RAISES CONCERNS OVER
COLOMBIA
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 600 words.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ U.S. anti-drug czar Barry McCaffrey on Thursday
expressed serious concerns about the ``explosion'' in drug
production in Colombia, but praised Mexico for its increasing
cooperation in the war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the Mexican president when he characterizes drugs
as the biggest threat to national security,'' said McCaffrey,
speaking at a luncheon here attended by educators, politicians, and
Latin diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Mexican government is serious about wanting to do
something about the drug problem,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday(2/15), McCaffrey will join President Clinton on a
visit to Mexico for meetings with President Ernesto Zedillo. The
issue of Mexico being used as a major throughway for drug
trafficking into the United States is expected to be a primary
topic of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting comes just two weeks before the Clinton
administration must give its recommendation to the U.S. Congress of
which countries have been cooperative partners in the war against
illegal drugs. Under U.S. law, Clinton must annually review the
cooperation of Mexico, Colombia and other countries that are either
used for drug production or drug trans-shipment. Countries that
aren't ``certified'' as fully cooperating can lose certain economic
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Following the administration's recommendation for certification,
which must be made by March 1, the Congress must then confirm the
certification within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has been certified as fully cooperating each year since
Congress mandated the process in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to certify Mexico again this year, but the
Washington Post on Wednesday reported that the president is bracing
for a concerted effort in Congress to overturn the certification.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey has never been a big fan of the U.S.' unilateral
certification process -- a feeling echoed strongly in Mexico. He
reiterated hopes Thursday that the United States will eventually
``bury'' the law and adopt a multilateral approach that allows
other countries to evaluate U.S. efforts to fight drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCaffrey said Mexico's making progress in its
anti-drug battle despite a police force that was once ``riddled
with corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes some 15 years to build a good police force,'' he
said, adding that Mexico needs ``another 10 years or more'' to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey also pointed to the Mexican government's recently
announced plan to spend $400 million to $500 million over the next
three years to buy new planes, ships, radar and law enforcement
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McCaffrey painted a very different picture of
the anti-drug war in violence-plagued Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said that cultivation of cocaine jumped 26 percent in
that South American country in 1998, with signs of an increase in
opium production there as well.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that 50 percent of all heroin consumed in the United
States is now produced in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   He countered this with the recent progress made in Peru, where
coca production has plummeted by 52 percent over the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia presents a special case in that 40 percent of the
land area is no longer under the government's control,'' McCaffrey
said.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Colombia has been fighting a powerful offensive by
Latin America's oldest and largest rebel group. Much of the
country's countryside is now controlled either by rebels or
paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said the United States has been inadequate in its
support of Colombia, which received more than $250 million in U.S.
aid last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton granted a waiver to Colombia certifying that
country by invoking national interest even though it failed to make
the grade.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey refused to comment on whether he would recommend
Colombia's certification this year.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the Caribbean -- an increasingly important transit
area for Colombian drug smugglers shipping heroin and cocaine to
the United States -- McCaffrey said he's seen no credible effort in
Haiti to stop a surge in drug smuggling there. He's also seen no
evidence that the Cuba's communist government is involved in drug
smuggling, a charge often made by the Cuban exile community in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey's visit here came just days after Clinton proposed
$17.8 billion in anti-drug funding as part of his new budget.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the government's new National Drug Control Strategy
is to reduce drug use and availability by 50 percent by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   About 6 percent of the U.S. population uses illegal drugs,
although McCaffrey emphasized Thursday that the level of drug use
among 12- to 17-year-olds declined slightly in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the new budget is $50 million for the Immigration
and Naturalization Service to implement the Integrated Surveillance
Information System, or ISIS, which incorporates infrared cameras
with ground sensors to aid the Border Patrol in anti-smuggling
efforts on the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes three truck X-ray systems to examine commercial
cargoes in trailers entering the United States at Laredo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interdiction resources will increase significantly in 1999,''
McCaffrey said. But ``prevention and treatment remain our plan's
central components.''

THE PRANKSTER'S GUIDE TO VALENTINE'S DAY
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, we're not suggesting that you send an exploding box of
chocolates, but you have to admit, that is a pretty funny drawing.
Just because you're an incorrigible practical joker doesn't mean
you can't throw some romance into the mix. Here are some gags we
cooked up:
</P>
<P>
   _While your sweetie's at work, hide his or her car. This will,
of course, lead to fretting, but it will all be worthwhile when she
finds the car and it's filled with roses (try to supply them with
water; dead roses aren't much fun). Or when he finds it and it's
filled with season tickets to every sporting event in town.
</P>
<P>
   _Tell your honey you've made reservations at a moderately fancy
restaurant _ one that's at least stuffy enough to dis you when you
arrive with no reservations. While you're driving away, pretending
to be baffled by the mistake, suggest that maybe you can get into
someplace really swanky for a drink. Of course, that's where you've
made the real reservations.
</P>
<P>
   _Remember the Polaroid commercial where the workaholic guy in a
business meeting is persuaded to take a long lunch when he finds a
sexy photo of his wife in his briefcase (they never did show that
photo, darn them). Take it a step further by hiding lingerie in his
pants pockets, briefcase or whatever he's likely to open in front
of other people during the day. Guys, if you do something like
this, we recommend new underwear.

BACK OF BUS ISN'T ALL THAT BAD _ TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Riding on the back of the bus turns me on today.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, not too long ago, it turned me off.
</P>
<P>
   But that's black history for you.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes backward is forward.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that I can enjoy riding on the back of the bus today,
even look forward to it, on the days when I have no need to drive
downtown to work speaks volumes about the transit of black history.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the back of the bus was never that physically
uncomfortable. It was just the fact of being relegated to it that
hurt to the bone and to the soul. It was as much a symbolic thing
as an actual physical limitation.
</P>
<P>
   A cross section of the local population these days shares the
rear section of the bus with me _ a mixed bag of races,
occupations, interests and political views. The conversation, which
may range from sports to the president's libido or the latest
antics of some of the more egotistical members of the Fort Worth
City Council, is usually lively and semi-well-informed.
</P>
<P>
   I am the token liberal. And I get chided for it.
</P>
<P>
   Some back-section riders choose to read, which is one of the
advantages of parking and riding. There is, for example, a
librarian among us who pores through a different mystery novel
every day. She seldom looks up from her book, although at one point
in one of our powwows, she interjected that she is a member of
Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   Some sleep. I do that too, sometimes, but that is usually on the
way home.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier time, I also slept in the back of the bus on the
long haul between downtown and Fort Worth's Lake Como neighborhood,
where I grew up. I did that sleeping on one of the two routes to
that side of town. One went to Como, the other to the lilly-white
Ridglea neighborhood. When the bus turned off to Como, we could
move up. But by then, there wasn't much point in doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you could move up sooner, depending upon the
temperament of the bus driver. At that time the bus drivers were
all white, and they possessed an authority over African-American
riders that approximated that of a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   To sleep on the back of the bus: Perchance, as the Bard said, to
dream of getting away from a place that relegated one to such a
status, that defined one as something inferior and confined one's
aspirations to such cramped limits.
</P>
<P>
   In my late teens, I _ like thousands of young African-Americans
_ fled North, vowing never to ever ride on the back of the bus
again or to ever accept second-class citizenship, employment,
educational opportunity, housing or public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Others stayed to wait for their change to come _ and many paid a
price to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned to Fort Worth years later, Rosa Parks had
refused to budge in Montgomery, Ala., setting in motion the social
cataclysm that brought down most of the putrid scaffolding of Jim
Crow law that the back of the bus symbolized.
</P>
<P>
   By then, African-Americans could sit anywhere on the buses. The
problem was that by the late '60s, the bus system in Fort Worth was
about on its last wheel. Public transit had been run over by many
things _ the reluctance of many whites to sit intermingled with
African-Americans, the exponential growth of private automobile
ownership, and the flight to the suburbs that had been fueled by
the expansion of the interstate highway system.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the reduction in routes and the deterioration of the
rolling stock, bus ridership had decreased to the point that some
bigoted members of the Fort Worth Police Department referred to
city buses as ``air-polluting (ethnic slur)-haulers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was true that African-Americans constituted the bulk of the
now-defunct Fort Worth Transit Co.'s riders. But they at least kept
the system going until residents could be persuaded to approve bond
funds for the city to buy the franchise and turn it over to a
management company to run.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth voters later approved the establishment of a public
transportation authority, funded largely by a half-cent sales tax.
And public transportation has been on a steady course of
improvement and innovation ever since.
</P>
<P>
   That will continue out of necessity because increased use of
public transit is crucial to preventing highway gridlock and to
diminishing air pollution. Increasingly, people from across the
demographic spectrum are riding the buses because of the
convenience and the conviviality that sometimes prevails on them,
particularly in the rear seats.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is considerable interracial and class
interaction occurring in other parts of the bus. But for
sentimental and historical reasons, I choose to sit at the back of
the bus to talk, to read, to sleep, perchance to dream.

KING'S `STORM' A TOO-LONG LOOK AT EVIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No doubt about it. Stephen King writes long.
</P>
<P>
   Lovers of his books don't seem to mind. They keep coming back.
And they may be willing to sit still for the g-r-a-d-u-a-l
unfolding of events in ``Stephen King's Storm of the Century,''
airing Sunday, Monday and Thursday on ABC. But, with all due
respect to Mr. King and his obvious ability to scare the pants off
us, viewers who skip Monday's installment can still be thoroughly
terrorized while having been pantsed in a third less time than the
average American viewer.
</P>
<P>
   What could be better?
</P>
<P>
   A more convincing type of fake snow would be nice, but I'm
getting picky now. ``Storm of the Century'' is a well-made,
gut-wrenching film, with Tim Daly giving a stout performance as the
lonely voice of reason in a town gone reasonless, and Colm Feore
topping that with a spellbinding, chilling portrayal of evil
personified.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, when the author's name is part of the title, one can
pretty well figure the cutting-room floor stayed relatively clean
during final assembly. And when the author-with-name-in-title is an
executive producer, well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who chooses to sit through all three nights must endure 4
1/2 hours of film (plus 90 minutes of commercials) and a boatload
of Down East accents, some good, some a few states off the mark.
Daly chose to go accent-free, thus avoiding what could have been a
monumental distraction, and Feore, whose character hails from
another world altogether, didn't have to worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   Daly plays Mike Anderson, storekeeper and constable on Little
Tall Island, two miles off the Maine coast. Fans will recognize
Little Tall from King's novel, ``Dolores Claiborne'': remote
location in the harsh Atlantic, hardy populace that's close-knit
and able to keep a secret.
</P>
<P>
   On Night 1, Anderson is busy at the store as townsfolk stock up
in advance of the mother of all winter storms. His preparations are
interrupted when a teenager discovers the body of a well-loved
community elder. Anderson and his deputy find the killer (Feore)
sitting calmly in the woman's living room, waiting to be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Even by King's long-winded standards, it's not long before we
know who's really being held prisoner here.
</P>
<P>
   Feore plays Andre Linoge, a mysterious man in watch cap and
peacoat who seems to be intimately familiar with the skeletons in
everyone's closets.
</P>
<P>
   His revelations of personal peccadilloes and more heinous
transgressions, plus the supernatural power residing in his fancy
cane with the wolf's-head handle, eventually cause many of Little
Tall's people to check out for good.
</P>
<P>
   As the death toll mounts, the accumulated worries of a
hysterical community grow deeper than the fake snow outside the
town hall where hundreds are waiting out the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of Part 2 on Monday serves to build, build, build
the tension, and it's slow going.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in Part 1 Linoge says, ``Give me what I want, and I'll
go away.'' Regrettably, we don't find out what he wants until
halfway through Part 3, when it's fairly easy to make an accurate
guess.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, King has deftly written a dandy study in group
hysteria, setting up a sort of Hobson's choice for the town _ one
option likely resulting in the deaths of everyone, the other
possibly yielding a fate worse than death.
</P>
<P>
   King, who wrote this directly for the TV screen, not as a novel,
is a master of psychological terror, and ``Storm of the Century''
delivers plenty, with several fine performances from a huge cast.
At the same time, it is not too violent nor too bloody, just a
night too long.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen King's Storm of the Century. Six-hour miniseries about a
remote New England town and its struggle against nature's fury and
an evil supernatural force. Starring Tim Daly, Debrah Farentino and
Colm Feore. Sunday, Monday and Thursday on ABC. Parental guideline
rating: TV-14.

CLEVER `BLAST FROM THE PAST' IS FUNNY, FRESH AND SWEET-NATURED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser is having a very good year. ``Gods and
Monsters,'' in which he co-stars with Ian McKellen, is a critical
triumph and well-deserving of its Oscar nominations.
</P>
<P>
   His new film, ``Blast From the Past'' is a sweet-natured movie
that hits more than it misses because of the talent, affability and
modest charm of the Cornish College of the Arts graduate and
``George of the Jungle'' star.
</P>
<P>
   There have certainly been a slew of films that transport an
innocent from one era into another _ ``Iceman'' thrust a caveman
into the 20th century, ``Back to the Future'' worked the reverse
angle, sending Michael J. Fox back to the 1950s, and ``Late for
Dinner'' became a sleeper success with its story of two men who are
frozen and then thaw out 20 years later. Even ``The Truman Show''
twisted the theme, tossing an unsuspecting soul into chaos and
forced to find himself _ and real love _ in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Though director Hugh Wilson, who had a surprise hit with ``The
First Wives Club,'' works from some fairly shopworn material (which
he also co-wrote), ``Blast From the Past'' is well cast and will
appeal to young and old alike.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, brilliant scientist
Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) erects an exact replica of his
San Fernando Valley house deep within the Earth. And when an error
causes Calvin and his pregnant wife, Helen (Sissy Spacek), to
believe the bomb has leveled L.A., they retreat down under where
Helen gives birth to their son, Adam (Fraser).
</P>
<P>
   This idealistic child will be raised listening to Perry Como,
watching Jackie Gleason's ``The Honeymooners'' and being instilled
with respect for everyone, regardless of race, religion or sexual
preference.
</P>
<P>
   Adam is 35 when he's dispatched to the surface to gather
supplies. With a list from his mother that specifies visits to the
local grocery store, and most important, the nearest liquor store,
Adam embarks upon the adventure armed only with a stack of baseball
cards, $3,000, and some ``worthless'' AT&AMP;T and IBM stock
certificates. And in his first encounter with a violent, miserable
not-so gardenlike Eden called Los Angeles, he meets Eve (Alicia
Silverstone).
</P>
<P>
   Eve's had a different kind of upbringing: She's weathered a
broken home, a string of bad relationships and lives with her savvy
gay roommate Troy (Dave Foley). When Adam asks Eve for help in
deciphering this new world, the two must find a way to reconcile
innocence, experience and a fast-growing attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of ``Blast From the Past'' is smart, fast-paced
and fun, and Sissy Spacek is a riot as Adam's budding-alcoholic,
June Cleaver-esque mom. It's also a nice change of pace to see
Walken playing something other than a gangster, thug or killer.
</P>
<P>
   And though the second half deteriorates into neatly wrapped up
plot points and too-convenient, fateful meetings, Fraser manages to
waltz off with the film, elevating it above its tidy contrivances.
In a tricky role that demands a fine balance between strength and
naivete, he makes us believe Adam is truly a guy desperate to find
his place in a world he's never before known.
</P>
<P>
   He contributes a graceful ease as well as his own radioactive
sex appeal, helping ``Blast From the Past'' transcend the familiar
plot to become something clever, funny and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Blast From the Past. Directed by Hugh Wilson. Written by Wilson,
Bill Kelly. Cast: Brendan Fraser, Alicia Silverstone, Christopher
Walken, Sissy Spacek, Dave Foley. New Line Cinema. 112 minutes.
Rated PG-13 for sexual themes, language.

   Bring back the draft
</P>
<P>
   By Arnold Rosenfeld
</P>
<P>
   The Marines, perpetually looking for a few good men, seem to
have all they need. The Army and the Navy, who need more than a
few, have fallen on tougher times.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that is good news. The economy has been whizzing along.
When that happens and civilian jobs are there for the taking,
recruitment in the armed forces lags. Historical fact.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a bit of talk lately of bringing back the draft.
Good idea. Some form of conscription ought to get serious thought.
It would be good for the country for a number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   A draft would fill up the ranks - and give a lot of young people
the feeling that serving their country was more than an empty
phrase. It would bring to the military and its culture a lot of
young people who wanted nothing more than to get out. That's a
healthy part of military service in a democracy. The armed forces
that protect us so nobly are also the best of our class levelers.
They are about as close as we come to a true meritocracy. Not a bad
thing to know when you're growing up. Not a bad thing for the
country.

scene last year by winning the U.S. Amateur and finishing as the
low amateur at The Masters, but passed on an opportunity to turn
pro to continue enjoying the college experience. In fact, the
20-year-old is not only the team's best player, but he's also the
best practical joker. (Arey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.

 &HT;    Impeachment fallout: Did TV misread public disinterest?

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lumbering toward a finale, the
sex-and-the-presidency miniseries that dominated television for
more than a year has tested the patience and judgment of TV news
executives.
</P>
<P>
   They have wrestled with the historical nature of President
Clinton's impeachment vs. the public's disinterest in it. With the
Senate expected to cast a final vote today, TV news folks are
looking back on the difficult year and looking forward to some
semblance of normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we've been held hostage by this for over a year,''
sighed CNN anchor Judy Woodruff. ``It's been very difficult to get
anybody to focus on anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout that year, starting with the revelation of the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal and continuing through the Senate trial,
TV news has wrestled with how and how much to cover the story. On
one hand, the impeachment of Clinton was history-making news; on
the other hand, the American public dismissed impeachment as a
partisan snipe-fest and turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to cover the news stories we think are important,
but we also can't completely ignore the fact that we live in a real
world,'' Woodruff said. ``It's a competitive news world out there,
and polls say Americans don't really care. But Clinton is the
president, this is the Constitution and they are the Congress.
There was no way we could ignore this.''
</P>
<P>
   All-news cable networks, such as CNN and MSNBC, went
gavel-to-gavel and saw their ratings soar. But they were small
ratings to begin with, so the increase didn't represent a
groundswell of interest. Whenever the broadcast networks ditched
programming in favor of the daily dronings in the House and Senate,
viewers either tuned out or went ballistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you go into soap operas, people are going to call the
network's switchboard or the local stations,'' said Lane Venardos,
executive producer of special events for CBS News. ``Short of
somebody taking a shot at the pope, people don't want to know about
it. They're comfortable hearing about it on the evening newscast.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ABC, CBS and NBC covered at least some of the
House and Senate proceedings every day. When the Senate trial
began, they all covered the opening arguments. And everybody plans
to cover the final Senate votes. Over the past couple of weeks,
however, network airtime has diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant battle between what we think the public ought
to know and what we think they want to know,'' Venardos said.
``It's not always an easy call, but we've tended to come down on
less is more and save our ammo for what we think is really
important.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, CBS aired almost two hours of coverage Saturday,
figuring the video excerpts of Monica Lewinsky's testimony in the
Senate would stir some interest. But the network decided against
live coverage of Monday's closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the closing argument truly is a regurgitation of
what has been on before,'' Venardos said.
</P>
<P>
   When the impeachment wagon began rolling last summer, TV news
was on board with minimal audience. A January poll from the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press indicated only a small
number of people are still interested. A New York Times poll a
couple of weeks ago found that only 19 percent of Americans are
following the story.
</P>
<P>
   Interest or no interest, news executives determined the story
had to be covered, and impeachment dominated all of TV news. It
might have waxed and waned had it not been for cable news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even 19 percent is more than enough to fuel and expand ratings
for 24-hour cable news,'' said Rich Noyes, media analyst for the
Center for Media and Public Affairs. ``When the story was about to
ebb naturally, cable kept it going with more interviews and
newsgathering, and that gave the networks something to report as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN's Woodruff said she asked herself all year if her team was
overplaying the story because of the sex angle but decided,
overall, CNN handled it ``pretty well.'' CBS's Venardos, who
admitted that if the audience had wanted more, the network would
have done more, also pronounced his network's performance ``pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall I do think there's been a huge effort to be balanced
and fair,'' said Noyes. ``That's easier to do when the story is
generating its own events. When there's a lull in the story, there
tends to be more speculation than reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   People have a tendency to blame the messenger, and the
impeachment story was no exception. Polls show that the public's
disapproval of the way politicians handled the situation in
Washington was mirrored by disapproval of the media's coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the public, especially that large segment of the
public that wants this to go away, has hardened its attitudes about
the media,'' Noyes said. ``But you can't really criticize them for
cover a major story like impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Venardos is philosophical about the public's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right down there with used car salesmen anyway,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, what would TV news do differently?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the press can be very proud of the mob scene
around (White House secretary) Betty Currie at her home,'' Woodruff
said. ``I think the press as a group has got to figure out better
ground rules for dealing with people who are suddenly thrust into
the public eye like that. I'm not sure what the answer is, but we
do need to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fitting final chapter comes later this month when Lewinsky
sits for her exclusive talk with Barbara Walters. No politicians,
no partisan politics. People probably will watch that one.

CLINTON LAUNCHING FUND-RAISING CAMPAIGN FOR DEMOCRATIC HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: New material throughout)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL And JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House, trying to douse a political
firestorm on the eve of the Senate's vote on impeachment, denied
Thursday that President Clinton is launching a campaign of
ballot-box revenge designed to oust House Republicans who
masterminded his impeachment in the House.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said Republicans'
narrow margin of control in the House is the sole motivation behind
a stepped-up White House drive to defeat Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are within a handful of seats of regaining the House,''
Lockhart said. ``That's enough incentive to go out and work hard
for Democrats around this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to launch a nine-city fund-raising campaign in San
Francisco on Feb. 25 to raise money for Democratic efforts to
reclaim control of the House and Senate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., condemned the
planned campaign of revenge as described in Thursday's editions of
the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is deeply troubling that the president views closure of
this constitutional process as an opportunity for revenge,'' said
Lott, who has coordinated the first Senate impeachment trial of a
president since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, said Americans will wonder
whether Clinton has ``the people's business on the nation's agenda
or whether it is a vendetta.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, one of the 13 House members who
served as prosecutors in Clinton's Senate impeachment trial,
condemned the reported campaign of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States, arguably the most powerful
man in the world, has declared a personal vendetta against the
House managers, stating his will to single them out for
destruction,'' Cannon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who talks about ending the politics of personal
destruction, while dispatching his agents and pledging to destroy
people,'' Cannon added.
</P>
<P>
   Another House prosecutor, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., issued a
statement saying the reported threats ``are part of the course,
from a White House that has turned the politics of personal
destruction into an art form.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman did not specifically deny that the president
was angry with the 13 House prosecutors, led by House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart said Clinton's motivation for working hard to elect
Democrats was his desire to see Democrats retake control of the
House that was lost to the GOP in 1994 for the first time in 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is very committed to working hard over the next
year and a half to help Democrats retake the House and the
Senate,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   With the margin of control in the House so tight, ``We think,
with the president helping to raise resources and articulating a
very positive and forward-looking message, that we can retake the
House,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said a White House campaign of revenge would be
ill-advised. ``I can't think of a worse, more dumb, strategy than
going after people based on whether they were a House manager or
not,'' Lockhart said, adding that most House managers have been
elected without opposition from safe seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go out, do the best we can at articulating a
message, and do it based on where we think we can win seats, in
cooperation with the Democrats on the Hill,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance in San Francisco in late February will be
the first of a series of appearances on behalf of ``Majority
2000,'' a drive to raise $9 million in 1999 to help Democrats gain
the six seats they need to take control of the 435-member House,
said Eric Smith, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the event in San Francisco will be used by House
Democrats and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to
recruit strong candidates, provide campaign support and plan
campaign advertising.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the event in San Francisco was the only event
scheduled so far by the House Democrats' campaign organization, led
by Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., son of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass.,
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led House voted two articles of impeachment
against Clinton on Dec. 19. The Senate is expected to vote Friday
to acquit the president of perjury and obstruction of justice
charges in connection with the sex-and-cover-up scandal involving
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's goal is the same as before _ to elect
Democrats who can help enact the Democrats agenda to protect Social
Security, strengthen education and expand health care,'' said Barry
Toiv, White House deputy press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, embroiled in the Lewinsky sex scandal last fall, helped
the Democratic party alone raise $53.4 million last year at a
series of invitation-only fund raisers.
</P>
<P>
   But the president kept his public campaigning on behalf of
candidates to a minimum, in an effort to avoid injecting the
scandal into local congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's stepped up commitment follows a decision by House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., to forego a threatened
challenge of Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 2000. Gephardt is in line to be the next speaker, if
the Democrats win control of the House.

`STEPHEN KING'S STORM OF THE CENTURY': A BLIZZARD BLOWS COLD
HORROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A white-haired little old lady sits sipping tea and watching the
Weather Channel describe a ferocious blizzard about to hit her tiny
island off the Maine coast. A stranger strides up to her door. He
looks like a local fisherman, in a pea coat and knit cap, but
carries a walking stick topped by a silver wolf's head.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first snowflakes have fallen in ``Stephen King's
Storm of the Century,'' the man bashes her head in with the stick,
whose wolf's head can come alive, then sits calmly finishing her
tea and singing ``I'm a Little Teapot.'' And that just hints at the
stranger's mysterious personality and power.
</P>
<P>
   As chilling and gripping as any Stephen King film since Stanley
Kubrick's classic movie of ``The Shining,'' this six-hour
miniseries works the way the most enduring horror tales do,
stretching back to Edgar Allan Poe: by blending supernatural events
with purely human psychological terror.
</P>
<P>
   The first King work written directly for television (the
just-published novel followed), ``Storm of the Century'' includes
knowing echoes of ``The Shining'' and of Shirley Jackson's story
``The Lottery.'' Nervous laughter is also built in, and jumpy
viewers can use every bit of it.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Anderson (Tim Daly) is the everyman hero, with a wife
and small son, who runs the local grocery and moonlights as the
town constable. He arrests the stranger, who says his name is Andre
Linoge and announces with an enigmatic smile and eerily soothing
voice, ``Give me what I want and I'll go away.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one is leaving soon, and not only because this miniseries
stretches over three nights. Because of the storm, Little Tall
Island (the same setting as King's ``Dolores Claiborne'') is soon
cut off from all communication with the outside world. As the snow
piles up, King smartly piles on classic elements of terror: the
creepy isolation; the howling storm, so severe it topples the
lighthouse; the gradual revelation of dark secrets. The horror is
intensified because it flies from so many directions at once, from
the other world and the natural world, as well as from inner
demons.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the island's residents are crammed into the Town Hall
for shelter from the storm, but no one is safe from Linoge's
psychic powers. He knows, and casually announces, the townspeople's
secret sins: who is dealing drugs, who was with a prostitute when
his aged mother died calling his name.
</P>
<P>
   And Linoge makes people act unlike themselves, committing murder
and in one case suicide with an ax. ``I think it was the cane with
the wolf's head that made me do it,'' one person says, the truth
slowly dawning after Linoge's effect has worn off.
</P>
<P>
   The series' first two episodes are paced for maximum suspense,
as every out-of-focus object in the background comes to seem
ominous. Despite the tale's violence, the most gruesome scenes take
place off camera.
</P>
<P>
   The actors' thick Maine accents are strained, but before long
they stop being a distraction. In a role without flourishes, Daly
is called on to be straightforward. He is supported by a cast of
equally solid actors, notably Casey Siemaszko as his faithful but
less mentally agile deputy, and Jeffrey DeMunn as the
self-important, cowardly town manager.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all is Colm Feore's insinuating, understated performance
as Linoge, whose unblinking eyes and seductive voice make his words
all the more terrifying. King offers playful clues about Linoge,
some meaningful and others red herrings: Linoge's odd name suggests
a hidden meaning; he looks a bit like Constable Anderson; he makes
a point of talking to Anderson's little boy.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of episode two, the townspeople have a collective
dream, played out on screen, that is one of the most haunting of
all Stephen King images. It's too bad that the next, final
installment is the weakest. In episode three we discover what
Linoge wants. His request cleverly forces the townspeople to choose
between two impossible evils, and adds a deeper moral issue to the
supernatural plot. Still, the episode feels padded and talky, when
it should move swiftly toward the end.
</P>
<P>
   And the episodes are parceled out badly from a viewer's
perspective, however deliberate a programming stunt ABC is pulling.
The first installments appear Sunday and Monday; then there is a
gap before the third arrives Thursday, pitting the miniseries'
final hour against George Clooney's last episode of ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the last installment of ``Storm of the Century'' feels
stretched out, it is worth getting to the very end of the
miniseries. It comes with a terrific kicker about the aftereffects
of the storm. Stephen King may be our master of horror; no one ever
called him the master of the happy ending.

 &HT;    King up to some old tricks in chilling `Storm'

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got to give the devil his due, and Stephen King does, in
``Storm of the Century,'' a six-hour miniseries that will whip
through you like serious wind chill.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Linoge, the very bad guy at the center of ``Storm,'' is
not literally the devil, but he's far beyond human in his
supernatural powers and the depths of his evil, as a whole townful
of people find out over three nights. The folks in Little Tall
Island, off the coast of Maine, pride themselves on being
close-knit, with no secrets among them, just two of the notions
Linoge will shatter during his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a huge snowstorm is blowing in, he shows up, a man with
an unnerving stare, an unwavering purpose and a walking stick with
a silver wolf's head. His first act is to bludgeon an old lady to
death, then write on her walls in blood, ``Give me what I want and
I'll go away.'' Arrested and stuck in the town's small jail, he
refuses to say what it is he's after (that comes in Part 3).
</P>
<P>
   To get what he wants, he softens up the locals by mentally
taking control of some of them _ infiltrating their dreams, driving
some to grisly suicide, others to murder _ all while sitting in his
cell. Those whom he doesn't drive mad, he divulges their dirty
secrets, so that by the time he tells them what he wants, they're
so spooked they'll give him practically anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's holding who prisoner here?'' wonders a deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of King's work, repetition is key to building the mood
(``Hell is repetition,'' Linoge warns), with the children's song
``I'm a Little Teapot'' a particular harbinger of impending
ugli-ness. There's also the ``give me what I want'' catch phrase,
endlessly repeated a la ``Redrum'' in ``The Shining.''
</P>
<P>
   And as usual, character is subordinate to plot, so that the good
townsfolk _ Tim Daly as the constable, Debrah Farentino as his wife
_ are more necessary than interesting: Somebody's got to suffer.
Linoge, however, is one of King's more memorable villains, the
darkness at the heart of ``Storm,'' and Colm Feore makes his calm
impassiveness as menacing as Hannibal Lecter's.
</P>
<P>
   But King is up to more than just saying boo; by the end, which
is bleaker than usual for the author, he's taken viewers into a
heart-breaking moral dilemma that makes ``Storm'' more than just
the story of a boogeyman in a blizzard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storm'' is the first mini King has written directly for TV (a
paperback of the screenplay is being released by Pocket Books), so
unlike ABC adaptations of, say, ``The Stand'' or ``The Shining,''
no King fans know where he's heading here. Some viewers may think
it takes him a little too long to get there _ six hours now feel
like a lifetime commitment to some people _ but there's hardly a
moment when you'll be tempted to turn it off.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike his ABC projects ``It'' and ``The Langoliers,'' both
of which fizzled out in the end with silly special-effects
monsters, there's no letdown at the end, just as there's no let-up
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ABC's scheduling adds a devilish twist that may
undercut some of ``Storm's'' popularity. Sunday's kickoff is up
against the most important ``The X-Files'' episode ever (surely
there are millions of King/``X-Files'' fans in common). Then, by
the end of Part Two on Monday, you'll be slavering to find out what
happens, but you'll have to wait three nights, until Thursday, for
the conclusion. Which, by the way, is opposite George Clooney's
final episode on ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider it a little extra level of hell you have to wade
through.

BOSTON SYMPHONY: BIG, BROAD IDEAS TO MATCH A MASTER'S RARE
GENEROSITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Boston Symphony paid one of its regular visits to
Carnegie Hall on Wednesday night. Advertised as Seiji Ozawa's 25th
anniversary as music director, it is a milestone cheered by some,
though others are restless for change. Here the program was solid
and straightforward: the Beethoven Violin Concerto with Anne-Sophie
Mutter and Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who follow music create in our memories identifying
images of different orchestras. The Boston sound that I think of
has brilliance without flash, and elegance without a trace of
coyness. At its best, this historic organization has played with a
glow and power that readily distinguished it from other American
orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the Beethoven on Wednesday one heard other things.
One was a certain weariness that no amount of professional
application to the duties at hand could disguise. The shine seemed
missing from the violin sections and at times communal intonation
soured ever so slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Here as in the Stravinsky, the Boston's winds and brass showed
what fine players they are. The clear, rich woodwinds spoke with
special empathy for this unusual bit of Beethoveniana. The Violin
Concerto is perhaps the least obsessive and most materially
generous of the great man's major pieces. The first movement, in
particular, moves at a stroll. Beethoven's parsimony _ the tight,
relentless grip on a few ideas _ relents; theme after theme pours
out. We know the major-minor shifts are coming, but they never fail
to take the breath away.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mutter, with her wonderful control of the instrument and
big, broad ideas, prefers grandeur to intimacy, and it is certainly
her right to do so. She is a master of extremes: breathless
pianissimos, ringing vibrato, striking ritards and accelerandos at
key moments. These are observations, not criticisms. Ms. Mutter's
bigness is never bloated; she sets a wider stage than most and then
proceeds to occupy it handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   The Stravinsky performance could have used Ms. Mutter's sense of
proportion. The brief melodic phrases were thick to the ear,
stretched and contracted with a kind of Stokowskian languor.
Everything else was simply loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rite of Spring'' is, of course, weighted away from
traditional orchestral string sound, but Ozawa's brass-heavy
balancing of instruments seemed specifically designed to obliterate
all competition while exploiting surface excitement for its own
sake. This great piece is more than cheap thrills. Ozawa made it
sound almost vulgar.

 &HT;    Washington's home gets a makeover
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 14.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man who was ``first in war, first in peace and first in the
hearts of his countrymen'' died Dec. 14, 1799. On Monday,
Presidents Day, the George Washington Bicentennial 1999 officially
begins at the newly furnished Mount Vernon, the Virginia home of
the first president.
</P>
<P>
   The home's new exhibition, ``Mount Vernon as It Was: Over 100
Objects From the World and Times of Washington,'' will feature
original Mount Vernon furnishings as well as 18th-century artifacts
and art _ but not his much-discussed false teeth. They are included
in the traveling exhibition ``Treasures From Mount Vernon: George
Washington Revealed.''
</P>
<P>
   The national tour of ``Treasures'' continues through Feb. 22,
moving to the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical
Gardens in San Marino, Calif., March 16-June 6. The exhibition will
return east in July for a three-month installation at the Virginia
History Society before moving to the Atlanta History Center Oct.
14-Jan. 6, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Vernon observance, which continues through Dec. 31,
includes special ``Only in 1999'' tours including 18th-century
characters. On the estate, guests will wear black armbands as they
retrace the steps of Washington's funeral procession, experience a
multimedia production called ``Washington Is No More,'' the new
Mount Vernon Museum and ``An American Celebration in Music''
concerts Friday and Saturdays. On Oct. 16-17, the U.S. Armed
Services present a tribute from air, land and sea, and on Dec. 18,
there will be a dramatic re-enactment of Washington's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Bicentennial hotel packages are offered in nearby Alexandria,
Washington's hometown. Call 1-800-296-1000. For details on ``Only
in 1999'' activities, call 703-780-2000 or check the Web sites

ISRAELI POLITICIANS URGE ULTRA-ORTHODOX LEADERS TO CANCEL SUNDAY
RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ An escalating conflict between religious and secular
Jews is expected to spill into the streets here on Sunday when a
mass prayer rally against the liberal Supreme Court faces a
counter-rally by non-religious Israelis who feel that democracy is
under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders worked unsuccessfully Thursday to persuade
religious leaders to cancel the prayer rally, which some feared
could turn violent. The police predicted at least 100,000
demonstrators, a loose coalition against ``the judicial
dictatorship'' including ultra-Orthodox Jews, religious Zionists
and Jewish settlers from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   President Ezer Weizman shuttled between rabbis and justices
Thursday, seeking to mediate this most recent flare-up in a
chronic, low-level war between religion and state in the Jewish
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if I can prevent bloodshed _ and there could be
bloodshed on Sunday _ it is my duty to do so,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged by a spate of recent decisions challenging the
principles and privileges of ultra-Orthodox Jews, religious leaders
issued a series of vitriolic attacks against the Supreme Court
judges this week. They escalated their rhetoric and called for the
rally in anticipation of a Supreme Court hearing next week on the
sensitive issue of conversion _ whether those who converted to
Judaism under non-Orthodox auspices should be recognized by the
state as Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of the Shas political
party, called the Supreme Court judges ``empty-headed and wanton
evil-doers'' who are ``unclean and desecrate the Sabbath.'' His
son, Rabbi David Yosef, described Chief Justice Aharon Barak as an
``enemy of Judaism.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in calling for the rally, Menachem Porush, a former member
of Parliament and head of the Orthodox Agudath Israel movement,
warned of a revolt if the Supreme Court continued to issue
``anti-Semitic decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the remarks, security was tightened on the Supreme
Court and the judges. And prosecutors began investigating whether
criminal charges of incitement should be brought against the
rabbis. Incitative speech is a very sensitive issue here since such
language governed the political climate in the months before
Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a religious militant in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that Chief Justice Barak is an enemy of the Jews is not
only a shame and a disgrace, but also borders on the criminal,''
said Edna Arbel, the state attorney. ``We do not want to take
people to court on matters of freedom of speech, but if these
expressions have a potential for violence, we will do so.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the religious neighborhood of Mea Shearim in Jerusalem, there
was concern about incitement, too, but against residents of the
community, not against the judges. Black and white posters
announcing Sunday's rally said, ``Incitement! Like never before, an
incitement campaign is being conducted against Judaism and the
Jewish heritage. And we remain silent?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel closed in and we feel attacked,'' explained Jonathan
Rosenblum, an Orthodox writer and a spokesman for Am Echad, an
Orthodox organization. ``There is a certain siege mentality. We
know that there's a resentment that we didn't disappear into
history. And indeed, the rally will be a kind of a
counter-statement that we haven't disappeared. That we are here, we
are many and we are not going away.''
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox groups believe the courts are interfering in religious
affairs by ruling on matters that they think should be decided by
Jewish law. The were infuriated by recent Supreme Court rulings
that the military deferment granted to Orthodox yeshiva students is
illegal and that the all-Orthodox religious councils should be
integrated with Reform and Conservative members.
</P>
<P>
   Also, lower courts have ruled that conversions performed by
non-Orthodox rabbis should be recognized, and that shops on
kibbutzes could open for business on Saturdays _ contradicting a
longstanding practice of keeping them closed out of respect for the
Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis see these decisions as critical affirmations of
the separation of religion and state at a time when the political
power of the ultra-Orthodox is increasing. And they see the battle
over these issues with the Orthodox as a fight over the very
character of Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court is one institution that they can't blackmail
or intimidate, and this institution enjoys extraordinary prestige
because it is independent,'' said Amnon Rubenstein, a member of
Parliament from the leftist Meretz Party. ``And they want to topple
this last bastion.''
</P>
<P>
   But even many who criticized the judicial activism of the
present Supreme Court recoiled at the verbal attacks on the
judiciary this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps some are unhappy with court decisions,'' said Dan
Tichon, speaker of the Israeli Parliament. ``But if things are
taken as far as breaking down the entire legal framework, this will
turn Israel into a lawless state, into anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting with the chief rabbis and the state's top
lawyers on Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he
would set up a ``national forum for dialogue'' between the
religious and the secular public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have to be very concerned at this flare-up,'' he said,
adding that a ``Kulturkampf,'' or culture war, is just a ``synonym
for the beginnings of a civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent rally that drew several thousand men in black hats
and black coats, the ultra-Orthodox protested the detention by the
police of three Hasidic men suspected of ransacking the apartment
of three Christian women who lived in Mea Shearim. Thursday, in
blood-red paint, a wall in that community was turned into a
memorial for the suspects, with candles lit beneath graffiti that
said: ``Here three religious men were kidnapped and taken to
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox school system plans to shut down on Sunday so
students can attend the afternoon rally, which will be held in a
plaza near the Jerusalem Convention Center at the entrance to the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The United Kibbutz Movement, student groups, civil rights
groups, Jerusalem civic groups and legal groups are busing in
members for the opposition rally, which will be much smaller and
will be held nearby, close to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Law schools throughout the country held seminars and protests
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Ariel Procaccia, dean of the Law School at Hebrew
University, called for an end to government financing of the
ultra-Orthodox movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are severing themselves from the basic Israeli social
contract,'' he said. ``And their institutions should therefore not
receive even a single cent.''

<P>
   Is it possible to find peace in our rapidly changing world,
arrayed as it is with pleasures and pains, distractions and
attractions? Can you be a part of the world, deal with its
complexity, and still find peace in your heart?
</P>
<P>
   Is it only in removing yourself from the world to some remote
mountaintop or desert that you can look upon your unperturbed heart
and find peace?
</P>
<P>
   Is peace possible only in a place where you never have to deal
with challenging people or situations? Or where there are no
conflicts, no annoyances, misunderstandings, needs, pressures or
disappointments?
</P>
<P>
   Or does the wise person find peace even amid the difficulties of
life by simply not allowing his heart to be touched by them?
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawing from the world either physically or emotionally does
not seem to be the wise person's path to eternal peace. We are
placed in this world to deal with it, not escape it; to integrate
ourselves with it, not separate into a fragment apart from it; and
to find a way to be of benefit and service to the world, not to
shun it or harden ourselves to it.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you are willing to be present in the world and
involved with it, the impact on your emotions may not always feel
peaceful. We have both positive and negative feelings in our
hearts, and our life experiences tend to stir up both. How, then,
is it possible to find peace within your heart?
</P>
<P>
   We tend to feel at peace when things are under control. And we
do the best we can to control or manage our lives according to our
ideas of order. But if inner peace depends on that control, your
peace of mind could frequently be at risk. Can you control the
economy or energy supplies? Another person's behavior or actions?
The choices and destinies of loved ones or others on whom you
depend?
</P>
<P>
   When you take a long, honest, and sincere look, there may be
very little outside yourself that you can control. Therefore, real
peace must be an inside job.
</P>
<P>
   A person is truly wise who knows that the heart is the place
where lasting peace may be found. The changeability from one day to
the next of your personal world, or the world at large, may make
outer things an unreliable source of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Try going away to that mountaintop, or to any place that seems
serene and carefree to you, and you can still find yourself
disturbed over something -- a memory, a concern about a current
situation, a fear about the future, or a mere gnat flying around --
if you fail to realize that peace dwells at the center of your
being.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of peace has nothing to do with the fluctuation of
life events that bring elation or grief with the passing of time.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it has to do with the state of being that may be found
within your heart of hearts, in the ``still point of the turning
world,'' of which the poet T. S. Eliot wrote, where you are one
with the very essence of life.
</P>
<P>
   Webster's Dictionary defines ``essence'' as the ``permanent as
contrasted with the accidental element of being; the real, or
ultimate nature of a thing, as opposed to its existence.''
</P>
<P>
   In the changing, often confusing fortunes of time when you know
and act from what seems to be essential, it is possible to
experience the peace of this unchanging state.
</P>
<P>
   When your world goes topsy-turvy and turmoil threatens, try this
exercise. Think about tranquility. Let the screen of your mind
reflect whatever the word ``tranquility'' may bring. A gentle
meadow in warm summer sunlight. A placid blue lake at dusk. A
fragile butterfly lightly touching a flower. Cool green woods with
sunlight filtering through the trees. A majestic snow-covered
mountain peak. A fisherman leaning against a tree nonchalantly
watching his float on a gently flowing river.
</P>
<P>
   It's your thought. Simply take a moment and become still.
Speaking softly to yourself, affirm that deep within you is a place
of complete tranquility. It is the secret place of the Most High,
where peace and tranquility reign supreme. Nothing -- no discord --
can enter here without your consent. And you choose peace. You may
turn often to this place within where you abide in the presence of
God. ``I am poised, serene, and peaceful!''
</P>
<P>
   Eliot wrote, ``At the still point, there the dance is.... Except
for the point, the still point, there would be no dance, and there
is only the dance.'' The dance of life continually shifts its
tempo, rhythm and form. As you move with it, you may find yourself
facing unimagined situations. This is the flow the dance often uses
to carry you beyond limited ideas of who you are and what you are
capable of handling.
</P>
<P>
   Practice looking within your heart, not for emotion but to
identify yourself with the still point of your essence and,
regardless of ``accidental elements'' existing around you, peace
can be found.

Making of a Landmark.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the 19th century, New Yorkers seemed to believe
that tearing down buildings was tantamount to progress. In 1812,
they even stood and watched the destruction of Federal Hall, at
Wall and Nassau Streets. This building had not only served as New
York City's second City Hall, it was also where George Washington
had taken his oath of office as president and where the first
Congress had met. It was arguably the nation's most historic
building.
</P>
<P>
   But when Federal Hall was torn down, an unknown hero clearly
believed that not all should go to the scrapheap, and salvaged a
piece of the railing from the balcony upon which Washington had
stood. This section of railing was installed at Bellevue Hospital
as a curiosity; now it is ensconced in today's Federal Hall, which
stands on the site of the original and is named in its honor.
</P>
<P>
   This act of salvage may qualify as the earliest on record for
New York City, and it may have started a trend. For during the 19th
century, while the city was reshaped, a movement of architectural
salvage took hold. Odd bits and pieces of the older structures _
gates, railings, sculpture panels, statues, columns, even whole
walls _ were saved from the wrecker's ball and incorporated in new
designs, usually to preserve links with the past, but also
frequently to save money.
</P>
<P>
   A result is a city rich in architectural salvage, with fragments
of buildings grafted onto others or standing alone, offering a
glimpse of what otherwise might have been lost to history.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some examples of where architectural salvage can be
found in New York:
</P>
<P>
   Any seeker of architectural salvage should make a pilgrimage to
Our Lady of Lourdes Roman Catholic Church, built in 1904 on 142nd
Street between Amsterdam and Convent Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   The church contains stones that were salvaged from three
structures demolished at the turn of the century, and that were
purchased, according to the Rev. Joseph McMahan, the parish's first
priest, ``at a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   The front of the church and its east wall, both Venetian Gothic
in style, originally played a secular role. They came from a
building that occupied the northwest corner of Fourth Avenue at
23rd Street, home to the National Academy of Design for about 35
years. When the building was destroyed, McMahan picked up the
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The squat, curved newels flanking the steps of Our Lady were
salvaged from the mansion of A.T. Stewart, who in 1846 founded
Stewart's, the city's first department store, on Broadway at
Chambers Street. By the 1860s, Stewart had made so much money that
he was the city's wealthiest resident. To flaunt some of that
wealth, he had a house built in 1867 on the northwest corner of
Fifth Avenue at 34th Street, where it stood in overblown opulence
until it was torn down to make way for a bank. McMahan picked up
more pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The north wall of Our Lady, in the rear of the church, is a
Gothic Revival beauty that was originally the east wall of St.
Patrick's Cathedral, designed by James Renwick Jr. The wall dates
from the opening of the cathedral in 1879, and once overlooked
Madison Avenue. It was removed to make way for the Lady Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   St. Peter's Gates
</P>
<P>
   One of the city's most venerable manifestations of architectural
salvage is at St. Peter's Church at 344 W. 20th St., in Chelsea,
built in 1838. This is the church of Clement Clarke Moore
(1779-1863), the Greek and biblical scholar best known for writing
``The Night Before Christmas'' for his children.
</P>
<P>
   Moore gave the land for St. Peter's and designed the parish seal
(a Greek temple on a rock), and his name appears on the original
architectural plans. According to those plans, the church was to
have been in the form of a Greek temple, a notion that was
abandoned. Instead, Moore and the architect James W. Smith decided
on a Gothic style, more akin to the design of the parish churches
of Britain than to the then-popular pagan Greek.
</P>
<P>
   Historians have long believed that Moore helped St. Peter's
obtain its iron railings and gates, originally from Trinity Church,
on Broadway at Wall Street. He was on good terms with the vestry of
Trinity; St. Peter's was a parish of that church. And he no doubt
knew that by the late 1830s that the church housing Trinity was in
such bad physical shape that its wardens knew they should tear it
down before it fell down.
</P>
<P>
   But though the building was crumbling, the railings and gates,
dating from 1829, were sound. Because Trinity was wealthy enough to
order new gates to go with its new building, it presented its old
gates to St. Peter's in 1840, and they have stood there ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Research by Dino Valaoritis, of the architectural firm of Gerald
Allen &AMP; Jeffrey Harbinson, unearthed the information that this was
not Trinity's first gift of a fence and gates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1829, Trinity gave an older set to St. Mary's Church on 126th
Street in Manhattanville, but those are long gone.

INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW MAY BE VICTIM OF IMPEACHMENT DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel law, up for renewal this
summer, may be headed for a quick death as Democrats upset about
Kenneth Starr's investigation into President Clinton join
Republicans who remember investigations of GOP presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that each side has had a taste of what this law can do, I
don't know how much support there will be to save the statute,''
said Sen. Fred Thompson, chairman of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Thompson announced that his committee would hold
hearings in late February on how the frequently-amended statute,
which expires June 30, has worked since it was passed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   He said that those in favor of the independent counsel law would
be given the chance to make their case, but that ``they will have
their work cut out for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not sure this law can be fixed,'' said Thompson,
R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans opposed the law when it was passed in the wake
of the Watergate scandal, during which President Richard M. Nixon
ordered the dismissal of special prosecutor Archibald Cox over his
refusal to drop a subpoena for Nixon's incriminating White House
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Cox was working under a special appointment from Attorney
General Elliot Richardson. Nixon's order that the attorney general
fire Cox resulted in the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' _ Richardson's
resignation and the dismissal of his top deputy as well as Cox _
and triggered the drive for Nixon's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The law was designed to insulate investigations of presidents
and high-level Cabinet officials from political pressure and to
take the responsibility for such probes out of the hands of the
attorney general, who is appointed by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage over Starr's more than four years of investigating
Clinton was mirrored during the Reagan administration when
Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh's lengthy probe into the
Iran-contra affair _ in which some proceeds of arms sales to Iran
were used to help Nicaraguan rebels _ drew harsh criticism from
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   During the Reagan and Bush administrations, congressional
Republicans complained that the statute permitted independent
counsels to conduct politically-inspired investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans almost didn't renew the law in 1993, but the
newly elected Clinton lobbied for the law and won.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1994, a three-judge federal court panel appointed Starr
to investigate Clinton's dealing in the Arkansas land development
project known as Whitewater. Since then, Democrats has repeated
many of the criticisms of the independent counsel voiced earlier by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one issue on which the Republicans were right, and we
were wrong,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said. ``The
independent counsel statute is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Justice Department officials acknowledged that
Attorney General Janet Reno has taken steps toward a full-scale
investigation of alleged misconduct by Starr's office. The
department is looking into several points arising from Starr's
handling of the Monica Lewinsky matter, including alleged
misconduct in immunity talks with Lewinsky and potential unethical
contacts with the lawyers handling Paula Jones' sexual harassment
suit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement provided Democrats more ammunition for their
attacks on both Starr and the independent counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard a lot about the rule of law recently,'' Sen. Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa, said. ``How does that apply to Ken Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., one of the authors of the law and a
member of the Government Affairs Committee, placed much of the
blame for Congress' antagonism toward the independent counsel law
on Starr, who he says overstepped the statute's authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starr has made a mockery of the independent counsel process,''
Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of Republicans say that if the independent counsel
law is allowed to expire, it will be the fault of the attorney
general, not Starr. They say her refusal to request a special
prosecutor to investigate possible campaign finance violations by
the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign shows that the law is ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said Reno's decision, which she made over the objections
of FBI Director Louis Freeh and the head of her own task force
investigating the campaign finance issue, ``put the nail in the
coffin'' of the independent counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress will fight to save the law, saying that
while flawed, the statute is necessary to ensure that
investigations of presidents and their administrations are fair and
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Levin concedes that the law needs to be ``radically reformed''
to ``rein in the independent counsel,'' if it is to be renewed. He
has suggested placing time limits on independent counsel
investigations to prevent ``endless'' probes into administration
officials.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., introduced a bill in January that would
severely limit the powers of future independent counsels. Dickey's
bill would, among other things:
</P>
<P>
   _ Give the attorney general more power to investigate
allegations before requesting an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Require that the scope of the investigation be narrowly set.
</P>
<P>
   _ Require special prosecutors to have their budgets approved
after two years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bar independent counsels from practicing privately while
serving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we continue the way we are going with independent counsels,
we risk losing the support of America,'' Dickey said in a letter to
the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But some members of Congress say reform measures may not be
enough to save the statute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden is really on the proponents of the law right now,''
Thompson said. ``They need to show us why it's worth the trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been at least 20 independent counsels appointed in
the last 20 years. Presidents, Cabinet members and other officials
have been their targets. Total costs of these investigations now
stand at more than $133 million.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Starr's ongoing investigation of Clinton, there are four
independent counsels at work investigating four current or former
members of his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress doesn't renew the act, such investigations would be
handled by the Justice Department. The attorney general would have
the authority to turn an investigation over to a special prosecutor
in the manner followed in the Watergate probe of Nixon.

 NEW YORK: long gone.

   Stately Scraps for Scholars
</P>
<P>
   Columbia University's campus is probably the champion for
winding up with peripatetic gates _ four pairs in all.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the pairs were originally part of the entrance to the
grounds of the North Dutch Church, which stood on the corner of
Fulton and William Streets from 1769 until 1875. Columbia held some
of its commencements in that church _ a plaque on one gate at its
new location honors the commencement of 1809 _ and Alexander
Hamilton, a student at Columbia when it was still King's College,
is said to have clung to one of the gates while giving an anti-Tory
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Moved to Columbia in 1938, two pairs of the church's gates flank
the campus' St. Paul's Chapel, while the third is at the quadrangle
formed by the chapel and Avery, Schermerhorn and Fayerweather
Halls.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth pair of gates is believed to be original to the Deaf
and Dumb Asylum, which stood on the block bound by Madison and Park
Avenues between 49th and 50th Streets. Columbia occupied the
property as its second campus from 1857 to 1897, but the gates did
not make the trip to Morningside Heights until 1938, when they were
placed just west of the entrance of Hamilton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the period in between when the four pairs of
gates lost their buildings and arrived at Columbia? They spent that
time at Ringwood Manor, then the New Jersey estate of Abram S.
Hewitt and now Ringwood State Park. Hewitt, one of New York City's
original pack rats, made off with dozens of artifacts from
demolished buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbia, the four pairs of gates are a memorial to Hewitt,
Columbia College, class of 1842. He was a major player in the
creation of the Columbia University we know today, as well as a
major donor: Barnard College has a Hewitt Hall. Hewitt was also New
York City's mayor from 1887 to 1888 and a son-in-law of the
inventor and manufacturer Peter Cooper, but he is probably best
remembered as part of the hyphenated name of the Cooper-Hewitt
National Design Museum, a branch of the Smithsonian Institution in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Erskine Hewitt, the last Hewitt to live at Ringwood, gave the
estate to New Jersey in 1936 along with all of Abram Hewitt's
spoils, and he was instrumental in the state's gift of the gates to
Columbia in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Gutting the Gilded Age
</P>
<P>
   The gates to Central Park's Conservatory Garden and the
sculpture panels at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel don't appear to
have much in common, but they both come from the mansion of
Cornelius Vanderbilt II, which was perhaps the most visible of the
local Vanderbilt mansions, partly because it was the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1880, the 60-plus-room house occupied the northwest
corner of Fifth Avenue at 57th Street. By 1893, the house had been
extended west and north, and had swollen to 137 rooms. What had
been the front entrance on 57th Street was eclipsed by a new
entrance on 58th Street, where a fence with a pair of wrought-iron
gates that was manufactured by Bergotte &AMP; Bauviller of France
opened onto a driveway leading to a carriage porch.
</P>
<P>
   To decorate the porch, architect George B. Post commissioned the
sculptor Karl Bitter to execute six high-relief limestone sculpture
groups. But the building suffered the usual fate of dinosaurs, and
down came the mansion _ gates, porch and all _ to make way for
Bergdorf Goodman in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the sculpture groups were installed in the entranceway to
the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, which was being built at the time. One
of the panels shows a group of boys in procession carrying plumes;
the other shows a group of girls with musical instruments. Both,
perhaps symbolically, herald the arrival of guests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, one of the gates that had fronted on Grand Army Plaza
and some of the fence were installed at Central Park's Conservatory
Garden, at Fifth Avenue and 104th Street, a gift of Gertrude
Vanderbilt Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Railing at the Fates
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected place to find first-rate architectural salvage is
in architecturally undistinguished Public School 41, at 116 W. 11th
St., just west of the Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In the back, overlooking the playground, is a set of Gothic
Revival railings pulled from the wreckage of Rhinelander Gardens, a
row of houses designed by James Renwick Jr. that stood on the site
of today's school. The three-story houses were set back from the
street with gardens in front. Adding to their charm were terraces
running the length of the buildings, linked by wrought iron
railings. Most of the railings disappeared when the row was
demolished in the early 1950s, but one set was salvaged and
installed in the rear of the school in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   To view the railings firsthand you need a legitimate reason for
being on the school grounds. But you may glimpse the railings from
across the playground on Greenwich Avenue at Charles Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles Have Landed
</P>
<P>
   The pair of granite eagles flanking the steps to Grant's Tomb on
Riverside Drive at 122nd Street seem to fit there, like an elusive
piece of a jigsaw puzzle. But if you look at the eagles a second
time, you will notice they are both facing stage left, as if you
should be looking in that direction as well. No designer would have
done that intentionally. The eagles should be facing each other
like the eagles that architect John Duncan incorporated in the flat
pediment atop the cornice.
</P>
<P>
   Moved to Grant's Tomb in 1939, the eagles were originally
perched on pediments on the fifth floor of the General Post Office
in City Hall Park, a Second Empire pile that put every other
American version of that style to shame. The post office was only
five stories high, but the body of the building was 112 feet high,
with a 56-foot-high dome above that. The eagles were never designed
to be seen up close, nor were they meant to be seen from four
sides. Nevertheless, they look fine where they are, especially
since their tails are as carefully carved as their beaks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tomb needs some more dressing up. Duncan's winning
entry in the competition for the design of the tomb provided for
construction in stages because there was not enough money to go
whole hog. What was built was the basic tomb, with the planned
statuary groups and grand approach from the Hudson River put off
until more contributions had been raised. They never were.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice if the Post Office eagles were harbingers of
future statuary that, like the first robins of spring, would take
the architectural chill off the place.

 NEW YORK: the place.

   Last Exit for Brooklyn
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, the impressive steps leading to the portico of McKim,
Mead &AMP; White's neo-classical Brooklyn Museum on Eastern Parkway at
Washington Avenue were stripped away. The portico was left high and
dry, the harmonious balance of the composition was thrown out of
whack and a void cried out to be filled. Something was needed, and
statuary, like a pinch of salt, always adds zest, even if it
doesn't always save the dish.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Chester French's allegorical statues of Manhattan and
Brooklyn did what they could. The 20-ton statues had been placed at
the Manhattan Bridge to flank the Brooklyn entrance in 1916, but in
1963 they were placed in storage. In 1964, Brooklyn, complete with
a church to symbolize that borough's fame as the City of Churches,
and Manhattan, sitting with a strongbox to symbolize commercial
hegemony and a peacock to symbolize pride, were installed at the
museum on eight-foot stone pedestals to dress up the place a bit.
</P>
<P>
   A Just Solution
</P>
<P>
   When city officials decided in 1961 to widen the traffic lanes
on Centre Street by narrowing the sidewalk, an elaborate entrance
to the Hall of Records and Surrogate's Court building had to go.
The stairs vanished, but not the two statues that flanked them:
Philip Martiny's Justice and Authority turned up in the sculpture
niches on the portico of the New York County Courthouse on Foley
Square.
</P>
<P>
   Although the small scale of the statues had made sense at the
Hall of Records, it seemed that the Lilliputians were camping out
on the doorstep of the Brobdingnagians at the courthouse, a problem
that was mercifully rectified in 1997. With the coming of the new
U.S. Court House east of the county courthouse, a pleasant plaza
has been created between Pearl and Worth Streets where Justice and
Authority reside at an appropriate scale.
</P>
<P>
   Big Boy
</P>
<P>
   A bronze statue of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt by Ernst
Plassman, weighing four tons and standing 17 feet high, was
installed in 1869 atop the Hudson River Railroad freight warehouse.
The warehouse stood on the site of St. John's Park, just south of
Canal Street on Varick, where there is now an exit from the Holland
Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   As the central figure in a 31-foot-high-by-150-foot-long tableau
depicting railroads and steamboats, the statue had to be big to
play its role. At the time, it was the largest cast in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1920s, the freight station was obsolete, and down it came
to make way for an automobile plaza for the Holland Tunnel. So in
1929, the statue was placed standing in solitary splendor
overlooking the automobile viaduct that rings Grand Central
Terminal. This is an appropriate place because Vanderbilt created
the railroad that built the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, few people see the statue except from a speeding
automobile, and few drivers slow down enough to glance at it. But
pedestrians may view it close up. There are entrances to the
roadway from the Met Life Building (formerly the Pan Am Building),
from the Grand Hyatt Hotel and from the terminal. But caveat
viewer: drivers have a way of regarding pedestrians as interlopers.
</P>
<P>
   Not Bound for Glory
</P>
<P>
   Only a few fragments are left to remind us of the glory that was
the original Pennsylvania Station. Bits of the station are
scattered about the countryside. There is some statuary in the
sculpture garden of the Brooklyn Museum of Art but closer to their
original home are a pair of eagles flanking the Seventh Avenue
entrance to 2 Penn Plaza. Unlike the statuary in the sculpture
garden, these reminders of past glories seem conspicuously out of
place amid the modernism of the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The last of Penn Station's salvage are six of the bronze
torchiers that used to light the general waiting room. They were
installed at the head of the steps in front of the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine on Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street. The lamps
originally had eight heads in a classical Roman style, but they
were given triple heads in a Gothicized style to harmonize with the
cathedral, and they looked perfectly at ease in that guise.
</P>
<P>
   But now these lamps are back in storage. The northernmost one
was toppled in a major windstorm about 10 years ago. The other five
were soon deemed unsound because their supporting lead pipe had
corroded, said the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, dean emeritus of
St. John's, and so were removed as a safeguard.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Penn Station, New York's own Caracalla Baths and
Brandenburg Gate rolled into one, lies somewhere in New Jersey's
Meadowlands, where it was dumped after the station was torn down in
1963.
</P>
<P>
   The new Pennsylvania Station concourse that will be built within
the General Post Office, directly across Eighth Avenue from the
demolished station, will incorporate some of the lost and found
treasures from the vanished landmark.
</P>
<P>
   A Light to Remember
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, a small copper tower shaped like a lighthouse was built
on the roof of the Seamen's Church Institute, which stood on South
Street at Coenties Slip. The tower did not function as a
lighthouse, although it had a light. It did have a practical
purpose, however: A ball atop the tower dropped down a pole to
signal noon to ships in the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   But the lighthouse was primarily designed to serve a higher
calling as a memorial for those who died on the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   After the Seamen's building came down in 1968, the lighthouse
was moved to Pearl and Fulton Streets, where it is now an
entranceway to the South Street Seaport. But in its new home, the
light, so far, has failed.
</P>
<P>
   Born Again
</P>
<P>
   The porch on St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue, between
50th and 51st Streets, was not created for the present church but
for the former St. Bartholomew's, which was built in 1876 and stood
on Madison Avenue at 44th Street. Curiously, the porch, designed by
Stanford White, had not been planned as an integral part of that
structure, but was added by the Vanderbilts as a memorial to
Cornelius Vanderbilt II in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Since the porch honored a Vanderbilt and had been underwritten
by the Vanderbilts, the vestry did not wish to alienate the family
by leaving it behind when the old church was demolished and the
congregation moved to Park Avenue in 1917. So the porch came along,
and, indeed, was the linchpin to the design of the new church.
</P>
<P>
   At both sites, White's design, with its neo-Romanesque features
_ sumptuous arches of limestone, glowing panels of Egyptian
porphyry and doors of cast bronze _ has been an elegant setting for
the comings and goings of the congregation.

 NEW YORK: the congregation. 
  &HT;    Still Hammering Away &HT;    A statue of Minerva and the bell ringers Stuff and Guff
originally stood on the cornice of the Herald Building on 35th
Street between Sixth Avenue and Broadway. The newspaper, whose
presence gave rise to the name of the square, moved in the 1920s
and the statues were put in storage.
 &HT;    By 1940, they were returned to their old neighborhood, this time
within a granite niche designed by the New York City Parks
Department architect Aymer Embury II in Herald Square. After all
this time, Stuff and Guff's hammers still regularly miss the bell
by about three inches. The bell is struck from behind by a hidden
mallet, which has never stopped Stuff and Guff from doggedly
swinging away.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Dry-Docked
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Soon after the Normandie burned and sank at Pier 88 in 1942, the
United States Customs Service started auctioning off articles found
in the wreckage.
 &HT;    Msgr. Mansour Stephen of Our Lady of Lebanon, whose congregation
had acquired the Brooklyn Heights church at Remsen and Henry
Streets that had originally been the Church of the Pilgrims, wanted
to fill his new church with beautiful things. Among his purchases
in 1945 was a $1,025 pair of bronze doors from the Normandie's
banquet room and another set of doors, this one with 10 medallions,
for $975. The Normandie was a French liner, so nine of the
medallions show Norman cities, and one shows a sister ship, the Ile
de France.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A Well-Heeled Gypsy
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Tiffany's statue of Atlas, which the jeweler has come to revere
as an icon, is in the running for New York's oldest established
floating statue. Carved from wood and coated in bronze, with feet
of lead for balance, the statue was installed in 1853 over the main
entrance to Tiffany &AMP; Co., then at 550 Broadway. Tiffany moved
uptown to Union Square in 1870, to 37th and Fifth in 1905, and
finally to 57th and Fifth in 1940. Atlas has accompanied the
jewelry store on each move, and hasn't shrugged yet.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Old School Tie
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Founders' Memorial, the Gothic Revival finial at Schwartz Plaza
between Bobst Library and Shimkin Hall at New York University, is
one of four finials that adorned the main entrance to the original
University of the City of New York, today's NYU.
 &HT;    Built on the east side of Washington Square in 1837, the
original building was torn down in the 1890s, when the college
moved to University Heights in the Bronx. One of the building's
finials followed, and was dedicated as the Founders' Memorial on
the Bronx campus in 1894. When NYU left that campus, the memorial
returned to the Washington Square area and was set up on Fourth
Street in 1973. It was erected at its present site in 1994.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Serving a Long Sentence
 &HT;    
 &HT;    One of Britain's infamous jails during the American Revolution
was the Rhinelander Sugar House, a warehouse near the site of
today's Police Plaza, east of the Municipal Building at Centre
Street. When the Sugar House was torn down in the 1890s, a barred
window was salvaged and set into the facade of the Rhinelander
Building, then on the site of Police Plaza, as a memorial to
patriots who died in the prison.
 &HT;    When the Rhinelander Building was in turn torn down in the early
1970s, the window was salvaged yet again and set into a plain brick
wall just east of the Municipal Building's southern arcade, to
stand as a chillingly lonely monument. (Another window from the
Sugar House was installed as a memorial not far from the Van
Cortlandt Mansion in the Bronx at the turn of the century.)
 &HT;    Other relics from the Rhinelander Building, these indigenous to
it, are five Ionic columns from the facade. They were originally
placed in surrealistic isolation on the plaza at Pearl and Madison
Streets, but have since been handsomely reconfigured to define two
walls of a seating area along Madison Street between Pearl Street
and the Avenue of the Finest.
 &HT;    Viewing these objects, like viewing almost all things
architectural, is free, and you can see them any time you're in the
neighborhood. They're a gift. And priceless.

CENSURE CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beyond voting on the question of removing President Clinton from
office, the Senate can and should take one useful action before
ending this tortuous impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate should pass a strong resolution of censure, one
crafted to win as large a bipartisan vote as possible.
</P>
<P>
   History would thereby be advised to focus on Clinton _ to view
this sad chapter as caused, essentially, by his misdeeds. If,
instead, the Senate insists on partisan action following on the
partisan impeachment votes in the House, history will likely view
the episode as essentially a failed political attack by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats would welcome that result. But the fact is that
Clinton behaved abominably for an entire year and should be held to
account. The House votes to impeach him cannot be erased. What the
Senate can add is a reflection of the national sense that Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and his attempts to hide it from
the public and investigators were both wrong.
</P>
<P>
   No censure resolution will please those at the extremes. Some
Republicans feel that Clinton has betrayed his family and office
inexcusably and undermined the rule of law so fundamentally that
his continuation in office is a national tragedy. Some Democrats
feel that Clinton's misbehavior was a private matter between
consenting adults and became entangled in the legal system only
through a right-wing vendetta. They will never agree.
</P>
<P>
   But attempts to block censure by a rules challenge or filibuster
would be divisive and counter-productive. A large majority of the
Senate should support a resolution of condemnation, one that does
not try to do too much. It should not seek to declare Clinton
guilty of crimes without actually saying so. It should not attempt
to impose a fine. It should not seek an admission by Clinton. And
it should not protect Clinton from the normal courts. Each of these
goals is beyond the Senate's purview. Each would subtract votes
from the broad support needed to write a censure of President
Clinton into the history books.

TIME FOR A LITTLE GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It can take more character to exhibit grace in the
exhilaration of victory than in humiliating defeat, but that is
what is required now of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Restraint and strength of character are not qualities often
associated with this president. But he does have a reputation for
rising to the occasion when he's really on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's reaction will set the political tone for the rest of
his administration, either fueling the frenzy of his defeated House
adversaries or beginning the process of healing the partisan furies
that have swirled about him since his 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
   The impromptu pep rally of Democratic congressional supporters
at the White House following the Dec. 19 House impeachment vote
struck many voters as too harsh and hollow. At a moment of grave
seriousness, it may have bolstered Clinton's morale but it was not
the right message to send the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is searching for the narrow path between personal
contrition and pragmatic confrontation of the political struggles
ahead to advance his national agenda. Retaliation and revenge, if
there is to be any, must be left to others.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of how not to proceed, Clinton has before him the
case of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose allies refuse to
concede any wrongdoing by their hero and are still furious that he
was deposed.
</P>
<P>
   They are in full cry since the Internal Revenue Service ruled
recently that a private foundation which sponsored a college course
Gingrich taught had not violated the tax laws. The result of the
IRS probe of the Progress and Freedom Foundation suggests that
Gingrich did not illegally use tax-exempt money to spread political
propaganda disguised as college lectures, one of the allegations
against him.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS investigation stemmed from a House ethics committee
probe of the speaker's college course. The ethics committee
concluded that Gingrich had engaged in a lengthy pattern of
``disregard and lack of respect for the standards of conduct'' that
a congressman should follow.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich in effect made a plea bargain to settle the ethics case
before the House could pass judgment on the harshest charge, which
was whether he deliberately or inadvertently lied to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, saw the IRS
ruling as a reason to demand an apology from congressional
Democrats for making ``trumped-up charges'' against Gingrich. He
particularly cited Democratic Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., who had
filed the original ethics complaints against Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Bryce Dustman and Peter Roff, officers of GOPAC, a political
action committee Gingrich headed for nearly a decade, joined the
chorus by attacking liberals whose complaints they felt amounted to
``a left- wing harangue.'' They called congressional Democrats
``partisan, hate-mongering hypocrites'' for not going along with
Gingrich's agenda to dump the ``liberal welfare state'' on the
``ash heap of history.''
</P>
<P>
   This is pure ideological rubbish. What's to apologize for?
</P>
<P>
   The narrow decision by the IRS did not exonerate Gingrich of all
the ethics violations found by the House. His allies' bombast is a
pitiful attempt to re-write history and will only confirm to
sensible souls how right it was to oppose him.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich agreed to pay a fine of $300,000 to compensate for the
cost of the House investigation into various alleged ethics
violations, including providing material that Gingrich ``knew or
should have known was inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich never admitted to actually lying, any more than Clinton
has. Among other things, however, he had told the committee in
writing that GOPAC had nothing to do with his college course,
although it had paid at one point for satellite broadcasts of the
course material.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich agreed to pay the fine to avoid the possibility the
ethics committee would censure him or force him out of office. And
he did admit to bringing ``discredit'' on the House by failing to
get legal advice about the financing of his college course and by
furnishing ``untrue'' information to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, Gingrich didn't accept responsibility for his
problems but blamed them on his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions were described by committee chairman Nancy
Johnson, a Connecticut Republican, as ``tough and unprecedented.''
Other committee members complained that Gingrich was trying to
minimize the charges against him, portraying it all as just another
day in the political park.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich resigned after Democrats picked up House seats in the
November election and his own troops threatened to turn against
him. He has paid the fine.
</P>
<P>
   But if he ever wants to return to politics, he ought to lay off
the recriminations and make nicey-nicey. And that's what Clinton
ought to do as well, for the good of his party, his country and Al
Gore.

 &HT;    Florida citrus growers try to contain canker
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Fresh from two years of battling Mediterranean
fruit flies, Florida's citrus growers were rocked this week by the
discovery of deadly canker in a commercial grove in one of the
state's top citrus-growing counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If left unchecked, it's a devastating disease,'' said Florida
Agriculture Department spokesman Terence McElroy. ``It's obviously
alarming to our growers, but with a little luck we can contain
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak occurred in Hendry County, southwest of Lake
Okeechobee, which has more citrus trees than any other Florida
county. Officials believe the disease may have been spread by
agricultural workers or machinery brought in from Miami-Dade and
Broward counties, where scientists have been battling a canker
outbreak in backyard trees for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we find canker it's serious, but when it enters a
commercial grove it's more so,'' said Lisa Backman, a spokeswoman
for Florida Citrus Mutual, a trade group representing 12,000
growers. ``Canker is probably the most serious threat of all to our
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the only way to kill the bacteria and stop its
spread is by destroying trees.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, Florida growers have successfully battled
Mediterranean fruit flies, which infested several counties near
Tampa in 1997. A massive campaign of aerial pesticide spraying
brought the flies under control.
</P>
<P>
   While growers don't have to cut down trees to fight the
Medflies, the spraying outraged many urban residents, some of whom
reported medical reactions to the malathion chemical used to kill
the flies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits were threatened, and many residents have vowed to renew
their opposition if spraying is used again in fields near their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   State officials hope to avoid more controversy by early
detection of the flies, which lay eggs in the fruit, rendering it
unmarketable. They have stepped up monitoring efforts by putting
out millions of fly traps and hiring dozens of new inspectors to
check the traps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've also spent $6 million to $7 million releasing billions
of sterile male flies so that if there are any females in the wild,
they hopefully won't reproduce,'' McElroy said.
</P>
<P>
   With both Medflies and canker, the big worry is that Florida's
export partners will ban the state's citrus. That could be a
devastating blow to the industry, which generates some $8.5 billion
in economic impact in Florida, with $1.5 billion in direct sales.
</P>
<P>
   Canker, a bacteria, is believed to be spread when people bring
fruit or soil from a host country into Florida, where the disease
is not indigenous. The bacteria quickly infect healthy trees,
causing lesions on the branches, fruit and leaves. The fruit can
still be used for juice, but is not marketable otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, workers have destroyed about 100,000 trees to fight
canker in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, at a cost of $25
million. Officials have proposed cutting a mile-wide buffer between
the counties and the rest of the state, an effort that would cost
millions more.
</P>
<P>
   Canker also showed up in commercial groves in Collier and
Manatee counties last year, but officials believe it has been
contained.
</P>
<P>
   In Hendry County, the 200 or so infected grapefruit trees are
confined to one grove that is isolated from other citrus
operations, mostly surrounded by sugar cane fields, McElroy said.
That should slow the spread of the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Florida growers are lobbying the state and federal governments
for $165 million to battle the disease over the next three years.
Without the money, they fear, the state's largest agricultural
industry _ it employs 120,000 people _ could be endangered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida seems to be having a higher incidence of these
problems lately, and it's probably because we're so heavily
visited,'' Backman said. ``We've got over 40 million visitors a
year coming here, so it's a real challenge to make sure none of
them bring in any unwanted pests.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record to near-record warmth will bathe much of the Eastern
seaboard Friday as southerly winds increase ahead of a cold front
approaching from the Great Lakes and Appalachians. Winds blowing
over chilly Atlantic waters will limit warmth over southern Long
Island, Cape Cod and parts of northeast New England. Humidity
levels will climb to almost summertime levels across eastern
Virginia and the Carolinas, creating a powder keg of energy that
could erupt into strong thunderstorms later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   A line of showers and thunderstorms will develop across the
Middle Atlantic states Friday afternoon as a cold front arrives. A
few of the storms may approach severe levels, generating isolated
swaths of damaging winds and hail. Rain could be heavy for a time,
but the steady eastward march of the cold front will preclude the
risk of protracted, recurrent rain. Thus, rainfalls should
generally average an inch or less.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow swath of chilly rain or snow will follow the cold front
from the eastern Great Lakes to the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys.
Farther west, some moderately heavy snow squalls will develop
downwind of Lake Superior and northern Lake Michigan as cold air
pours over relatively tepid waters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, coastal rain and building winds will come ashore in
the Pacific Northwest, with mountain snows in the Cascades and
Olympics, with the latter mountains receiving the heaviest
snowfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Morning temperatures below zero degrees will set the stage foe
patches of ice fog early this morning across the Great Basin.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Without Sun
</P>
<P>
   Just as dawn broke over Madison, Wis., on Thursday, the mercury
rose to 55 degrees, breaking the city's long-standing record for
the date. The morning upheaval of record highs across the upper
Midwest was symptomatic of the minor warming role that the sun
plays in winter. Indeed, it is the wind that has the upper hand
over the northern tier-states, largely controlling temperature by
either importing warm air from the south or cold air from the
north. Wednesday night, sustained winds from the south brought
temperatures to the threshold of record levels across the upper
Midwest.

ISRAEL AND PLO HELD SECRET TALKS IN 1988, NEWSPAPER REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The newspaper Haaretz reported Thursday that Yitzhak
Rabin and Shimon Peres held secret negotiations with the PLO in
1988, well before the 1993 Oslo accord, when they were in the
government of Yitzhak Shamir, the rightist prime minister from the
Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   The unattributed account, apparently leaked by a participant in
the talks, said Rabin and Peres negotiated when they were defense
and foreign ministers in Shamir's national unity government,
composed of the Likud and Labor Parties.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Rabin and Peres were represented by
Ephraim Sneh, a member of parliament from the Labor Party.
Representing Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was a senior
aide, Hani al-Hassan. The talks were held in Paris and were
organized by Steve Cohen, a Canadian professor, Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis offered a 14-point plan that included a suspension
of the Palestinian uprising, which erupted in December 1987, in
return for halting the deportations of Palestinians, prisoner
releases and easing economic restrictions in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip. The two sides understood that their goal was
comprehensive political negotiations on two tracks, open talks with
Palestinians from the territories and secret negotiations with the
PLO, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Peres' defeat in the elections in 1988 stopped the discussions,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh told Haaretz that he had heard from Rabin that Shamir had
approved the talks. Peres maintains that Shamir was content with
reports that the talks were about missing Israeli soldiers and took
no further interest. Shamir contends that the talks were held
without his knowledge or approval.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The cast of ``Babes in Arms'' had been assembled for
the grand total of an hour before hearing five of the most
frightening words in theater: ``We open in a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker was Kathleen Marshall, the director of the show and
the artistic director of Encores series at City Center, which is
presenting ``Babes in Arms'' this weekend. She was exaggerating
just a tiny bit; the cast, crew and musicians had a whole 10 days
to put together its production of the 1937 Rodgers and Hart
musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``So here's the deal, guys,'' said Ms. Marshall, addressing the
cast on Monday morning, Feb. 1. ``In a week you'll be down onstage
on a set that isn't built, with blocking you don't know, saying
lines you haven't learned for a big crowd of people.'' She paused
to let the nervous laughter subside and added, ``So let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began the sometimes mad, sometimes miraculous process of
putting on a show Encores style. Ms. Marshall, along with the
musical director, Rob Fisher, was about to turn a group of 32
actors, singers and dancers into an ensemble, and then turn that
ensemble loose.
</P>
<P>
   Encores, in its sixth season, is a program devoted to concert
performances of three rarely seen American musicals a year, each
meticulously resuscitated from archival sources and staged for an
ultra-limited run of five performances. Previous Encores seasons
have included rarities like ``St. Louis Woman'' (1946) and ``Du
Barry Was a Lady'' (1939).
</P>
<P>
   ``Babes in Arms,'' which runs through Sunday, is this year's
first production and will be followed by ``The Ziegfeld Follies of
1936,'' a musical revue with songs by Vernon Duke and Ira Gershwin,
in late March, and ``Do Re Mi,'' with songs by Jule Styne, Betty
Comden and Adolph Green, in May.
</P>
<P>
   Re-creating these shows in less time than it takes milk to spoil
not only means panic attacks for the actors; the work behind the
scenes is equally frantic, with designers begging and borrowing
everything they can. Why? Every Encores show operates on a
shoestring budget. Sets are built and painted; lights are hung and
gelled, and costumes are built, nipped and tucked: all for about
$400,000 a show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the show you call in all your favors for,'' said John
Lee Beatty, the scenic designer. ``Every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the first read-through on Feb. 1 and the show's sold-out
opening night, the cast and crew will tumble through a hundred
minor crises and makeshift solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Exhaustion is the norm. Eight-hour rehearsal days are usually
followed by homework at night, a regimen participants variously
compare to going to boot camp, cramming for a big exam or being
shot from a cannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go home every night after rehearsal with every intention of
working out and returning phone calls,'' said Erin Dilly, who plays
Billie Smith, a young vagabond. ``About 15 minutes after dinner,
I'm in bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, having an Encores credit on one's resume has become a
gold star in the theater world because of the growing success of
the series. Some performers plan their vacations around the
two-week process to allow themselves a shot at a role. Others
rehearse Encores during the day and then perform in other shows at
night.
</P>
<P>
   A few staggering success stories, for performers and
productions, have come out of the series. The most famous
breakthrough was ``Chicago,'' which appeared at Encores in May 1996
and was then shipped to Broadway, where it won several Tony Awards,
including one for best revival, and is still running. The show has
since spawned six other companies, playing in cities from Las Vegas
to Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The series has also been a showcase for luminaries like Patti
LuPone, who achieved an ego-boosting triumph in the Encores ``Pal
Joey'' in 1995 after publicly losing the starring role in ``Sunset
Boulevard'' on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the young stars who have emerged from Encores
performances, like Melissa Errico, who made a splash in the Encores
``One Touch of Venus'' in 1996 and went on to star in last season's
``High Society.'' Other alumni now on Broadway include Rebecca
Luker, starring in ``The Sound of Music,'' and Kristin Chenoweth,
stealing the show in ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this has raised the stakes for the Encores creators and
performers. Ms. Marshall said one of the more difficult elements of
the abbreviated creative process was reminding herself and her
performers that Encores productions are supposed to be concerts,
not polished performances. In line with that esthetic, Encores
abides by several ground rules: limited costumes, limited sets and
scripts kept in the actors' hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part is holding yourself back a bit,'' Ms.
Marshall said. ``We don't want to look like we aimed too high and
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with these reminders, a close look at the birthing of
``Babes in Arms'' reveals an intense dedication to the work and all
the insecurity and anxiety that accompany bringing any show to
life, compacted into 10 all-too-short days.

BACK TO BUSINESS: CONGRESS TAKES UP TAX CUTS, SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With impeachment out of the way, it's back to
business for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get a burst of activity to show that we are
attending the people's business,'' said Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss. House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., says
Republicans need to ``get the impeachment behind us'' and start
``talking about the business people care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Hastert hope to focus on a host of issues from
education to tax cuts during the coming months to help distance the
Republican party from its months-long involvement in the
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News/New York Times poll released Feb. 3 showed that
two-thirds of those questioned thought the impeachment proceedings
hurt the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   Even more alarming to Republicans, are other polls that show
Americans think Democrats are better able to handle issues like
education, health care and Social Security reform and even
traditional Republican issues such as tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A Time/CNN poll conducted Jan. 20 and 21 showed that nearly 60
percent Americans trusted Democrats to handle Medicare, Social
Security compared to about 30% of Americans who prefer Republicans
to handle such issues. Fifty percent of Americans trust Clinton
more on taxes and 35 percent said they trusted Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a Republican-led legislative blitz may be in the
offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realize they are close to losing their majority,'' said
William Connelly, a political science professor at Washington and
Lee University in Lexington, Va. ``They've got to appeal to
something other than their base if they want to keep their
majority. Legislative accomplishments are the way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans saw their majority in the House sliced to a six-vote
margin over the Democrats after last year's election, partly
because of the impeachment proceedings but also because Congress
had few legislative accomplishments last year.
</P>
<P>
   A big change facing Congress this year is how to spend billions
in projected federal budget surpluses after seeing deficits for the
past 30 years. Republicans prefer to use the money for tax cuts
while Democrats would like to see spending increases in areas like
education.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress returns Feb. 22 after a week-long recess,
Republicans are hoping for quick action on a bipartisan education
bill that would allow states more flexibility in spending about $10
billion in federal aid money annually.
</P>
<P>
   For example, present law requires that 75 percent of
approximately $300 million available under the Eisenhower
professional development grant program to be used for math and
science education. Under pending legislation, a school that does
well in math and science could apply for a waiver to reduce that
amount to 60 percent, with the rest going to reading or other
programs. The waiver program is currently being tested in 12
states.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the issues that will dominate the congressional agenda
for the remainder of the year include:
</P>
<P>
   --SOCIAL SECURITY: Republicans have already agreed to Clinton's
plan to put aside about 60 percent of the projected federal budget
surplus to help keep Social Security solvent when the baby boom
generation begins retiring in about 12 years. But many Republicans
reject the idea of allowing the federal government to invest Social
Security money in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans and Democrats would allow individuals to invest
their own money with matching government funds in the stock and
bond markets. Other proposals being looked at to help fix Social
Security include gradually raising the retirement age from 65 to
70.
</P>
<P>
   -TAX CUTS: Some Republicans are rallying around a bill that
would lower each income tax rate by 10 percent, but Democrats have
attacked it as a plan aimed at the wealthy. The plan, for example,
would reduce the 28 percent tax bracket to 25.2 percent and the 15
percent bracket to 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans want the marriage penalty reduced. Married
working couples often pay more taxes than if they were single
because the tax code takes a bigger bite out of their combined
higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the Democrats have said they also favor eliminating
the marriage penalty but have not formally proposed doing so
because it would cost the federal government at least $20 billion
annually in lost tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are backing plans offered by Clinton that include a
$500 tax credit for parents who stay home with infants and a $1,000
tax credit for people who care for a disabled child or parent.
</P>
<P>
   -EDUCATION: Republicans want to eliminate 31 narrowly-targeted
education programs such an $18 million grant program for Native
Hawaiians and a $29 million program aimed at providing educational
and support services for homeless children. The 31 programs cost
about $2.7 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be given to states in the form of a block grant.
Republicans say an additional $800 million would be available to
states by eliminating the bureaucracy required to run such
programs. Democrats fear that block-granted education money could
be diverted by states for other uses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans are currently drafting legislation
that would offer tax breaks to lure investors into state and local
school bonds to finance school construction.
</P>
<P>
   -HEALTH CARE: Both Democrats and Republicans say giving
consumers more leverage to challenge medical decisions by health
providers like HMOs is a top priority. Such legislation failed last
year and a major sticking point remains whether to give patients
more rights to sue their HMO when medical treatment is denied.
</P>
<P>
   -MEDICARE: A congressional task force is studying ways to fix
the nation's health insurance program for the elderly, which won't
be able to meet all its obligations in the next decade because of
rising health care costs and the coming influx of retirees from the
baby boom generation. One option the task force is considering is a
plan that would give people age 65 and older a fixed amount of
federal money to purchase private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   -FEDERAL BUDGET: Lawmakers will spend the remainder of the
legislative session crafting the 13 bills needed to fund the
government on an annual basis. This usually sparks small battles
between Congress and the White House throughout the year over
policy issues and funding levels for federal agencies. Both Clinton
and the Republicans back in increases in defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   -BANKRUPTCY-Republicans are expected to again try to approve
legislation that will require more people to pay off a portion of
their debts if they declare bankruptcy rather than walking away
from the entire debt. Such legislation failed last year.
</P>
<P>
   -Y2K-Lawmakers are considering whether to limit some of the
liability that companies may face involving computer problems
stemming from the Jan. 1, 2000, date change, or Y2K. Some computer
programs will read 2000 as the year 1900 unless they are fixed.
Some Y2K experts predict possible power outages and disruption in
air travel. A few stores have had problems processing purchases
with credit cards that have an expiration date of 2000 or later.
</P>
<P>
   -AIRLINES-Democrats and Republicans are interested in
legislation that would require airlines to give people 48 hours to
cancel tickets that are currently non-refundable and, among other
things, to find out from the airline all of the fares that are
available on a particular route.

 NEW YORK: all-too-short days. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday, Feb. 1: 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the green room at City Center nervous actors sit,
surrounded by posters of past Encores performances. A piano sits in
the corner. A few actors talk with each other, but most are
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The first impression of the group is its youth. The bulk of the
cast might as well be on ``Dawson's Creek''; only a few are even
approaching 30. The youngest is Cartier Anthony Williams, 9, a
tap-dancing prodigy whose bio in the program concludes, ``Thanks to
Mom and God.'' He sits shyly at his mother's side, with feet
dangling off the chair, still short of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   To his right sits Scott Irby-Ranniar, 14, an original cast
member of ``The Lion King.'' He and Cartier don't know each other
yet, but by week's end they will be behaving like brothers, sharing
video game tips and tap moves. To Cartier's left sits Priscilla
Lopez and Donna McKechnie, two of the show's four veterans of ``A
Chorus Line'' on Broadway, a group known informally as ``the
grown-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason for the cast's youth. ``Babes in Arms,''
with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Lorenz Hart, tells the
story of a group of teen-agers on Long Island in the 1930s who put
on a show to stave off a trip to the dreaded work farm, where day
labor is exchanged for room and board.
</P>
<P>
   In her opening remarks to the cast, Ms. Marshall calls it ``the
original `let's put on a show in a barn' musical.'' And after
running on Broadway for nine months in 1937, the show was turned
into a movie with (who else?) Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland. Many
(too many) imitators followed. Among the ``Babes'' songs that
became standards are ``My Funny Valentine,'' ``Where or When'' and
``The Lady Is a Tramp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that by the end of the evening people will say, `Who
are all those people and where did they come from?''' Ms. Marshall
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vim and vigor aside, the room is a symphony of sniffles. These
are the final innings of the winter cold season, and a quick survey
of the room finds a dancer who's ``feeling ill,'' an actor getting
over laryngitis and, most worrisome, a dancer who says he has the
flu. ``Oooooh,'' goes the room when he offers the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dilly, meanwhile, is already tired, having flown in on the
red-eye from Michigan, where she was on tour with ``Beauty and the
Beast,'' playing Belle, the female lead. After getting into New
York, she realized that a sublet she had arranged was a dump and
ended up on a friend's couch. She's had four hours' sleep. David
Campbell, who plays her love interest in ``Babes,'' had come even
farther, flying in on Sunday from his native Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Even Judith Daykin, the stalwart executive director of City
Center, looks a little peaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't anyone who came here to perform come anywhere close to
me,'' she says through a stuffy nose. She smiles and adds: ``We
have people leaving their Encores subscriptions in their wills. Not
to put any pressure on you.''
</P>
<P>
   While the rehearsal process for the performers is short, the
behind-the-scenes preparation for Encores begins far in advance.
Ms. Marshall spent time in the library at Lincoln Center, studying
souvenir programs of the 1937 production to get a sense of the look
and feel of the piece. Fisher, meanwhile, was digging through the
Rodgers and Hammerstein archives, piecing together the score. The
point is to re-create, as much as possible, the musical's first
performance, right down to using photocopies of original music from
the orchestra pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is that if you're in the audience at Encores,'' Ms.
Daykin says, ``you should be hearing the sound that the audience
heard in 1937.''
</P>
<P>
   But certain accommodations are made for modern audiences and
performers, including microphones for the actors and sound mixing
for the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   A month before the show opens, casting is completed. And a week
before rehearsal, Ms. Marshall, working with three assistants,
marks out each dance and scene, all of which allows the creative
team simply to plug the cast into its design, at least in theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like Christmas,'' Fisher says. ``If you cast
well, you open the presents, and they come alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Feb. 1: 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the first meeting, the pace is already
fevered. In the main rehearsal room, a fluorescent-lighted square
on the third floor, Christopher Fitzgerald and Jessica Stone are
lip-locked. They play the musical's feisty romantic duo and are
already blocking out the first scene with Ms. Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like: `Oh, you're from Maine? Let's make out,''' Ms.
Stone said later.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald added: ``The first day you have to suck face. As an
actor, that kind of assures you establishing these relationships
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall two costume assistants are taking the actors'
measurements as they drink coffee and trade echinacea secrets.
Almost all the ``Babes'' costumes are borrowed or rented, to keep
costs down, said the costume designer, Toni-Leslie James. There is
one notable exception: a custom-designed jumpsuit for Ms. Dilly's
character, which Ms. James says she asked a friend at Donna Karan
to make. The price? A pair of Ms. James' shoes. (Her Prada shoes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I see that jumpsuit, I'll see my shoes,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon is the first read-through. The script has been
slimmed down by John Guare, the playwright, who weeded out several
smaller characters and minimized the ``gee, that's swell'' factor.
</P>
<P>
   Guare says he was drawn to the script by its treatment of race:
Two of the principal characters are young black performers, and the
villain is a bigot. ``I was very taken by the fact that in the
show, the producer will close the show because there's African
Americans in it,'' he says. ``I was very taken by that.''

 &HT;    NASCAR '99 forecast: Rules seesaw won't slow Gordon
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's the second week in February, and aside from the
fact that you better remember Valentine's Day, it also means the
NASCAR season is about to kick off. The 51st NASCAR season, to be
exact.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the 50th anniversary last year was a milestone worth
noting, but the hype was one car that many thought ran a few laps
too long.
</P>
<P>
   There was one thing about the anniversary celebration I found
delightful: NASCAR finally got around to acknowledging the
contributions of people like Tim Flock, Roy Hall, Raymond Parks and
a multitude of other lesser-known names who helped to build what is
now NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   As NASCAR has grown over the past five decades, it has had its
share of growing pains. There was the little-talked-about driver
boycott when Talladega opened. The drivers felt the tires were not
up to the track's speed potential. Then there was Chrysler's
departure because NASCAR basically outlawed all its hemi-headed
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Running NASCAR, then and now, is a delicate balancing act of
trying to make sure that all things (and cars) are equal.
Currently, competition director Gary Nelson is responsible for
creating as equal a playing field for all manufacturers as
possible. Basically, that means Ford and General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Any die-hard NASCAR fan knows every season is laced with whining
from the opposite camp about getting the short end of the rules
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon's Chevy dominates, and Ford teams demand a rules
change to create parity. Then the next week, the first 10 rows are
pretty much Fords, except for the Chevy of Gordon and the Hendrick
racing team. Then, NASCAR makes adjustments to humor the Chevy
teams, but it always seems to backfire. It makes all the Chevys
equal to the Fords except one, Gordon, who takes off like a scalded
dog.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be a basic problem here. The rules are being
adjusted to accommodate the demands of two manufacturers, but in
reality there seem to be three brands of cars competing in NASCAR
these days: Chevrolets, Fords and Hendricks. It has to make
Nelson's job a nightmare. If he tries to keep the Hendrick-built
cars in parity with the Ford contingent, he buries the rest of the
Bow-Tie Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   Until NASCAR finds an answer, it's a pretty safe bet Jeff Gordon
and his crew chief, Ray Evernham, will continue to dominate the
circuit again this year. That's my prediction for the '99 NASCAR
season, and I'm sticking to it.

 &HT;    Super Show opens for sports industry
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some of sports' biggest stars will be in Atlanta over
the next four days, but you probably won't get to see them.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will you be able to buy the latest in sports equipment and
apparel _ which will be on display as well at the Super Show, which
opens today at the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which has been held in Atlanta since its inception in
1986, is not open to the public. It will bring together 100,000
manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and exporters and importers
of sporting goods and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success that a company has at the Super Show _ how
successful they are in getting the attention of retailers _ can
really dictate a company's success for the calendar year,'' said
Mike May, a spokesman for the Florida-based Sporting Goods
Manufacturers Association, which owns the show.
</P>
<P>
   He said many companies use the annual trade show to introduce
new products. Retailers scout the goods and eventually place
orders. There will be 3,000 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our company, the show provides a fishbowl _ or showcase _
for us to show our products to competitors and the trade,'' said
Peter Loveridge, director of marketing for Greenville, S.C.-based
Dunlop Maxfli Sports Corp. ``The Super Show is the largest show for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company places about 5 percent of its orders for the
year at the Super Show. Overall, he said, as much as 30 percent of
Dunlop's business can be tied to the show.
</P>
<P>
   This year, three of the show's major exhibitors will be absent.
Nike Inc., Reebok International and L.A. Gear will not attend.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia World Congress Center houses the main part of the
show, with other gatherings at the Georgia Dome and the GWCC
Pavilions.
</P>
<P>
   Several features have been added this year, including fashion
shows several times a day. Also new is the Sports Nutrition &AMP;
Health Show, a vehicle for manufacturers and buyers of
health-related items such as energy bars, sport drinks, vitamins
and food supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Next year will be the show's last year in Atlanta until possibly
2004. It will leave Atlanta after 2000 and go to Las Vegas for
three years.

 NEW YORK: by that.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday, Feb. 4: 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The cast has now touched on every scene in the play, or so Ms.
Marshall hopes. ``I have the equivalent of the actor's nightmare,
where the actors are standing waiting for you to say something, and
you've got nothing,'' she says. ``There are, honestly, times as a
choreographer that you just want to go to the window and scream,
`Somebody give me a step!'''
</P>
<P>
   The cast is also showing signs of fatigue. Two dancers, Tina Ou
and Josh Prince, hold down two jobs, rehearsing ``Babes'' during
the day and performing at night, in ``Rent'' and ``Little Me,''
respectively. And Kevin Cahoon, who plays a fickle communist in
``Babes,'' is also an understudy in ``Hedwig and the Angry Inch''
and performs the title role every Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   During an afternoon rehearsal, Perry Laylon Ojeda, normally
pitch perfect, is having trouble finding a low C. He finally hits
the note and then rushes through his blocking a bit too fast. ``You
were just so excited to find that C,'' Ms. Marshall teases.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, meanwhile, is struggling to break some of his singers of
the habit of ``back phrasing,'' prolonging certain notes beyond the
musical accompaniment. Since back phrasing developed as a style in
the late 1940s, it does not mesh with the aim of Encores
performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels really good to people,'' Fisher said. ``And there's
nothing wrong with it. But it doesn't fit in the middle of a 1930s
musical comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, Beatty, the set designer, is having his own fun trying
to fit 25 musicians and their instruments on a stage roughly the
size of a racquetball court.
</P>
<P>
   There's never really enough space, Beatty says. ``Musicians are
diametrically opposite of scenic designers,'' he notes, with a
grin. ``Rhythm isn't my thing, and spacing isn't theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   The covers on the show's two pianos have been removed to make
room for a platform. This will change their sound, which the sound
designers need to remedy. One solution often begets a new
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is also complicated by the need of each musician
to see Fisher, the conductor, during the performance, and by their
aversion to crowding. ``Nobody wants to be too close to the
percussion,'' Beatty says. ``Except the bass, which doesn't want to
be anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty usually opts for minimal set dressing. The main scenic
elements are a large gilded proscenium and a dozen microphones,
both common sights to any Encores patron. This year, Beatty has
added a second proscenium, occasionally draped by a golden fabric
arch that drops from the rafters. On the first day of rehearsal,
Beatty calls it a ``pathetic rag,'' but when it first appears on
Tuesday afternoon, his disdain has weakened. ``It looks all
right,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Feb. 6: 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The entire cast and crew head to Carroll Rehearsal Studios,
tucked under a wing of the Port Authority Bus Terminal on West 41st
St. For the first time the cast sings with the full orchestra, in a
rehearsal known as the ``sitzprobe,'' a German term for ``sitting
rehearsal.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors say the process is invigorating, as the sound of dozens
of instruments backs their voices. But for Fisher it is a time to
see how far the group needs to go to be performance-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   It is only the second time most of the musicians have seen their
scores, and Fisher constantly makes corrections, adding and
subtracting instruments, making suggestions on tempo and volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crescendo on 24, fill on 25,'' he says. And, the next time
around, they do.
</P>
<P>
   The Coffee Club Orchestra, as Fisher calls his orchestra, is
filled with veteran New York City players and more than a couple of
wise guys. When Fisher asks the brass section not to play a portion
of the finale, the first trumpeter says, ``OK, but it's not going
to sound as good.'' And when Fisher announces that things are going
well, the second pianist plays a few bars of ``Beautiful Dreamer.''
Fisher smiles, but by this point, he, too, is suffering from a bad
cold.
</P>
<P>
   The actors, meanwhile, use the time to socialize. A clique of
men is debating the movie ``The Thin Red Line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was poetic,'' one says. ``It was self-indulgent,'' counters
another. ``But it's poetic in its self-indulgence,'' retorts the
first. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallway, a chorus member talks on a cellular phone.
Checking on voice-mail is common: After all, in just another week
most of the cast will be looking for work again.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Feb. 7: 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   This is a day off for the cast, but Fisher and Ms. Marshall
consult on the show's progress by phone.
</P>
<P>
   The rough spots are apparent. Guare has done a rewrite on the
final scene, and a pair of lengthy dream ballet sequences have a
ways to go.

 NEW YORK: to go. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday, Feb. 8: 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is in the theater for the first time. Both ballets are
worked on. They are complicated routines, involving most of the
cast and an array of props, from oars to milk crates. In the rows
immediately in front of the stage, Ms. Marshall and her three
assistants count out the beats for the performers onstage,
mirroring the dancers' moves with their bodies. ``Five and six and
seven and eight,'' is a common cry, often followed by ``Stop and
stop and stop and stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The technicians are still putting things together. The lighting
designer, Peter Kaczorowski, plots his cues for the show from a
makeshift desk in the 11th row, all the while listening to the
Senate impeachment proceedings on headphones. The dim work lights
are also having an effect: Several actors doze in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage the dancers are getting winded, and the mood is getting
slightly tense. Then the atmosphere is suddenly broken by the
smallest member of the cast, Cartier. Standing center stage, the
9-year-old starts to tap. He looks nervous at first but slowly
gains confidence, finding a rhythm in the silence. He gains
momentum, shuffling stage left. Then he stops, turns his body to
the right. He breaks into a split and slides to a halt, center
stage.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time since the beginning of the rehearsal
process, there's applause in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Feb. 9: 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Today is amputation day. If it isn't working, it's cut.
</P>
<P>
   After a relatively smooth technical rehearsal (the orchestra fit
onstage), and a clean run-through on Act I, the show bogs down near
the end of Act II. Ms. Marshall and Fisher meet and start trimming.
Gone is a waltz section of a dream ballet, and a couple of pages of
clunky dialogue near the show's finale involving a lost French
aviator, Rene Flambeau, and an imposter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was feeling really lo-o-ong,'' Fisher said. Ms. Marshall
spends some of the evening cutting. By the next day, four pages of
dialogue has been compacted into one.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Feb. 10: 10:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The invited dress rehearsal ``lets them hear an audience
respond,'' Ms. Daykin says of the cast. ``Before, they'd just go
out there with no idea what they had.''
</P>
<P>
   About an hour before the 7:30 curtain, the orchestra seats and
mezzanine of City Center begin to fill. About 1,000 people _
friends, past Encores performers, corporate donors, students _ will
be the first to see ``Babes in Arms'' performed beginning to end,
without any stops.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, the actors prepare, some chatting amiably, others
listening to headphones alone.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief speech by Ms. Daykin, the show begins.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few hitches: A misplaced prop here, a sluggish
rhythm there. Melissa Rose Anderson, who has the show's brassiest
voice, sounds a little tentative in her delivery. And for good
reason: She's suffering from a throat infection, and she has just
started antibiotics. After the show, she's in tears, but she
receives consolation from Fisher and Lea Delaria, a star of last
season's Encore's ``Li'l Abner,'' who was in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were great,'' Ms. Delaria says.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 days of prepping, the show seems fairly polished. The
dancers hit their marks; the musicians hit their notes, and Cartier
steals the show.
</P>
<P>
   At the final curtain, the cast members, all 32 of them, stand
forward and deliver the show's finale, the words of which seem all
too true for this bunch:
</P>
<P>
   They call us babes in arms,
</P>
<P>
   They think they must direct us,
</P>
<P>
   But if we are babes in arms,
</P>
<P>
   We'll make them all respect us.
</P>
<P>
   From the sound of the applause, they have done just that.
</P>
<P>
   Where or When

CANDIDATE GORE FACES PRESSURE TO CONDEMN CLINTON'S CONDUCT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore emerges from President
Clinton's impeachment struggle with his own presidential campaign
strengthened by the disciplined Democratic unity that helped rescue
the embattled chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president's burgeoning campaign for the White House
faces a fresh challenge from some Democrats in Congress who want
Gore to criticize the president's conduct to help the party
distinguish itself more clearly from Clinton on the hot-button
issue of personal values.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was impeached in the House and tried in the Senate for
perjury and obstruction of justice for trying to conceal his
dalliance with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all condemned the president's personal conduct on an
individual basis,'' said a prominent Democratic lawmaker who has
been involved in national Democratic fund-raising efforts. ``But we
need Gore to speak for all Democrats and make our stance more clear
to help us reclaim the values issue.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official in Gore's presidential campaign, speaking on
condition anonymity, said Gore may ``say something again'' about
Clinton's personal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people are tired of hearing about this,''
the official added. ``They want us to start talking about their
problems and their future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore already plans to highlight differences with Clinton on
policies and programs later this spring as he shifts into campaign
mode, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people want elections to be about the future, not
about the past,'' the official said. ``We're going to talk about
what we're going to do _ and not about what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson, the civil rights activist who has twice
campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination, said late
Thursday that Gore emerges from Clinton's impeachment fight as a
formidable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stronger because he has the absolute support of a strong
president, a robust economy and has made no outstanding mistakes,''
Jackson said. Jackson said in an interview on CNN that he may
compete against Gore for the Democratic nomination in order to
``broaden the base of our party.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore must ``earn the nomination, not inherit the nomination,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Patterson, a presidential campaign scholar at Harvard,
says Gore has to distinguish himself from Clinton with considerable
delicacy to avoid appearing disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a former senator from Tennessee, owes his shot at the
White House to Clinton, the Arkansas governor who defied
conventional electoral strategy in 1992 by naming a fellow
southerner to join a baby-boom ticket. Gore was born in 1948,
Clinton in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Gore underscored his loyalty to Clinton in the depths of the
impeachment fight at a Democratic pep rally on the White House lawn
on Dec. 19, hours after the House voted to impeach a president for
first time in 131 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has ``acknowledged that what he did was wrong,'' Gore
said, adding that the nation must also ``acknowledge that invoking
the solemn power of impeachment in the cause of partisan politics
is wrong.'' Gore then introduced Clinton as ``my friend, America's
great president.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said that Gore must now ``look for an opportunity to
express unhappiness with the president's conduct'' sometime over
the next month. ``You do it; you say you've done it; and you move
on,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Sullivan, incoming chairwoman of the Democratic Party in
New Hampshire, the state planning to hold the nation's first
presidential primary in 2000, warned that Democrats in New
Hampshire aren't looking for Gore to condemn Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``scores a lot of points for loyalty to the president,''
Sullivan said. Gore's fidelity and commitment to his family are so
widely known that he doesn't need to highlight differences with
Clinton, she said, adding: ``The vice president is seen as a real
straight shooter, as a very personable and likable guy.''
</P>
<P>
   With impeachment behind Clinton, Gore is now free to confront
his lone declared Democratic challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley
of New Jersey, and to begin taking on potential Republican
challengers such as Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Red Cross
president Elizabeth Dole, wife of 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's most formidable Democratic challenger has already stepped
aside. House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., announced in
early February that he would abandon a threatened bid for the
Democratic nomination in favor of efforts to help Democrats reclaim
political control of the House that was lost to Republicans in 1994
for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., have also
announced they will forego presidential campaigns in 2000. Gore
still could face challenges for the Democratic nomination from Sen.
John Kerry, D-Mass., as well as Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Gore well ahead of all potential Democratic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys also show that Gore's stature has barely dimmed as a
result of six years of service in the White House. A survey for ABC
News in May 1994 found that 58 percent of American adults had a
favorable impression of Gore; a survey for Time/CNN conducted last
month found 58 percent of respondents had a favorable impression.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, said Gore has emerged from Clinton's travails largely
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you add it all up, I don't think that it's had a
tremendous impact on Gore,'' Sabato said. ``Gore's popularity stems
from the economy. If we continue to have a good economy, he will
continue to benefit.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who opened a campaign headquarters in Washington in early
February, is building his bid to succeed Clinton on powers of
incumbency. A Washington insider and son of a senator, he has
served in the House, Senate and White House for 22 years. Gore
crisscrosses the nation on thinly veiled political missions to
announce federal grants in early caucus or primary states such as
Iowa, New Hampshire and California.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's blessing, Gore steps forward in Washington and on
the road to spotlight initiatives that court powerful Democratic
constituencies including labor unions, women, African-Americans,
Hispanics and liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pointedly cited Gore's ``visionary leadership'' in his
own nationally televised State of the Union address on Jan. 19 and
followed up the next day touting Gore at campaign events in
Buffalo, N.Y., and Norristown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say without qualification that no vice president in
history has had so much responsibility or done so much good,''
Clinton told a boisterous rally in Norristown.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is tapping into a network of loyal Democratic campaign
donors whose contributions to the Clinton-Gore ticket and the
Democratic Party in 1992 and 1996 enabled Democrats to mount the
most expensive presidential campaign in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that Gore will easily raise the $33 million by
year's end that is permitted for presidential candidates accepting
federal matching funds. Attorney General Janet Reno last year
cleared Gore of any wrongdoing in the Democrats' controversial 1996
fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has history on his side as well. Four of the five
Democratic vice presidents who have sought the party's nomination
since World War II have captured the nomination. Five of the last
10 presidents first served as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's delicate balancing act between loyalty and independence
recalls challenges faced by Vice President George Bush as he
prepared to launch his 1988 campaign to succeed Ronald Reagan and
Vice President Hubert Humphrey as he sought to succeed Lyndon B.
Johnson in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential primaries are stacked early in 2000, playing
into the hands of an elected official with a built-in platform.
Some 35 states are expected to have held their primaries by March
21, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet polls asking voters about a hypothetical race show Gore
trailing two undeclared Republican presidential candidates. A Los
Angles Times survey completed Jan. 29 showed Bush, the Texas
governor, topping Gore 57 percent to 39 percent. The same study
found Mrs. Dole beating Gore 50 percent to 42 percent.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Gonzalez tells tales out of school. He tells
them in school, too, and on radio and in museums and theaters and
arts centers and anywhere else he can find a stage and young
audience for his one-man musical storytelling epics.
</P>
<P>
   But ``storyteller'' is surely too static a description for the
hyperkinetic Gonzalez, whose new show, ``Mytholojazz,'' featuring a
be-bop and modern jazz interpretation of the Orpheus myth, opens
Friday night for 11 public performances at the New Victory Theater
here.
</P>
<P>
   Lanky at 6 foot 1, lithe and rubber-faced, the 42-year-old part
Cuban and Puerto Rican professional music therapist and guitarist
dances, orates and scat-sings, falling silent only at rare
intervals and by great force of will. ``I'm working on moments of
stillness,'' he said in a series of fast-moving live and phone
interviews briefly interrupted by the loss of his cellular phone
somewhere in his cluttered car.
</P>
<P>
   So what is he? ``I call myself different things,'' he said.
``Solo theater artist. Performance artist. Family-oriented
performance artist. There's no good word really.''
</P>
<P>
   In a culture where entertainment is often either unsuitable for
little eyes and ears or numbingly boring to adults, Gonzalez is out
to engage a broad audience. ``My mission is to be a vehicle for the
transmission of these stories so they come to life in the
imagination of the audience,'' he said. ``It only works if there is
a deep rapport between us. So I'll do whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   His first hit, ``Sofrito!,'' a spicy stew of folk tales set to
jazz, salsa and mambo rhythms by Larry Harlow and the Latin Legends
Band, including the redoubtable Yomo Toro and Adalberto Santiago,
filled the New Victory two seasons ago and went on to play Central
Park, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and other venues.
(Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times called the show
``rousing'' and praised Gonzalez's ``supple voice and command of
gestures.'')
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, he also has been on the radio on Sunday nights at 6
on WNYC-AM (820) with ``New York Kids,'' a two-hour show of
call-ins, quizzes, music, book talk and occasional storytelling by
Gonzalez, who shares the microphones with a buoyant, sisterly and
silken-voiced partner, Florence Barrau, and rotating pairs of grade
school hosts from a different school each week.
</P>
<P>
   He has performed for schoolteachers at the Lincoln Center
Institute and devised arts programs for them and their classes. He
is also an accomplished poet who has given readings at the
Nuyorican Poets Cafe on East Third Street in the East Village, and
is an adjunct professor at the New York University School of
Education, from which he holds a doctorate in music therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In May, in a big departure, Gonzalez is to be performing an
original multimedia piece at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in
Washington. Geared particularly to teen-agers and young adults, the
one-man show, ``Double Crossed: The Saga of the St. Louis,''
commemorates the 60th anniversary of the voyage of the ship that
sailed from Germany in 1939 filled with 937 refugees from Nazism
and was turned away from port after port _ including Havana, near
Gonzalez's childhood home _ and finally returned to Europe on the
eve of World War II. Nearly half of the passengers perished.
Gonzalez plays all 13 characters, including the captain of the
ship, several passengers, Goebbels and President Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from ``Double Crossed,'' Gonzalez's ``Mytholojazz'' is his
most ambitious creation. As Orpheus, he plays an imaginary
saxophone to captivate the underworld prince, Hades (whom he also
portrays, along with the hapless Eurydice). He rescues his beloved
from death but then loses her, as he must, for failing to follow
instructions. ``Mytholojazz'' includes a Chilean fairy tale,
``Delgadina,'' adapted from a story told by Laura Simms about a
girl who gets the Midas touch from a magical red snake. Gonzalez's
wife, Lisa Sokolov, sings Eurydice's lament and Delgadina's song to
her mother. Both pieces are performed to an original jazz score by
D.D. Jackson and performed by his D.D. Jackson Trio.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's like really raw talent,'' said Lenard Petit, a friend
and director of the Michael Chekhov Actors Studio, whom Gonzalez
brought in to direct ``Mytholojazz.'' ``He needs someone like me to
give him some shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of his projects has been particularly gratifying
for someone sensitive about being typed, in Gonzalez's words, as
``El Storyteller,'' someone expected, as he said, to ``fill every
school district's requirement for multiculturalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he isn't proud of his Cuban roots and his mother's
Puerto Rican heritage, he said. On the contrary. ``I'm a Latino
storyteller,'' he said. ``But I'm not just a Latino storyteller.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in the Bronx and taken to Cuba as an infant. Several
years later, Fidel Castro's takeover sent the well-to-do Gonzalez
family fleeing. (His father ended up working for the Central
Intelligence Agency and was posted offshore in the failed Bay of
Pigs attack, Gonzalez said.) The family returned to the Bronx,
where his parents divorced and his mother supported David and his
elder brother with secretarial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He began telling stories when he was 7, he said, when his Uncle
Jose made him a puppet theater and his mother hung a pair of red
velvet curtains on it.
</P>
<P>
   He attended James Monroe High School, where, he said, ``I was
held at knifepoint about 10 times and started hanging out with some
bad kids.'' He got into some trouble himself, he said: ``Petty
thievery, some minor drug problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a teacher, Tom Porton, introduced him to drama, music and
ballet. ``My whole world burst open,'' Gonzalez said. ``I started
taking classes in folk guitar, blues, jazz. I fell in love with
sound. It saved me. I could have gone an entire other way.''
</P>
<P>
   He studied guitar in Spain and went on to New York University,
where he pursued graduate and post-graduate degrees in music
therapy as a way of connecting with handicapped children. It was
there that he met his wife-to-be, Ms. Sokolov, a singer, who was
also studying music therapy. They live in Rockland County with
their two children, Jake, 8, and Raina, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who also spent five years studying dance with Abdullah
Djoniba Mouflet at the Djoniba Dance and Drum Center, broke into
storytelling with a program of Aesop's fables that he called
``Animals, Animals, Animals,'' soon followed by shows of folk tales
he entitled ``Up in Smoke,'' ``Totally Awesome,'' ``Cuentos: Tales
From the Latino World'' and ``The Handless Maiden,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   He has performed these and other shows before some 1,500
audiences at the Royal National Theater in London, Lincoln Center,
the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Tampa Bay Performing Arts
Center, the Kravis Center for the Performing Arts in West Palm
Beach, the Smithsonian Institution, the St. Louis Art Museum, the
Detroit Center for the Arts, the Philadelphia Art Museum and the
International Festival of Art and Ideas in New Haven.

that her deepest regret is the pain she caused Monica Lewinsky. In
her first lengthy interview, Mrs. Tripp said she betrayed Ms.
Lewinsky to save the young woman from being abused by the
president. ``As a mom, especially with a daughter close in age to
Monica, I would hope some other mom would do for my daughter what I
did for Monica, despite the fact that it looks horrible, that it
looks like betrayal,'' Mrs. Tripp tells The New York Times. By Don

<P>
   AMR-PILOTS (Undated) _ Operations at the nation's second-largest

FORMER MORTICIAN SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON IN WIDOW'S KILLING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN AUGUSTINE, Texas _ Jurors sentenced one-time mortician
Bernie Tiede to life in prison and fined him $10,000 Thursday for
the 1996 murder of his 81-year-old companion, wealthy Carthage
widow Marjorie Nugent.
</P>
<P>
   Tiede, who frequently wept during his two-week trial, was calm
as the sentence was read. The 40-year-old Carthage man will be
eligible for parole in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased,'' Panola County District Attorney Danny Buck
Davidson said after hearing the sentence. ``To me, this was one of
the most heinous crimes in East Texas. He shoots her in the back
four times, throws her in her own freezer and then, while she's
dead in the freezer, he goes traveling on her money. He's preaching
in church and telling her friends lies about her health and where
she is ....
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a slam-dunk for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The life sentence was the maximum allowed. Davidson said he
could not seek the death penalty because he couldn't prove Tiede
had stolen money from the woman. Capital cases require that the
murder be committed during the commission of another felony.
</P>
<P>
   Tiede also is the subject of a federal money laundering
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent's son addressed the court after the sentence was
pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crime to me is about finding old people who are
vulnerable and stealing from them,'' said Rod Nugent, adding that
he believed Tiede took $4 million from his mother over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Clifton ``Scrappy'' Holmes, who could not be
reached for comment after the trial, had urged jurors to show mercy
to his client, claiming prosecutors had unjustly portrayed Tiede as
a greedy, calculating killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (murder) was an absolute aberration,'' he said in final
punishment phase arguments, noting witnesses had testified that
Tiede was ``a kind, careful, attentive, good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of more than 40 prosecution witnesses, only one had
described Tiede as ``bad,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After only one witness,'' he thundered to the packed
courtroom, ``they (prosecutors) have the unmitigated gall to stand
up here and call him `evil.' There's not even a suggestion of
premeditation in this case. If they had other witnesses who thought
Bernie Tiede was bad, you can rest assured they would have put him
or her on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``... They promised you greed. They promised evil. But what they
brought through their evidence was that Bernie Tiede was a good
man. Remember what (one witness) said, `He was an angel with the
kids.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an angel all right,'' Davidson responded. ``He was an
angel of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week jurors deliberated only an hour to convict
Tiede of the widow's murder. The trial was moved to this community
about 40 miles south of Carthage because of pretrial publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony revealed the mortician gained confidence after the
March 1990 death of Nugent's husband, ultimately becoming her
business manager and travel companion. Using her money, he invested
in businesses and gave lavish gifts to his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Tiede testified that Nugent became increasingly demanding,
monopolizing his time and driving away his friends. Finally, in
November 1996, Holmes contended, Tiede ``snapped.'' He shot Nugent
four times as she bent over to pet her dog, then stashed her body
in a chest freezer beneath bags of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   For the next nine months he continued to live a lavish
lifestyle, traveling, preaching at a Methodist Church where he was
a lay minister and generously dispensing Nugent's money to
charities and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had become sophisticated,'' Davidson charged, ``and he
wouldn't walk away. He enjoyed living the life of the rich and
famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He continued preaching. Remember, he testified that it would
have bothered him if he had thought about it. But he put it out of
his mind. Thou shalt not kill. This man had no conscience. He is a
continuing danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes argued that his client had been devastated by his action,
that, subconsciously, he desired to be apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't bury the body,'' Holmes told jurors. ``He didn't
burn the house down. He preserved the body. The stories he told
about her whereabouts, how could they continue? He knew he would be
found out. He intended to be found out. He just didn't have the
courage to tell on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson countered that numerous witnesses testified they saw no
change in Tiede's demeanor after the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always `the same old Bernie,''' he said.

 By WILLIAM DIEM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The recent turmoil at BMW, where the top two executives
were removed last week, fanning takeover rumors, has a simple
explanation. Rover Group, the British maker of cars and off-road
vehicles that BMW adopted in 1994, has proved to be a needy,
dependent child that demands an ever-bigger allowance and shows no
sign that it can soon support itself.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the ouster of BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder and the
resignation of his deputy, Walter Reitzle, reflects the board's
judgment that Rover was given too much freedom. Pischetsrieder had
orchestrated the Rover takeover and invested nearly $6 billion to
modernize the company and expand its lineup. Rover is thought to
have lost more than $500 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rover is struggling for several reasons. The brand image of its
cars _ which are sold globally except in North America _ is
indistinct. Nor did it contribute as much engineering prowess as
BMW thought it would, undermining the new parent's strategy to
elevate Rover's image.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problems is the strength of the British pound,
which makes exports expensive and lets importers reduce prices
without cutting profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately for Rover, the speed with which the values of
currency changed exposed problems Rover had not yet overcome,'' the
new German president of Rover, Werner Samann, said at the recent
introduction of the Rover 75 sedan, which is to go on sale in
Europe in June for about $26,000. ``Rover was still too inflexible,
unable to react quickly enough, and had not fully established its
brand strengths in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover, the sport utility division, does not have the same
problems. Production was a record 142,000 vehicles last year,
including 50,000 units of the new, compact Freelander. And last
fall, Land Rover redesigned its midrange Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   But while Land Rover has a strong brand image _ reinforced by
its vehicles' appearance in wildlife documentaries and the
company's popular off-road driving schools _ Rover's cars have a
blurred image. ``Rover stood for putting the Rover badge, leather
and slabs of wood on Honda cars,'' said Peter Schmidt, an analyst
with Automotive Industry Data in Tamworth, England.
</P>
<P>
   Honda Motor Co. owned 20 percent of Rover when BMW bought the
rest from British Aerospace in 1994. Most current Rovers are based
on Honda platforms, and those roots have stymied efforts to burnish
the brand's image, said Rover's chief spokesman, Bernard Carey.
``We're trying to find a position for the Rover brand that is
justifiable in the metal,'' he said. ``With the Rover 75, that's
what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   BMW wants to reposition Rover as a premium line of
front-wheel-drive cars, to complement BMW's stature as premium
rear-drive cars. That is more difficult in Britain, Carey said,
because ``Rover is the successor of Austin-Morris,'' mass-market
producers that gained a reputation for poor quality. He added,
``We've had to pull out of a mass-market image.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Rovers are often seen as company cars provided by
employers. ``The perception of Rover is worse at home than it is
abroad,'' said Simon Miller, an analyst in London for Credit
Lyonnais, the French bank. ``They depreciate like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales in Britain fell 23 percent last year, to 152,734, and its
market share dropped to 6.8 percent from 8.6 percent. Some analysts
suggest that BMW's only way out is to sell Rover or find a partner
to share in development of front-wheel-drive platforms, but Rover
disputes the need for help. ``Anybody who has driven the 75 will
know that Rover is capable, with BMW's help, of designing and
engineering some of the best cars in the world,'' Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts are not alone in believing that Rover's engineering
resources are strained. Noel Goutard, chairman of Valeo, an auto
supplier based in Paris, said after his financial press conference
in January that Rover's biggest problem was a shortage of
engineers. Indeed, in January, Land Rover tried to recruit 150
engineers in Britain and received only 20 applications. A year
earlier, Rover had 1,400 applications for 100 positions, but hired
only 50 engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Not recognizing Rover's engineering weakness was a fundamental
error by BMW, some analysts say. BMW should ``fire the entire old
crew, because an old dog doesn't learn new tricks,'' Schmidt said. &QL;

 By WILLIAM DIEM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The recent turmoil at BMW, where the top two executives
were removed last week, fanning takeover rumors, has a simple
explanation. Rover Group, the British maker of cars and off-road
vehicles that BMW adopted in 1994, has proved to be a needy,
dependent child that demands an ever-bigger allowance and shows no
sign that it can soon support itself.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the ouster of BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder and the
resignation of his deputy, Walter Reitzle, reflects the board's
judgment that Rover was given too much freedom. Pischetsrieder had
orchestrated the Rover takeover and invested nearly $6 billion to
modernize the company and expand its lineup. Rover is thought to
have lost more than $500 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rover is struggling for several reasons. The brand image of its
cars _ which are sold globally except in North America _ is
indistinct. Nor did it contribute as much engineering prowess as
BMW thought it would, undermining the new parent's strategy to
elevate Rover's image.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problems is the strength of the British pound,
which makes exports expensive and lets importers reduce prices
without cutting profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately for Rover, the speed with which the values of
currency changed exposed problems Rover had not yet overcome,'' the
new German president of Rover, Werner Samann, said at the recent
introduction of the Rover 75 sedan, which is to go on sale in
Europe in June for about $26,000. ``Rover was still too inflexible,
unable to react quickly enough, and had not fully established its
brand strengths in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover, the sport utility division, does not have the same
problems. Production was a record 142,000 vehicles last year,
including 50,000 units of the new, compact Freelander. And last
fall, Land Rover redesigned its midrange Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   But while Land Rover has a strong brand image _ reinforced by
its vehicles' appearance in wildlife documentaries and the
company's popular off-road driving schools _ Rover's cars have a
blurred image. ``Rover stood for putting the Rover badge, leather
and slabs of wood on Honda cars,'' said Peter Schmidt, an analyst
with Automotive Industry Data in Tamworth, England.
</P>
<P>
   Honda Motor Co. owned 20 percent of Rover when BMW bought the
rest from British Aerospace in 1994. Most current Rovers are based
on Honda platforms, and those roots have stymied efforts to burnish
the brand's image, said Rover's chief spokesman, Bernard Carey.
``We're trying to find a position for the Rover brand that is
justifiable in the metal,'' he said. ``With the Rover 75, that's
what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   BMW wants to reposition Rover as a premium line of
front-wheel-drive cars, to complement BMW's stature as premium
rear-drive cars. That is more difficult in Britain, Carey said,
because ``Rover is the successor of Austin-Morris,'' mass-market
producers that gained a reputation for poor quality. He added,
``We've had to pull out of a mass-market image.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Rovers are often seen as company cars provided by
employers. ``The perception of Rover is worse at home than it is
abroad,'' said Simon Miller, an analyst in London for Credit
Lyonnais, the French bank. ``They depreciate like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales in Britain fell 23 percent last year, to 152,734, and its
market share dropped to 6.8 percent from 8.6 percent. Some analysts
suggest that BMW's only way out is to sell Rover or find a partner
to share in development of front-wheel-drive platforms, but Rover
disputes the need for help. ``Anybody who has driven the 75 will
know that Rover is capable, with BMW's help, of designing and
engineering some of the best cars in the world,'' Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts are not alone in believing that Rover's engineering
resources are strained. Noel Goutard, chairman of Valeo, an auto
supplier based in Paris, said after his financial press conference
in January that Rover's biggest problem was a shortage of
engineers. Indeed, in January, Land Rover tried to recruit 150
engineers in Britain and received only 20 applications. A year
earlier, Rover had 1,400 applications for 100 positions, but hired
only 50 engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Not recognizing Rover's engineering weakness was a fundamental
error by BMW, some analysts say. BMW should ``fire the entire old
crew, because an old dog doesn't learn new tricks,'' Schmidt said. &QL;

   &LR; BLACK-ANTHEM (Undated) _ In the 1950s, in a little African
Methodist Episcopal church in Evanston, Ill., I first heard our
choir perform ``Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing.'' If memory serves, I
was an 8-year-old seated on a hard wooden bench between my parents,
both wearing their go-to-meeting best, and I remember asking my
mother what this particular song was about. ``Just listen,'' she
said, gently elbowing me into silence as the choir sang James
Weldon Johnson's words, her voice filling suddenly with the sort of
respect she reserved for things hymnal and holy.
(italics)``This,''(end italics) she informed me, ``is the Negro
National Anthem.'' (Italics)This,(end italics) her tone said, is
(italics)important.(end italics) &UR;  &LR; Looking back, during Black
History Month, I believe now that her affection for this
ineluctable work, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year on
Feb. 12, consisted partly of a profound appreciation for its
perennial, much-honored place in black culture, and partly of her
deeply felt gratitude for the towering figure, the (Harlem)
Renaissance man, who produced it &UR; .  &LR; By Charles Johnson. (Moved).

<P>
   ROSIE-PEREZ-FILMS (New York) _ Rosie Perez has built an
improbable acting career, which began with a chance encounter with
the director Spike Lee, on being pretty much what she is: an
intense, voluble, working-class Puerto Rican from Brooklyn who is
indelibly from her own unfashionable patch of turf. In her new
film, ``The 24-Hour Woman,'' written and directed by Nancy Savoca,
she plays a familiar character but with a twist. She is definitely
Ms. Perez, but she is also a successful television producer, rather
than a kid from the streets, trying to balance work, marriage and
motherhood. By Peter Applebome. &UR;  &LR; (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKING-BARRELS-FILM (London) _ ``Could every one of you stop
getting shot?'' a particularly hapless character asks well into
``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' the cheeky London gangland
film that opens on March 5. This request comes out of a desperation
at once comic and fearful, as befitting an alternately funny and
violent tale of London criminality from the lunatic to the thuggish
_ which is to say, from dope-addicted, well-spoken public school
boys (known as ``trustafarians'' for their ready access to trust
funds to finance their habit), to seasoned tough guys with
Runyonesque names like Big Chris and Hatchet Harry. By Matt Wolf.

</P>
<P>
   BRITISH-FILMS-SPEECH (Undated) _ Moviegoers on these shores have
long been baby-powdered by British actors who pamper every line as
if the English language were a newborn's bottom. If we weren't
savoring the plummy consonants in stuffy Merchant-Ivory
productions, we were relishing the plumped vowels in stifling
Elizabethan costume dramas. Lately, though, British movies have
become both less mannered and less manored. And the grittier the
fiction, the muddier the diction. The British cinema isn't dead,
it's just not speaking as clearly. By Franz Lidz. (Moved).

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THINGS-FALL-APART-THEATER (Undated) _ ``Things Fall Apart,'' is
a drama with music now at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in
Newark. Adapted from the classic 1958 novel of the same name by the
Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe, the production chronicles the rise
and fall of a Nigerian leader who watches his beliefs and
traditions unravel with the arrival of missionaries and other white
foreigners in Africa in the early 1900s. By Rachel L. Swarns.

<P>
   FREE-THEATER (New York) _ The crowd at the Actors Studio Free
Theater at Raw Space spills into the small lobby at 529 West 42nd
Street. A mix of young people and old, their names are checked off
a clipboard as they arrive. There is a smattering of theater
celebrity; the playwright Romulus Linney and his daughter, the
actress Laura Linney, came to a recent performance of Clifford
Odets's ``Awake and Sing!,'' as did Ellen Adler of the Stella Adler
Conservatory. During intermission in the big barnlike space, people
talk about what they have just seen in ``Power Failure.'' This is a
crowd that goes to plays and performances like connoisseurs: on the
lookout for the unusual. That is certainly true of the price: it's
free _ as it has been since Arthur Penn, 76, the president of the
Actors Studio, created the Free Theater in 1997. By Liz Welch.

   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   651-ARTS-DANCE (New York) _ One of the best-kept secrets in the
performing arts in New York City is 651 Arts. The Brooklyn-based
producing and presenting organization is often confused with the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, a separate corporation that helped found
651 Arts nearly 10 years ago and has maintained a symbiotic
relationship with it. Today, 651 is a major developer, producer and
presenter of contemporary performing-arts works by black artists
like Donald Byrd (``Harlem Nutcracker'' and ``Jazz Train''), Anna
Deavere Smith (``Fires in the Mirror'') and Randy Weston (a
production of his rarely performed 1961 ``Uhuru Afrika''). This
month, 651 is one of 13 organizations citywide that is
participating in a salute to the documentary ``I'll Make Me a
World.'' By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KIRCHNER-MUSIC (New York) _ On Saturday evening, at Merkin
Concert Hall, a group of fine musicians will gather to pay tribute
to one of America's finest composers: Leon Kirchner. Kirchner
turned 80 last month, and the retrospective concert is a kind of
birthday present. The real beneficiaries, though, will be the
members of the audience, for Kirchner's music has always been
outgoing, strong, challenging, glorious to hear. He is a big man,
and he makes big music. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SWENSEN-VIOLINIST (Undated) _ As a young violinist, Joseph
Swensen had a rapidly blossoming international career and top
management: ICM Artists booked him for some 100 events a season. He
had an exclusive contract with a major label, BMG/RCA, which
promised at least six recordings. Having studied with the world's
most revered violin pedagogue, Dorothy DeLay, at the Juilliard
School, he had a blistering technique second to none. He also had
something infinitely more precious: a restless, probing, highly
personal musicianship. But in 1991, at 31, Swensen did something
shocking if not heretical, abandoning the violin and announcing
that he would accept engagements only as a conductor. Eight years
later, violin cognoscenti still shake their heads at mention of his
name, whether in sad or admiring disbelief. By K. Robert Schwarz.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-CLASSICAL-CDs (Undated) _ Back when the LP still
reigned, long before the classical CD glut, a new recording of
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony or Tchaikovsky's ``Pathetique'' would
inevitably draw some critic's weary sigh, ``Do we really need
another one?'' Now, as CD bins groan _ and the browser's mind reels
_ with choices beyond number, a new wave of mainstream classical
CDs from England washes on these shores. And the old refrain
echoes: do we really need this? Not to milk the suspense, the
answer in this refreshing case is yes. Well, mostly yes. At hand is
a boxful of budget-price CDs offering a potpourri (or is it a
hodgepodge?) of composers and works, all performed by the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra of London with various conductors. By
Lawrence B. Johnson. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK-ART-SONGS (New York) _ Since Aristotle, and on through
Newton, Baudelaire and Scriabin, progressive thinkers have linked
the aural sensation of music to the visual sensation of color. But
is the color of the composer ever audibly discernible? The
distinguished American mezzo-soprano Florence Quivar explores that
question Sunday afternoon, when she and the pianist Wayne Sanders

   JAZZ-LABELS-MERGER (Undated) _ Two weeks ago, two of the seven
recording imprints that comprise the major-label jazz industry _
Verve and Impulse! _ merged. They came together under the umbrella
of the Verve Music Group, a subsidiary of the new, expanded
Universal Music Group. (They will still be kept separate as
imprints, but they will be presided over by the same marketing and
sales department and general manager.) Aside from the lost jobs,
it's a sure thing that plenty of artists will be dropped from the
rosters. With fewer major-label jazz records coming out, and many
great musicians without contracts, it's now or never for for the
independent label to become an important force in jazz again. By

science has played an increasingly prominent role in art. Donald
Judd used the Fibonacci series of natural numbers as a

 &HT;    Opening proposals for Delta execs, pilots leave $100,000 gap
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Delta Air Lines captain flying the carrier's newest
widebody, the Boeing 777, would make about $212,000 a year in base
pay under an initial company proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's pilot union wants $312,000.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and the union have exchanged opening proposals, kicking
off negotiations on pay rates for the plane. Only a few dozen
pilots have a direct stake, as Delta is buying just 14 of the giant
jets, with the first four arriving this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the ability of management and union leaders to bridge the
$100,000 gap in opening proposals will provide a test of relations
heading into negotiations on a new contract for all 9,000 pilots.
Those talks start in September.
</P>
<P>
   Delta wants to avoid the kind of ill will that led to a strike
at Northwest last fall and a sickout this week at American.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to cast its 777 offer in a generous light, the airline
outlined it in a letter to all pilots, not just union negotiators.
Delta said the offer represented ``the highest rates in the
industry for this type of aircraft,'' exceeding rates at the
next-closest carrier, American, by 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's proposal calls for a 777 captain to make $236.36 an
hour, or $212,724 a year based on a standard 75-hour month.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Line Pilots Association's proposal calls for a rate of
$346.44 an hour, or $311,796 a year. Those rates don't include any
overtime pay or other add-ons.
</P>
<P>
   An ALPA spokeswoman declined to comment, except to note that the
twin-engine, long-range 777 is ``a highly efficient and productive
aircraft.'' Translation: Delta will make lots of money with it.
</P>
<P>
   The 777 will be Delta's premier international aircraft. In
addition to the 14 on order, it has options for 20 more.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, captains flying MD-11 jets are the highest paid at
Delta, earning about $195,000 a year in base pay.

 &HT;    Quick gas deregulation in Atlanta could bring random provider
assignment by summer
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Deregulation of Georgia's natural gas industry is
moving quickly, setting the stage for customers who have not
selected a marketer to be assigned to one as early as summer.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 370,000 of Atlanta Gas Light Co.'s 1.5 million
customers have switched to marketers, AGL said Thursday. That's
about 25 percent of the customers who were supplied by AGL when
deregulation began Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Once 33 percent of the gas service in each of the state's nine
delivery areas is provided by marketers, the rest of the customers
will be assigned to various marketers after 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   As of Feb. 1, the Athens, Augusta, Macon and Atlanta districts
had the most marketer sign-ups, while Brunswick and Savannah were
lagging. AGL spokesman Ross Willis said it's possible the process
for random assignment of consumers could be initiated in the
most-active areas after the next accounting, March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming, and it's coming soon,'' said Deborah Latham,
president of Roswell, Ga.-based marketer Peachtree Natural Gas.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Darby, senior vice president of South Carolina-based
SCANA Energy, said he expects assignment of AGL customers in the
leading districts to be completed by next winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that it happen this year so we don't have
another mess with AGL,'' Darby said. He was referring to the recent
flap over the utility's rates for its remaining customers.
</P>
<P>
   The recent settlement between AGL and the Public Service
Commission that revised the utility's rates and required $14.5
million in refunds to consumers expires Sept. 30. Willis said the
utility intends to continue the present rate structure for
customers it retains after that date, though minor revisions could
be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the random assignment system, marketers have a great
incentive to sign up as many customers as possible now. That's
because their market share will determine how many customers they
get later. So far, 12 of the 19 certified marketers have signed up
customers.
</P>
<P>
   SCANA is widely believed to have signed up the most through
alliances with several large electric membership cooperatives and
special offers of $50 worth of free gas. SCANA said it had signed
up 143,740 of the 317,213 customers who had switched as of Feb. 1,
for a 45 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
   Other active players such as Georgia Natural Gas Services, Shell
Energy Services, Columbia Energy Services and GasKey declined to
say how many customers they have. Peachtree Natural Gas claimed
30,000 customers as of Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The PSC will hold hearings today on the applications of two more
companies seeking certification.
</P>
<P>
   Southeastern States Energy Inc. is a newly formed subsidiary of
Houston-based Perry Gas Cos., a wholesale gas marketer. ACN Energy
Inc. is a newly formed energy marketing subsidiary of American
Communications Network, a telecommunications company based in Troy,
Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers are expected to step up efforts to attract customers
in advance of the random assignments. AGL has given certified
marketers CD-ROMs that contain detailed customer profiles that
should make it easier to quote prices, though 300,000 customers
requested that their data be withheld.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not see Ginsu knives and toaster ovens, but you'll see
something,'' Peachtree Natural Gas' Latham said of the upcoming
marketing blitz.

 &HT;    Judge's ruling delays Southern Co.'s plans to expand
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co.'s plans to expand its electric generating
holdings were set back Thursday when a protracted bankruptcy
proceeding failed to select a buyer for Louisiana-based Cajun
Electric Power Cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that the case would finally be settled after five years
were dashed when U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Gerald Schiff issued a
long-awaited opinion that didn't select either a $1.19 billion bid
submitted by a consortium that includes Southern or a $940.5
million bid from Southwestern Public Service Co., a Louisiana
utility known as Swepco.
</P>
<P>
   While rejecting the reorganization plans, Schiff said the
proposals could be modified and ``this proceeding can be concluded
without further extended hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern spokesman David Mould said the company was studying the
opinion but intends to pursue the purchase. Swepco spokesman Peter
Main said the company was disappointed but is reviewing the ruling
with an eye toward revising its bid.
</P>
<P>
   Cajun, which provides power through member cooperatives to 1
million customers in rural Louisiana, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy in 1994, and its non-nuclear assets were put up for
bids. Southern is seeking Cajun's power plants and supply contracts
to back up its growing wholesale power marketing business.

 &HT;    QUAYLE POISED, CONFIDENT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE CAMPAIGN SWING
 &HT;    530&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Dan Quayle made his first foray into New
Hampshire as a presidential candidate Thursday, showing a poise and
confidence not always seen in his years as George Bush's sometimes
bumbling vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of gaffe-free speeches, interviews and press
conferences, Quayle, 52, argued that with 12 years in Congress and
four as vice president, he is ``the most prepared and the most
qualified'' of those seeking the 2000 Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while his return to the national political arena has
invited late-night comedians to dust off their Dan Quayle jokes, he
may no longer be a national punch line to New Hampshire voters,
whose first-in-the-nation primary is key to his strategy for
winning the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jay Leno would just stop making those jokes about him _
that's the thing,'' said Ray Shoults, a Manchester retiree who came
to see Quayle's tour of city hall Thursday. ``He has the
wherewithal, he has everything needed to be president. But he has
to overcome the reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is a long way from erasing the caricature that has dogged
him ever since Bush plucked the 41-year-old freshman senator from
near-political obscurity to be his running mate in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But Quayle is clearly relishing the opportunity to be his own
man on the campaign trail, no longer at the mercy of the
strategists and ``handlers'' he had to contend with as Bush's
running mate and vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running for president. I'm not running for vice
president,'' he said. ``When you're No. 1, it makes a world of
difference. It's your campaign. It's your ideas. It's your
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of his break with the past, the Quayle campaign has
signed on John Sununu as the national chairman of Quayle's
campaign. The former New Hampshire governor served as White House
chief of staff for Bush, father of a prime Quayle opponent for the
nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Sununu, who accompanied Quayle on his rounds Thursday, suggested
that most Americans hardly know Quayle because of the countless
jokes about his intellect and spelling skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the smartest of the candidates running for president,''
said Sununu, adding that Quayle has ``the experience and
credentials to serve as president that, frankly, none of my other
friends who want to run have.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle ``benefits enormously from the expectation game,'' said
Bill Kristol, the ABC News analyst who served as chief of staff in
Quayle's vice presidential office. Among the GOP hopefuls, he is
perhaps the best known, and ``if he is not the bumbler his critics
expect, it is to his advantage,'' Kristol added.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that is a major part of Quayle's strategy in overcoming
the front-runners in the GOP race, Gov. Bush and Elizabeth Dole,
the wife of Bob Dole, the GOP's 1996 presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Thursday about overcoming his reputation, Quayle
replied, ``People are going to look at me. They are going to listen
to me. Then they are going to judge me against the others. And when
that judgment is rendered, I feel very confident that I will be the
Republican nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Quayle benefited enormously from the decision by Sen. John
Ashcroft of Missouri to forgo a campaign for the GOP nomination.
Both are very popular among the religious conservatives who play a
vital role in the Republican Party's nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also has spent the last six years raising money and
campaigning for Republican congressional candidates. In the 1998
cycle alone, he collected about $6 million and campaigned for more
than 200 candidates. ``I have been working my heart out for
Republicans and the Republican Party, and now it's my turn,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the other candidates, Quayle does not have to define
his position on major issues. His anti-abortion views are well
known, and he is well ahead of the GOP presidential pack in
promoting tax cuts to help relieve the financial squeeze on working
families.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Quayle is uniquely positioned to take on the issue
of character as the nation elects a successor to President Clinton.
Though initially ridiculed for it, Quayle single-handedly made
``family values'' a political issue, giving voice to millions of
Americans who see a decline in the nation's morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to the day that we can return honor and
integrity to the White House,'' Quayle said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And taking aim at Vice President Al Gore, he said his successor
had been ``nothing but a cheerleader'' for Clinton. ``I can assure
you, this will be an issue in this race,'' he added.

SNOWE BECOMES 4TH REPUBLICAN SENATOR TO OPPOSE CONVICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate trial of President Clinton headed
toward acquittal Friday, Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, became the
fourth Republican senator to announce she would vote to acquit the
president on both articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe said in a statement that ``the president's wrongdoing can
and should be effectively addressed by the criminal justice
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowe said she found the president's behavior ``deplorable and
indefensible,'' adding that he has ``fueled our darkest
cynicisms.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``I determined that the only way that I could
approach this case was to ask myself `if I were the deciding vote
could I remove this president under these circumstances?' The
answer, I conclude, is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowe's decision to vote for acquittal increased doubts that
even a simple Senate majority would vote to convict Clinton and
remove him from office. It's been a foregone conclusion that the
Senate won't come close to the 67 votes required to convict and the
simple 51-vote majority was seen as partial vindication for the
House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe joins Republican Sens. Jim Jeffords of Vermont, John W.
Chafee of Rhode Island and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania who
announced Wednesday that they will vote to acquit Clinton on both
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Many senators have predicted that the perjury article, the
weaker charge of the two, would fail to reach a 51-vote majority.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, one senator after another released written
statements explaining how they will vote when the verdict ballot is
called Friday. Most of them were predictable and along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon H. Smith, R-Ore., and Bob Bennett, R-Utah, thought
to be on the fence, both said they intend to vote guilty on both
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said, ``I refuse to say that high political polls and
soaring Wall Street indexes give license to those in high places
who act in low and illegal ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said Clinton has had a pattern of ``habitual mendacity''
running through his entire public career. ``A president who has
demonstrated a capacity to lie about anything, great or small,
whether or not under oath, does threaten our liberties,'' Bennett
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any president who readily used the power of his office for his
personal ends regardless of who is hurt _ that president is a bully
and, as such, a threat to the constitutional liberties of us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he and Senate
Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., would be among four
final speakers to deliver their 15-minute remarks right before the
vote, which he predicted would come at noon.
</P>
<P>
   When Chief Justice William Rehnquist reads the articles of
impeachment Friday, senators will rise one by one at their desks
and vote ``guilty,'' ``not guilty,'' or ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   After the votes are completed, a copy of the Senate's verdict
will be deposited in the office of Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, according to Lott's spokesman John Czwartacki, pursuant
to Senate rules.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Herbert H. Kohl, D-Wis., said the trial was moving at a
good clip Thursday because many senators, including himself, had
chosen to insert their written statements into the record rather
than speak for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, who said he decided not to speak ``to expedite the
process,'' said he will vote to acquit Clinton. He added that he
believes the president has ``demeaned the office and exhibited bad
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl also said there was very little back and forth going on in
the closed chamber Thursday and that it was mainly just senators
``speechifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans declared that the censure resolution
spearheaded by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the lead opponent of censure, declared
with a wide grin, ``Censure's dead.'' Gramm has vowed to use a
number of parliamentary maneuvers to block censure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said the ``general understanding''
among Republicans was that there wouldn't be a floor vote on a
censure resolution but there would be a declaration signed by some
of the members condemning Clinton's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans emerging from their caucus Thursday were already
trying to shift the focus from the impeachment trial that the
Senate has been mired in for five weeks and toward their
legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial concludes, Congress will face another huge
challenge, said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really going to have to get back into a period of
working together,'' Brownback said. ``It's going to be very
difficult for the country and for Congress.''

 Federal officials file civil charges in fatal grain-elevator
blast  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) ...an explosion, DeBruce said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my hand on it,'' DeBruce said of an experiment carried
out in recent months in which consultants hired by DeBruce
re-created Grose's scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the OSHA counts filed Wednesday allege missing or
malfunctioning monitoring equipment designed to alert employees to
any abnormal conveyor-belt motion or speed that would warn of a
frozen bearing.
</P>
<P>
   Other counts allege inoperable grain-dust collector systems,
inadequate storage of flammable materials, violations of
respiratory-protection standards for workers, and failure to
provide adequate safety training to employees and contractors at
the site.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA officials also have noted that DeBruce officials were aware
of excessive grain-dust problems at the elevator, but ignored
warnings issued by the federal Farm Service Agency in 1996 and
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the investigation, relations between OSHA and DeBruce
representatives have been less than cordial.
</P>
<P>
   Questioning of DeBruce employees in recent months has at times
degenerated into verbal fisticuffs between Oscar L. Hampton III, a
lawyer for the Department of Labor, and DeBruce lawyer Mark
Hinderks.
</P>
<P>
   According to transcripts of those sessions, made public by
DeBruce in recent weeks, Hampton has pushed DeBruce employees hard
about whether any company documents have been destroyed or
falsified and whether DeBruce's management practices neglected
safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   One such exchange occurred Oct. 10, during questioning of
Richard Wilbur, DeBruce's operations chief.
</P>
<P>
   Hinderks: ``You have gone far afield (about matters) that have
nothing to do with this case. I didn't object. We are cooperating.
Just don't push it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton: ``You are not my boss. You are not even a
representative of the federal government. So keep your comments to
yourself and do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton could not be reached Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hinderks said he was puzzled by the OSHA lawyer's stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinarily, I have very good relations with opposing
counsel,'' he said Wednesday. ``We're professionals. I don't
understand it. ... I don't know what's driving OSHA on these
citations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very surprised about the lack of exchange of any
information. As a lawyer, you see a lot of things. This one really
has me scratching my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years ago, Kittoe, Wilbur and Pillsbury successfully
deflected OSHA's civil charges. Those counts included the absence
of magnets along conveyor belts to trap loose pieces of metal. At
the time, Wilbur also worked for Pillsbury, as its director of
engineering in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA concluded at the time that loose bits of metal apparently
struck something along the conveyor line and sparked, triggering
the explosion of airborne grain dust that, in a confined space such
as a grain elevator, can detonate with six times the force of
dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury argued that an electrical short in a grain-level
monitoring device elsewhere in the St. Joseph facility triggered
the initial explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after OSHA dropped the case, Kittoe was promoted, but
two years later he left Pillsbury and took a grain-marketing job in
California. He joined DeBruce in 1987 and was named president in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce worked at the elevator southwest of Wichita one summer
while he was a college student, and in 1996 the company bought the
22 million-bushel storage facility, one of the largest in the
world.

 Federal officials file civil charges in fatal grain-elevator
blast  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) DeBruce Grain officials should have known about and
corrected hazardous conditions that triggered the fatal June 8
grain-dust explosion at the company's storage elevator near
Wichita, Kan., federal agencies said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration on Wednesday filed formal charges in the
blast, in which seven workers were killed and nearly a dozen others
were injured. The charges allege 36 counts of willful and serious
violations of federal safety regulations. They carry fines of up to
$1.7 million and possible criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Wichita confirmed Wednesday that they
were continuing to review OSHA's allegations to determine whether
criminal charges should be filed.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce has formally contested the civil charges and will mount
a defense later this year at a hearing before OSHA's Review
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials complain that OSHA's investigation has not
been a search for the truth, but for a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, we have not been given an opportunity to speak
with any OSHA representative who was prepared to discuss our
concerns,'' said Paul DeBruce, the company's founder and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only has there not been any give-and-take discussions on
our information, but also we still have no idea how OSHA came up
with many of its conclusions, which are in direct contradiction to
the facts we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations filed Wednesday are nearly identical to OSHA's
initial findings against the company, made public in December. An
OSHA spokesman said Wednesday that the agency had no comment on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   To DeBruce's president, Larry T. Kittoe, the scenario is all too
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1980, Kittoe was branch manager in charge of a
Pillsbury Co. grain elevator in St. Joseph, Mo., when it exploded,
killing one worker and injuring five others.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview at DeBruce headquarters in North Kansas
City, Mo., Kittoe said he didn't know how to respond to questions
about his role in the two explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unfortunate coincidence,'' said Kittoe, 48. ``I guess
I'm very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, OSHA investigators cited missing or faulty
equipment meant to guard against unsafe conditions that can trigger
explosions in the highly combustible grain dust.
</P>
<P>
   But in the St. Joseph case, Pillsbury disputed OSHA's
allegations, and the agency eventually dropped all charges against
the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest difference between that experience and the one
we're going through now is the amount of substantive communication
we're having with OSHA,'' Kittoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago. OSHA listened to Pillsbury's defense, he said.
Today, said Kittoe and DeBruce, agency officials refuse to meet
with top DeBruce executives for substantive discussions about the
explosion, and appear to have their minds made up that the company
is guilty.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA's investigator in the Wichita explosion, Vernon Grose, has
stated publicly that a seized bearing in a grain-carrying conveyor
belt caused friction and generated enough heat to ignite grain
dust, which triggered subsequent explosions throughout the
half-mile-long complex.
</P>
<P>
   Kittoe and other company officials call OSHA's theory absurd,
arguing that even if a bearing had frozen up, the resulting
friction from the conveyor belt passing over it would not generate
enough heat to detonate grain dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Grose) truly knew this industry, he would know those
rollers don't heat up enough'' to cause an explosion, DeBruce said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my hand... MORE

A SPLENDID CONVEYANCE FOR THE HUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH TEXAS _ In that solemn hour of morning before the sky
begins to lighten, hunters do not arrive for breakfast in mere cars
or pickup trucks. They come driving (ital)trains.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The rigs parked in the lot of the highway diner are like none
you've ever seen before.
</P>
<P>
   At the front is a van, a sport-utility machine or something
larger, serving as the train's engine. Attached behind that, with
compartments underneath for six or eight dogs, is the hunting
vehicle proper, about which more later.
</P>
<P>
   Towed at the rear is a trailer with accommodations for at least
that many dogs again.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, how long is such an outfit? Thirty feet, maybe.
Possibly more. Long enough, anyway, that both lanes of the highway
need to be empty of car lights all the way to the horizon before
easing onto the road and heading for the field.
</P>
<P>
   Men here take quail hunting seriously. If you want to know
(ital)how(end ital) seriously, you'd better ask their wives. John
Howe, our host, is no exception _ though his wife, Linda, a
schoolteacher, seems fully to approve.
</P>
<P>
   Howe sold a manufacturing business not long ago, and is
preparing to launch a different enterprise. He's a tall,
well-conditioned man in his middle 50s, whose manner is an engaging
blend of intensity and graciousness.
</P>
<P>
   In his large back yard are kennels and a training and exercise
area that would be the pride of any professional dog handler. John
keeps 13 dogs. Two or three he's boarded and trained as a favor to
friends. The rest are his, all female and mostly pointers, with a
yellow Lab, Cody, whose passion is finding and retrieving downed
birds.
</P>
<P>
   In an early letter, when we were just getting acquainted by
phone and mail, John wrote with feeling about his
dog-of-a-lifetime, Amy, and how the loss of her had hurt. Those are
feelings I know very well.
</P>
<P>
   He'd kept four of Amy's daughters, and they'd turned out to be
capable workers, though not yet their mother's match. He's recently
bought a youngster of famous breeding, for which he has great
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   But fine as they are, it was not his dogs I started to speak
about. Rather, it's the machine he's constructed _ a fabulous,
motorized schooner _ for navigating the oceanic vastness of his
lease.
</P>
<P>
   Other men may buy their hunting cars ready made, or order them
manufactured. John built his himself, to his own specifications and
to suit his own needs.
</P>
<P>
   First he removed the upper parts of a Volkswagen bus, down to
the frame, which he reinforced to withstand the punishment of a
terrain gullied by seasonal torrents and trenched by the endless
rooting of feral hogs.
</P>
<P>
   Upon this foundation he erected a wondrous conveyance: a bench
seat in front for two; a second bench behind, suitable for three,
elevated somewhat to allow for dog compartments underneath; behind
that, a higher platform upon which Cody, the retriever, perches,
waiting to be summoned to the work she loves.
</P>
<P>
   A pan for watering the dogs is attached by a spring to its
special bracket. The turn of a lever fills the pan from a reservoir
mounted on the side. (A red warning light on the driver's panel
gives notice that the pan has not been returned to its bracket, and
prevents leaving it behind.)
</P>
<P>
   The dogs, in shifts of two or three at a time, search for quail
in the cover ahead, while the hunters, in motorized splendor,
proceed at a stately, even majestic, pace behind.
</P>
<P>
   When a covey is found, the men dismount for the flush, then look
for the scattered singles on foot.
</P>
<P>
   In case these excursions might take them some distance away,
into that vastness of mesquite and cactus, all of which looks very
much alike, John has rigged a siren that goes off every 10 minutes
or so when the vehicle is unoccupied, sparing them all the
humiliation of becoming lost.
</P>
<P>
   There's one other amenity I mean to mention, though perhaps not
just now.
</P>
<P>
   Because now the sky is paling and the last stars are going out.
By afternoon the temperature will be in the upper 70s, or possibly
the 80s. But the morning air has an edge, and there's a dusting of
frost on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   John Howe steers around a thicket and into a little grassy
clearing. Already, with barely light enough to shoot, there's a dog
on point and two others honoring at right-front, along a line of
brush.
</P>
<P>
   And the whole day, rich with promise, still lies ahead.

THE WARM FEELINGS AFTER CLINTON'S CHINA VISIT HAVE TURNED CHILLY
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By JANE PERLEZ 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seven months after President Clinton's return from
a picture-perfect trip to China, the promise of a new era in
Chinese-U.S. relations has faded, leaving the administration
grappling with an unexpected round of repression of human rights in
China and a mounting perception in Congress that Beijing is
threatening Asian security.
</P>
<P>
   The high expectations set by Clinton in China have run up
against a pessimistic tone set by political forces in both
countries that administration officials say are more intent on
confrontation than cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of showing signs of progress in its policy of
``constructive engagement'' with China, the administration is
facing a squall of China-bashing in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Even U.S. business, a constituency that the administration's
China policy has particularly tried to assist and the loudest
advocate of closer ties, is complaining about Beijing's new
restrictions on foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by a bipartisan congressional inquiry's findings that
China stole sensitive U.S. military technology, administration
officials say they are warily waiting for even more explosive
details expected to be announced in March in a declassified report
by the congressmen who headed the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   And later this month, the Pentagon is expected to send to
Congress its long-delayed classified report on security questions
in the Taiwan Strait, which will describe a sharp increase in the
number of missiles on the Chinese coast.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and experts who have had sections of the report read
to them said the Pentagon would report that in the early 1990s
China had 60 missiles pointed at Taiwan but that since 1995 that
number has more than doubled. In three years the Chinese are
expected to have 800 missiles deployed on their side of the strait.
</P>
<P>
   That report, another administration official said, is sure to
create ``a new wave of calls about the China threat.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of these obstacles, the administration says its
policy of ``constructive engagement'' still holds.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two months, in advance of a visit to Washington by
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji on April 8, the administration will be
working hard to find some issue on which the two countries can find
common ground, most likely the possibility of China's admission to
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Even that common ground may be elusive. As the Chinese economy
suffers from slower growth, rising unemployment and stalled
economic reforms, the incentive for the Chinese to make trade
concessions so they can join the trade organization has diminished,
economists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration thought after the Clinton trip that it had
come to some tolerable modus vivendi with China,'' said Jonathan B.
Pollack, a defense strategist at Rand Corp., who recently visited
China. ``But it doesn't run very deep. There's a clear sense that
the underpinnings are very fragile, and there's a very clear
potential for a real reversal in the relationship.''

   (Undated) The word ``synergy'' is bandied about the work world
these days. It's corporatespeak for ``You scratch my back and I'll
scratch yours _ provided we both make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold on, though. Here's a synergy that erases cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   The synergy starts with (so far) seven men and women who are
interested in economic or emotional fulfillment in their retirement
years. They have 20-hour-a-week jobs through the Older Kansans
Employment Program, administered by John Green in Chanute, Kan.
They are career mentors.
</P>
<P>
   The synergy continues with the people being mentored. So far,
that comprises about 245 Johnson, Wyandotte and Leavenworth county
residents who are on the welfare-to-work track through the Kansas
Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services.
</P>
<P>
   The synergy threads through the department, which has crushing
caseloads and great pressures to move inexperienced and
hard-to-place welfare recipients into jobs. The mentors make a big
difference in the government's ability to train and maintain these
new workers in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The synergy winds through four _ soon to be five or six _
Wyandotte and Johnson county businesses that need a steady supply
of manufacturing, clerical and service industry workers.
</P>
<P>
   The participating companies not only get employees, they get
free and frequent on-site consulting from the mentors. And the
counseling isn't just helping entry workers adjust to work. It's
helping existing employees _ sometimes even the business owners and
managers _ with everything from interpersonal relations to business
tips.
</P>
<P>
   John Sharda, one of the mentors, says it's fulfilling work. He's
enthused about the mentors' track record since August of helping
companies get and keep their new workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employee retention is a tough, costly problem,'' Sharda said.
``Often, employers aren't even aware of problems that cause an
employee to leave until after the worker is gone. We're there to
help solve transportation problems or whatever it is that's getting
in the way of success.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is good news for taxpayers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Brown, human relations manager at American Laminates, known
as AmLam, said the commercial cabinet manufacturer in Kansas City,
Kan., had hired three former welfare recipients referred to them
from the program and expected to hire five more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employees they've sent us have been very eager to learn
and to do what we ask,'' Brown said. ``And the mentors have helped
us work through several employment situations. Our supervisors are
happy to have them here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sprenkel, job developer at the Social and Rehabilitation
Services office in Kansas City, Kan., said AmLam, GE Capital in
Merriam, The Maids of Johnson County, and Labor on Demand in Kansas
City, Kan., had hired workers through the program. United Parcel
Service has committed to join, and another company is ``in the
wings.''
</P>
<P>
   The synergy, stitched together with a combination of state
funding and private enterprise willingness, has no long-term
guarantees. But as long as everyone's itches are being scratched,
it looks like a winner that deserves to thrive.

 WASHINGTON: relationship.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most immediate thorn for the administration is how to deal
with the regression in China's human rights policies in the last
two months.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials argue that they never expected
continued improvement in human rights after Clinton left China in
July and that there is ``no quick fix,'' as Harold Koh, the
assistant secretary of state for human rights, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   But the long prison sentences of 11 to 13 years imposed on three
democracy campaigners in December took officials here by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we were are unhappy about the arrests and have said
so publicly and from the president on down privately,'' said Sandy
Berger, the president's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the clearest path for the administration to
register its objection to such a crackdown is to sponsor a
resolution condemning China at the annual meeting of the U.N. Human
Rights Commission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   That is an annual opportunity for countries to record their
disquiet at China's human rights policy in a forum that the Chinese
authorities take seriously despite its relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in the face of a seemingly improved human rights
climate in China and to the gratification of the Chinese
government, the administration decided for the first time since
1990 not to offer such a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in what an official described as almost
``insurmountable'' pressure from Congress, the administration is in
the midst of a heated debate about whether to reverse last year's
course and condemn the Chinese for the crackdown. Such a reversal
could be embarrassing for Clinton, who at the end of his China trip
said, ``China has the right leadership at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was opposed to moving against the Chinese in
Geneva, administration officials said, but became alarmed when a
moderate Republican, Rep. Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, chairman of
the International Relations Subcommittee on Asia, said there would
be an ``explosion'' in Congress if the administration remained
quiet at Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the White House was now considering what
recommendation to make to Clinton about the Geneva conference,
which starts on March 22 and runs until April 30. Inconveniently
for the administration, Zhu's visit to Washington is scheduled for
the middle of the Geneva gathering.
</P>
<P>
   On national security, the administration faces a confluence of
issues that may serve only to intensify the problems in the
relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list is the administration's proposal, which
the Chinese have vehemently criticized, to push forward plans for
developing a theater missile defense system with Japan, South Korea
and possibly Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The system, which is still in the design stage, has been
promoted with renewed urgency by the administration since the
surprise firing by North Korea of a missile that flew over Japan
and into the Pacific in August.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says the system would protect Japan and South
Korea from North Korean missiles, but Taiwan's government has shown
interest in being part of the system, an interest the
administration has not discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have interpreted the recent push on the theater
missile defense system as hostile to their interests. A Pentagon
official suggested this was hardly surprising, since the defense
system hits them at the ``heart of their military posture.''
</P>
<P>
   The coming release of a Pentagon report on the system, requested
last year by Congress, is likely to intensify the debate. The
Chinese have already raised the issue in a way that does not please
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Washington last month, a senior Chinese arms
control official, Sha Zukang, warned the administration that
pushing ahead with the missile defense system would sink any
chances of China's joining a major international mechanism for
controlling the spread of missile technology, the Missile
Technology Control Regime. Nations that belong to the regime are
bound not to export missile parts.
</P>
<P>
   Sha made the warning at a conference at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, where Berger announced that Washington
would like China to join the control regime this year.
</P>
<P>
   From the administration's point of view, the brightest picture
for achieving some progress with the Chinese in time for the prime
minister's visit, appears to be paving the way for China's entry to
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Urging China to make concessions so it can join the world's
premier trade body has been the focus of Clinton's efforts in the
last three years to open China economically and politically.
</P>
<P>
   But Western economists assert that this is one of the most
inopportune times to be moving China toward the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. corporations complain that China, instead of easing market
access, has been tightening the rules for Western investors in the
last few months, particularly in telecommunications. And to belong
to the trade organization, China would have to make such
fundamental changes as freeing up the distribution system of roads
and warehouses, which are now almost entirely in the hands of the
Chinese army.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that the administration wanted to persevere and that
another delegation of the U.S. trade representative's office would
go to China soon.
</P>
<P>
   He said that even though China was going through economic
dislocations, the Chinese would like to be part of the World Trade
Organization before the Taiwanese, who are close to membership.
</P>
<P>
   But he also acknowledged that the Chinese had to face the
reality that the only way they could win membership in the trade
group was if they made enough concessions to allow U.S. market
access to China and to adhere to the rules of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said we would be flexible, but it must be an
agreement that is justifiable on market grounds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Berger said, there is little chance that Chinese
membership will be approved by Congress.

<P>
   OAK BROOK, Ill. _ In Austria, Indonesia and South Korea,
McDonald's sells Big Macs and Happy Meals. But its Vienna
franchises also contain ``McCafes,'' which offer coffee blended for
local tastes. In Jakarta, the McDonald's menu includes rice as well
as french fries. In Seoul, the burger chain sells roast pork on a
bun with a garlicky soy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   That combination of a globally recognized brand with a flexible
menu that caters to local palates has helped McDonald's navigate
the global economic turbulence that has knocked most of the other
big corporations operating around the world way off course.
</P>
<P>
   For the 15th consecutive year, McDonald's Corp. has achieved
solid growth in its international division, which now accounts for
nearly 60 percent of corporate profits. No other American
multinational has enjoyed such consistent success abroad,
particularly lately amid the dizzying plunges in local currencies
and economic activity in much of Asia and Latin America. McDonald's
says a large part of the reason it has done so well is that its
operations overseas are run by local residents who are attuned to
changing economic conditions and consumer tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, McDonald's is testing a variation on the theme that ``all
business is local'' in the United States, where since the mid-1990s
the fast-food giant has been wrestling with a dramatic and widely
publicized fall from grace. After a period of growing concerns over
declining food quality, shrinking market share and a generally
falling stock price, profits at McDonald's appear to be on their
way up at home as well as abroad.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years of fumbles, Wall Street analysts say there are
signs that McDonald's is climbing back _ in large part following
the course charted abroad _ by decentralizing marketing and
decision making.
</P>
<P>
   Senior executives now say they are committed to more local
control, and what Jack M. Greenberg, the new chief executive, calls
a ``shared vision'' of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't manage 25,000 restaurants in a centralized way,''
Greenberg said in an interview at the company headquarters here in
this Chicago suburb. ``Many decisions need to be decided closer to
the marketplace; you have faster decisions that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, when McDonald's reported its fourth-quarter and
year-end results, foreign sales and profits were strong, up about
10 percent, despite widespread weakness overseas. In the United
States, the improvement was even more striking. Operating profits
were up 13 percent, more than double what they were in 1997 and the
best yearly gain since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   While McDonald's has plenty of problems, investors have become
increasingly optimistic. Shares have soared 63 percent the last
year, closing at $82 Thursday, up $2.125.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've turned a corner,'' said Mitchell Speiser, who
covers the fast-food business for Lehman Brothers. ``They have
culturally, operationally and strategically turned the corner.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet the new approach carries its own set of quandaries. For
instance, some analysts say that in reinventing the company,
McDonald's runs the risk of scrambling the formula dreamed up by
the late Ray Kroc. That formula gave McDonald's uniform quality and
unified marketing themes, like ``You Deserve a Break Today,'' and a
consistent and distinctly American batch of winning products that
came to be symbolized by the Golden Arches.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's officials also may face an uphill battle as they try
to meet their goals of improving profits by 10 to 15 percent a year
the next five years, analysts say. After all, McDonald's is already
a $35 billion company with more than 12,400 restaurants in the
United States alone, and stiff competition is coming from Wendy's,
Burger King and even unlikely competitors like the Carl's Jr.
hamburger chain in California and a reviving Jack-in-the-Box.
</P>
<P>
   What Greenberg, the 56-year-old former accountant who took over
as chief executive in August, would most like to reverse is a
lengthy series of corporate miscues that began in the mid-1990s,
when McDonald's was trying aggressively to expand its operations
with big promotions.
</P>
<P>
   New products, like the Arch Deluxe, flopped. New promotions,
like ``Campaign 55,'' a deep-discount program that was supposed to
hark back to the Eisenhower era by offering 55-cent burgers
fizzled. Burger King and Wendy's began to gain market share.
McDonald's food was widely seen as subpar, ranking in one food
quality taste test not that long ago just below Hooters, and, in
one customer satisfaction survey, just ahead of the Internal
Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1997, the company dropped its lead advertising agency,
Leo Burnett &AMP; Co., in favor of Omnicom Group's DDB Needham unit,
which created the ``Did Somebody say McDonald's?'' campaign. Last
year, the company elevated Greenberg from the head of United States
operations to chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, sales at restaurants open at least a year have
improved substantially, the company said. After slipping in 1996
and 1997, McDonald's share of the fast-food market has reached its
highest level in a decade, 43 percent of the market, according to
Technomics, a market research firm in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A new McDonald's is emerging, analyst say, that helps explain
its improved standing in Wall Street circles. Since Greenberg took
over, the more flexible cooking system is generating somewhat
higher customer satisfaction. Strained relations with franchise
operators have improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different management style,'' said Paul Saber,
chairman of the National Leadership Council, a group that
represents franchise operators. ``Jack's attitude is to get to know
owner operators and their issues; he's brought a spirit of working
together.''
</P>
<P>
   A sense of denial about McDonald's failings appears to have been
replaced in recent months by an almost ritualistic desire to
confess past sins. ``In retrospect, we lost our way back in
mid-1994.'' Michael Conley, the company's chief financial officer,
said in an interview last week. ``We were trying to drive the
company almost exclusively with national advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg reorganized the company's domestic operations into
five divisions. He gave owners of McDonald's independent franchises
a more collaborative role in marketing and advertising and a say in
the menu. The company also has agreed to pay half the cost of what
McDonald's calls its ``Made For You'' food preparation system. The
new system, which is not available at all outlets, is arranged to
keep bread, lettuce, onions and other ingredients fresh and allow
McDonald's assembly line process to accommodate new menu items.
</P>
<P>
   The company also slowed its growth in the United States, where
rapid expansion led to concerns about cannibalizing existing
McDonald's outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Unprofitable, low-volume satellite operations in places like
Wal-Mart stores were closed; faster drive-throughs, cleaner stores
and better food quality are high priorities, executives say. And it
is all in the spirit of inclusiveness and decentralization, the
backbone of foreign operations.
</P>
<P>
   In McDonald's international division, local managers and
franchise operators have long had substantial control over how they
do business. The locals create a supply infrastructure within each
country or region; everything is financed in the local currency. A
great deal of attention is paid to local customs, like food tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to be as much a local business as possible,''
said Jim Cantalupo, head of international operations. ``We don't
run Spain out of Portugal.''
</P>
<P>
   That decentralization allowed local managers in Indonesia to add
rice quickly after the currency collapsed in 1997, which made
french fries _ its main imported product _ much too expensive. And
it has paid off in other places hit hard by global market forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of experience dealing with down markets,''
Cantalupo said. ``We've dealt with six government economic plans in
Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   While other multinational companies like Coca-Cola and Procter &AMP;
Gamble suffered sharp earnings declines in 1998, McDonald's _
despite a dip in Asia _ still posted operating profit gains of 9
percent overseas. ``International is the locomotive here,'' said
Dean T. Haskell, an analyst at Everen Securities in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Though pleased with 1998 results, Greenberg knows that one
strong year is just one strong year. He says the company is hardly
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of hard work ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company has become more attuned to Wall
Street, buying back a big chunk of its own stock and announcing a
two-for-one stock split last month, which investors applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one advertising executive, who agreed to speak only if he
was not named, said that while McDonald's has righted itself
financially, it may have lost some of its marketing bravado. The
company has pinned its hopes on Teanie Beanie Baby promotions and
Disney movie tie-ins. ``The market's only as loyal as the next
Beanie Baby promotion or the next Disney movie,'' he said. ``What
happens when the movies flop? Does everyone run to Burger King for
Rugrats cups?''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also question whether McDonald's brand loyalty
among older customers has begun to wane and whether the recent rise
in profits was simply a minor tuneup on a motor that may have
passed its prime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly have more outlets and more distribution with
the lowest price points,'' said Haskell of Everen. ``But more and
more people are looking for variety and quality. The quick
drive-through is becoming less of a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskell and others cite the success of Starbuck's coffee,
Einstein Bagels and other more specialized food chains.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenberg and other executives say they are responding to
such concerns. In tune with its decentralized foreign operations,
McDonald's is experimenting more actively with new sandwiches and
foods in regional tests in hopes of recreating the success of the
Egg McMuffin, which was born in San Diego, and the Big Mac, which
took root in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Extra, which some say is like a Burger King Whopper, was
tested in the Northeast and is being offered nationwide. The
McFlurry, a soft ice cream with candy, spread across the country
last year. A salad that comes in a plastic container that customers
use to shake up their dressing is in tests as McSalad. There are
additional products in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more things in test now than at any time in my 24
years here,'' said Conley, the chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The company will experiment and innovate, officials say. But
while decentralized operations are the new mantra, McDonald's,
executives say, will still be McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decentralization doesn't mean chaos or anarchy,'' Greenberg
said. ``The things that make McDonald's distinct are going to be
there. Those things aren't negotiable.''

`REAL' DAN QUAYLE GREETS NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Former vice president Dan Quayle reintroduced
himself Thursday to voters in this first-in-the-nation primary
state, hoping they will come to know the ``real'' Dan Quayle, not
the caricature lampooned by late-night talk show hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Touting himself as ``the best prepared and most qualified to be
president,'' Quayle announced the formation of his exploratory
committee. He formally will announce his run for the White House in
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take my candidacy to the people. I'm going to be
all over this great state, in living rooms and coffe shops,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's traditional brand of politics, he said, will
work in his favor. ``Voters are going to come, they're going to
listen to me, and they're going to walk away with the opinion that
I am prepared to be their president,'' Quayle said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle spoke to the Manchester Rotary Club, did a radio talk
show, and toured Manchester's newly-refurbished City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that there are three major challenges that face
America today,'' Quayle said later at a news conference. ``First,
there is an assault on middle class values. Secondly, there is a
middle class tax squeeze and a loss of freedom. Third, there is a
challenge of leadership in the areas of foreign policy and national
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Some New Hampshire voters said they liked what they saw and
wondered why Quayle still struggles against the image he acquired
as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can the media make somebody so smart, so intelligent and
so honest look so ridiculous?'' Ann Domingue of Goffstown asked
after listening to Quayle's speech at the Rotary Club.
</P>
<P>
   In the radio interview, Quayle said: ``Bill Clinton and Al Gore
have simply trashed values. . . . They have trashed the White
House, and it's not theirs to trash.''
</P>
<P>
   He chided Gore for being a ``nothing but a cheerleader'' for
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between being loyal and having blind
loyalty,'' Quayle said. ``If George Bush had committed perjury and
obstruction of justice like Bill Clinton has, and if George Bush
would not have resigned, as vice president I would have resigned.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle has secured the support of John Sununu, a former New
Hampshire governor and former White House chief of staff, who will
act as a national cochairman of his campaign, along with Ovid
Lamontagne, a conservative who lost a gubernatorial bid to Jeanne
Shaheen in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sununu said Quayle ``has the experience, he is the smartest of
the candidates running for president, (and) he is the most capable
in terms of taking an issue and producing a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, 52 and graying at the temples, seemed to many here to
have added polish since he came into prominence as Bush's young and
eager running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes across as a seasoned public servant, a statesman of
sorts,'' said Michael Mudryan, a Manchester real estate agent.
``He's really come a long way.''

VITAPRO PRESIDENT PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO FRAUD CHARGES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Canada) 
 
By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Canadian ex-convict-turned-businessman pleaded not guilty
Thursday in federal court to charges of conspiracy,
money-laundering and fraud stemming from an alleged kickback scheme
involving the sale of tons of a soy-based meat substitute to the
state prison system.
</P>
<P>
   Yank Barry, president and chief executive officer of VitaPro
Foods Inc., of Montreal, was arrested Thursday morning at Houston's
Bush Intercontinental Airport by federal and state authorities. He
was then whisked away for interviews with investigators and an
appearance before a federal magistrate.
</P>
<P>
   Barry, who served a six-year jail sentence in Canada for
extortion under his given name of Gerald Barry Falovitch, had been
indicted more than a year ago on two counts of bribery, two counts
of money laundering and one count of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Mr. Barry is going to have some more information
based on the VitaPro sale,'' Larry Todd, spokesman for the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice, said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Judge Marcia Crone set Barry's bond at $200,000
and released him on the condition that his travel be restricted to
the United States and Canada. A tentative trial date has been set
for April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Todd said Barry's trip to Houston and bond had been arranged in
advance with federal and state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Barry's attorney, Mike Ramsey of Houston who negotiated the
surrender, said Barry has been living in Montreal since his
indictment, but insisted the businessman was never a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been trying to arrange a surrender since the indictment
was unsealed, but there was a series of impediments,'' Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Canadian citizen, but there was never an attempt made
to extradite him. He's here voluntarily. I can say that he was
absolutely never a fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury had indicted Barry and former TDCJ
executive director James. A. ``Andy'' Collins in January 1998,
alleging they had concealed kickbacks paid to Collins from TDCJ's
purchase of $33.7 million worth of VitaPro.
</P>
<P>
   TDCJ paid about $3 million on the contract, which Collins
allegedly ordered his department to sign. Collins resigned his post
in 1996 after details about the VitaPro purchases, and his
directives that employees bypass state bidding and purchasing
procedures, came to light.
</P>
<P>
   As a state and federal investigation of that deal began, TDCJ
sued to cancel the remainder of the contract on the basis that it
was an illegal one. Although a state judge in Huntsville ruled in
the state's favor, a Texarkana appeals court overturned the ruling.
Then last week the Texas Supreme Court agreed to review the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments allege that VitaPro Foods paid Collins at least
$20,000 while Collins was still at the helm of TDCJ in exchange for
giving Barry a five-year contract extension to buy the foodstuff.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also alleges that Collins and Barry conspired to
conceal the payments by funneling them through Certified Technology
Consultants Inc., a company that Collins set up to receive the
payments. It also alleges that Barry was issued a TDCJ
identification card under a phony Social Security number at
Collins' directive.
</P>
<P>
   After resigning under pressure, Collins went to work for VitaPro
as a $1,000-a-day consultant, a job Collins allegedly had lined up
before leaving state employment. Barry, however, asked him to
resign after widespread news accounts of their business dealings
and state and federal investigations began. Collins then filed for
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' attorney has denied the allegations against his client.
Collins is facing a March 23 trial.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, each could face up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine on the conspiracy count; 10 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine on the bribery count; 20 years and a $5 million fine
on the money laundering charges; and five years and a $250,000 fine
on the fraud charges.

CONGRESSMAN SEEKS TO PREVENT RELEASE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Republican congressman called Thursday for the
removal of Immigration Commissioner Doris Meissner over the pending
release from crowded detention facilities of illegal immigrants
with criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this horror story goes forward, the commissioner's
credibility as a law enforcement officer would be shattered,'' said
Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas. The Immigration and Naturalization
Service denied that dangerous criminals would be released.
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of detention beds is forcing the INS to release
illegal immigrants who have served their sentences for non-violent
crimes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The request to fire Meissner drew a quick rebuke from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``She continues to serve with the full support and confidence of
the president,'' a White House spokesman said. ``Throughout her
tenure, the commissioner has demonstrated a firm commitment to the
agency, to increase service to immigrants, and to a compassionate
enforcement of this nation's immigration laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
immigration, sent a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno asking
her to block the release of ``criminal aliens.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, also signed by Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., said
the INS plan would flood neighborhoods with ``thousands of
deportable criminals who are likely to commit additional crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith urged Reno to block their release or fire Meissner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the INS fails in this critical mission, it is endangering
the safety of countless citizens throughout the United States,''
Smith wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Bergeron, an INS spokesman in Washington, said 93 percent
of the INS detention facilities nationwide are filled.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term detainees from countries without extradition treaties,
like Cuba, have tied up thousands of INS detention beds. The
Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to make room for 2,000 of
those detainees next year.
</P>
<P>
   But INS officials contend the crowding was partly created by
Smith's 1996 immigration reform bill that made it mandatory for the
agency to incarcerate illegal immigrants who have completed their
prison terms and hold them until a deportation decision is made.
</P>
<P>
   Before the law went into effect Oct. 9, 1998, INS had discretion
to release non-violent criminals awaiting deportation hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Criminals the INS wants to release to free detention space have
served time for non-violent crimes that include shoplifting,
possession of illegal drugs or violation of immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face a situation where we must reduce the number of beds we
are using,'' Bergeron said when the INS plan was first made public
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, meanwhile, has criticized the Clinton administration for
seeking only $22.5 million to build additional detention facilities
when a congressional report recommended the INS spend $80 million
for new housing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he blasted the administration for failing to
include 1,000 new Border Patrol positions in the budget for fiscal
2000, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the INS of having a ``bungled policy'' that has
prompted a wave of Central Americans to seek refuge in the United
States and with failing to enact a program that would place
immigration agents in the country's 100 largest county jails to
identify and detain ``criminal and illegal aliens.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron said the agency doubled the number of Border Patrol
agents from 4,000 in 1993 to 8,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The INS said it has tried to dissuade Central Americans without
documents and who were fleeing the damage of Hurricane Mitch from
seeking employment and shelter in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The county jail program, Bergeron said, is being implemented
with $10 million Congress ordered taken from the account that
supports detention facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doris Meissner is dedicated to this agency, dedicated to
advancing the immigration policy of this country and restoring
credibility to this nation's immigration law,'' Bergeron said.

 &HT;    Atlanta official feels `used' after AOL deal falls flat
 &HT;    By Kelly Simmons and Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cobb County Commission Chairman Bill Byrne, who
earlier said America Online would build a $500 million computer
center in Smyrna, now says the company won't locate in the Atlanta
area and is trying to get a better deal in Virginia. The company is
looking elsewhere, said Byrne, despite millions of dollars worth of
incentives offered in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the business decision, but I resent being used,''
Byrne said. ``The next time around, I am going to be very reluctant
to offer anything to anybody.'' The company's investment would have
included as many as 200 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, the largest commercial online service in the nation, has
about 16 million members. Revenue totaled $2.6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Byrne said AOL had chosen Smyrna over competing
sites in Charlotte, N.C., and Vienna, Va., near Washington D.C.
Byrne's comments surprised local and state economic development
recruiters, who typically try to keep potential deals quiet until
the company is ready to make an announcement.
</P>
<P>
   AOL officials never publicly confirmed interest in opening a
center in Georgia or anywhere else. That's still their public
posture. ``It's very premature to discuss any infrastructure growth
plans,'' AOL spokeswoman Wendy Goldberg said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   State economic development officials in Georgia, Virginia, and
North Carolina also declined comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne said AOL hasn't officially said no to Cobb's incentive
package. But it is apparent that local officials have lost hope of
landing the Dulles, Va.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne said the state and county agreed to a package of
incentives that they thought would seal the deal for AOL, including
purchase of a $5 million site for the company. He wouldn't reveal
other details of the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company knowingly and aggressively pursued the deal they
got. They said, `if you give us this and the state gives us this,'
we'll come,'' Byrne said. ``When they got as much as they could
squeeze out of everybody, they turned to Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kind of business people are not welcome in Cobb
County,'' he said. ``They are the type that bail out on you when
it's beneficial for them to go. I'm glad we found that out first
before we invested more money into them.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Cardoza, commissioner of the Georgia Department of
Industry, Trade &AMP; Tourism, declined to comment on AOL, but he said
companies do sometimes seek incentives in one community to use as
leverage elsewhere. ``That is not typically the situation,'' he
said. ``Their reputation and integrity is worth a lot more than a
handful of incentives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens, and that's unfortunate,'' said Vicki Horton, who
manages Deloitte &AMP; Touche's Fantus Consulting arm, which helps
companies with location decisions. Community officials should
resist announcing company projects early, Horton advised. ``We have
all seen deals go down the tubes even after they have signed.''

OLYMPIC MARKETING CHIEF REASSURES SPONSORS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   With the notable exception of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance
Co., the biggest Olympic sponsors are comfortable with Olympic
officials' handling of the corruption scandal, the Games' chief
marketing official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sponsors have been very supportive of the efforts we've
been making to date to clean up this problem,'' Dick Pound, an
International Olympic Committee vice president, said in a
conference call from New York. ``There is nobody that has
withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound voiced calm amid a rising tide of allegations, most
recently the addition this week of 10 IOC members' names to the
list of alleged wrongdoers. Fourteen IOC members had been
implicated previously.
</P>
<P>
   Pound sought to put a positive spin on criticisms by David
D'Alessandro, president of Boston-based John Hancock, that the IOC
still has not acted decisively enough to reverse the damage from
the two-month-old controversy. D'Alessandro said this week he was
canceling negotiations with NBC for $20 million in Olympic ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he thinks he's trying to help us,'' Pound said of
D'Alessandro. ``He has been for many years one of the most positive
of the Olympic sponsors. John Hancock has made fabulous use of that
sponsorship for the betterment of their business. I think he would
like very much to continue it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound added, however, that D'Alessandro's actions were
unnecessary. ``We are saying that even without that pressure we
would be doing the same thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock is one of 11 companies in the IOC's highest-level
sponsorship program; membership costs $40 million to $50 million in
exchange for use of the Olympic logo.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with with all 11 sponsors and NBC television at
the Hill &AMP; Knowlton public relations firm in midtown Manhattan
Thursday, IOC marketing director Michael Payne told reporters he
had assured the group there would be a ``total housecleaning'' of
the IOC. He said ``we will expel anybody who is found guilty,'' and
promised there will also be ``significant reforms,'' though he
declined to discuss specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said the sponsors, who were not available for comment,
were ``pleased'' with these assurances, and none are withdrawing
from their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Pound said the IOC would pursue the allegations
contained in the Salt Lake City ethics report released Tuesday,
which provided new details on the allegations of vote-buying and
influence-peddling surrounding the awarding of the 2002 Winter
Games.
</P>
<P>
   He rebuffed suggestions that the IOC deserved more blame for
failing to rein in members accused of the most egregious excesses.
For instance, the ethics report said Jean-Claude Ganga of the
Republic of Congo made at least a half-dozen trips to Utah, brought
along several family members, ran up huge bills, and arranged for
an assortment of free medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly were not wilfully blind,'' he said. ``We didn't
know about it. It's not the sort of thing the member involved talks
about . . . It came as a huge surprise to us to see the magnitude
of what was involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said he still hoped the Olympic cleanup could be completed
in time for a special IOC meeting scheduled for March 17 and 18 in
Lausanne, Switzerland. Then, when the IOC meets again in June to
choose the site of the 2006 Winter Games, the worst of the scandal
will begin to recede into history, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a higher standard expected of the Olympic
Games generally and the IOC in particular,'' Pound said. ``I think
the vast majority of our members adhere to those higher standars.
It appears that some of our members have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Those members, he said, would face the ``ultimate sanction,''
expulsion from the IOC.

MIT STUDENT STANDOUT WINS INVENTOR PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Md.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ A Massachusetts Institute of Technology
graduate student who at age 32 has already made a career's worth of
inventions was honored Thursday with a $30,000 prize that is
considered one of MIT's most prestigious student honors.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel J. DiLorenzo, a Maryland native who at age 2 1/2 asked,
``What is the color of electricity?'' _ and opened up wall sockets
to find out _ was honored with the fifth annual Jerome H. Lemelson
student prize, intended to identify and promote premier young
inventors.
</P>
<P>
   By grade school, DiLorenzo was designing complicated robots with
moving hands and infrared sound transmission systems. And as an MIT
undergraduate earning an electrical engineering degree in just
three years he patented an electronic moisture-sensing device with
an alarm to train children not to wet the bed _ and built a company
selling the Sleep Dry System.
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo is now completing work to earn both an M.D. and PhD in
June, as well as possibly a master's degree in technology
management from MIT's Sloan School. In July he will begin training
in Utah as a neurosurgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, DiLorenzo's principal focus is developing prosthetic
limbs that, through complex connections to people's nerves, would
register sensation and someday respond to neural messages
transmitted from the brain to move accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan is a consummate inventor whose talents are broad,'' said
Martha L. Gray, co-director of the joint Harvard-MIT division of
health science and technology. ``The impact on clinical medicine of
the devices that Dan has already invented is potentially
enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo said he hopes after his seven-year residency to go
into practice as a neurosurgeon while continuing to work on
inventions, particularly advanced prostheses he is now writing
about for his MD thesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of synergy in combining the two,''
DiLorenzo said in an interview Thursday. ``The time is becoming
ripe for the two fields to integrate.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the practical benefits DiLorenzo hopes to achieve by
creating prostheses that register sensation would be, for example,
to help someone using an artificial hand to drink a glass of water
be able to feel whether they had a sure grip on the glass, without
having to constantly look to make sure.
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate that roughly half of all people with artificial
limbs are dissatisfied with the way they work, DiLorenzo said.
Making them feel and work more like natural limbs could allow
people with disabilities to live happier lives, said DiLorenzo, who
has also invented devices to help paraplegics walk and holds a
patent for a device to control brain and tissue swelling.
</P>
<P>
   Lemelson, who died two years ago, was one of the nation's most
prolific inventors, developing more than 500 patents including key
components of the Sony Walkman and home video recorders and
players.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Dorothy, endowed both the student prize and a
$500,000 Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award for inventors that
is given out each spring, as well as a professorship now held by
economist Lester C. Thurow, and the center for the study of
invention and innovation at the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what advice he would give to young inventors, DiLorenzo
said, ``Be persistent without limit in trying to find people'' to
serve as mentors. He mentioned the help he received from several
teachers as well as his parents, who in his youth made endless
trips to Radio Shack and hardware stores to help him buy parts for
robots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't stop asking. There are hopefully a lot of people out
there who are willing to help,'' DiLorenzo said. ``Keep knocking _
there are a lot of doors.''

Charles Johnson is the author of the novel ``Middle Passage'' and
``Dreamer: A Novel.'' 
 By CHARLES JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1950s, in a little African Methodist Episcopal church in
Evanston, Ill., I first heard our choir perform ``Lift Ev'ry Voice
and Sing.'' If memory serves, I was an 8-year-old seated on a hard
wooden bench between my parents, both wearing their go-to-meeting
best, and I remember asking my mother what this particular song was
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just listen,'' she said, gently elbowing me into silence as
the choir sang James Weldon Johnson's words, her voice filling
suddenly with the sort of respect she reserved for things hymnal
and holy. ``This,'' she informed me, ``is the Negro National
Anthem.''
</P>
<P>
   This, her tone said, is important.
</P>
<P>
   Mom's explanation that Sunday morning, and her reaction,
initially brought me more confusion than clarity. Didn't we, as
Americans, already have a national anthem? And why, I wondered, did
my mother, a bibliophile with the soul of an actress, a woman who
was wonderfully ironic, occasionally cynical and capable at times
of devastating scorn for whatever she saw as hypocritical and
phony, all but stand up and salute when this lay's last lines
alchemized the air?
</P>
<P>
   Its simplicity was deceptive. In a way I could not unlock 40
years ago, my mother was saying that it was necessary for me to
understand this poem if I wanted to grasp something essential about
her, my father _ and myself.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, during Black History Month, I believe now that her
affection for this ineluctable work, which celebrates its 100th
birthday next year on Feb. 12, consisted partly of a profound
appreciation for its perennial, much-honored place in black
culture, and partly of her deeply felt gratitude for the towering
figure, the (Harlem) Renaissance man, who produced it as, in his
own words, ``an incidental effort, an effort made under stress and
with no intention other than to meet the needs of a particular
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   James Weldon Johnson is best known for his poetry, his
stewardship of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People and his classic novel about the perils of passing
for white, ``The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man'' (first
published anonymously in 1912, then reissued with his authorship
acknowledged in 1927).
</P>
<P>
   But the spirit of his remarkable life, influential esthetics and
formidable political legacy is as fully contained in ``Lift Ev'ry
Voice and Sing'' as in his major literary and social contributions.
</P>
<P>
   If we wish to experience this generation-spanning poem as our
predecessors did, give it as a gift to our children and carry it
whole into the next century, then I suspect we must revisit often
Johnson's achievements and the values and vision bequeathed to us
by our ancestors who were born just a heartbeat after the abolition
of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   But one quickly discovers that Johnson's multidimensional career
resists brief recitation because he was blessed to live in a time
when black Americans believed they could do anything _ and did
everything _ regardless of the obstacles white people placed in
their way. (Indeed, Johnson's upbringing was so positive, he says,
that he developed ``an unconscious race-superiority complex.'')
</P>
<P>
   He was born in 1871 in Jacksonville, Fla., to a self-educated
father who was headwaiter at the St. James Hotel and a mother who
taught at Stanton Public School for Blacks. While attending Atlanta
University, Johnson himself taught the children of former slaves;
he wrote in his autobiography, ``Along This Way'' (1933), that this
experience ``marked the beginning of my knowledge of my own people
as a `race','' and it no doubt influenced his lifelong devotion _
as a man of letters, educator and political activist _ to ``the
folk.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it seems as if we are looking at the biography of two
men, or perhaps three, when we discover that Johnson and his
musician-brother, Rosamond, were, once they teamed up with Bob
Cole, remarkably successful songwriters for hit Broadway shows
(``The Maiden With the Dreamy Eyes,'' ``My Castle on the Nile,''
``Under the Bamboo Tree,'' ``The Congo Love Song''); that he read
law books in his leisure time and after some 20 months of doing
this became the first black person to pass the Florida Bar exam;
that during his graduate study at Columbia University he began
``The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man,'' then completed it while
serving as the United States Counsel in Venezuela (1906-1909) and
counsel to revolution-wracked Nicaragua (1909-1912); that he ran
the editorial page of The New York Age, a black, pro-Booker T.
Washington newspaper; and that, as field secretary of the NAACP, he
increased that organization's branches from 68 to 310.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in 1920, Johnson became the NAACP's first black general
secretary and lobbied for two years in Congress for the passage of
the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, which passed in the House but failed
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A luminous life, yes _ a cornucopia of creativity. After a
decade at the NAACP, after writing the important cultural study
``Black Manhattan'' (1930), editing landmark Harlem Renaissance
works like ``The Book of American Negro Poetry'' (1922) and
publishing volumes of verse, Johnson accepted the Adam K. Spence
Chair of Creative Literature at Fisk University.
</P>
<P>
   His restless intellect, elegant, gentleman's charm and protean
talents finally ended in an automobile accident while he was
vacationing in Maine on June 26, 1938.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was early in Johnson's life, during his years as principal of
the Stanton School in his hometown, that he composed ``Lift Ev'ry
Voice and Sing'' when he was asked to give an address for
celebrating Lincoln's birthday. ``I began preparing,'' he wrote,
``but I wanted to do something else ... I talked over with my
brother the thought I had in mind, and we planned a song to be sung
as a part of the exercises. We planned, better still, to have it
sung by schoolchildren _ a chorus of 500 voices.''
</P>
<P>
   In Johnson's brief account of the song's creation, it was a
hesitant muse that came to him and he groped his way through the
opening. ``I got my first line: Lift ev'ry voice and sing. Not a
startling line; but I worked along, grinding out the next five.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave the first stanza to Rosamond to set to music, then
without pen or paper, ``I paced back and forth on the front porch,
repeating the lines over and over to myself, going through all the
agony and ecstasy of creating.'' By the time he reached the final,
spiritually drenched stanza, he said, ``I could not keep back the
tears and made no effort to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing'' was all he'd hoped it might be and
fit the young Johnson's nascent esthetics, which emphasized the
fusion of western forms with black content in order to conjure a
new, universal vision of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I at once recognized the Kiplingesque touch in the two longer
lines (of the last stanza); but I knew that in the stanza the
American Negro was, historically and spiritually, immanent, and I
decided to let it stand as it was written.''
</P>
<P>
   With their assignment for the Stanton School completed, the
Johnson brothers, never ones to rest on their laurels, quickly
moved on to other projects and let, as he wrote in his
autobiography, ``both the song and the occasion pass out of our
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is one of the delicious ironies of an artistic life that
frequently the work a creator hopes will be his finest achievement
_ or his legacy _ winds up in history's dustbin while the
``lesser'' assignment he did in a day, without looking back,
becomes the gift that captures a people's American odyssey and
dreams for a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schoolchildren of Jacksonville kept singing the song,'' he
later realized. ``Some of them became schoolteachers and taught it
to their pupils.'' Within two decades it was de rigueur, ``pasted
in the backs of hymnals and the songbooks used in Sundays schools,
YMCAs,'' and it was ``sung in schools and churches throughout the
South and in other parts of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who lived to hear it ``fervently sung'' even by white
students at Bryn Mawr College, confessed, ``We wrote better than we
knew.''
</P>
<P>
   The song's greatest boost surely came when ``Lift Ev'ry Voice
and Sing'' was adopted by the NAACP (early in this century it was
popularly known as the Negro National Hymn), a fact that guaranteed
its wide distribution and longevity, but also might have
contributed to its insouciant reception by some blacks in the last
three decades of the post-civil rights era when the NAACP was seen
as bourgeois, old-fangled and corny by younger, more militant
activists.
</P>
<P>
   One hears, for example, far more references these days to the
seven principles of Kwaanza than to the Negro National Hymn _ in
fact, the very word ``Negro'' in its title dates it as a pre-1960s
document.
</P>
<P>
   However, this song accomplishes the unlikely feat of
transcending the age-old antinomies of integrationism vs. black
nationalism, and left vs. right. It wears quite well, one decade
after another, because in some 30-odd highly compressed lines
Johnson invokes the ``gloomy past'' of America's 244 years as a
slave state (1619 to 1863), acknowledging not only this horror that
brought a fledging nation to the Civil War, but also ``the blood of
the slaughtered,'' the victims of the middle passage and the
Peculiar Institution whose lives, sacrifices and struggle for
liberation must never be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   But notice this: ``Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing'' does not morbidly
dwell on that ``dark past,'' like a sick man fingering his wounds,
or see it as defining for the future; it does not catalog in
mind-numbing detail every act of evil and dehumanization visited
upon people of African descent, for blacks in Johnson's generation
(like W.E.B. Dubois) were forward-looking, full of pride and faith
in their own efficacy and genius.
</P>
<P>
   No, while the the ``chast'ning rod'' is remembered _ vividly by
blacks in 1900 _ that past is not paralyzing. Rather, those who
sang these words realized they had at last ``come to the place for
which their fathers sighed,'' though the challenges and dangers
they faced as a group were far from over.
</P>
<P>
   They knew, those who kept this song alive, that America was
their ``native land,'' indeed, that its history from the colonial
period through Reconstruction was patently inconceivable without
their influential presence in the country's economy, culture and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   In point of fact, they were a new people combining the promise
of both the Old World and this brash, constitutional republic _
``omni-Americans,'' in the writer Albert Murray's view. Yet in its
last heartfelt lines we, as a people, are urged to stay ``in the
path'' of morality and dignity, to fight on in the name of freedom
but not to lose our souls in that secular quest, to fulfill the
covenant handed to us by our predecessors and remain as God-fearing
as the ancestors we honor ``lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of
the world, we forget Thee ... ''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   My mother, I believe, knew these idealistic stanzas spoke _ and
would continue to speak _ directly to ``the souls of black folks.''
And she was, as usual, right in hinting that if I wanted even a
rudimentary understanding of what empowered my father to sometimes
work three jobs in the 1960s to support his family, what shored up
my great-uncle, a general contractor, to build churches and
residences for black people all over the North Shore area, and what
kept her own mother ``in the path,'' working indefatigably for the
well-being and future of her daughter and grandchild, then I _ like
those who came before me _ was obliged to sing this beautiful song,
too.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, I did. And 40 years later, the song is still being
sung in schools and churches, especially in the South. Even my
daughter Elizabeth, who is now 17, can recite the song, which she
was taught while attending a predominantly white elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   In his preface to ``The Book of American Negro Poetry,'' James
Weldon Johnson stated, with a syncretism that must have pleased
Ralph Ellison: ``What the colored poet in the United States needs
to do is something like what Synge did for the Irish; he needs to
find a form ... expressing the imagery, the idioms, the peculiar
turns of thought and the distinctive humor and pathos, too, of the
Negro, but which will also be capable of voicing the deepest and
highest emotions and aspirations, and allow of the widest range of
subjects and the widest scope of treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   In his rich contributions, especially `Lift Ev'ry Voice and
Sing,'' elder Johnson gave Americans, black and white, that rarest
of literary gifts _ a song worthy of singing for a century. &QL;

ADMINISTRATION IMPOSES MORATORIUM ON NEW LOGGING ROADS IN NATIONAL
FORESTS
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Thursday suspended the
construction of new logging roads in most of the undeveloped back
country of the national forests, decisively shifting forest policy
toward conservation after a year of heated public debate.
</P>
<P>
   The move sets the stage for a comprehensive review of long-term
forest policy. The administration wants to look at not only the
remote roadless areas affected by the suspension but also at other
areas that are excluded from the moratorium and at the even larger
expanses that are already crisscrossed by an estimated 400,000
miles of roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some frontiers are not to be conquered,'' Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman said, expressing bluntly that the
administration no longer wants to make logging and other
development the main purpose of the national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Road building will be suspended for 18 months, temporarily
protecting about 33 million acres of publicly owned land. The
moratorium, in effect, began more than a year ago, when the
suspension was proposed in January 1998. Meanwhile, the agency
collected some 50,000 comments from the public and felt the ire of
powerful logging interests and their allies in Congress, but it
built few new roads, if any, in the roadless areas.
</P>
<P>
   The timber industry and lawmakers from the West who favor
logging and other development on public lands called the plan
irresponsible. But environmental advocates said it was just a first
step toward permanently protecting all forests where there has been
no logging, mining or grazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their long-term vision is to accede to the extremists,
which is basically to get everyone out of the forest,'' said W.
Henson Moore, the head of the American Forest Products Association,
aa trade association that represents timber and paper companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a state with huge undeveloped
forests, said the proposal ``has been widely unpopular and severely
disrupted Idaho's rural communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservation groups said they would work during the moratorium
to seek permanent protection for all areas without roads and to
shape the agency's policies in areas that already have roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protecting existing roadless areas isn't enough,'' said David
Bayles, conservation director of the Pacific Rivers Council, an
environmental group in Eugene, Ore. ``Restoration is needed as
well. With a real change in direction, the Forest Service could
begin to reverse some of the damage from the past and start to heal
the places that need it most _ the lightly roaded but still
relatively healthy watersheds that support sensitive species such
as grizzly bears and native cutthroat trout.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The administration made few significant changes to its initial
proposal for a moratorium. Several large forests where new
management plans are already in place or proposed were exempted;
among them are the Tongass National Forest in Alaska and the
Pacific Northwest forests where a dispute over logging in the
habitat of the imperiled spotted owl was settled several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the national forests include about 192 million acres, of
which about 35 million acres of land without roads are already
protected by wilderness status. About 33 million acres of
additional roadless areas, mostly in tracts of 5,000 acres or more,
will be protected by the moratorium; about 8 million acres of this
land are actually suitable for logging.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 million acres of roadless areas in several national
forests were excluded from the moratorium, but even some of that
land will not be open for road building because of other
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation groups complained that some relatively small
undeveloped areas were not protected by the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some areas in the Sierra Nevada deserving protection will not
be spared from logging and road building,'' said Brian Vincent, a
California organizer for American Forests, a conservation group.
For example, he said, Devils Canyon in the Tahoe National Forest,
which contains the largest stand of old growth in Nevada County but
is not protected because it is smaller than the 5,000-acre minimum
set by the administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 people have commented on the road building
moratorium in the past year, and the agency is likely to consider
many more comments on its long-term road building policies in the
months ahead, agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the moratorium would defer 200 to 300 miles
of roads that might otherwise have been built and would probably
reduce the amount of timber cut in national forests during the next
18 months by about 200 million board feet. Each year, the agency
sells about 4 billion board feet of wood from national forests.
</P>
<P>
   But agency officials said that only a few hundred jobs would be
lost and that the overall economic harm would be relatively slight
_ an estimated $22 million to $33 million _ because much of the
demand for wood would be filled instead by private landowners.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the administration eventually decides to manage
areas that are still free of roads, it must also struggle with
managing those parts of the forest that are already full of roads.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the roads were originally built for logging trucks, but
now carry an estimated 1.7 million vehicles a day: mostly mundane
rural traffic, but also visitors to the national forests. Fewer
than half the roads meet safety and environmental standards. The
Forest Service says it has a maintenance backlog of $8.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is seeking $123 million for road
maintenance in the forests next year, an increase of about 25
percent, but this amount is nowhere near what is needed to make
necessary repairs. Therefore, the agency faces some decisions _
which roads should be improved and which shut down.

   NEW YORK _ Here is a selective listing by critics of The New
York Times of new or noteworthy movies currently playing in
theaters. Running times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AFFLICTION,' starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe,
Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114
minutes). Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as
Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle
with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Coburn,
terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago
cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Schrader, this pure,
unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks' novel starts on a
deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury.
Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play
the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE,' &UR;  &LR; starring James Woods and Melanie
Griffith. Directed by Larry Clark (R, 101 minutes). From the
director of the bruising and ominous ``Kids,'' this vibrant,
unapologetically seedy road movie is a virtual day at the beach.
Clark's second feature may not have the sting of his first, but it
comes closer to establishing him as William S. Burroughs with a
swooping, pivoting movie camera, bringing bizarrely innocent
enthusiasm to material that might otherwise ooze druggy shock
value, and making decadence as basic as the weather. Woods, as a
junkie, thief and absurdly unlikely father figure, revels in this
full-throttle role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AT FIRST SIGHT,' starring Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino. Directed
by Irwin Winkler (PG-13, 128 minutes). In this overlong and often
desperately banal version of a case study reported by Dr. Oliver
Sacks, Kilmer plays a man whose nearly lifelong blindness was
suddenly alleviated by surgery. Ms. Sorvino plays the bright-eyed
New York career woman who falls in love with him, then urges him to
change his once-peaceful life. But the film brings little more than
case-study data to communicating how this man's restored sight
affected him, or what made it a mixed blessing. Sample dialogue:
``Have you ever listened to the rain? I mean, really listened?''
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CENTRAL STATION,' &UR;  &LR; starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de
Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115
minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older
woman crosses paths with an orphaned young boy. There's plenty of
room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all
in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then
embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's
hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings great
tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey.
Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's
very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A CIVIL ACTION,' &UR;  &LR; starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall.
Directed by Steven Zaillian (PG-13, 120 minutes). This story of a
David-Goliath lawsuit against industrial polluters, with Travolta
first-rate as an ambulance chaser who develops a conscience, could
have been business as usual in the legal thriller genre. But
Zaillian's keenly observed, beautifully acted film, based on
Jonathan Harr's nonfiction best seller about a case in Woburn,
Mass., doesn't follow familiar formulas. It follows all the
surprises and frustrations of a story that was never black and
white and is all the better for its shades of gray. Duvall is
outstanding as a corporate lawyer full of wily tricks (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GODS AND MONSTERS,' &UR;  &LR; starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a performance
that well deserves to be remembered at Academy Award time, McKellen
becomes the deliciously urbane James Whale, depicting the gay
``Frankenstein'' director late in life. Shaken by the aftereffects
of a mild stroke, this Whale finds his past coming back to greet
him just as the present offers new fascination in the Adonis-like
form of the gardener (Fraser, also fine), whom Whale finds mowing
his lawn. This beautifully acted, witty and heart-tugging film,
from a Christopher Bram book, imagines what Whale's final days
might have been like while shaping a splendid character study and a
droll portrait of closeted gay Hollywood. Lynn Redgrave provides
ballast and comic relief as Whale's perpetually scandalized
housekeeper (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HILARY AND JACKIE,' &UR;  &LR; starring Emily Watson and Rachel
Griffiths. Directed by Anand Tucker (R, 121 minutes). The parallel
biographies of the brilliant cellist Jacqueline du Pre (Ms.
Watson), who contracted multiple sclerosis at the height of her
career, and her slightly older sister, Hilary (Ms. Griffiths), a
talented flutist who gave up a professional career to marry and be
``ordinary,'' is one of the most insightful studies of sibling
rivalry ever filmed. Jacqueline may have won fame and glory, the
movie says, but she remained a desperately needy emotional child
who had to have everything Hilary had (including Hilary's husband).
The film is structured like a concerto, in three movements, the
last of which ends with Jackie's harrowing death in her sister's
arms. The drama is deepened by a soundtrack that makes expert use
of Jacqueline's signature piece, the Elgar Cello Concerto in E
minor. Ms. Watson's Jacqueline flames with an almost scary
intensity (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `MY NAME IS JOE,' &UR;  &LR; starring Peter Mullan and Louise Goodall.
Directed by Ken Loach (R, 92 minutes). A splendid, feisty
performance by Mullan energizes this film about a recovering
alcoholic trying to rebuild his life. With humor and scrappy
intensity, Joe throws himself into coaching young athletes and
embarking tenuously on a love affair, only to find the expected
challenges to his new sobriety everywhere. Loach's commitment to
delineating social issues is accentuated by the way his star
breathes life into Joe and makes viewers root for his success.
Special bonus: this film breaks the brogue-and-burr barrier by
including helpful subtitles for the overlapping, heavily
Scottish-accented dialogue (Maslin).

INVESTORS UNCERTAIN ABOUT OFFER FOR LYCOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY AND ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proposed merger of Internet portal service Lycos Inc. with
major assets of Barry Diller's USA Networks Inc. fell into crisis
Thursday as Lycos' largest shareholder wavered in its support.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI Inc. of Andover, Mass., which owns 22 percent of Lycos,
withdrew its support for the deal Thursday morning, only to offer a
lukewarm endorsement later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors also criticized the agreement for failing to
provide an adequate short-term profit to Lycos shareholders, even
as they admitted that the merger could prove quite profitable in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's potentially a great merger in the way the parts fit
together...but I'm happy that it's probably not going to go
through,'' said Michael Goldston, principal of Cambridge Equity
Advisors Inc. in Nashville, Tenn. His firm owns about 100,000
shares in Lycos and about 65,000 shares in CMG. ``Long-term, the
deal could be great. But people don't buy Internet stocks for
long-term gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger was announced on Tuesday. Over the next two days,
Lycos stock lost nearly a third of its value, falling from 127 1/4
on Monday to 87 1/4 on Wednesday as investors balked over the
complex deal that offered a low premium for Lycos shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Then Thursday morning, David Wetherell, chief executive of CMGI,
a venture capital firm that specializes in investing in Internet
businesses, issued a statement that seemed to put the deal on life
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our long term view of the Lycos deal remains very positive,''
said Wetherell. ``However, the deal must overall be accretive to
Lycos shareholders, including CMGI. Until the stock returns to a
level which provides the premium that Lycos shareholders expect, we
will not vote our shares in favor of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But CMGI's position softened later in the day, perhaps because
of a strong rebound in Lycos shares. Hours after its first
statement, CMGI issued a milder one: ``CMGI confirmed today that it
is generally supportive of the Lycos/USA Networks transaction as
previously reported, but reserves the right to reassess its
position as developments unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Networks CEO Barry Diller was taken aback by CMGI's
uncertain stance on the merger. ``We can't imagine that they could
possibly be this reactionary,'' Diller said, arguing that the fall
in Lycos' stock price merely reflected investors' confusion over
the complexity of the deal. ``There was a tremendous turndown in
Lycos stock because, I believe, Lycos shareholders did not
understand the transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Diller insisted that the plan to merge Lycos with USA Networks'
Home Shopping Network, Internet Shopping Network and Ticketron
Online brought more real value to investors than other
highly-touted Internet deals. ``I believe...that this is actually
one of the first sound Internet transactions that has taken
place.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one investment firm agreed. Paul Noglows of the
investment firm Hambrecht &AMP; Quist Thursday raised his rating on
Lycos from ``buy'' to ``strong buy.'' breaking ranks with five
other analysts who have downgraded Lycos stock since the merger was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Noglows said the Lycos-USA Networks deal made good business
sense. But he added, ``we also believe there is significant upside
in the stock even if the deal is restructured or ultimately falls
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Lycos stock rallied sharply on Thursday, along with other
Internet issues that have been battered this week. Lycos shares
closed up $16 at $103 1/4 on the Nasdaq stock exchange. CMGI gained
$19 15/16 to $112, while USA Networks rose $ 3/4 to $40, all on the
Nasdaq stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ullas Naik, who tracks Internet stocks for First Albany
Corp. in Boston, thinks Lycos' Thursday runup may not save the deal
as currently structured. ``The CMG guys aren't stupid,'' said Naik.
``They're not going to give away money.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the original merger terms, USA Networks shareholders were
to get between 56.5 and 61.5 percent of the shares of the new
company, while Lycos shareholders would get only 30 to 35 percent,
depending on the new firm's market valuation. Naik said that in
order to save the deal, Diller, Wetherell and Lycos CEO Bob Davis
may reslice the pie to give more stock to Lycos investors. ``It
depends on how badly these three parties want to make this deal
happen,'' Naik said.
</P>
<P>
   Naik said that if the deal collapses, Lycos' credibility as a
business partner would be damaged. On the other hand, it would mean
that Lycos would once again be on the market, and be still able to
command a high price. ``They now have the option to renegotiate
with some of the other players.''
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, whose stock ran up in recent weeks becuase of speculation
it was a takeover target, has previously confirmed partnership
discussions with a host of other media companies. Though the
Waltham, Mass. company has never identified these other firms,
industry analysts believe they may include the NBC and CBS
television networks, and the Time Warner media conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Several Internet portfolio managers said CMG's change of heart
indicates the increasingly short-term outlook of Internet
investors, whose appetite has been whetted by a series of recent
mergers that gave high premiums to Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Even managers who thought the Lycos deal with USA Networks had
long-term potential said they hoped it wouldn't be completed under
the original terms because of the relatively small premium it
offered initial investors.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ely, portfolio manager at Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co. in Boston
said he expected the deal would need to be restructured to gain
more support among Lycos and CMG investors. ``I think there was a
general feeling that Barry Diller had done a great thing for his
shareholders and not necessarily for Lycos shareholders,'' said
Ely. He sold shares in the company last year.
</P>
<P>
   CMG's change in direction pleased other holders. Because USA
Networks' stock trades as a much lower multiple than Lycos', the
deal's initial terms were ``kind of shocking,'' said Alexander
Cheung, portfolio manager of the Monument Internet Fund, in
Bethesda, Md, which owns about 5 percent of CMG. ``If it were a
cash deal this would be fine, but that's not what they're getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the market's saying the deal is going backwards, and that's
probably why they (CMG) had to act,'' Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos chief executive Bob Davis spent the day in New York and
Boston discussing the deal with major investors and market
analysts. He pointed to the second CMGI statement as proof that the
merger is alive and well. ``I think this is what they felt all
along,'' Davis said. Davis also viewed the run-up in Lycos stock as
evidence that investors are coming to recognize its worth. ``I
think the market is beginning to understand the value of this
transaction,'' he said.

 NEW YORK: dialogue (Maslin).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `PATCH ADAMS,' &UR;  &LR; starring Robin Williams and Monica Potter.
Directed by Tom Shadyac (PG-13, 110 minutes). As a maverick doctor
intent on making terminal patients laugh, Williams delivers a
little clowning and a lot of maudlin feel-good sentiment, along
with vulgarity left over from the filmmaker's ``Ace Ventura'' days.
He also spends a lot of time being congratulated for his good
works, as the film's minor players are kept busy marveling at his
antics. The real-life story of this doctor may sound like a fine
excuse for Williams to cut loose, but the film version proves
narrow and predictable. Ms. Potter, with a nostrilly resemblance to
Julia Roberts, figures in a romantic subplot with a bizarre twist
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PAYBACK,' &UR;  &LR; starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry. Directed by
Brian Helgeland (R, 110 minutes). In this inept, excessively
sadistic film-noir spoof adapted from the same Richard Stark novel
(``The Hunter'') that inspired the 1967 genre classic ``Point
Black,'' Gibson is a thief named Porter who retaliates with a
vengeance after an attempt on his life. Determined to recover
$70,000 that was stolen from him by a double-crossing partner in
crime, he works his way up the pecking order of a crime syndicate
brutally dispatching all who stand in his way. The hard-boiled
dialogue is ludicrous, the storytelling clunky, the acting fair to
awful, the gore ankle-deep. Credit the star with being able to keep
a straight face through this loathsome mess (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE PRINCE OF EGYPT,' &UR;  &LR; starring the voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph
Fiennes and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve
Hickner and Simon Wells (PG, 93 minutes). First came the great
expectations for this animated magnum opus from Dreamworks. Then
came reality, in a film struggling mightily to balance animated
whimsy and biblical stature. The upshot is an admirably worthy
rendering of the Exodus story, even if Moses must initially be seen
as a playful young scamp. Biblical plagues and miracles serve as
special inspiration for the animators' reality-bending ingenuity
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `RUSHMORE,' &UR;  &LR; starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia
Williams. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 93 minutes). A dryly
hilarious portrait of the mogul as a young man, with Schwartzman a
real find as its perfectly horrid little hero, Max Fischer. Max's
prep school, Rushmore Academy, does have a faculty, but none of the
grown-ups have anything like Max's natural authority. Murray is
sneakily fine as the steel tycoon and Rushmore benefactor who
happens to be on Max's own wavelength as they vie for the same
beautiful teacher. A particular treat for its skewed, outrageously
funny memories of a cutthroat boyhood (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,' &UR;  &LR; starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth
Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench. Directed by
John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate
delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets
better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc
Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp
dialogue reminiscent of his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are
Dead,'' dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between
Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain
aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy
envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting
and conniving we enjoy today, and has great fun presenting the
creation of ``Romeo and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms.
Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first
great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A SIMPLE PLAN,' &UR;  &LR; starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and
Bridget Fonda. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 120 minutes). This onetime
cult horror director makes a flawless transition to mainstream
storytelling with a quietly devastating thriller. And its fine cast
plays out the consequences of a harmless-sounding error in judgment
that winds up leveling everything in its path. The catalyst is $4.4
million that literally falls out of the sky, and Scott B. Smith's
story proves how deadly the morality of expediency can become. When
you get the shivers watching this wintry tale, which features an
especially memorable performance from Thornton, it won't be from
the cold (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `STEPMOM,' &UR;  &LR; starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed
Harris. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG-13, 120 minutes). A man's
ex-wife and new girlfriend lock horns over who can be nicer to his
two children, in a sudsy story made livelier by its two female
stars, both in appealingly high gear. Ms. Roberts plays the nicest
person ever to wear black to a downtown photo shoot, while the
especially fiery Ms. Sarandon plays the suburban mother as mama
lion. Even when the prospect of mortality looms, the story manages
to maintain its big, lavish look and peculiar (under the
circumstances) sense of fun. As in ``Home Alone,'' Columbus directs
with sunny indifference to reality, medical, economic or otherwise
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE THIN RED LINE,' &UR;  &LR; starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick
Nolte and Sean Penn. Directed by Terrence Malick (R, 166 minutes).
From the first frame of this huge, drifting war epic loosely
derived from James Jones' Guadalcanal novel, it's viscerally clear
that Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached visual style
that made ``Badlands'' and ``Days of Heaven'' the most beautiful
films of the 1970s is instantly apparent here, even if the
narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar. The
film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual poetry,
the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter editing.
Bottom line: no one who admired Malick's early work should miss
this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it here
(Maslin).

PILOTS IGNORE JUDGE'S ORDER, AMERICAN STILL IN TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines pilots ignored a judge's back-to-work order
Thursday, with thousands calling in sick and grounding more than
half the airline's flights _ the most since the sickout began over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The airline canceled 1,170 of its 2,250 daily flights Thursday,
as passengers whose travel plans were disrupted by the dispute
fumed.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines, the nation's second largest carrier, sought
to have the pilots union held in contempt. A hearing was scheduled
for this morning.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,400 of its 9,200 pilots had called in sick before US
District Court Judge Joseph Kendall in Dallas on Wednesday issued a
temporary restraining order telling them to go back to work. Some
of those pilots had not returned to work Thursday, and it was not
clear when they would be back, AMR Corp., the Texas-based parent of
American Airlines, said.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, 17 flights were canceled at Logan International
Airport, resulting in long lines and crowds as passengers waiting
to reschedule their flights or switch to other airlines. ``Right
now, I guess, the ball is in the pilots' court,'' said Phil
Orlandella, director of media relations for Logan Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not know which cancellations were caused by
previous sick calls or stemmed from calls that came in after the
court order was issued. ``A large number of cancellations were
expected because of a carryover from the sick calls we received
from previous days,'' AMR spokesman Tim Smith said in a taped
recording.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to determine whether the sick calls are
improving,'' Smith added. ``We look to the Allied Pilots
Association to communicate to its members that the pilots have a
legal obligation to return to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied president Richard LaVoy said he had advised all pilots to
return to work and abide by the court order.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both sides resumed talks Thursday for the first time
since union and management deadlocked last week over the company's
refusal to immediately add 300 pilots from Reno Air Inc., which AMR
recently purchased, to its salary roster. AMR has said it will take
up to 18 months to fully integrate the new pilots and will cost
approximately $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since the job action began last Saturday, more than 350,000
passengers have been stranded and 3,500 flights have been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the company noted that even if the pilots returned to
work immediately, cancellations would continue for the next several
days due to logistical issues and scheduling demands that require
the company to move flights and crews to various cities as the need
arises.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law prohibits pilots from striking they can
call in sick if they believe they are being subjected to undue
emotional distress or tensions.
</P>
<P>
   However, earlier this week Judge Kendall warned the pilots that
they would be found in contempt of court if they did not obey his
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you call in sick, and you're not really sick, you're a
liar,'' the judge said. Kendall also sharply criticized the company
for seeking a temporary restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's silly to even be here,'' he said. ``It's like killing a
gnat with a sledgehammer.''
</P>
<P>
   American said it would offer full refunds on all tickets, or
help passengers reschedule if they have travel arrangements through
Monday. Delta, TWA, and several other airlines have accepted the
stricken airline's tickets and have waived change-of-flight charges
as part of an agreement between the airlines.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-CHEROKEE (Undated) _ ``Ask the man who owns one,''
Packard used to advise, on the theory that a satisfied customer
provided the most believable kind of advertising. So ask me about
the Jeep Grand Cherokee, two of which have have joined my household
over the last four years. You can fool some of the people some of
the time, but 55,000 miles of hard driving will uncover most
serious flaws. I am happy to report that the Grand Cherokees I know

_ have performed admirably. By James G. Cobb.

been around about as long as automobiles. And until recently, they
haven't changed radically. But with the rekindling of interest in
four-wheel drives due to the popularity of sport utilities and
pickup trucks combined with advancements in sophisticated
electronics, four-wheel-drive systems are changing. An innovation
likely to catch on is one used on some versions of the 1999 Jeep
Grand Cherokee. The Grand Cherokee equipped with the new
Quadra-Drive four-wheel-drive system marks the industry's first use
of this new system. By Michelle Krebs.

COMMENTARY: LA COMMEDIA E FINITA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, what a pity, what a pity _ the Senate performance is ending
when we are still enjoying the artistry of turning a national drama
into comedy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That was difficult to achieve, turning Hamlet's soliloquy into a
Grouchoian shtick, but they did it. It took all the Senate's
self-adoration and pomposity, all its arthritic 18th-century
regulations and the talent to switch between treating them as
biblical pronouncements and discarding them as garbage, all its
loose-jointed ability to kneel before political pressure, all its
tradition of talking bipartisanship while practicing gang warfare.
There were brave senators, but as a body they marched to nowhere
with a practiced rhythm not seen since the glory days of the
Rockettes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But of course they could not put together all by themselves this
demonstration of simultaneously ducking, weaving and blabbering
into the oblivion of evasion.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Performance and artistes were organized and put on stage by the
majestic theatrical skills, by which he governs, of the man
senators harrumph as William Jefferson Clinton.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You see, the whole Senate song-and-dance was a plot created by
Bill William Jefferson after the House sent its act of indictment
to the Senate for verdict. Now, I have no reliable sources for
this. I do not even have the spokesman sources tax-paid to pass on
information to the public. (Now we in the press routinely allow
spokesmen the anonymity that would have driven me into paroxysms of
snarls when I was an editor.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But I have something better _ my own brain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brain tells me that surely the senators could not have learned
all those neat tricks themselves. Republican leaders must have been
taught the idiocy of preventing some of the most important
witnesses from testifying, even on tape _ like the presidential
secretary who could have cleared up the question as to how much he
coached her about how he and Monica were never alone. Surely
members of both parties could not have learned at their mamas'
knees how to demand privacy of voting but rush to the corridor
microphones to announce what they said and how they voted.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it was not Democratic genetics to renounce the ethical
meaning of everything they had said about no man being above the
law and all that jazz. Brain says only one man in the country had
the theatrical genius to do all that, Bill W.J. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man had similar hits before. In his Playbill listing are the
bland baby-faced demonstrations of double-crossing the victims of
human rights in China and Tibet and Africa, crossing the high wire
between saying he would never send American troops into Bosnia and
now keeping them there indefinitely, and the cool gall to give a
long State of the Union barely mentioning Iraq or anything but a
few cliches about other matters of foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Oscar of fighting legislation against
religious persecution abroad while marching into church with his
very own Bible every week. This man is good.
</P>
<P>
   So for some weeks the Senate conducted what was neither a trial
nor a hearing or ``Entertainment Tonight.'' Oh, poor Chief Justice
Rehnquist, how his stomach must have churned the while. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, hear ye, they became ready to decide that a president who
risked the presidency to scratch his itches on a junior employee,
who lied and lied, who commanded a cover-up in what is generally
known as obstruction of justice, was guilty of nothing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But however Congress failed, it was President Clinton who did
what he did and lied as he lied. It was he who put America through
hell, not Congress. Just as a presidential kleptomaniac out of
control, or a practicing drug addict, he risked the honor and
stability of the presidency.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, no escape from it, the American majority did not want him
punished, and goodness, the Senate cannot offend the majority, can
it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I do not think America would collapse, whatever the verdict.
Clinton may break his promises about religious and secular human
rights, and the fate of U.S. troops and security, but in the past
couple of years my life and belief in America have been enriched by
the number of Americans I hear from who will not forget. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``La commedia e finita,'' the clown Canio in ``Pagliacci'' cries
to watching peasants after he stabs his wife to death. The peasants
then dispersed; we won't.

ANALYSTS QUESTION KING ABDULLAH'S CLOUT TO PUSH PEACE WITH ISRAEL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Two years ago, fed up with what he said were the
anti-peace policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Jordan's King Hussein sent a strongly worded letter admonishing the
Israeli for actions that Hussein feared would threaten their
hard-won peace.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement never faltered. Nor did Hussein's commitment
to it.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter signaled that months of stalemate in
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations had dampened support for peace in
Jordan, where at least 60 percent of the people are of Palestinian
origin.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Hussein died Sunday, his eldest son, Abdullah, was
crowned king. Immediately, the 37-year-old former army general
pledged to follow the path of peace laid out by his father, and
Jordanian analysts said they believe that the new king intends to
keep his word.
</P>
<P>
   But what they wonder is whether Abdullah, unpracticed in
politics and unknown to most Jordanians, will have the force of
personality and the domestic political clout that allowed his
father to pursue warm relations with Israel even as popular support
for the treaty began to wane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The king was strong enough to defy public opinion,'' said
Radwan Abdullah, a Jordanian political consultant with the
Florida-based Middle East Consulting, Research and Analysis. He was
one of several experts who predicted that Abdullah will have a
tough time keeping alive public support for the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new king is a newcomer to political life,'' he said.
``He's bound to be much more cautious. I think there will some kind
of cooling off (in relations with Israel) at least for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Jordanians agree that peace with Israel in their interest.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the treaty helped to secure $225 million in annual
U.S. aid to Jordan and allowed the king to play an active role in
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, the peace talks at the heart of
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, Jordanians saw advantages, too. In the years since
the treaty was signed in 1994, for instance, tourism to Jordan has
increased, in part because so many Israelis came to see Petra, a
rose-tinted city carved out of desert rock by ancient Nubians.
</P>
<P>
   They expected trade with Israel, and with the West Bank in
particular, to follow suit. With a common language and close family
ties, cross-border business between Jordan and the West Bank seemed
a sure thing _ a ``fruit of peace'' the government initially
vigorously sold to engender popular support for the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Most Israeli analysts and some Jordanians say these benefits
will help to ensure that the fragile peace survives.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has shown strong support for King
Abdullah with the understanding that a prosperous Jordan can help
stabilize the region. The administration has already asked Congress
to increase aid to Jordan by $300 million over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, four years after Jordan signed a peace treaty with
Israel, most of the promised gains have not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's economy is stuck in recession, hard hit by the years of
United Nations-imposed sanctions on Iraq, which once was its
largest trading partner. Trade with the Israeli-occupied West Bank,
small in comparison and impeded by Israeli security checks, has not
made up for that loss.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations are way off
track. In October, there was a flicker of progress when the two
sides signed an agreement in Maryland. Days later, Israel handed
over more West Bank territory to the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, Netanyahu has frozen additional land transfers
agreed to in that accord, citing Palestinian non-compliance.
Israelis and Palestinians say they don't expect any progress toward
implementing the October agreement until after the Israeli
elections set for May 17 and June 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordanians are disappointed,'' said Sari Nasir, a sociologist
at the University of Jordan and one of an estimated 3 million
Jordanians of Palestinian origin. ``People expected Israel to
withdraw from the land. The fact that they haven't is an obstacle
to a warm peace, to closer ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Jordanians blame the negotiating stalemate on Netanyahu and
say that they hope one of his rivals, either Labor party leader
Ehud Barak or former Likud party defense minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, who heads a new centrist party, wins the election for
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Netanyahu wins, it will be a disaster,'' said the analyst
Abdullah. ``It will mean that the present impasse will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   At best, without progress in the West Bank, Jordanian-Israeli
relations will remain as low-level contacts in tourism and trade.
At worst, Jordanian syndicates and unions will be under increasing
pressure to sever ties with their Israeli counterparts _ making for
a peace similar to the one Israel has had with Egypt since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Rami Khoury, a political columnist for the Jordan Times,
cautioned against ``exaggerating'' the dangers of a stalemate. Most
Jordanians, he said, are willing to be patient. But others warn
that ultimately, faced with increasing opposition, King Abdullah
could have trouble promoting the kind of warm relations that made
Israelis feel they had finally found a partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a peace process dead in the water, it will make it
difficult (for the king) to sell it to the population,'' said one
foreign analyst. ``There's a domestic reality that people have to
consider.''

`SHAKER GIFTS, SHAKER GENIUS':   THE SAGA AND THE SHOW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Out of all proportion to their tiny numbers, the
Shakers (aka the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second
Appearing) left an amazing artistic legacy. For sheer simple
elegance, nothing matched the chairs, cupboards, wardrobes, tables,
boxes, baskets and other handicrafts they turned out, works whose
grace and harmony of design is today admired worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a Shaker how it was that he or she made simply beautiful
things, and you got a simple answer: the creative spirit was a gift
from God. The Trappist monk and poet Thomas Merton once suggested
that the perfection of a Shaker chair came from the maker's belief
that ``an angel might come and sit on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But these busy utopians had a lot more than handcrafts in mind,
as seen in ``Shaker Gifts, Shaker Genius: The Collections of the
Shaker Museum and Library'' at the Paine Webber Art Gallery, which
runs through April 2.
</P>
<P>
   As a self-isolated sect, they shunned what they called the
world's people, yet they were connected with mainstream America
through a bustling network of commercial enterprises that ranged
from the large-scale growing and marketing of seeds (they were the
first to sell seeds in colored paper packets) to the manufacture of
patent medicines. Driven by spiritual needs, they worked with
prodigious energy to maintain their tightly organized communities.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 400 objects on view _ rocking chairs, oval boxes,
bonnets, cloaks, washstands, woodworking tools, religious
paraphernalia, song sheets, documents, visionary drawings, maps,
historical prints, photographs and even a Shaker fire engine, made
in 1822 _ ``Shaker Gifts, Shaker Genius'' gives an unusually
rounded picture of this beehive sect. Chosen and arranged by Erin
M. Budis, curator of the Shaker Museum and Library in Old Chatham,
N.Y., the exhibits all come from the museum's extensive collection.
</P>
<P>
   The Shaker saga began in Britain in 1747 as an offshoot of a
Quaker revival movement. Its members were originally known as
Shaking Quakers for the dancing, shimmying and shouting that
signaled their religious ecstasy. The movement waxed under the
leadership of Ann Lee, who was raised in a British industrial slum
and considered herself a female incarnation of Christ's spirit.
</P>
<P>
   To escape what she saw as a corrupt society, she came to America
in 1774 with eight followers and two years later founded a ``heaven
on earth'' community at Watervliet, N.Y. A piece of the checked
linen dress she wore on the journey is displayed in the show.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Shaker meant living communally as Brothers and Sisters
while remaining celibate. (Children in the communities were usually
charitable wards or sent there by parents with problems.) Shared
rooms and other living spaces made for little privacy. A ``retiring
room'' set up in the show presents the bare essentials: a
curtained-off bed, a shared wardrobe chest, a tripod table with
candle, a washstand, a wood-burning stove and a woven rug. What
more did a good Shaker need?
</P>
<P>
   Besides celibacy, core principles of Shaker life were confession
of sin, common property, equality of the sexes and spiritual
revelation. Shakers believed in the dual gender of God; the male
principle was incarnated in Jesus, the female in Mother Ann (who
died in 1784).
</P>
<P>
   Communities were organized into groups of 80 or 90 ``families,''
each benignly ruled by two Elders and two Eldresses. The peaceful,
tolerant Shaker movement stayed vibrant in the United States for
nearly a century. At its peak in the 1840s, members numbered nearly
5,000, living in 18 communities from Maine to Kentucky. But after
1860, Shakerism began to decline, and today there are only half a
dozen members, living in the Sabbathday Lake community in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Shaker shows, which tend to deal in anonymities,
this one traces the lives of several Brothers and Sisters,
providing names, faces, biographical descriptions and samples of
their work. One was Sister Emma J. Neale (1847-1943), who lived in
the leading Shaker community at Mount Lebanon, N.Y., established in
1787 and referred to reverently as ``the Mount.'' Brought there
early in life by their parents, Emma and her sister, Sarah, became
part of the ``family'' known as Church.
</P>
<P>
   In 1888 Emma took over the cloak business started by another
Sister and built it into an important source of income for the
church family under the name ``Emma J. Neale &AMP; Company.''
``Company'' meant the Sisters who cut and sewed the cloaks, which
came in popular shades of broadcloth, had bonnet hoods and shoulder
capelets, and fell in long, elegant folds. (A number of cloaks are
on view in the show.)
</P>
<P>
   Emma had the design trademarked and promoted the cloaks through
advertising. At the same time she managed another major business,
the production, packaging and distribution of medicinal herb
tonics, including asthma cures, toothache pellets, laxatives and
Wild Cherry Pectoral Syrup.
</P>
<P>
   That familiar Shaker symbol, the ladderback chair, was a
moneymaker, too. A full line of chairs made by the New Lebanon
community could be ordered from a mail-order catalog distributed
nationwide. The catalog included not only conventional seating, but
Shaker rockers, commodes and wheelchairs. Shown here in an
attractive sampling, the chairs _ the only furniture produced by
the Shakers with significant sales to the outside world _ were so
successful that they were widely copied, and so they were
eventually marked with a bright gold Shaker trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Of more religious import, and definitely not for sale, were the
ethereal graphic works known as ``gift drawings,'' said to be the
products of divinely inspired visions. They are evidence of an
intense religious fervor that swept the Shaker communities from
1837 to 1850, and produced a spate of gifts or messages from the
spirits of departed Shakers, particularly Mother Ann. A
particularly beautiful specimen is ``From Mother Ann to Amy Reed,''
made by Sarah Bates at Mount Lebanon in 1848. Neatly arranged
colored emblems and writings fill the sheet: trees, fanciful birds
and flowers, religious symbols and heavenly musical instruments,
framed by a floral border.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Shaker skills waned as the communities lost members,
particularly men, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Shaker
Sisters took to making clothes, food and souvenirs that were sold
in Shaker gift shops and through catalogs. In the 1930s and 40s, a
last gasp of the old Shaker enterprise could be seen in the efforts
of Sisters at Canterbury, N.H., who prepared baked beans in a
wood-fired oven, then sold them from a truck whose back panel is on
view in the show.
</P>
<P>
   But the Shaker accomplishments remain as a bright chapter in
American folk history. They liven up even the pompous,
unaccommodating lobby space at Paine Webber that serves as their
gallery.

COMMENTARY: FATHERS AND SONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most striking thing about King Hussein's funeral was who did
and did not attend from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, Moammar Gadhafi sent his son and heir apparent, Seif
el-Islam. Hafez Assad went himself, instead of sending his son and
heir apparent, Bashar. Saddam Hussein could have sent his son and
heir apparent, Uday, but they weren't invited. Hosni Mubarak went
himself; I didn't notice if he brought his able son Gemal. King
Hassan of Morocco sent his son, Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed. Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia came himself and left his sons and
brothers to tend the store back home. Amir Isa of Bahrain came
himself and didn't send his son. Crown Prince Saad of Kuwait came
instead of his older cousin, the emir. They all came to pay homage
to King Hussein's son and heir, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the world was represented at the funeral
largely by elected leaders, the Arab world was represented almost
entirely by fathers and sons _ either kings and their sons or coup
leaders and their sons. While the rest of the world is empowering
its people to thrive in the information revolution, the Arab
leaders are still trying to buy stability by empowering their sons.
</P>
<P>
   Guys, a word of free advice: This ain't gonna work much longer.
</P>
<P>
   When I was in college, studying introductory Arabic, I still
remember the first two sentences I ever learned: ``The Nile River
is the biggest and longest river in the world,'' and ``Women are
half the nation.'' Alas, both sentences are still true, but only
one is actually believed in today's Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's Queen Noor had to watch from afar as her husband was
buried because women were not allowed at the funeral. The Arab
world is trying to enter the age of globalization with one and a
half hands tied behind its back: Its women in general are not being
empowered, and even many of its men are being frozen out of
participation.
</P>
<P>
   This in an era when Singapore has already hooked up every one of
its households to a high-speed, broadband Internet network, and has
just named ``Miss Internet Singapore,'' after a pageant in which
the winner was chosen on the basis of how well she could design a
Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these Arab leaders kept saying to Abdullah, `May you
follow in your father's footsteps,''' said Shibley Telhami, an
expert on international relations at the University of Maryland.
``But this is precisely the mindset that needs to be put behind us.
The notion that your sons should always follow in your footsteps
just isn't appropriate anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The one hopeful sign is that all these Arab kings and dictators
have lost their monopoly over information. It started with private
Saudi financiers setting up Arabic newspapers and a satellite
television station, the Middle East Broadcasting Centre, in London
_ from where they beamed back real, uncensored news into the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi financiers, though, made one mistake. At the urging of
their government, they used their private media to attack their
little neighbor Qatar for having been too aggressive in opening up
relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis forgot that in the era of globalization size doesn't
matter very much. So Qatar's emir _ whose whole country consists of
only 300,000 people _ authorized creation of a private Qatari
satellite television system, al-Jazeera TV, which is now the
freest, most widely watched TV network in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   It was al-Jazeera that broadcast Saddam Hussein's recent call
for the elimination of all the Arab leaders _ particularly the
Saudis _ at a time when no state-owned Arab television would
broadcast such a threat. Little Qatar's satellite station is now
driving the rest of the Arab world crazy, in between reruns from
the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The Arabs and Jews still need a peace process, but the Arab
world needs a modernization process even more. Look at Syria.
President Assad won re-election Thursday for a new seven-year term
with 99.98 percent of the vote. It's hard to believe anyone still
holds these phony elections. I mean, what's the point? The best you
can say about the Arab world today is that it is finally entering
its Gorbachev phase: It is trying glasnost without perestroika. It
is opening up to the world externally _ satellite TV and the peace
process with Israel _ but without much real internal restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab world desperately needs a country or leader able to
demonstrate that it is possible both to open up to the world and to
empower your people politically, economically and educationally,
without sparking instability. In the increasingly competitive relay
race that is today's global economy, if you are only fielding a
relay team of fathers and sons, there is no way _ no way _ you are
going to keep up.

MISMATCH SEEN BETWEEN CLINTON LAWYERS, MANAGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gulf between the courtroom talents of the two sides was so
vast, one attorney critical of the impeachment of President Clinton
said, that the House managers ``were embarked on a suicide mission
from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer, who thinks the charges against Clinton warranted
his removal, added that ``the kindest thing'' he could say about
the disparate abilities of the prosecutors and defenders was that
``it was a pretty clear mismatch.''
</P>
<P>
   As the second presidential impeachment case in US history nears
its end, probably with a Senate vote Friday, trial specialists
differ on how much impact any of the lawyers ultimately had on the
proceeding's outcome. Still, they unanimously agree that Clinton's
team of highly paid professionals outperformed the House's
politician/litigators in devising strategy, executing tactics, and
presenting arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be fair to the House managers, they'd been politicians for
years . . . and so you tend to lose your edge,'' said Roger
Spaeder, a former federal prosecutor who is now a defense attorney
in Washington. ``But they also made quite a few mistakes you'd
think they wouldn't have, and mistakes hurt a lot when you're up
against some of the best, which they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Spaeder said his reference to ``the best'' applied first and
foremost to Charles F.C. Ruff, the president's chief counsel, who
received accolades from everyone interviewed Thursday. Attorneys of
every political stripe said that, to the extent that Americans
watched Ruff, they observed unusually high-caliber trial lawyering:
thoughtful, clever, not overtly aggressive, appealing in an almost
avuncular way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no one of his stature and capability on the other
side of the room,'' said F. Dennis Saylor, a Boston attorney who
was chief of staff of the Justice Department criminal division
under President Bush. He argued that the evidence against Clinton
was powerful, but added that even more seasoned prosecution lawyers
probably could not have succeeded in ousting the president because
of the decidedly political _ and partisan _ nature of the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   It was not Ruff alone who drew high praise. Legal specialists
said the defense was built on a sound mix of strategies aimed at
the senators sitting in judgment of Clinton and at the larger
outside jury of American voters.
</P>
<P>
   Those ranged from the choice of female and black attorneys who
were widely viewed as talented _ and offered a stark symbolic
contrast to the 15 white men who made up the prosecution team _ to
the decision to ask virtually no questions of the three deposition
witnesses, thus loudly signaling that the defense saw nothing in
their testimony worth addressing.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the courtroom observers said, the House
managers seemed to make mistake after mistake.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, nearly everyone interviewed said that most
prosecutors with nearly no chance of winning would try to secure
some punishment by negotiating a settlement rather than risk a jury
letting the defendent off entirely. In this case, they said, a
scathing bipartisan censure of the president probably could have
been secured early on _ but, after a divisive trial, now seems all
but impossible to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers also received wide and sharp criticism for
lecturing their fellow Republicans in the Senate, sometimes in
derisive tones and with derogatory phrasing, about how badly
history would treat them if they did not sign on to the managers'
vision of the case. Lawyers seeking to get jurors on their side
typically don't employ such accusatory tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, they were insulting the jurors, insulting their
audience. They were pontificating about God, mother, and country
rather than explaining their case,'' said Norman Zalkind, a
prominent Boston defense attorney. ``That kind of talk didn't do
them any good with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   While some of the House managers received high marks for their
performance, particularly Representative Asa Hutchinson of
Arkansas, most drew criticism right to the end of their case.
Specifically, those interviewed lambasted the decision to allow all
15 prosecutors to speak during their side's summation.
</P>
<P>
   Courtroom specialists said that choice minimized the possibility
that any prosecutor would connect with the jurors, and resulted in
a fragmented presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Spaeder compared the 15-prosecutor windup with a football team's
decision to put second-string players into the game when it becomes
clear that all is lost. ``It was like admitting they were in the
last five minutes of the fourth quarter and down five touchdowns,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   All the attorneys Thursday said lawyers ultimately played a
minimal role in the impeachment trial since few minds apparently
were changed by the arguments or evidence. Some pointed out,
however, that a combination of the defense team's strengths and the
prosecutors' weaknesses may have contributed to the announced
decisions of several moderate Republicans to vote to acquit Clinton
on both the perjury and the obstruction of justice charges against
him.
</P>
<P>
   If just a few more Republicans join their ranks, neither charge
will gain a majority _ much less the two-thirds vote needed for
conviction. Even if 51 or more senators do concur on one of the
charges, the president and his supporters will have the ammunition
to argue that GOP extremists drove the process against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be fair, whenever you're trying to judge how lawyers
perform, you have to keep in mind that you don't know everything
they had to deal with or what limitations they had . . . but I
didn't see any real trial lawyering on the prosecution side,'' said
Nancy Hollander of Albuquerque, a former president of the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing was so bizarre that I don't know what effect
that had,'' she added, ``but, certainly, if it helped bring some
Republicans over to Clinton, it will make it easier for him to say
the whole thing was a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the praise for the president's attorneys, there was one
persistent jab: Nearly all observers agree he probably could have
escaped the entire impeachment drama if his initial private lawyer,
Robert Bennett, had persuaded Clinton to plead the Fifth Amendment
rather than provide any substantive testimony during the Paula
Jones civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any lawyer faced with a client who has been subpoenaed to be
deposed, where there are any questions about criminal exposure,
will naturally counsel his client to invoke his right to avoid
self-incrimination, however innocent his client may in fact be,''
said Blair Bernholz, a Los Angeles defense attorney. Bernholz said
that lawyers and academics have ``eviscerated'' Bennett for ``that
terrible error,'' but added that the president's lawyers have made
few mistakes since.

OLYMPIC MARKETING CHIEF REASSURES SPONSORS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   With the notable exception of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance
Co., the biggest Olympic sponsors are comfortable with Olympic
officials' handling of the corruption scandal, the Games' chief
marketing official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sponsors have been very supportive of the efforts we've
been making to date to clean up this problem,'' Dick Pound, an
International Olympic Committee vice president, said in a
conference call from New York. ``There is nobody that has
withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound voiced calm amid a rising tide of allegations, most
recently the addition this week of 10 IOC members' names to the
list of alleged wrongdoers. Fourteen IOC members had been
implicated previously.
</P>
<P>
   Pound sought to put a positive spin on criticisms by David
D'Alessandro, president of Boston-based John Hancock, that the IOC
still has not acted decisively enough to reverse the damage from
the two-month-old controversy. D'Alessandro said this week he was
canceling negotiations with NBC for $20 million in Olympic ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he thinks he's trying to help us,'' Pound said of
D'Alessandro. ``He has been for many years one of the most positive
of the Olympic sponsors. John Hancock has made fabulous use of that
sponsorship for the betterment of their business. I think he would
like very much to continue it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound added, however, that D'Alessandro's actions were
unnecessary. ``We are saying that even without that pressure we
would be doing the same thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock is one of 11 companies in the IOC's highest-level
sponsorship program; membership costs $40 million to $50 million in
exchange for use of the Olympic logo.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with with all 11 sponsors and NBC television at
the Hill &AMP; Knowlton public relations firm in midtown Manhattan
Thursday, IOC marketing director Michael Payne told reporters he
had assured the group there would be a ``total housecleaning'' of
the IOC. He said ``we will expel anybody who is found guilty,'' and
promised there will also be ``significant reforms,'' though he
declined to discuss specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said the sponsors, who were not available for comment,
were ``pleased'' with these assurances, and none are withdrawing
from their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Pound said the IOC would pursue the allegations
contained in the Salt Lake City ethics report released Tuesday,
which provided new details on the allegations of vote-buying and
influence-peddling surrounding the awarding of the 2002 Winter
Games.
</P>
<P>
   He rebuffed suggestions that the IOC deserved more blame for
failing to rein in members accused of the most egregious excesses.
For instance, the ethics report said Jean-Claude Ganga of the
Republic of Congo made at least a half-dozen trips to Utah, brought
along several family members, ran up huge bills, and arranged for
an assortment of free medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly were not wilfully blind,'' he said. ``We didn't
know about it. It's not the sort of thing the member involved talks
about . . . It came as a huge surprise to us to see the magnitude
of what was involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said he still hoped the Olympic cleanup could be completed
in time for a special IOC meeting scheduled for March 17 and 18 in
Lausanne, Switzerland. Then, when the IOC meets again in June to
choose the site of the 2006 Winter Games, the worst of the scandal
will begin to recede into history, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a higher standard expected of the Olympic
Games generally and the IOC in particular,'' Pound said. ``I think
the vast majority of our members adhere to those higher standars.
It appears that some of our members have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Those members, he said, would face the ``ultimate sanction,''
expulsion from the IOC.

`NOVEMBER 1916': A GRAND LITERARY EDIFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct spelling of Willetts in 3rd graf and in
publication notes.)  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be said, in an effort to put matters into
perspective, that the Soviet dictator Leonid Brezhnev would one day
be dimly remembered as a Russian politician during the era of
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. In fact, matters turned out to be more
complicated. Brezhnev is a bad memory, but Solzhenitsyn, the great
dissenting author of ``Cancer Ward'' and ``The Gulag Archipelago,''
whom Brezhnev pushed into an exile that lasted 20 years, is hardly
a universally celebrated figure either.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Solzhenitsyn has outlived the centrality he had when
moral criticism was an act of enormous courage, and he has not
helped his cause by his recourse to dyspeptic commentaries on the
inadequacy of secular, liberal culture.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the publication of ``November 1916,'' the second
volume of Solzhenitsyn's three-book cycle, ``The Red Wheel,'' could
help rehabilitate a tarnished hero. ``November 1916,'' which
follows the publication of ``August 1914,'' the first in the ``Red
Wheel'' series, by almost a decade, is an impressive
accomplishment, and H.T. Willetts has ably translated it from the
Russian. True, it has a fusty quality about it, its specific
ingredients more or less what one familiar with the sprawling
historical genre would expect. Certainly it is overlong and
contains too much talk and not enough action. Moreover, as in
``August 1914,'' Solzhenitsyn intersperses his story with long,
dense historical explanations that not only require a good deal of
specialized knowledge to assimilate but also slow the novel's
dramatic momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The Solzhenitsyn of ``November 1916'' is a long way from the
cranky, semi-mystical ideologue that he has sometimes seemed to be.
The work is an enormous literary palace teeming with life and
intellectual passion, a grand edifice of history and character in
the Tolstoy tradition. Indeed, ``November 1916'' is not ``War and
Peace,'' but some of the same adjectives could be used to describe
both books: ambitious, panoramic yet intimate, prodigiously
researched, invested with a strong sense of verisimilitude. One
senses that for the many dozens of characters who appear in
Solzhenitsyn's 1,014 pages, November 1916 must actually have been
something like the way it is described in this all-embracing book.
</P>
<P>
   A kind of political fable frames Solzhenitsyn's broad-shouldered
tale. The central action reveals the inability of a self-absorbed,
wishful liberalism to respond effectively to the condition of a
country being bled white by war and facing the dread menace of a
revolution that will utterly destroy the old order.
</P>
<P>
   ``November 1916'' in this sense depicts two opposing points of
view, two modes of action. On the one side are various members of
the Russian elite: academics, doctors, forward-looking officers in
the Czar's army. This portion of Russian society strives to find
some formula by which the corrupt and incompetent ancien regime
(incarnated by the meddlesome czarina and her mystical spiritual
guide, Rasputin) can be overthrown even as the elite remains in
power. On the other is Lenin, shown living in exile in Zurich,
Switzerland, waiting for his chance and using his implacable and
trenchant logic to foment the civil war that will eradicate the old
order and give him vastly greater power than the czar ever dreamed
of.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Probably the most important of Solzhenitsyn's many characters is
Georgi Vorotyntsev, an army colonel who has spent the war at the
front and has come to believe that Russia will destroy itself if
the war continues. Vorotyntsev goes to St. Petersburg to meet with
Aleksandr Guchkov, a leading military officer (and historical
figure) who, in Solzhenitsyn's account, tried to drum up support
among the senior generals for a coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
   Vorotyntsev has long conversations with the Kadets, Russia's
liberal reformers, and eventually with other military leaders,
including Gruchkov, but he finds nobody who shares his view that
the only salvation for Russia is to get out of the war. Many
opinions are eloquently expressed as Vorotyntsev makes his rounds,
but most eloquent of all is his own description of the slaughter
taking place at the front, a slaughter that goes on while Kadets
and senior generals alike speak to each other in nonexperiential
generalities.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Vorotyntsev's soldier's-eye view of the war is stunning
in its concreteness, an impressive piece of historical
reconstruction. We, the readers, moreover, believe him and his dire
predictions for the future of Russia because Solzhenitsyn has
already taken us to the front in his opening chapters. We have seen
for ourselves, as it were, how a routinized absurdity and the
superiority of the German enemy have made the legendary courage of
the Russian soldier almost obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose task is it to prevent the conflagration from engulfing
Russia?'' Vorotyntsev at one point asks Gruchkov and another
officer. ``Who has to be on the alert, to forestall the elemental
forces, who if not ourselves, the leaders of Russian society, the
strong and active? It is our duty. And it is also in our interest
politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Vorotyntsev's conservative clarity is matched
only by the revolutionary clarity of Lenin, whose genius was to
perceive what the liberal intelligentsia did not: that the way to
topple the old order was to push workers and soldiers into
rebellion, not to fight the war more effectively but to stop
fighting the war altogether. ``What the proletariat needs is civil
war,'' Lenin tells his followers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in contrast with Solzhenitsyn's characters, we know
what happened a year later, when Lenin did come to power, and in
the decades after that. And our knowledge lends Solzhenitsyn's
story a piquancy that can only come from watching people marching
toward a tragedy that they could avoid if only they knew what we
know. One of the most powerful of Solzhenitsyn's chapters concerns
an underground Bolshevik operative in St. Petersburg named
Aleksandr Shlyapnikov, whom we see striving to foment a general
strike among munitions workers. We know from the glossary of
historical figures at the end of the book that Shlyapnikov was a
close collaborator with Lenin but that he was expelled from the
Central Committee in 1922 and eventually died in Stalin's purges.
</P>
<P>
   Shlyapnikov's eventual fate underscores the extent of the
political calamity that Russia was careering toward in November
1916, when concerted wise action by the Russian liberal elite might
still have changed the course of history. Solzhenitsyn in this
sense has drawn a realistic, deep and expansive portrait of
intelligent and even courageous individuals caught in the web of a
tragic history.
</P>
<P>
   ``November 1916'' is a fable centering on human intractability
that promises to stand the test of time.

NISSAN UNIT PLANS MORE JOB CUTS, PLANT CLOSING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Stepping up efforts to overhaul its struggling
operations, Nissan Diesel Motor Co. announced Thursday that it
would close one of its largest manufacturing plants and cut far
more workers than previously planned.
</P>
<P>
   The company, the troubled truck manufacturing affiliate of the
equally troubled Nissan Motor Co., also plans to merge with its
sales unit, Nissan Diesel Sales, by March 31, 2000, and cut the
board of the merged company to seven or eight directors from the
current 14.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Diesel president Hirofumi Nakazawa said the new cutbacks
would save the company 150 million yen, or about $1.25 million,
over the next three years and help restore the company to
profitability in the fiscal year that begins April 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year that ended last March, Nissan Diesel lost
1.11 billion yen and is expected to lose money again in its current
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time when the justification for the existence of
profitless companies is severely questioned,'' Nakazawa said, with
what was remarkable candor for a Japanese executive.
</P>
<P>
   He declared he had an ``indomitable resolve'' to restore the
company to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what the new restructuring steps might mean to
DaimlerChrysler AG's current negotiations to buy at least a portion
of Nissan Motor's 39.8 percent stake in Nissan Diesel.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler and Nissan Motor have been in discussions since
May but they have bogged down over Nissan Diesel's debts, which
some analysts estimate are as high as 400 billion yen.
</P>
<P>
   The debts of Nissan Diesel Sales, which run to roughly 100
billion yen when the debts of its dealers are included, are rumored
to be an obstacle in the Nissan Motor-DaimlerChrysler talks.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Diesel's announcement that it will close its Ota plant in
Gunma Prefecture, where it makes midsized trucks, puts it at the
forefront of Japanese companies moving to address excess production
capacity. Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker, said
recently that it would reduce capacity by 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Nissan Diesel said it would eliminate 2,500 jobs by
2001; Thursday, it increased those plans by 500 more jobs, bringing
the total jobs to be cut to 3,000, or almost 25 percent of its work
force.
</P>
<P>
   It said it would begin producing its midsized trucks at its main
Ageo plant in Saitama Prefecture this year. The company also plans
to reduce its models by 20 percent, which will help it reduce
costs.

WHITE HOUSE PROPOSES MORE GENEROUS PAYMENTS TO DISABLED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Vt.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration on Friday will propose a
more generous policy regarding the payment of cash benefits to
disabled people under Social Security, administration officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in nearly a decade, the government will
propose an increase in the amount of money that people may earn
while receiving disability benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The limit on earnings is now $500 a month, and it has been at
that level since January 1990. The commissioner of social security,
Kenneth Apfel, will propose a rule increasing the limit to $700,
officials said. After reviewing public comments, the commissioner
has the authority to make the change, which would take effect on
June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore plans to announce the proposal on a visit
to Albany, N.Y., on Friday. ``By proposing an increase in the
allowable monthly earnings from $500 to $700 a month _ a 40 percent
increase _ we are enabling Americans with disabilities to make the
most of their abilities,'' Gore says in the text of his prepared
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security officials said the change could help 250,000
people a year. Those who receive disability benefits are
automatically eligible for Medicare after a two-year waiting
period, and for many, the Medicare coverage is even more valuable
than the cash benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who sought the change is Tipper Gore, the vice
president's wife. Since the early 1980s, she has been a zealous
advocate for people with mental illness and retardation.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Ford, a lobbyist for the Arc, formerly known as the
Association for Retarded Citizens, welcomed the proposed change.
``This is an important step, long awaited, and it will help a lot
of people,'' she said. ``It will make a significant difference for
lower-income workers who are severely disabled and need continued
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ford said the change would benefit many people with
disabilities who work at food service jobs or at entry-level
positions in supermarkets and retail stores. Disabled workers
earning $500 to $700 a month are now ineligible for benefits, but
could qualify under the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   The administration plans to make a similar change in a related
program known as Supplemental Security Income. The White House said
the changes, taken together, would cost the government $1.2 billion
over five years. Social Security benefits for disabled workers now
average $733 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials did not suggest any specific way to pay
for the added benefits, but said the cost would somehow be covered
in the overall context of a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment now at 4.3 percent, the lowest level in 28
years, many employers have difficulty finding workers, and some say
they are more willing to hire people with disabilities. Because of
recent increases in the minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour, workers
with disabilities are more likely to reach the earnings limit of
$500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   While people with disabilities have not generally been viewed as
a big voting bloc, disability rights have won bipartisan support.
President Clinton recently proposed a new tax credit and new health
insurance options to help people with disabilities go back to work.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican senators, William Roth Jr. of Delaware and James
Jeffords of Vermont, have joined Clinton in supporting a bill that
would expand Medicaid and Medicare so disabled people could retain
their health benefits when they return to work. Former Sen. Bob
Dole, himself a disabled war veteran, urged Congress last week to
pass the bill as a way to increase the number of disabled people
who work and pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, a person is said to be disabled if he or she
is unable to engage in ``substantial gainful activity'' because of
a physical or mental impairment that is expected to cause death or
to last 12 months or more.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current rules, if a person is earning more than $500 a
month (after subtracting certain work expenses), the person is
considered to be engaging in substantial gainful activity and
therefore not disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate objective of the new policy is to help disabled
people get jobs and become self-sufficient. ``If even a small
fraction of the people receiving disability benefits could go to
work,'' Gore said, ``we would save billions of dollars in the long
run.''

 &HT;    `Our Kind of People': The black elite survive in America
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Author Lawrence Otis Graham has become an expert on
African-Americans who attend Ivy League schools, use the word
``summer'' as a verb and have little contact with the great huddled
masses yearning to eat brie.
</P>
<P>
   Graham should know about these folks. He considers himself one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest book, ``Our Kind of People: Inside America's Black
Upper Class'' (HarperCollins, $25), the 37-year-old,
Harvard-educated lawyer chronicles the ``black elite,'' an affluent
and exclusive subculture that survived slavery, Reconstruction and
integration by creating their own race-based social institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The book describes an insulated, and mostly invisible, lifestyle
that most whites _ and many blacks _ have never heard of and could
never join. They include invitation-only children's groups such as
Jack and Jill, secretive societies such as the all-male Boule, and
exclusive women's groups such as the Links.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Graham returned to Atlanta _ one of a dozen cities
that earned a chapter in his book _ for an autograph session at the
Herndon Home Museum attended by some of the same prominent
Atlantans he interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are black people who are uncomfortable talking about
class in the black community, but it exists,'' Graham told the
crowd of about 60, jammed into the living room of the mansion, once
the home of black Atlanta's wealthiest businessman, Alonzo Herndon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some, it's difficult to acknowledge that there are black
dynasties who shouldn't have to apologize for their success or
their ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham contends that Atlanta's black elite is older, and more
entrenched than their counterparts in other cities, largely because
of the national reputation of historically black colleges such as
Morehouse and Spelman. He also found it to be the most impenetrable
for black newcomers who mistakenly believe wealth is sufficient to
join their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York or Chicago it's more fluid and based on money. You
don't have to trace your family back three or four generations to
Morehouse or Spelman.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before the event, Graham said he intended the
book as a history lesson, not an expose. But some of his subjects
are not amused.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Nelson, a nationally known writer whose family is included
in the book, criticized Graham in an article for the Internet
magazine Salon. She contended that Graham's book ``cheerily
embraces and celebrates . . . snobbery.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Graham sold most of the books he brought to the
Herndon signing, several people accused him of promoting the same
class distinctions that slavemasters used by favoring light-skinned
``house'' slaves over their darker-skinned peers who toiled in the
fields.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Graham acknowledges that entry into the upper echelons
of black society once required aspirants to pass a ``paper bag and
ruler'' test: Anyone darker than a brown paper bag and whose hair
was not straight enough to be measured against a ruler was usually
ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the black elite did was create a caste system,''
complained Ernie Oglesby, a 67-year-old retired ad executive. ``And
all they're doing is emulating the white man.''
</P>
<P>
   But Julia Bond, the 90-year-old mother of NAACP Chairman Julian
Bond, said putting her children in groups such as Jack and Jill was
not a matter of elitism, but of social necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first moved here we didn't know anyone,'' Bond said.
``We weren't trying to be elite, I was just trying to find a play
group for my children and to introduce our family socially. That's
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Portia Scott, whose family owns the Atlanta Daily World, is
featured in Graham's book. Scott, who was active in Jack and Jill
as a child, and is still a member of the Links, recalls taunts from
black classmates whose families could not afford expensive summer
vacations and other privileges she enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say I was sheltered, but I never felt I was
superior or better than anybody else,'' Scott said. ``For us it was
a matter of survival, because white society was telling us we were
inferior. My family made sure I didn't grow up feeling inferior,
and these groups gave me a sense of self-esteem. But it wasn't
about being a snob.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his life was comfortable, Graham also remembers similar
schoolyard insults that made him feel alienated from other blacks.
Slightly built with a nasal voice, Graham said he and his brothers
were often bullied for ``acting white'' in the New York suburb
where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said those feelings have made the black elite a minority
within a minority, excluded by whites for their color, and by other
blacks for their culture. And that's why he believes that the
social infrastructure created by the black elite is still
important, even though the black middle class has grown larger and
more successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of us it's about networking,'' Graham said. ``Because
of integration we're more spread out in society, and it's harder
for us to find each other. People think it will not only help them
professionally, but will help their kids get a summer job or an
internship.''

 &HT;    That ` '70s' girl Donna lot like actress Prepon
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This probably isn't the story Laura Prepon of
``That '70s Show'' would want told, but she told it, so it's fair
game and says something about her.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was a recent Fox party at Perino's, a plush jazz
dinner club here, full of Fox executives, journalists and her
co-stars. Prepon, who at 18 has a strong sense of herself, couldn't
find the women's restroom, so she charged into the men's.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they were like, `Ooh, a girl in the men's room.' And I
just, like, walked right in. And I was, like, in the stall, and I
was, like, `Can I come out now?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And they were, like, `Are you dressed?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was, like, `Are you dressed?' ''
</P>
<P>
   That is, like, exactly how Laura Prepon talks and Laura Prepon
acts.
</P>
<P>
   On ``That '70s Show'' (8:30 p.m. Sundays), a moderate hit for
Fox in its first season, Prepon (pronounced pree-pon) plays Donna
Pinciotti, neighbor and sort-of girlfriend to lead character Eric
(Topher Grace). Like Donna, Prepon is a bit of a jock (high school
tennis and, at 5-foot-10, center on her basketball team) and almost
disconcertingly deadpan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just play it totally straight,'' she says. ``We're totally
close'' she says of Donna.
</P>
<P>
   ``That '70s Show,'' which chronicles the escapades of six teens
stuck in suburban Wisconsin in 1976, is Prepon's first major acting
work. The Wacthung, N.J., native studied acting at the Total
Theater Lab in New York City when she was 16 and appeared in a
couple of small plays and on a quickie Internet ``series'' called
``They Go On.''
</P>
<P>
   She says show creators Bonnie and Terry Turner didn't have
height in mind when they wrote the character of Donna, but it has
turned out well, since Donna and Eric play basketball
competitively, and Donna usually wins.
</P>
<P>
   The show is sometimes controversial for depicting teens getting
high on marijuana, and the Feb. 21 episode may not be to some
parents' liking. When friend Jackie (Mila Kundis) thinks she might
be pregnant, Donna freaks and orders birth control pills, even
though she's a virgin. And somehow it all ends up on Eric, as it
usually does, as he must face one of the most hideous birds and
bees talks ever from both parents.
</P>
<P>
   As for Prepon, the tall redhead is just starting to taste the
two-edged fame of being on a TV series. She'll be on the cover of
the March issue of Twist, a teen girl magazine, and several fan-run
Web sites started up as soon as the show debuted last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first,'' she says, ``the recognition was really weird, but
now it's cool. A lot of people just look or do double takes. I love
it.''

POPE IS SAID TO CONSIDER VISITING HONG KONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Pope John Paul II is considering a visit to Hong Kong
later this year, according to church officials in Asia and Rome.
Such a visit could soften the decades-old standoff between the
Vatican and China's Communist government, which has sovereignty
over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican and China have also had secret talks about improving
relations, a Chinese Catholic bishop said in a recent magazine
interview. But the bishop, the 82-year-old Aloysius Jin Luxian of
Shanghai, gave no sign that the two sides were overcoming their
bitter history.
</P>
<P>
   A papal visit to Hong Kong, which has autonomous status as a
``special administrative region'' of China, may be too freighted
with politics to be feasible, church officials say.
</P>
<P>
   After taking over China in 1949, the Communists severed ties
with the Vatican and created a ``patriotic'' church, which now has
4 million members. But many Chinese Catholics have remained
defiantly loyal to the pope, and today as many as 6 million, by
some estimates, worship illegally, their leaders often arrested.
</P>
<P>
   China demands that religious groups be subservient to the
Communist Party, while the Vatican insists that the pope must have
authority over the appointment of bishops and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Further angering China, the Vatican maintains diplomatic ties
with Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ``one country, two systems'' model that gave Hong Kong
autonomy when it joined China in 1997, the Catholic Church there
continued to report to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   After a synod of Asian bishops at the Vatican last spring,
church officials said the pope might visit Hong Kong, New Delhi or
Jerusalem to report conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in an interview with an Italian Catholic magazine called 30
Giorni, Jin has said that church leaders in Hong Kong were
promoting a papal visit there.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Rome as well as the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong
said Thursday that there had been no decision yet about the pope's
Asian visit, expected to occur late this year. ``Of course, we'd
like the pope to come here,'' said the Hong Kong diocese
spokeswoman, Mary Seung.
</P>
<P>
   ``A papal visit to Hong Kong now would be a breakthrough,'' said
Beatrice Leung, an expert on politics and religion at Lingnan
College in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Beijing would allow a visit, a spokeswoman for
China's Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the decision would be
in the hands of the Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
   But the spokeswoman, Zhang Qiyue, said China's ties with the
Vatican could improve only if it severed diplomatic relations with
Taiwan and agreed not to interfere in the internal affairs of
China, including religious affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Jin expressed a yearning for reconciliation,
saying, ``The pope represents the supreme leader of all the world's
Catholics, including those in China.'' His office said Thursday
that he could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Jin also said that the Vatican and China were engaged in a
dialogue and that he dreamed of seeing a papal nuncio in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Past negotiations have gone nowhere. Still, Pope John Paul II
has said he hopes to visit China some day.

ADMINISTRATION MUST DECIDE SOON WHETHER TO SEND U.S. TROOPS TO
KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The Clinton administration will have to
decide by the middle of next week, at the latest, about whether to
send American troops to Kosovo if NATO planning for a peacekeeping
force is to proceed smoothly, a senior NATO diplomat said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An operational plan for Kosovo is expected to be approved by
mid-week, and the precise composition of the force would be
determined soon after that, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Key decision points are coming up,'' the diplomat said.
``Because NATO is moving toward the generation of a force, the
United States has to put its cards on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure in the administration to make a final decision on
troops is also building because the two sides in the peace talks at
Rambouillet in France are counting on knowing the details of the
promised NATO force before making a decision on signing a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton met with his foreign policy advisers on
Thursday to discuss the deployment of American soldiers to Kosovo
but, according to administration officials, did not make a
decision. Last week, the president said he was ``seriously
considering'' an American deployment, but set out a list of
conditions, including a firm peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was expected to visit the
peace talks on Sunday. But on Thursday night, a senior Clinton
administration official said that it remained unclear whether there
had been enough progress in the negotiations to warrant her going.
</P>
<P>
   And it was not decided, the official said, whether Ms. Albright
would attend a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Contact
Group _ the United States, four European nations and Russia _
scheduled for Sunday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's presence at the peace talks, which so far have
dawdled, was expected to give them a boost, although it has been
unclear what kind of specific new initiative, scolding or
encouragement she would bring.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators at the peace talks have told the two sides in the
Kosovo conflict, ethnic Albanian separatists and the Serbian
government, that NATO ground forces would be in the Serbian
province as peacekeepers for the duration of a three-year interim
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But the specific makeup of that ground force has not been
spelled out to the two sides, although Britain, France, Germany and
Italy have pledged troops.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon planners said in Washington that they had sent a
proposal to the White House on Thursday seeking approval for 4,000
American troops, including a Marine expeditionary unit of 2,400
which is aboard ships in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   The planners said that the American contribution would represent
about 15 percent of an estimated force of 28,000, a far lower
percentage of Americans than in the NATO-led peacekeeping force in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The specific Pentagon plan came after the North Atlantic
Council, the decision making body of NATO, gave what alliance
officials called ``conceptual'' approval here on Thursday to a
military annex for the peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The annex sets deadlines for the demobilization of Serbian
police forces and the Yugoslav army and for the disarmament of the
ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the talks at Rambouillet, which are designed to produce
a settlement that gives autonomy to Kosovo, have concentrated on
the easier political topics _ a new constitution and elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the point is rapidly approaching, Clinton administration
officials said, when the two sides will have to be presented with
the tough decisions. The Contact Group has set a two-week deadline
for the negotiations, which started last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest hurdle has long been predicted to be the military
issues: the composition of the peacekeeping force, what its tasks
would be and what role it would have in dismembering the forces of
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 ethnic Albanian delegates to the talks, who includes five
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, have made clear that they
want a NATO force and expect it to include Americans, officials
close to the delegation said.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians view the NATO troops as their only security
against the repressive tactics of the Serbs, who, according to the
military annex approved by NATO on Thursday, would be allowed to
keep 2,500 police in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs, the acceptance of a NATO force in Kosovo is
considered a breach of sovereignty, and officials in the Yugoslav
government have repeated their objections this week. NATO has
authorized air strikes against the Serbs if they refuse to agree to
the NATO troops.

<P>
   An important element of the NATO deployment, said the senior
NATO diplomat, will be winning approval for it from the Russians.
Moscow has been a traditional ally of Serbia and while a Russian
diplomat is one of the three negotiators at the talks at
Rambouillet, he has expressed public opposition to NATO troops in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and the Europeans were lobbying the
Russians on Thursday to convince them that the Yugoslav leader,
Slobodan Milosevic, must accept NATO troops. ``The Russians
understand that the viability of a settlement depends on an
international military presence, but whether that translates into a
robust military force is not yet clear,'' the diplomat said.

PROSPERITY IS BAD NEWS FOR GM'S MARKET SHARE, EXECUTIVE SAYS

<P>
   CHICAGO _ General Motors' &UR;  &LR; top North American executive said
Thursday that a long-promised sharp rebound in the company's market
share in the United States would not be possible this year if the
industry's sales continue at their torrid pace because GM cannot
produce enough full-sized pickup trucks to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   The acknowledgment of GM's difficulties is an unusual example of
how the prosperity of the U.S. economy combined with low energy
prices has actually created problems for some companies.
</P>
<P>
   GM simply cannot make enough big V8 engines to build all the
full-sized pickup trucks it needs to meet its market-share goals at
a time of near-record auto sales and record light truck sales, said
Ronald Zarrella, the president of GM's North American operations.
</P>
<P>
   GM's market share has been falling for more than two decades and
even edged below 30 percent last year, a serious problem for a
company that has the factory capacity to supply 35 percent of the
U.S. market. Zarrella and other GM executives vowed late last year
to reverse this long fall and set a goal of 32 percent of the
market this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Zarrella told reporters at the Chicago Auto Show Thursday
afternoon that if the market remained at a brisk, seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 16 million vehicles, a 32 percent market
share would not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the market is 16 million for the year, not a chance,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Zarrella said low gasoline prices, which help sales of
high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, were still
better than high gasoline prices, which help sales of GM's
low-profit cars, for which it has a lot of extra production
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   If gasoline prices rose, he said, ``There'd be positives in
terms of market share and lots of negatives in terms of
profitability. Given a choice, I'd prefer the profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Ford Motor &UR;  &LR; Co. or DaimlerChrysler &UR;  &LR; AG, GM still has
the bulk of its factories set up to produce cars rather than light
trucks, a category including sport utility vehicles and minivans as
well as pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Zarrella also announced a new technology for dashboard-mounted
air bags.
</P>
<P>
   GM's new technology involves a sensor pad that will be inserted
in the front-seat cushions on the passenger side of family vehicles
over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   If the sensor pad senses a child seat or a person weighing less
than 66 pounds in the front seat, the vehicle's front air bag will
not deploy on the passenger side. While air bags have saved the
lives of 3,800 Americans over the last decade, they have killed 125
children and short adults.
</P>
<P>
   Zarrella said that GM thinks children younger than 12 should
always be in the back seat, but many are not. He added that some
rival automakers were selling cars with side air bags that posed an
unacceptably high risk of injuring or killing small children.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lange, GM's safety director, said that German luxury
automakers were installing side air bags that inflated with such
force that they could injure a toddler who was not using a seat
belt or a child safety seat and who was sleeping against the door.
</P>
<P>
   For a year, GM's side air bags have been designed to not inflate
fully if someone is sitting in their path; they have vents that
allow some of the air to escape instead.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz and BMW AG officials said that their side air bags
were safe. They pointed out that no children had been killed by
their side air bags, which Lange acknowledged.

CRANE WINS FOUR-YEAR CONTRACT TO PRODUCE CURRENCY PAPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Crane &AMP; Co. of Dalton, Mass., the primary supplier
of US currency paper since 1879, Thursday won a four-year contract
worth up to $260 million to supply the specialized paper to the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Representative John Olver, the Amherst, Mass. Democrat who
announced the deal jointly with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, called
it ``the largest currency paper contract in US history.''
</P>
<P>
   Crane's standing as a government contractor was in doubt in
recent years as Representative Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican,
tried to pass legislation that would force Crane to face more
competition in bidding for contracts. His effort was bolstered when
the General Accounting Office last year reported that the
government is unable to say whether it pays a fair price for paper,
and that Crane should face more competition.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Senator John F. Kerry last year succeeded in
deleting language added to the Treasury Department's spending bill
that would have blocked the government from awarding another
multi-year contract for currency paper until two House committees
give approval.
</P>
<P>
   Olver's office said at least one other company bid for the paper
contract against Crane. Olver and Kennedy said Crane won because it
promised to supply the best product at the lowest cost. A spokesman
for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing could not be reached late
Thursday.

RELIGIOUS GROUP CALLS FOR RECOGNITION OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH AND HILARY SARGENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Calling it a civil-rights issue, a coalition of
religious leaders said Thursday the time had come for Massachusetts
to recognize same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Jew, I know from history that restricting marriage rights
has been a weapon of oppression against minorities,'' said Rabbi
Howard Berman, rabbi emiritus to a Chicago synagogue. ``As a rabbi,
I have seen and shared the pain of many loving, committed couples,
who have suffered greatly because they lack the legal protections
that all other married citizens take for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Religious Coalition for the Freedom to Marry found its
call greeted with skepticism by Governor Paul Cellucci, who has
been a strong ally of the gay community on many other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not for that,'' Cellucci said Thursday. ``I'm not for gay
marriages.'' Asked why, the governor said he felt allowing gay
marriage could undermine the sanctity of the family unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to encourage that basic family unit and I
think permitting gay marriages would detract from that,'' Cellucci
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. George H. Welles Jr., an Episcopal priest, said the denial
of the right to marry oppressed same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from the group's manifesto, Welles said: ``From the
shameful history of slavery in America, the injustice of forbidding
people to marry is evident as a denial of basic human rights. The
American laws forbidding interracial marriage, now struck down,
were clearly discriminatory. Denial of the status of marriage to
those who would freely accept its responsibilities, creates legal
and economic inequities in addition to its social injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 religious leaders have signed that statement.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Joan M. Saniuk, pastor of the Metropolitan Community
Church, which ministers to lesbians and gays, gay couple deserve
the same support as heterosexuals. ``As with any marriage,
same-gender couples have a better chance of a successful
relationship when their society acknowledges and encouragas them,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights activists from across the state are up in arms about
proposed legislation which would prevent same-sex marriages from
being recognized in Massachusetts. Activists have voiced their
criticism, calling the legislation ``unnecessary.'' Filed in
December by Representative John Rogers, Norwood Democrat, the bill
reads: ``A purported marriage contracted between persons of the
same sex shall be neither valid nor recognized in the
Commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hate bill,'' said Sean Cahill, chair of the Lesbian
and Gay Political Alliance of Massachusetts. ``It's unnecessary,
because we already don't have the right to marry. We are already
second-class citizens. This bill attempts to further stigmatize the
gay and lesbian residents of the Commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cellucci said he opposes same-gender marriages, he has not
thrown any weight behind Rogers' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure we need to ban something we don't permit,''
Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to pacify recent criticism of his proposal, Rogers
is in the process of rewriting the bill, and said that the purpose
of the legislation is to define marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to say what marriage was not. I wanted to say
what it is,'' said Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Religious leaders said they weren't undertaking a lobbying
effort to win legal recognition of gay-marriage rights in
Massachusetts, but rather were trying to jolt the state's
consciences. Still, the coalition said they would become more vocal
if the Legislature takes up the gay-marriage ban.

TOBACCO COMPANIES FACE GROWING THREAT OF SUITS BY INDIVIDUAL
SMOKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By BARRY MEIER 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a Memphis, Tenn., courtroom, the families of four deceased
smokers including a homemaker and a long-haul truck driver are
suing the nation's three biggest tobacco companies for $660 million
in damages.
</P>
<P>
   In Akron, Ohio, jury selection will begin this month in a
lawsuit against the tobacco industry by a labor union health fund,
in the first such case to reach trial. The health fund is seeking
$750 million for starters, and far more if it can prove civil
racketeering charges against producers.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, Ore., a jury is expected to hear a claim soon that
was brought against a cigarette producer by the family of another
dead smoker.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, the tobacco industry thought it had
vanquished its greatest legal threat when it agreed to settle all
remaining claims brought by states seeking to recover Medicaid
expenses, by paying the states $206 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But in the months of jockeying that led to the settlement, there
was a steady growth in the number of lawsuits against cigarette
makers by individual smokers and others. And this week the
industry's calm was shattered when a California jury, in a suit
brought by a woman who had smoked Marlboro cigarettes since age 15,
ordered Philip Morris Cos. to pay her $51.5 million in compensatory
and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco producers had not viewed such individual claims as a
threat, in large part because few cases succeeded, awards were
small and all were overturned on appeal. But the California
verdict, coming after years of relentless pounding of the industry
in the court of public opinion, suggests that the calm enjoyed by
producers since the announcement of the settlement with the states
late last year is over. There is much more anger among potential
jurors than cigarette makers had thought.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rabin, a professor of law at Stanford University who
follows tobacco litigation, said he believed that the steady
disclosure in recent years of damaging documents from cigarette
company files might have shifted public attitudes toward the
industry from the benign to the hostile. Those documents revealed,
for example, that some companies sought to recruit teen-agers as
``replacement smokers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis is no longer just on the product being dangerous,
but on the industry being malevolent in trying to cover up those
dangers,'' Rabin said. ``And it is not just happening in the juror
room but in the general way people think about the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris officials have said they will appeal the
California verdict, which was meted out by a state jury in San
Francisco. And there is a strong likelihood that the stunning
verdict, which included $50 million in punitive damages against
Philip Morris, the country's largest cigarette maker, may be
reduced or even thrown out on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Madelyn J. Chaber, who represented the smoker, Patricia Henley,
had asked jurors to award $15 million in punitive damages, which
are intended to punish the company.
</P>
<P>
   William S. Ohlemeyer, a lawyer representing Philip Morris, said
he believed that the size of the verdict represented not only
sympathy by jurors for Ms. Henley, who said her lung cancer
resulted from smoking Marlboros for 35 years, but also a deep
antipathy for cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These lawsuits should be decided on the facts rather than
emotion,'' Ohlemeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But for jurors these days, emotions may be a part of how they
view such facts. While Ms. Chaber, the lawyer, did not introduce
any new evidence in the California case, she did make extensive use
of documents produced by cigarette makers in recent years that
indicated they manipulated nicotine levels to keep smokers hooked
and marketed ``light'' cigarettes _ those with lower tar levels _
to smokers concerned about their health.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, Gwen Leath, a banker from San Francisco, said she was
particularly disturbed that Philip Morris had tried for decades to
cast doubt on scientific reports by government officials that
smoking was addictive and caused cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``With publicity and advertising, they really tried to downplay
it as a controversy between the surgeon general and responsible
medical people,'' said Ms. Leath, 47. ``It all seemed kind of
deceiving, and they were kind of saying, like, `Oh, this is just
business.' ''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The jury's foreman, George Loudis, said he believed that the $15
million sought by Ms. Chafer in punitives damages to send Philip
Morris what she called a ``strong message'' should have served as a
maximum for the jury's award. But while he declined to disclose the
amount he had suggested, he added that some jurors had considered
punitive awards in the hundreds of millions, with one juror going
as high as $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People felt that the tobacco companies were suppressing what
they knew and misstated what they knew from their findings to be
true.'' said Loudis, 37. ``That was proven to us, that they
suppressed knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henley said on Thursday at a news conference in San
Francisco that she would use the money to finance programs to keep
children from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't touch a nickel of somebody's blood money,'' she
said. ``But I have to hand it to the jury: they awarded that money
not knowing that I wasn't going to keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   The California verdict was only the fourth time in more than a
decade that a jury has awarded damages in tobacco case brought by
an individual smoker. And the previous awards, including the most
recent two cases in Florida against Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Co.,
were overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The highest previous award in a smoker's case was for $1 million
including punitive damages and that was set aside on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of both individual cases as well as class-action
lawsuits against cigarette makers has been steadily growing. In a
recent financial filing, Philip Morris said, for example, that
there were some 510 smoking and health cases filed by individuals
against it at the end of 1998 compared with 375 a year earlier.
Meanwhile, the number of class action cases grew to 60 from 50, the
company reported.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, a major class-action lawsuit brought on behalf
on all smokers in Florida has been under way in a Miami courtroom.
It is expected to go to the jury soon.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the size of the latest award may also set off a
stampede, some financial analysts believe. Until 1997, product
liablity claims by smokers were barred after a state law was passed
more than a decade ago that held that dangers of smoking were
well-known. According to a spokesman for Philip Morris, about 63
cigarette cases have been filed in California since the law's
repeal. About 20 of those cases are from individuals and the rest
are class-action cases.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a number of foreign government including Bolivia, Panama
and Nicaragua have filed claims in the United States against
tobacco companies, and President Clinton also recently announced
that he had directed the Justice Department to begin preparing a
lawsuit against cigarette makers to recover Medicare and other
federal funds spend treating smoking-related ills.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin, the university professor, said he believed that cigarette
producers had the financial resources to withstand five to six
judgements against them annually, even if some of them involved
substantial punitive damage awards.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that while the industry worked long and hard to put
the most troublesome cases, those brought by the states, behind it,
the bright new day of financial certainty that it anticipated may
be long time arriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If plaintiffs win a handful of these cases each year, the
industry can deal with that because they can get some of them
reversed on appeal,'' Rabin said. ``But every victory with a big
price tag bloodies the waters and creates powerful incentives for a
great deal of additional cases to be brought''

NEW DATA REVERSE TURTLE'S SPOT ON REPTILE FAMILY TREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing seems quite so grandfatherly as the turtle, toothless
and wrinkled, always the picture of venerable old age. So it was
fitting that biologists long ago accepted the lumbering beasts as
the most ancient of the reptiles, considerably older than the
skittering lizards and fluttering birds to which the reptile
lineage also gave rise.
</P>
<P>
   But a study appearing Friday in the journal Science suggests a
radical rewriting of the evolutionary history of this familiar
group. The new molecular research declares turtles to be the
unexpectedly close relatives of crocodiles. But most surprising of
all, turtles and crocodiles appear to be the most modern of
reptiles, leaping past lizards, snakes and birds into the top
branches of the reptile family tree.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Blair Hedges, evolutionary biologist at Pennsylvania State
University, is an author of the paper that already has jaws
dropping. Hedges said that like other researchers who had found
similar results with turtles in much smaller studies of DNA and
protein, he first thought the result was a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after completing the first large-scale molecular study, one
that compares 33 different genes from different groups in the
reptile family tree, Hedges said: ``I'm convinced. It took a lot of
data before it would convince me, but now I'm a believer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Gene Gaffney, a paleontologist who specializes in
turtles at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was
skeptical. Of the redrawn tree, Gaffney said, ``I don't think
there's much chance of that being the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney, who studies the morphology, or the structures, of
animal bodies to understand evolutionary relationships, added, ``It
contradicts so much morphological and paleontological evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Avise, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of
Georgia who uses DNA to study evolution, said that he expected the
new paper's conclusions to be ``highly controversial.'' Noting that
the data set in the study was huge, Avise said he was impressed
with ``the apparent consistency of the data pointing in one
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exciting science with some pretty revolutionary
conclusions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges and Laura Poling, a graduate student at Pennsylvania
State University, sequenced the same gene in five reptile species
and analyzed them along with their sequence of another reptile gene
and many more sequences from previously published papers. The
researchers studied both DNA and protein sequences, and looked at
the genes as a group and individually. In both situations they said
they found a striking consistency in the results, with genes
indicating again and again that turtles and crocodilians, a group
that includes crocodiles and alligators, were the closest of kin.
None of the individual genes, Hedges said, indicated that the
classical evolutionary tree for reptiles was correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to imagine that another 24 genes are going to
say something completely different,'' he added.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the standard textbook version of the evolutionary tree of
reptiles, turtles are seen at the base of the tree, evolving first.
Then moving up the tree, the group that includes lizards and snakes
is thought to have evolved next. Lastly, birds and crocodilians
split apart from one another as the most recently evolved groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the new tree, lizards and snakes are the first group shown to
branch off, then birds and lastly turtles and crocodilians split
apart. In addition, Dr. Hedges said that the classical tree
suggested that the turtle lineage went back about 300 million
years, but that the molecular data suggested turtles were younger,
appearing only 200 million to 250 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While researchers predicted that many who had spent a lifetime
working with reptiles would be skeptical of the new study, at least
a few are already applauding the paper's arrival. Dr. Olivier
Rieppel, paleontologist at the Field Museum in Chicago, wrote an
accompanying commentary in Science. He has been arguing, as have a
handful of others, that turtles should be placed further up in the
reptile evolutionary tree.
</P>
<P>
   Turtles have been long placed outside the group known as the
diapsids, which includes the supposedly more modern reptiles, like
crocodiles, snakes and lizards. But based on morphological studies,
Rieppel has been arguing for turtles to be placed among the
diapsids, which is exactly where they are in the new study.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an obscure morphological study published by a
Swedish researcher 20 years ago indicated, as does the new paper,
that the closest relatives of turtles were crocodiles. Until now,
all such claims had been pretty much ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The new paper is only the latest molecular study to flout
long-accepted evolutionary trees that were based on more
traditional, low-tech methods. Dr. Gary Packard, physiological
ecologist at Colorado State University who works with turtles,
described the publication of the new work as something ``like
throwing gasoline on a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem for turtle experts is that the notion of
turtles and crocodiles together at the top of the tree just does
not fit in with everything else they know. Gaffney said that
turtles showed a whole suite of characteristics that were
considered to be very ancient. If the new tree is correct, then
turtles are modern animals that just happened to have re-evolved
all those ancient characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have lost two sets of holes in their heads,
re-evolved a primitive brain case, palate, lower jaw,'' Gaffney
said. ``I have to see better evidence than this to convince me that
that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Rieppel, though, asserts that such changes as the loss of the
holes happen quite commonly in reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   Packard, who is particularly interested in reptile eggs, said
that many things about their eggs did not make sense either in
light of the new tree. The eggs of crocodilians and birds have a
similar structure and are made of the mineral calcite. Turtle eggs
are very different in structure and are made with aragonite.
</P>
<P>
   But Hedges suggested that part of the difficulty of thinking of
characteristics that link crocodiles and turtles could be that
researchers were just so used to thinking of them as distant
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have to rethink everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers suggested that a powerful next test would be to
combine morphological and molecular data and see which holds sway.
As to whether the new tree can withstand such scrutiny and further
testing, Avise said, ``Only time will tell.''

EXPERTS FAULT TEACHER TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three education specialists said Thursday the
Massachusetts Teacher Test is unfair, defective, and should be
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   The group analyzed only the scores of the certification test,
not the test itself, and in a 78-page report said the exam is an
unreliable measure of ability, with underachieving applicants
sometimes passing and more promising candidates often failing.
</P>
<P>
   At a State House press conference, the group called for the
immediate suspension of the exam and recommended it be replaced by
widely used national certification tests.
</P>
<P>
   The ad hoc committee also pressed for an investigation into how
the test was developed and said those who have taken the flawed
exam should have their $150 in fees reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We conclude this test cannot identify . . . candidates who
should not be teaching in our classrooms,'' said Anne Wheelock, who
writes on education issues and helped prepare the report along with
Boston College professor Walter Haney, a nationally known test
expert, and Salem State College professor Clarke Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   The three decided to evaluate the exam results after last year's
uproar when more than half the teacher candidates failed the test.
They said they received no funding for the analysis, paying for it
out of their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Education departments at the state's colleges were largely
blamed for the poor scores of would-be teachers. Boston College
graduates fared well, while about half of the Salem State College
applicants failed. Besides being a professor, Fowler is a member of
the Massachusetts Teachers Association, the union that opposes
testing current teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci, who has campaigned for testing both
current and prospective teachers, sharply derided the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a smoke screen because they don't like teacher
testing,'' Cellucci said. ``These are the same people who would
say, `Well we're going to pass Johnnie to the fourth grade because
we don't want to give him a failing grade because it might affect
his self-esteem. So then you put Johnnie in the fourth grade and
promote him to the fifth grade, and then he gets socially promoted
to the teacher college. And then when he gets his teaching degree,
he can't pass a literacy test. I don't go along with that. That's
the old way of doing things. We're doing it the new way.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was based on an analysis of the scores of hundreds of
candidates from public and private colleges across the state who
took the test last April and July. Those results were combined with
interviews Wheelock conducted of those who had taken the exam.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said he was the only one on the panel who has seen a copy
of the teacher test, but the group defended their review as sound.
</P>
<P>
   Among their findings:
</P>
<P>
   --The test is an unreliable measure of verbal skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test is poorly designed,'' Haney said. ``There is an
unusually low degree of consistency between the reading and writing
part of the Massachusetts Teacher Test.'' That disparity does not
make sense, he said, because both segments of the test measure
verbal skills.
</P>
<P>
   --The test has three times the degree of error of the Scholastic
Aptitude Test.
</P>
<P>
   --Those retaking the same part of the test can have widely
varying scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just looked at score data,'' Fowler said. ``You get
inconsistent scores from people who took the test twice.''
</P>
<P>
   --The test contains ``questionable'' content that does not
reflect the state's curriculum framework, nor does it reflect what
the panel called ``real world literacy.''
</P>
<P>
   --Test conditions are poor. Prospective teachers reported, for
example, that some tape players garbled the dictation portions of
the exam, and they found the eight-hour test too long.
</P>
<P>
   The group is also calling for an independent panel to audit how
the test was developed, administered, and used.
</P>
<P>
   National Evaluation Systems, an Amherst, Mass. company that
develops and administers such tests in eight other states,
contracted with the state Department of Education for this exam.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which gets paid through the $150 fee for taking the
test, defends the exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no issue with the questions being asked,'' said Dom
Slowey, a spokesman for the exam developer. ``The problem is with
the answers being given.''
</P>
<P>
   One question not answered in the report is why the test may be
such a bad measure of ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the whole story,'' Haney said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, turnover in leadership at the Department of
Education could be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   David Driscoll, the third education commissioner in as many
years, said the exam was reviewed by hundreds of Massachusetts
teachers before it was implemented to ensure accuracy, relevancy,
and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the department was already preparing a technical and
external review, as planned from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   However, Laura Barrett, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts
Teachers Association, said the report ``raises extremely serious
concerns about the legitimacy of this testing program.''

HEARST AND MIRAMAX TO SPLIT COST OF TINA BROWN MAGAZINE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hearst &UR;  &LR; Magazines and Miramax Films announced Thursday that they
had agreed to publish Talk magazine, with Tina Brown as editor, as
a joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   The move will pit Ms. Brown against her former Conde Nast
colleagues Graydon Carter and David Remnick in a battle for
readership and advertising dollars. Carter replaced Ms. Brown as
editor in chief of Vanity Fair when she left for The New Yorker.
Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, was hired by Ms. Brown as a
staff writer there.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership between Miramax Films, which is owned by Walt
Disney &UR;  &LR; Co., and Hearst Magazines signals a shift for the giant,
no-frills publisher known for producing magazines with a broad
appeal like Popular Mechanics, Food and Cosmopolitan. Hearst will
now be able to boast an editor known for clinking glasses at the
Four Seasons and generating buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Hearst Magazines _ which publishes 19
magazines in the United States, including Good Housekeeping,
Harper's Bazaar and Victoria _ will be responsible for the nuts and
bolts of Talk: circulation, manufacturing, newsstand distribution,
direct-mail efforts and subscription fulfillment. Talk Media, the
parent company, which will still be owned by Miramax, will provide
editorial content, advertising sales and marketing. Other divisions
of Talk Media will eventually develop television programming and
publish books, though details remain vague.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's partnership is limited to the magazine and its Web
site. Executives on both sides of the deal said that start-up costs
for the magazine would be around $50 million, costs that would be
evenly shared by Hearst and Miramax. By joining with Hearst,
Miramax reduces its risk in a business with low profit margins. It
can also take advantage of Hearst's reader database, economies of
scale and bundled advertising packages.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown and Ron Galotti, Talk's publisher, both have personal
equity stakes in the venture and will share in any profits, though
to what extent is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said that the first issue of Talk, which will sell for
$2.95, would arrive in August. Ms. Brown would not discuss specific
editorial content, but said that she had assembled ``a staff of
future stars.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Readers want intelligence and cachet, and they're
the same audience that loved `Pulp Fiction' and `Shakespeare in
Love.''' (Both movies were produced and distributed by Miramax.)
</P>
<P>
   Media buyers said Talk was guaranteed to attract a flurry of
attention _ ``just because of who's behind the magazine,'' said
Ellen Oppenheim, the media director of Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding New
York. ``The hard part is that we don't know what the continuing
editorial vision will be.''
</P>
<P>
   With little information available to advertising agencies, media
buyers are speculating that Galotti, armed with the contacts he
nurtured when he was publisher of Vogue, may be going directly to
the chief executive officers of companies that will advertise in
the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a concern among media buyers that Talk will be a
direct competitor for ad pages with Vanity Fair and The New Yorker.
Alan Jurmain, the media director at Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS, said Talk
would be going after ``an audience _ the intelligentsia, the
literati, whatever label you want to use _ where the pickings are
already relatively slim.''
</P>
<P>
   The partnership also raises the question of differing fiscal
sensibilities. Hearst is not the kind of corporation that dispenses
lavish editorial salaries, nor will it send an editors' luggage
overnight by Federal Express, as Conde Nast has done in the past
for editors who hate carry-ons. Ms. Brown raised the bar on
magazine publishing expenses at The New Yorker. By the time she
left the magazine, The New Yorker was losing more money each year
than when she started, but it was also generating more buzz.

JACKSON WEIGHING BEST WAY TO HELP PARTY IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson addressed the
Chamber of Commerce Thursday in terms tailored to the group's
mission: median household income, comparative annual job growth,
and other economic percentages.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics might have made interesting MBA material, but it
couldn't stop the fidgeting among a roomful of business listeners
expecting fire instead.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jackson, perhaps sensing the disconnection, discarded half
of his prepared speech and launched into a passionate call for
better schools, infusion of capital into poor areas, and building
bridges among the nation's many cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce audience interrupted the speech several
times with applause.
</P>
<P>
   Observers are wondering if Jackson is running for president
again.
</P>
<P>
   He said Thursday he sees more reasons to run than not, but
stressed that his choice will be based on how best he can help the
Democratic Party retain the presidency in 2000 and regain
majorities in both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make a decision about the role I want to play . . .
perhaps later this spring,'' Jackson told reporters. While in New
Hampshire, Jackson said, he intended to ``meet with Democratic and
labor leaders . . . to get some assessment of what they see as our
priorities in the post-impeachment period we're about to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a presidential candidate in 1984 and 1988, sidestepped
a question about whether he would accept an invitation to run as Al
Gore's running mate. But he did single out Gore's late father, a
former US senator from Tennessee, for his moderate politics in the
segregationist South.
</P>
<P>
   Both at the chamber and before 1,000 students at Portsmouth High
School, Jackson spoke of the need for racial respect and
multicultural education.
</P>
<P>
   One way New Hampshire can affirm the importance of civil rights
in American society is to recognize the Martin Luther King federal
holiday, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenge the leaders of this state to honor and recognize
Dr. King's birthday,'' said Jackson, who worked with King before
his assassination in 1968. ``Martin Luther King's work stands out
as a singular, prophetic voice'' on civil rights that transformed
the South and thus the nation, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that New Hampshire, the only state in the nation
that has not adopted the holiday, should reject a suggested ``Civil
Rights Day'' alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson spoke at length about King at Portsmouth High, the alma
mater of Navy Lieutenant Robert Goodman, a hostage whom Jackson
helped free from Syria in 1983. But in addition to recollections
about King's work, Jackson challenged the students to be
participants in democracy.
</P>
<P>
   After his remarks, Jackson coordinated the mass registration of
about 100 new voters. Shaking hands with the pupils and smiling
broadly, Jackson said: ``They think I'm doing this because I want
to be your president.''
</P>
<P>
   After a loud ovation, Jackson continued: ``No, I want to be your
friend _ and that's enough.''

 &HT;    N.C. cult figure sheriff makes airwaves
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, N.C. _ The revolver strapped to Sheriff Gerald Hege's
hip is three feet from inmate Mark Amberson's twitching left
fingers, but the burly lawman dressed in black doesn't seem afraid.
</P>
<P>
   As usual for the notorious sheriff whose many slogans include
``This ain't Mayberry and I ain't Andy,'' 50-year-old Hege holds
the upper hand in his latest publicity-seeking venture: crime-time
talk radio on Tuesday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting next to Amberson, Hege plays host on ``F-Block-101,'' an
hourlong show that the sheriff claims to be the only one of its
kind in America.
</P>
<P>
   `YOU'RE NO ANGEL'
</P>
<P>
   In the confident, slightly impatient voice of a lawman who's
heard a jukebox full of hard-luck tales from people on the wrong
side of the law, Hege probes for details of Amberson's troubled
past, only to snap the inmate back in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're no angel,'' Hege barked at Amberson, after the
muscular, tattooed inmate told the AM radio station WLXN audience
that his wife started the fight that landed him in the Davidson
County jail for 75 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bent her backward over the rail, but she still came after
me,'' Amberson said, as callers lit up the phone lines with words
of consolation and skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is your responsibility to stand up for yourself if you are
not a guilty man,'' a female caller chided Amberson, 31, who was
joined in the cramped, brightly lit studio by another inmate. The
other man, 22, claimed his wife falsely accused him of raping her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like the jail is full of innocent people,'' the
caller said. ``That's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's topic was spouse abuse. In the coming weeks, Hege
plans to bring in inmates accused of everything from burglary to
child molestation.
</P>
<P>
   The 17 callers Tuesday night among the thousands of listeners to
the 5,000-watt radio station embody this piedmont North Carolina
community's mixed but overall supportive feelings about their
two-term sheriff, a Vietnam veteran who drives a black patrol car
with a spiderweb etched across the hood.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Lexington, a city of 19,142 people famous for furniture
and chopped pork barbecue, the sheriff himself is widely viewed as
a piece of work. Part Hollywood, part corn pone, Hege's tough-cop
endeavors delight many along this stretch of NASCAR Alley between
Charlotte and Greensboro, and irritate his political foes who
dismiss him as a showboater in dark sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Crime figures from the North Carolina State Bureau of
Investigation suggest that Hege's department is taking a bite out
of crime.
</P>
<P>
   `THE MAN IN BLACK'
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of 1998, overall incidents of crime in
Davidson County fell by 21 percent compared with the first half of
1997, according to the state agency. However, some categories, such
as homicides, aggravated assaults and overall violent crime, showed
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his election in 1994, Hege yanked the TV sets out
of the county jail, dressed inmates in black-and-white striped
outfits and banned girlie magazines, cigarettes and chewing
tobacco. To prove that he had a soft side, Hege painted two of the
jail's cell blocks pink with blue teddy bears.
</P>
<P>
   The paint job landed Hege in the supermarket tabloid, the
National Inquirer, which is framed in the sheriff's office along
with numerous other articles, letters of praise and awards.
</P>
<P>
   Hege takes a particularly tough public stance against drug
pushers. He warns them on posters and on the sheriff's office Web
page, ``Scum Bags! We don't play in Davidson County.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a cult figure,'' said Bob Stiff, executive editor of
Lexington's newspaper, The Dispatch, which has been feuding with
Hege since last November's election, which the sheriff won easily.
``He is quite powerful politically in this region. People see him
on TV all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And, now, they're hearing him on the radio in a format that WLXN
operations manager Wes Jones said has ``exceeded my expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, some youths are listening to this show, or anybody
else who is on the edge,'' Jones said. ``You know, there are a lot
of people on the edge of getting in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Hege, who draws autograph seekers wherever he goes, said people
are fascinated by crime. ``They really love it when you're talking
to somebody who has been tried, convicted and put in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, callers wanted to know whether Amberson and
the other inmate, who did not want to be identified, had ever gone
to church when their marriages turned into a string of bruising
domestic incidents. Another wanted to know whether the couples'
children had witnessed their parents fighting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the callers seemed more intent on taking a shot at Hege
than the inmates. She wanted to know whether the prisoners got time
off for appearing on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Hege was poised like a cocked gun, firing back, ``The only thing
they get is a cup of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   The show ended with an excerpt from ``The Man in Black,'' a song
that deputy Hal Triplett wrote for Hege.
</P>
<P>
   The two inmates headed back to jail, accompanied by two
sheriff's officers, including Hege's cousin, David Hege. The
sheriff and his wife, Geri, departed in the sleek, powerful
``Spider Car.''
</P>
<P>
   The cruiser's windows are tinted black, but most everybody knows
who is behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a lot of things that others were afraid to do,''
said 80-year-old farmer John Lopp, a Democrat who voted for the
Republican sheriff in November's election. ``He has done a lot of
good.

POLICE VICTIM'S PARENTS LEARN OF ESTEEM IN WHICH OTHERS HELD HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GINGER THOMPSON with GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sitting on two folding metal chairs in between the
candy-counter and the magazine rack of a convenience store on
Manhattan's 14th Street, Kadiadou and Seikou Diallo sat and
listened to a community tell stories about their son.
</P>
<P>
   A cashier told them that their son urged him every day to stop
drinking. The owner of the store showed them the videotapes he sold
on a table out front, a job in which he never missed a day. And an
imam told them he was a good Muslim, presenting the parents with
the silk rug that he used to kneel upon to pray.
</P>
<P>
   As the people in the convenience store spoke, Mrs. Diallo
listened, rocking and sobbing in the same cream-colored chair that
her son had used to sell his wares. Seikou Diallo sat next to her,
struggling to keep his deep voice steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good boy,'' Diallo said over and over. ``He was a
very good boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Amadou Diallo died last week in a storm of bullets fired at him
by four New York City police officers as they followed him into his
Bronx home. The shooting has prompted angry protests and calls for
a federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But his parents said they came to New York to learn about their
son's life in the city the last two years as much as to press for
justice over his death.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving in the city this week, they have visited the
places most important to him _ the small, red-brick apartment
building in the Bronx where he lived and died; the convenience
store where he worked; and the homes of several relatives in town.
</P>
<P>
   They said that they are proud to find that while their son
struggled to make ends meet, his life was one of honesty and
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amadou was from Guinea,'' said Mrs. Diallo during an interview
Thursday night, ``but now, Amadou is from the whole world because
the whole world is sympathizing with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with the Diallos and with people who knew their slain
son provided a complicated portrait of a generous man, full of the
curiosity and optimism of youth. Known by everyone as Ahmed, he
lived the life of a poor street peddler, selling tube socks and
video tapes on the street. But his story is not like the oft-told
tale of an immigrant who comes to America to support a
poverty-stricken family back home.
</P>
<P>
   He came from a well-to-do family and left a home that some
describe as a mansion. His father works as an art merchant who
travels back and forth between Guinea and Vietnam. And Amadou
studied English and computer engineering in private schools in
Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Sept. 2, 1975, Amadou Diallo is the oldest of four
children. His parents said he came to America to pursue his dreams
for a college education and adventure. An avid newspaper reader, he
planned to take classes to improve his English, get his GED and
eventually enroll in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amadou was the kind of boy who had ambition to go to school
and to be somebody,'' Diallo said.
</P>
<P>
   He was a devout Muslim, praying in a crowded storeroom five
times a day. In January, the last time Diallo spoke to his son,
they talked about Ramadan and the son assured the father he was
observing the ritual fasts.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he earned about $20 a day, friends said he often
reach into his pocket to give a buck to the beggars who passed the
store where he worked, or to loan money to students at the high
school across the street. One student, Mohammed Ahmed, said Amadou
Diallo had just loaned him $43 to file his income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But while he was happy with his life in New York, friends said
the 22-year-old also missed his family, especially his mother. He
considered going to live with a brother in Angola, but he thought
that country, torn by civil strife, was too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was destiny,'' Mrs. Amadou reflected, when asked
why her son chose to come to the United States. ``God sent him here
for a mission and now he has completed that mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days days, the Diallos have shunned offers for
police escorts as they have traveled around the city to visit with
the people who knew their son. The parents, both bleary eyed from
sorrow and exhaustion, spoke at the end of an afternoon with their
son's friends and family. They said they did not mind the media
frenzy ignited by their visit here, and instead said they felt
strengthened by the thousands of people who have gathered over the
last week at demonstrations and community meetings to protest their
son's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have given me the courage to stand here, because all of
you have stood by us,'' Mrs. Diallo said at a community meeting in
Harlem. ``We are crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo arrived Tuesday and went immediately to the
vestibule, about the size of a walk-in closet, where her son was
shot. When her husband arrived the next day, he stopped for a
shower and went there as well.
</P>
<P>
   Burning candles light the dark hallway that is filled with
flowers, posters and sympathy cards. The walls are pocked with
bullet holes, each one numbered with black magic marker.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo collapsed in the entryway, wailing her son's name.
Her husband, often restrained and reserved, said he expects city
officials to deal justly with the men responsible for killing his
son.

JURY DECIDES HANDGUN MAKERS LIABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what could be a landmark verdict, a Brooklyn jury
Thursday found several handgun manufacturers liable for seven
victims of gunshot wounds, just as courts elsewhere have held
tobacco companies liable for deaths and illnesses caused by
cigarette smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which reached judgment after six days of often-heated
deliberations, awarded damages of $560,000 to just one victim,
Steven Fox, 19, the only one who survived the bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Joshua Horwitz, executive director of the Educational
Fund to End Handgun Violence, said: ``This is a day of reckoning.
The gun industry is going to have to change the way it does
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar lawsuits have been filed in Chicago, Miami, New Orleans,
and Bridgeport, Conn., while city officials are contemplating suits
in Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Horwitz said that after the Brooklyn verdict, ``Those other
cases seem pretty strong.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the gun makers said they would file a motion for
a mistrial. John Renzulli, whose clients include Glock Inc., said
the verdict ``completely makes no sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn case marks the first time such a suit has gone all
the way to trial, or resulted in a finding of liability. Of the 25
arms manufacturers that were sued, the jury found 15 liable,
including such major companies as Beretta USA Corp, Colt's
Manufacturing Co., and Jennings Firearms Inc. Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp.
and Sturm, Ruger and Co. were among the companies cleared.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed over three years ago by the relatives of six
victims who were killed by handguns in New York City and Yonkers in
1993-94, as well as by the mother of a teenager _ Fox _ who
survived a shooting but was left crippled with a bullet lodged in
his brain.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, lawyers for the gun manufacturers argued that
their clients merely sold legal products to licensed dealers and
that, therefore, they should not be held responsible for crimes
committed by the purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   However, lawyers for the victims argued that the entire handgun
industry is guilty of negligence in the way it allows its products
to be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   They cited recent studies by the US Treasury Department's Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, showing that a high percentage of
guns used in crimes were legally purchased from gun dealers and
then resold to youth gangs or felons.
</P>
<P>
   David Kennedy, a professor at Harvard University's John F.
Kennedy School of Government and director of the Boston Gun
Project, said this finding ``was contrary to what everybody
previously believed'' _ namely, that guns used in crimes had been
stolen from people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   The victims' lawyers also cited a study by the National Economic
Research Association, concluding that dealers in states with very
weak gun-control laws are supplied with far more guns than their
local markets could absorb.
</P>
<P>
   This study concluded the manufacturers over-supply these
markets, knowing _ or willfully ignoring the fact _ that many of
the excess guns will be bought by criminals, who cross state lines
to evade their own much tighter local gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, which has some of the strictest gun laws in the
country, 90 percent of the guns used in crimes are purchased out of
state. Nearly half are bought in the five states _ Georgia,
Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina _ known to
have the loosest laws.
</P>
<P>
   During the month-long trial, the victims' lawyers argued that
the gun industry's failure to control this situation amounts to
``negligent distribution,'' which makes them liable for resulting
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-makers' lawyers countered this argument with three
points. First, they questioned the statistics as speculative and
based on a very small sampling of gun dealers. Second, they cited
instances in which manufacturers have cooperated with the
government in tracing guns.
</P>
<P>
   Third, they contended that the victims' arguments are irrelevant
in the Brooklyn case because, in six of the seven shootings, no gun
was ever found and, therefore, no company can be held remotely
liable for the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's verdict indicates that at least these 11 jurors in
Brooklyn _ nine women and two men _ bought the plaintiffs' basic
argument that the trade practices and negligence of the entire gun
industry contributes to violence.
</P>
<P>
   One key may have been a deposition from Robert Hass, a former
executive with Smith &AMP; Wesson, who testified that handgun makers
take a ``see-no-evil'' approach to distributing their wares.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morris, the head of Tauras International Manufacturing
Inc., also admitted that his company had ``never cut off'' any
wholesaler or retailer ``for sloppy distribution practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury spent the last several days deadlocked. Thursday
morning, it sent a note to the federal judge, Jack Weinstein,
saying that 10 of the 11 jurors were heading in a common direction
but that was holding out, fearful that the verdict ``will open the
floodgate of lawsuits across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein told the jurors they were not to consider factors
beyond this immediate case. Late in the afternoon, they reached a
unanimous verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict-sheet instructed the jury to assess liability of
each defendant, then figure out which of the seven plaintiffs would
receive any and how much money. The manufacturers would split the
payment according to their percentages of market share.

MEDIA CRITIC JAMES FALLOWS TOSSES BARBS AT D.C. PRESS CORPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ An aging, out-of-touch and unaccountable Washington,
D.C., press corps has badly misread American public opinion during
the 387-day saga of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, assuming citizens
would be as titilated and anxious for details as the capital media
elite.
</P>
<P>
   That is the opinion of James Fallows, former editor of U.S. News
&AMP; World Report and a longtime critic of the preoccupations and pack
mentality that often seem to occupy attention in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a proportion of the network evening news, Monica has
represented more than did the Vietnam War between 1965 and 1968,''
Fallows told a World Affairs Council luncheon in Seattle Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal, he added, underscores the argument that ``what is
interesting to the Washington, D.C., press corps is not interesting
to Americans in everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Fallows angered the capital's ``commentocracy'' _ a
nickname coined by Vice President Al Gore _ by publishing
``Breaking the News: How the Media Undermine American Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The book depicted a press corps preoccupied with their own
celebrity, ready to stress the negative, glibly cynical and
condescending toward the country. Of the pundits on ``The
McLaughlin Group,'' Fallows observed: ``This is the way morons
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   He has skewered the pundits again during the Lewinsky scandal.
Part of the reason for the ``echo chamber'' in Washington, D.C.,
Fallows suggested, is that senior reporters have aged and become
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most geriatric establishment in American life,''
said Fallows. ``I am 49 years old and will turn 50 this year. In
the Washington, D.C., press corps, I am still an up-and-comer. The
same people are covering this as covered Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   The only force certain to reform Washington, D.C., talk shows,
he joked, ``will be the grim reaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallows has not lacked for targets. One pundit who has called
for President Clinton's resignation, David Broder of The Washington
Post, has been writing about politics since the 1960 presidential
election. Conservative commentator Robert Novak has been writing
his column since the mid-1960's. And R. W. Apple of The New York
Times is a veteran of the 1972 Nixon-McGovern campaign. Americans
first heard shouts from Sam Donaldson of ABC News during the Carter
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Fallows delivered a lecture Thursday on the causes of Asia's
economic crisis _ a serious issue that has cut into America's
exports _ but noted that Asia has ``virtually disappeared'' from
national media.
</P>
<P>
   Fallows blamed part of that on what he called ``America's
sustained difficulty at not paying attention to anything other than
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also cited a new emphasis on coverage that he described
as ``all spectacle _ all of the time. ... We seem to need one
transfixing at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallows noted how the O.J. Simpson murder trial captivated the
media in 1994-95. The car crash that killed Princess Diana became a
transfixing event in the late summer and fall of 1997. It was
followed, in January 1998 and through the past year, by Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these events occurred, the whole opinion analysis of the
world was devoted to this subject,'' Fallows said.
</P>
<P>
   Follows cited an op-ed piece written by a teacher in yesterday's
New York Times. The teacher related a school visit by the Rev.
Jesse Jackson. ``All the reporters wanted to know about Jackson's
role counseling Clinton over Monica Lewinsky,'' said Fallows,
``while the students wanted to know what to do to get into a
high-tech job.''

MEISSNITZER TAKES GS GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Her friend and mentor, Anita Wachter, the queen of
Austrian skiing, stood at the bottom of the World Alpine Ski
Championships giant slalom course in the swirling snow, looking up.
</P>
<P>
   A mile up the mountain, Alexandra Meissnitzer stood in the
starting shed, looking down the course into Vail Village, where
5,000 race fans waited with clanging cowbells _ her parents among
them _ to see if this would be the day when the mantle passed from
the retiring queen to a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the electronic beep counted down, Meissnitzer kicked
out of the start and began the fast, looping, rhythmic turns of a
GS race. She did not know it at the time, but over the top half of
the course, she was behind Wachter's time. But then in the steep,
technical turns down the International trail, Meissnitzer _ already
with the world super giant slalom gold in her pocket _ let it all
out, took risks skiing as straight a line as she dared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to risk everything,'' said Meissnitzer, ``and I
did give it all.''
</P>
<P>
   As her skis tripped across the finish, the numbers on the
scoreboard showed that Meissnitzer had added the GS gold to her
collection. Which meant that in the last major race of her career,
the queen had been deposed by 30-100ths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Wachter was done in by one of the first rules she ever learned
about top-level racing: Ski to protect a lead and you're ripe to
lose it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I skied a good first run and skied well over the top half of
the second run,'' said Wachter. ``But then on the bottom, I took no
risks. I didn't push it hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachter, who is skiing well after a severe knee injury last
year, ended up with the bronze medal as Norway's Andrine Flemmen
seized the silver with a huge second run. Flemmen also said she
risked everything, knowing how tight the top times were.
</P>
<P>
   In winning gold and bronze, the Austrian juggernaut also
increased its overall dominance of these games, often known as the
off-year Olympics and considered the pinnacle of international
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Austria has won 12 of 18 medals so far in the worlds, with nine
more at stake. There are 22 countries competing, and the Austrian
dominance of the ski world continues to be the major topic in Vail.
</P>
<P>
   Meissnitzer recalls how all the girls her age who skied dreamed
of becoming famous racers in the No. 1 sport in Austria. Then
getting on the national team, the heavy competition began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all support each other,'' said Meissnitzer, who spotted her
parents shedding tears of joy in the roaring crowd at the finish.
``But we have to be very competitive to get to race. There are many
many good skiers to compete against.''
</P>
<P>
   Other skiing legends took shots at the top, including Sweden's
Pernilla Wiberg, who skied the fastest second run but could not
overcome her ninth-place first run and finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Compagnoni from Italy, a five-time Olympic and world
medalist, was coming off chronic back problems. She skied a solid
run but never challenged the leaders and wound up seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The best US finish of the day was by Kristen Clark from Raymond,
Maine, a product of Carrabassett Valley Academy, who placed 19th.
``It's not a top finish,'' said Clark, who had had a disappointing
year leading into these games, ``but I think I skied well. I have
some confidence.''

AMERICAN JETS HIT 7 IRAQI MILITARY SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American aircraft pounded Iraqi air-defense sites
for the second day in a row Thursday as the Iraq government pledged
to continue challenging American and British control of most of its
skies, using diplomatic as well as military means.
</P>
<P>
   American fighter jets hit seven military sites _ including
surface-to-air missile launchers, radar stations and communications
centers _ in the northern and southern no-flight zones, Pentagon
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials described the strikes as defensive, although the
strikes in the south occurred more than six hours after the Iraqi
actions that the Pentagon cited as justification for attacking. The
severity of the strikes reflected the more aggressive enforcement
of the zones that President Clinton approved last month.
</P>
<P>
   The official Iraqi news agency said that two civilians had been
killed and several wounded. The Pentagon said it could not confirm
the casualties. Officials said the strikes appeared to have
succeeded in hitting their military targets, and expressed
skepticism about Iraq's contentions.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq also reported again that it had shot down an enemy plane.
But Pentagon officials said all the American and British jets that
flew over Iraq Thursday returned safely to their bases.
</P>
<P>
   The American attacks, which resumed on Wednesday after a
weeklong lull, have done little to stop Iraqi challenges to the
zones, which began in December after four nights of air and missile
strikes by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy prime minister of Iraq, Tariq Aziz, said Thursday
that Iraqi forces would confront the American and British forces
``no matter what the sacrifices and the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is flagrant aggression against Iraq,'' Aziz said. ``It is
a flagrant violation of international law and it is a violation and
act of disrespect for Security Council resolutions that Iraq will
not accept.''
</P>
<P>
   The new prime minister of Turkey, Bulent Ecevit, has expressed
misgivings about the American policy toward Iraq in the wake of
weeks of strikes by allied jets that are based at the air base in
Incirlik, Turkey. On Thursday, the United States expressed its
misgivings over Ecevit's willingness to meet Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't understand Prime Minister Ecevit's decision to host
Tariq Aziz at this time,'' a State Department spokesman, James
Foley, said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's willingness to allow the use of the base in Incirlik is
essential to enforcing the northern no-flight zone. The patrols
have always been a source of debate within Turkey's political
parties. But Pentagon officials said they were confident that the
country's powerful military remains committed to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes began Thursday, the Pentagon said, when Iraqi
antiaircraft batteries opened fire near an American F-15E that was
patrolling near the northern city of Mosul and then tracked it with
radar. The jet responded by attacking a communications center
linked to a surface-to-air missile site. Two additional F-15s then
attacked the missile site, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Those attacks were followed an hour later by strikes on an SA-6
mobile missile launcher and other radar and communication centers.
The officials said those strikes were a response to Iraqi forces'
``locking on'' the American planes with radar.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern zone, F-15s based in Saudi Arabia and F-14s and
F-18s from the carrier Carl Vinson attacked targets near
al-Habbariyah and al-Amarah. Those strikes responded to an
incursion into the zone by at least three Iraqi MiG-23 jets more
than six hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials justified the strikes in the south, saying
each violation would invite retaliation. Pilots now routinely fly
with potential targets in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said that commanders in the area have broad authority
to respond as they see fit to reduce the threats that are posed by
the Iraqis,'' a Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Michael Doubleday of the
Navy, said.

FEDERAL JURY HOLDS GUN MAKERS LIABLE FOR SHOOTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the first verdict of its kind, a federal jury in
Brooklyn found Thursday that gun manufacturers were liable for
shootings with illegally obtained handguns because of their
negligent marketing and distribution practices.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit that legal experts called a test case for a wave of
suits that have recently been filed against the gun industry by a
number of large cities, the jury found that 15 of 25 firearms
makers named in the suit had been negligent in their marketing and
distribution methods, and that as many as 9 of the 15 were liable
for three shootings _ two of them fatal _ in the New York City area
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that those nine manufacturers were collectively
liable for the shootings _ even though it was not proved which
company's gun had been used in a particular shooting _ because
their marketing and distribution of handguns were so negligent that
they fostered illegal gun trafficking from states with weak gun
laws to those with strict regulations, such as New York.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors found liability where it had determined that the
companies' negligent marketing and distribution practices had been
a ``proximate cause'' of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, in what
appeared to be a compromise verdict, awarded no damages to
relatives of the two homicide victims in the three shootings where
it found liability. It found only that the shooting victim who
survived was entitled to $3.95 million in damages _ though, given
the intricacies of the case, he would collect only about $500,000
under the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   And the jury found that in four other homicide cases that were
part of the lawsuit, none of the 15 the companies' negligent
marketing and distribution practices were a proximate cause of the
killings and therefore none of the 15 were liable in those four
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the verdict was hailed by all the lawyers for the
plaintiffs _ and the plaintiffs themselves, including those who won
no liability findings or damage awards _ as a major victory in the
growing effort across the country to hold the gun industry liable
for blood shed with illegally obtained firearms, much as lawsuits
have sought to hold the tobacco industry liable for deaths and
illnesses caused by smoking.

   LOS ANGELES _ Twenty years ago, what could have been the most
important bout on live television took place.
</P>
<P>
   It was on the infield of the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when NASCAR was just beginning to gain mass appeal,
CBS decided to make the 1979 Daytona 500 its first live broadcast
of a stock car race. As TV luck would have it, a snowstorm forced
many people in the Northeast and Midwest into their homes and in
front of their sets, creating the proverbial captive audience.
</P>
<P>
   The race held up its end.
</P>
<P>
   Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison battled side-by-side for much
of the final laps. On the last trip around the track, Yarborough
tried to pass Allison, then the leader. Both crashed and spun into
the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Then both jumped out of their cars and started fighting, with
Allison's brother Bobby joining in.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's great TV.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the chaos, there was still a race going on. And CBS
director Bob Fishman, who remembers being ``scared to death'' as he
watched this all unfold, nearly missed the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for (broadcaster) Ken Squier yelling, `Here comes
Richard Petty on Turn 4,' I wouldn't have had them swing the camera
from the finish line back to the turn to see Petty come across to
win,'' Fishman said Wednesday as much of the same CBS crew prepared
for Sunday's event (Channel 2, 9 a.m.), which is now referred to in
the sport as the Super Bowl of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   Fishman, who has since won 11 Emmy Awards for his Daytona work,
wonders how the sport would be today without that bizarre finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know major newspapers didn't cover this sport much then, but
that fistfight vaulted stock car to the front pages of sports,''
Fishman said. ``That incident was a great stroke of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   That race drew a 10.5 rating and 29 share, which remains the
highest-rated Daytona 500 in two decades of live coverage. Last
year, when Dale Earnhardt won his first 500 of his career, it did
an 8.6/23.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time has gone by, we've seen what kind of impact that race
has had,'' said Ned Jarrett, a pit reporter that day for CBS who
has since become a booth analyst for Squier. ``We knew network TV
would elevate the sport, but we didn't realize it would elevate it
as much or as quickly as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   More history: Need another example of NASCAR's acceptance as a
TV sport? CBS is using Greg Gumbel, who admits ``I don't know a
fender from a spoiler,'' as the show's host. For what it's worth,
Gumbel also becomes the first African-American sportscaster
involved in a national race car telecast.
</P>
<P>
   (Meanwhile, Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas lobbied for
and received the role as the race's Grand Marshal).
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't even approach pretending to know everything there is
(about racing) because I don't and I freely admit that, but I can
direct traffic,'' said Gumbel, who knows enough about it from
covering races as a sportscaster in Chicago and at ESPN as a
``SportsCenter'' anchor for a combined 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought me being part of the telecast might even denigrate
it,'' said Gumbel, ``but everyone has been extremely helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS race producer Eric Mann agrees that filling the host role
with Gumbel _ much like NBC will do later this year with Bob Costas
when it covers its first NASCAR event, the Jiffy Lube Miami 400 in
November _ is a sign that the sport has reached another level in TV
coverage and overall acceptability.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just a race,'' said Mann, ``and one of the reasons
Greg is here is to lend his presence and increase the bigness of
the event.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk of Crescenta Valley: Sports Illustrated's ``Star
Athletes And Their Sexy Spouses'' addition to its 36th annual
swimsuit issue includes golfer Tom Lehman and his wife Melissa, a
Crescenta Valley High grad who a year ago caddied for him at the
Nissan Open at the Valencia Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   She says in the caption (page 146): ``I thought it would be
really cool if my kids could say, `Mommy was in Sports
Illustrated!' When I told my mom, she was thumbs-up, and when I
told my pastor, he was way thumbs down.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Angels pitcher Chuck Finley and wifey Tawny
``Bachelor Party'' Kitaen in two poses, the second of which has the
caption: ``Tawny belongs in front of the camera and I love the fact
that she's sensuous and beautiful. I just wish they could have
found a little more material for her bathing suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotta admit, this SI Swimsuiter which will be seen by more than
58 million Americans (or one third of the population) is the
raciest we've seen in many moons. Just start with the foldout index
of Ashley Judd-lookalike Sarah O'Hare wearing a bathing suit made
of ... just sand.
</P>
<P>
   At least Tom Lehman and Chuck Finley can be glad that neither of
their spouses were in the article on body painting called
``Birthday Suits: Six Supermodels In Nothing But Paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Where X's and O's mean kisses and hugs: The NBA's ``I Still Love
This Game'' spin continues with a special half-hour Valentine's Day
production called ``Playing By Heart'' (Channel 4, 11:30 a.m.) that
leads into the triple-header that uses the Lakers-Pacers game at
2:30 p.m. as the middle game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NBA's ``Inside Stuff'' crew was at Warner Brother
Studios in Burbank on Thursday to tape segments on the sets of
NBC's ``Friends'' and ``ER'' that will be included in Saturday's
episode (Channel 4, 11:30 a.m.). The L.A.-slanted show features an
Ahmad Rashad interview at the home of his new best friend,
Shaquille O'Neal, interviews with the Lakers' Derek Fisher and the
Clippers' Scott Brooks and highlights from Magic Johnson's recent
celebrity game in Miami.

<P>
   Can you feel the love?

WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
_The Southern California Sports Broadcasters Association might as
well start voting with absentee ballots for their annual awards
ceremony since it seems like a tough task to get winners to show up
any more. At Monday's ceremony, Hall of Fame inductee
!racepay!Chick Hearn and top TV analyst Stu Lantz were in San
Antonio doing the Lakers game. And there was no Vin Scully, winner
of both the TV and radio play-by-play awards. Finally, when Ross
Porter was a no-show after his name was called as the winner for
best talk show category _ Irv Kaze won three years in a row, so he
wasn't eligible _ master of ceremonies Super Dave Osborne quipped:
``C'mon, you mean you couldn't get Ross Porter to show up? Is Rory
Markas here? Just give him the award if he's here.'' (By the way,
we got that story second hand. We weren't there either). &QL; 
_Joe McDonnell sightings. On KCBS-Channel 2 as a field reporter
from the Forum. On KFWB-AM (980) as a sports anchor, which could be
a more permanent gig for him. McDonnell's in such demand, he's got
to be thinking that KXTA-AM (1150), or whatever they're calling
themselves these days, should have fired him sooner. &QL; 
_The Angels tied up Larry Kahn, who made a run as the team's No. 2
play-by-play man a year ago, as their pre- and post-game talk show
host on KLAC-AM (570) this season. Kahn says he will go by the name
``Dr. Angel Fever.'' &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
_Would you pay to see former KABC Channel 7 sportscaster Rick
Lozano? Gonna have to if Oscar De La Hoya is invited to your boxing
party Saturday night. Lozano, posing as a reporter, is the .95 part
of the $44.95 price tag for TVKO's package on De La Hoya's bout
against Ike Quartey. Unofficial scorer Harold Lederman already
gives Lozano high marks, so you know what that means. &QL; 
_A belated ``choke'' to the city's sports-talk stations for sitting
oblivious on the sidelines a couple of weeks ago when KLOS-FM's
Mark &AMP; Brian secured St. Louis Cardinals star Mark McGwire as an
in-studio guest for their show. As Don Barrett wrote on his L.A.
Radio Web site column, McGwire admitted on Mark &AMP; Brian's show that
he went into therapy in 1991 after hitting .201 because ``I had no
idea who I was as an athlete or a person... I needed to get some
help to find out who Mark McGwire is and what he likes and what he
wants to do in life. I stepped up to the plate and went and got
some therapy for myself.'' &QL;

MODERATE N.E. SENATORS CONTINUE MAVERICK ROLE IN GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Olympia Snowe's decision to acquit Clinton
on both impeachment counts signaled further defeat for Republicans,
further victory for Democrats, further proof impeachment will fail.
But it is the ``mod squad'' that may enjoy the impact most.
</P>
<P>
   The ``squad,'' as it is known, of four moderate New England
Republicans, has been in tricky territory throughout the trial,
caught between their party and their more-liberal constituents.
They were among the few wild cards, the few votes in question until
the very end. Many wondered whether they would give in to pressure,
and vote with the party as many moderate Republicans in the House
did.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's announcement, however, it was clear: the New
England moderates still exist as a distinct bloc. Senators Snowe,
John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, and James M. Jeffords of Vermont,
three of the four Republicans so far to announce they will acquit
on both counts, continued their ``history of being mavericks'' _
and in doing so, restated their independence from the party's right
wing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Maine Senator Susan M. Collins told senators she
was planning to acquit on both counts, sources in both parties
said. Collins, the fourth of the New England moderates, made her
statements during confidential deliberations in the Senate, and
does not plan to announce her decision until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a brand of Republicanism that is somewhat unique,'' said
Patrick Garahan, the chairman of the Vermont Republican Party.
``There's a certain amount of respect that they aren't controlled
by the party. Frankly, as a party chairman, it sometimes makes my
life difficult. I've received several phone calls from irate
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords, who on Wednesday became the first moderate to make his
intentions public, was clearly pleased that so much of the
opposition to impeachment came from New England, and that the
articles would fail even to gain a majority because of the moderate
bloc votes. He practically beamed as he emerged from the day of
speeches Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good, because I believe we are not going to set a very
dangerous precedent,'' Jeffords said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the New England bloc had been able to garner so much
influence, Jeffords said, ``That's where the power of the country
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England senators are well aware of the power of their
status as a swing vote, not only on impeachment but on across the
board. They have broken away from the GOP repeatedly in the past _
on campaign finance, welfare reform, abortion _ and have been
viewed with great suspicion by the party in the past, even as they
have been heavily courted to sign on to Republican plans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after Thursday's announcements, the New England moderates
may be thrust into a new role: as living proof the party is not
dominated by its conservative wing, which is perceived by much of
the public as having conducted an impeachment witch hunt, damaging
the party in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the Republican Party is a party of individualists,
unlike the Democrats,'' said Cliff May, communications director of
the Republican National Committee. ``The leadership in the party
has said all along that every member should vote his conscience.
There's nobody dictating. That's different from the Democrats,
where everyone will vote in lockstep.''
</P>
<P>
   The four moderates face election concerns nonetheless. Three of
them _ Snowe, Chafee and Jeffords _ are up for reelection in 2000,
and can expect conservative Republican opponents in their primary
races. At the same time, they may face liberal opponents in a
general race; Independent Representative Bernie Sanders, who is a
declared Socialist, has indicated he may challenge Jeffords in
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the New England moderates approach such challenges
together, consulting each other frequently and having lunch, along
with Senator Arlen Specter, in each others' offices every Wednesday
afternoon. Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, was the other
senator to announce he would not convict Clinton on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters clearly wish the group were smaller: Both Jeffords
and Specter have been flooded with phone calls from infuriated
voters nationwide ever since their announcements, and Jeffords has
even received death threats, said Susan Russ, Jeffords's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   But at the RNC, May said there was no reason to give the
moderates anything but support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really have more issues in common with the GOP than
dividing them,'' he said. ``It's like Ronald Reagan, who put
together this winning coalition and said, `The guy who agrees with
me 80 percent of the time, he's my ally, not my adversary.' ''

AMERICAN PILOTS DEFY JUDGE; SICKOUT FORCES MORE FLIGHTS TO BE
CANCELED
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Defying a federal judge's order to end their protest and return
to work, more pilots called in sick on Thursday at American
Airlines, forcing the carrier to cancel more than half of its
flights and ensuring that its operations will be crippled during
the Presidents Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The disruption at American, which has now lasted six days,
continued to upset the plans of tens of thousands of travelers and
businesses around the world. The airline, the nation's second
largest, said on Thursday that it had already canceled 500 flights
scheduled for Friday and would probably have to eliminate more.
Passengers will have fewer alternatives on Friday than in previous
days because most airlines are expected to have full planes.
</P>
<P>
   American filed a motion on Thursday in U.S. District Court in
Texas, contending that the Allied Pilots Association, the union
that represents American's 9,200 pilots, should be found to be in
comtempt for not complying with Judge Joe Kendall's order on
Wednesday to end the sickout. A hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. on
Friday in Dallas, where AMR Corp., American's parent, has its
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that the judge will be satisfied that we are
doing what we have to do to comply with the order,'' said Rich
LaVoy, the union's president.
</P>
<P>
   Union representatives and the airline met on Thursday to try to
negotiate an end to the dispute. It was not clear whether progress
had been made toward a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   American said that the number of pilots calling in sick rose to
2,400 yesterday from 2,077 on Wednesday. Normally, 400 pilots are
out sick. As a result of the absences, the airline grounded 1,170
flights, more than half of its 2,250 flights daily, compared with
1,000 flights canceled on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots, many of whom are embittered after years of poor
labor relations at the airline, are angry about the way American
plans to integrate Reno Air, a small airline in the West that it
bought in December for $124 million. American has said that it
intends to take a year to 18 months to merge the two carriers. The
pilots want the integration to go faster, and they want Reno Air's
pilots and their members paid as if the integration were already
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Some pilots began calling in sick last Saturday after
negotiations between the union and American Airlines broke down.
More joined in, causing more flights to be canceled each day.
</P>
<P>
   American went to court on Wednesday and Kendall issued a
back-to-work order.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the numbers it doesn't appear that those pilots who have
called in sick are complying with the judge's order,'' said John
Hotard, a spokesman for American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But the union said it was in full compliance. After giving the
judge's order an ambiguous endorsement in a telephone message to
members, the union issued a stronger statement on Thursday, saying
that it did not ``authorize, ratify or condone'' a sickout or a
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We further instruct all pilots to resume their normal working
schedule and to otherwise comply with Judge Kendall's order,'' it
added.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the parties in the dispute, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said Kendall listened to the first
telephone message Thursday morning and called the union to voice
his displeasure, prompting the union to change the message.
</P>
<P>
   LaVoy denied that the union had contact with the judge on
Thursday. Kendall did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even after the union used the stronger language, it was still
difficult to determine how many pilots would return to the cockpit.
``That is what the leadership has to say,'' said one pilot on the
sick list who insisted on anonymity, referring to the union's order
to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the protesting pilots argue that the court order applies
only to the union's leadership, not to pilots acting on their own.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Gangemi, a labor lawyer in the Chicago office of
Winston &AMP; Strawn who often represents management, said that that
simply was not true. ``It would be surprising if the court would
tolerate this continuing injury to the public under the fiction
that the union has no control over the situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations require pilots to take themselves out of the
cockpit if they are sick, suffering from stress or otherwise not
fit to fly. Many veteran pilots have accumulated dozens of sick
days that allow them to stay on the sick list and still get paid.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the financial damage to AMR rise as the number of
canceled flights increases. Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst
at Paine Webber in New York, said the sickout would reduce AMR's
revenues for the quarter between $82 million and $110 million and
cut its earnings between 25 cents and 40 cents a share, if
American's operations begin returning to normal on Friday. He also
said the company might lose an additional $50 million in lost
bookings from customers who buy tickets on other airlines during
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the pilots return to work on Friday, a settlement
between the union and the company will be needed to even begin to
break down the pilots' intense mistrust of management. Many pilots
trace their ill will to the reign of Robert L. Crandall, AMR's
former chairman and chief executive, who retired last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a tough person to deal with, he created his
counterpart in the union,'' said one pilot not on the sick list,
who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Carty, Crandall's successor, began his tenure pledging
to improve management-labor relations and make American a happier
place to work. He has tried to allay the pilots' fears that
acquiring Reno Air is a ploy to lower pilot pay rates at American,
pledging that he is committed to bringing Reno Air's pilots under
the union contract.
</P>
<P>
   But even pilots who have not called in sick say Carty has not
succeeded in improving pilots' feelings toward the company.

DEVITO/VERDI PLAYS IN THE BIG LEAGUES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Calif.   )   By   PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Little more than a decade ago, Ellis Verdi was making
cold calls for accounts from his Upper East Side apartment, where
he had started an advertising agency with an Apple Macintosh and an
extra phone line.
</P>
<P>
   Today, his company, DeVito/Verdi, is considered one of New
York's hot shops with $115 million in billings, 86 employees and a
growing client base. With its winning in December of the $40
million-plus account for the Office Depot Inc. chain of office
products superstores and a string of other smaller, but important
assignments from major advertisers such as Seagram, Canon and Sony
Electronics, the agency seems poised to become a national player in
the $58 billion advertising business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hot right now,'' said Linda Fidelman, president of
Advice and Advisors, a New York advertising agency search firm.
</P>
<P>
   How does a tiny agency grow into a player? DeVito/Verdi's
success has a lot to do with its creative ability and determination
to win business. But it also had good timing. What Verdi could not
have forseen back when he left his account job at Grey Advertising
was that business would become more receptive to smaller shops for
reasons ranging from changes in media buying to the problem of
commercial clutter.
</P>
<P>
   One big reason for the new receptivity is the ever-elusive
consumer. Deluged by an overload of commercial messages every day,
consumers are zapping, overlooking or just deliberately tuning out
advertising, studies continue to show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fundamentally getting harder to cut through all the
things that conspire to clutter the consumer's mind, and the
solutions that are working are less conventional, with the smaller
agencies producing some of the more noticeable, breakthrough
things,'' said Stephen Bowen, who spent his early career at the
giant J. Walter Thompson and is now director of new business for
Merkley Newman Harty, a six-year-old start-up that now has $200
million in billings.
</P>
<P>
   So-called breakthrough work _ advertising that is different,
arresting, and above all remembered by consumers _ is historically
what has allowed creative boutiques to transform themselves into
national agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., is now legend in the
business for creating the ``Just Do It'' campaigns for a once
little-known company called Nike Inc. The same is true of the
former Chiat/Day of Los Angeles (now TBWA Chiat/Day, a unit of
Omnicom Group), which is credited with defining the Super Bowl
blockbuster commercial with its famous ``1984'' spot that
introduced Apple Macintosh to the country.
</P>
<P>
   There are other examples. Kirshenbaum, Bond &AMP; Partners, New
York, which opened in 1987 and now has $310 million in billings,
created Snapple's original advertising using the inimitable Wendy
as spokeswoman. Hal Riney &AMP; Partners (now the Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney
unit of Publicis S.A. in San Francisco) was behind the homespun
Bartles &AMP; Jaymes duo for E &AMP; J Gallo Winery. Goodby, Berlin &AMP;
Silverstein (now Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, part of Omnicom)
came up with the offbeat ``Got Milk?'' campaign. Deutsch Inc., New
York, transformed itself into an $800 million agency with
attention-getting work for clients like Ikea and Tanqueray.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started our agency, we were breaking the rules, not
adhering to them, and that's one reason we're doing so well,''
explained Richard Kirshenbaum of Kirshenbaum, Bond &AMP; Partners.
</P>
<P>
   One major business factor that has helped small agencies compete
is the trend toward ``unbundling'' _ which generally means
assigning responsibility to create commercials to one agency and
giving media buying to another shop. Unbundling requires less staff
and fewer resources of an ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   The unbundling trend, combined with a stellar creative
reputation, has helped Andy Berlin, a founder of the former Goodby
Berlin &AMP; Silverstein, to develop Berlin Cameron, New York, into an
agency with $200 million in capitalized billings. Opened a year
ago, the shop creates advertising and defines strategy for clients
like Reebok, the Cadillac division of General Motors and the
National Basketball Association _ leaving media buying
responsibilities to other shops.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even great success in the agency business can be
temporal, and paved with pitfalls. The agency business is littered
with once hot ad agencies whose fortunes have waned with their
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising is the first part of the budget to get cut,''
Berlin said. ``There is no advertising stability.''
</P>
<P>
   It is even harder to establish a creative reputation in New
York, where there are dozens of small shops, not to mention the
giants of the agency world. The American Association of Advertising
Agencies, a trade group in New York known as the Four As, said 19
of the nation's 20 largest agencies have their headquarters in New
York. And some of the big shops are now going after accounts as
small as $1 million in billings because they saw from the small
agencies that they ``can become big future accounts,'' said Ms.
Fidelman of Advice and Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Verdi said, it is not unusual to go on a pitch and
discover ``you're the 11th agency pitching and there's four more to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, DeVito/Verdi has the advantage of being known in the
city where its sometimes brash work has sparked its share of
controversy. The agency enraged Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani with an
outdoor ad in 1997 that promoted New York magazine as ``Possibly
the only good thing in New York that Rudy hasn't taken credit
for.''
</P>
<P>
   But the agency's pivotal moment came when Verdi hooked up in
1992 with Sal DeVito, an established art director who had worked at
Chiat/Day and Levine Huntley Schmidt &AMP; Beaver, now defunct. Call it
chutzpah, call it moxie _ whatever it was, the two native New
Yorkers apparently fused in a potent chemistry that has led to a
slew of award-winning advertising. Last year, the agency became the
first shop ever named the ``Best Small Agency'' in the nation for
four consecutive years by the Four A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is real simpatico between us _ the unspoken conversation
is very good,'' said Verdi, who recalled that in their very first
pitch together, they turned to walk out on the presentation when
the client, New York's South Street Seaport, became combative. The
agency still won the account.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's defining moment came early on when it turned down a
lucrative $16 million financial account that required creating dull
financial rate ads. Had it taken the account, Verdi said,
DeVito/Verdi would have become another small shop mired in
collateral work, rather than a feisty New York shop aiming to
compete creatively with the best in the business.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito/Verdi is getting its chance in the big leagues with the
Office Depot account, which represents the agency's first step
toward establishing a national presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting close,'' Verdi said. ``But we're not there
yet.''

OLYMPIC MARKETING CHIEF REASSURES SPONSORS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   With the notable exception of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance
Co., the biggest Olympic sponsors are comfortable with Olympic
officials' handling of the corruption scandal, the Games' chief
marketing official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sponsors have been very supportive of the efforts we've
been making to date to clean up this problem,'' Dick Pound, an
International Olympic Committee vice president, said in a
conference call from New York. ``There is nobody that has
withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound voiced calm amid a rising tide of allegations, most
recently the addition this week of 10 IOC members' names to the
list of alleged wrongdoers. Fourteen IOC members had been
implicated previously.
</P>
<P>
   Pound sought to put a positive spin on criticisms by David
D'Alessandro, president of Boston-based John Hancock, that the IOC
still has not acted decisively enough to reverse the damage from
the two-month-old controversy. D'Alessandro said this week he was
canceling negotiations with NBC for $20 million in Olympic ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he thinks he's trying to help us,'' Pound said of
D'Alessandro. ``He has been for many years one of the most positive
of the Olympic sponsors. John Hancock has made fabulous use of that
sponsorship for the betterment of their business. I think he would
like very much to continue it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound added, however, that D'Alessandro's actions were
unnecessary. ``We are saying that even without that pressure we
would be doing the same thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock is one of 11 companies in the IOC's highest-level
sponsorship program; membership costs $40 million to $50 million in
exchange for use of the Olympic logo.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with with all 11 sponsors and NBC television at
the Hill &AMP; Knowlton public relations firm in midtown Manhattan
Thursday, IOC marketing director Michael Payne told reporters he
had assured the group there would be a ``total housecleaning'' of
the IOC. He said ``we will expel anybody who is found guilty,'' and
promised there will also be ``significant reforms,'' though he
declined to discuss specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said the sponsors, who were not available for comment,
were ``pleased'' with these assurances, and none are withdrawing
from their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Pound said the IOC would pursue the allegations
contained in the Salt Lake City ethics report released Tuesday,
which provided new details on the allegations of vote-buying and
influence-peddling surrounding the awarding of the 2002 Winter
Games.
</P>
<P>
   He rebuffed suggestions that the IOC deserved more blame for
failing to rein in members accused of the most egregious excesses.
For instance, the ethics report said Jean-Claude Ganga of the
Republic of Congo made at least a half-dozen trips to Utah, brought
along several family members, ran up huge bills, and arranged for
an assortment of free medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly were not wilfully blind,'' he said. ``We didn't
know about it. It's not the sort of thing the member involved talks
about . . . It came as a huge surprise to us to see the magnitude
of what was involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said he still hoped the Olympic cleanup could be completed
in time for a special IOC meeting scheduled for March 17 and 18 in
Lausanne, Switzerland. Then, when the IOC meets again in June to
choose the site of the 2006 Winter Games, the worst of the scandal
will begin to recede into history, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a higher standard expected of the Olympic
Games generally and the IOC in particular,'' Pound said. ``I think
the vast majority of our members adhere to those higher standars.
It appears that some of our members have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Those members, he said, would face the ``ultimate sanction,''
expulsion from the IOC.

SENATORS DOUBT WHETHER EITHER IMPEACHMENT ARTICLE WILL DRAW A
SIMPLE MAJORITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the five-week-long impeachment trial drew to its
close, the Senate on Thursday debated President Clinton's fate
behind closed doors, certain to acquit him but passionate in
condemning the behavior that one Democrat said had led to a
``sordid spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   With the final verdict set for Friday and senators sure that
they would not muster the 67 votes that would be required to
convict Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice,
the only question remaining is whether even one of the two articles
of impeachment _ obstruction of justice _ would draw a simple
majority.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, the perjury charge against Clinton appeared
virtually guaranteed to draw less than a majority and it was
possible that the obstruction article, too, could receive fewer
than 51 votes. ``My guess is that it will be at least 50-50,'' said
Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt. He added that at least five Republicans
would vote to acquit the president of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, of Maine, on Thursday became the fourth
Republican moderate to announce that she would vote to acquit
Clinton on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it, I find the president's behavior
deplorable and indefensible,'' Snowe said in a statement. But, she
said, ``I determined that the only way I could approach this case
was to ask myself `if I were the deciding vote could I remove this
president under these circumstances?' The answer, I conclude, is
no.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several senators said that Sen. Susan Collins,
R-Maine, also indicated in the Senate chamber that she would vote
to acquit the president on both counts. And Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., told colleagues he would vote against the perjury count. If
none of these Republicans waver before the final votes, at least
eight Republicans would vote against the perjury charge and five
against obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, who number 45 to the Republicans' 55 senators,
held their ranks in support of the president on Thursday. Only the
judgment of Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., remained unknown. He plans
to speak in the closed deliberations on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be outraged that William Jefferson Clinton's
personal failings debased himself and his office,'' said Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., whose final position had been considered uncertain.
``But they did not cause permanent injury to the proper functioning
of our government,'' he said, coming out for acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   With senators determined to explain their thinking on a vote
many considered one of the most significant of their careers, Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said he expected
the final roll call on guilty or not-guilty to come at noon or
earlier on Friday. Only a handful of speakers were left for final
debate, including Lott and Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done our duty,'' Lott said during an afternoon break.
``We've done it the constitutionally required way.'' Once the
Senate ends the trial, a certified record of its final judgment is
to be submitted to the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, as
required under the Senate's impeachment rules.
</P>
<P>
   With a move to censure the president now appearing all but dead,
its proponents were working toward a test vote Friday that would at
least demonstrate some bipartisan support for such a rebuke. A
two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, would be required to change
Senate rules and bring the censure motion to the floor. Opponents,
mostly Republicans, said the votes were not there. ``Censure's
dead,'' declared Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote of the
Senate to convict a president, Clinton will be acquitted Friday
whether or not a mere majority votes against him on either article.
But the numbers are politically significant for how the impeachment
effort is likely to be ultimately judged. Opponents of conviction
from both parties said that if House prosecutors failed to win 51
votes on either charge against Clinton, it would signal that they
had been too zealous in pursuing a case that had not won bipartisan
backing or public support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it sends a very loud message to the House of
Representatives,'' said Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D. ``Don't ever, ever
send to the Senate again articles of impeachment that are this weak
and partisan.'' Jeffords said he wished the House had recognized
that a proposal floated by former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy
 &UR;  &LR; Carter to censure Clinton had been ``a pretty good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., however, scoffed at the vote
counting. ``If Republicans think they can celebrate because it's 50
and Democrats can celebrate at 49, then I've missed something,'' he
said. ``This does not have great value.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Senate chamber, the day's solemn mood was somewhat
tarnished by reports that Clinton planned an all out drive to help
Democrats win back the House in 2000, and topple the Republicans
who had impeached him in December largely along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is deeply troubling that the president views closure of
this constitutional process as an opportunity for revenge,'' Lott
said in a statement. But the political wrangling did not appear to
be affecting the deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate deliberated on its verdict for a third day,
senators circumvented the secrecy rules by sending out a flood of
printed statements or by holding news conferences. They divided
largely along party lines on Clinton's guilt or innocence, but all
condemned Clinton in stinging language.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., had said he was
leaning toward voting for acquittal on perjury. But on Thursday, he
said he would vote to convict Clinton on both articles. ``I refuse
to say that high political polls and soaring Wall Street indexes
give license to those in high places who act in low and illegal
ways,'' he said.

A MULTIRACIAL FAREWELL TO `MAMA'

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Anyone who shopped at Chung-bok Hong's small
market here more than once got used to calling her what the rest of
the working-class neighborhood did: ``Mama.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not matter that she was a Korean-American and most of her
customers were black in a city where the two groups have a recent
history of bad blood. She treated young and old with respect and
kindness and they treated her the same. Mama knew that everyone was
chasing the American Dream; some people just ran a little faster or
had better running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   When young mothers came in with no money for diapers or milk,
Mama put the items in a bag and whispered, ``Pay me next time,''
and they did.
</P>
<P>
   When the teen-age boys came in with their baggy pants and their
trying-to-look-tough faces, Mama smiled at them and went about her
business. After all, she had a son of her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't follow you around the store like you were going to
steal something,'' Terrence Smith, 18, said Thursday outside the
dark and locked market. ``She treated you like a person. She didn't
treat you like a color. I'm going to miss her.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hong, 52, was killed last week during a robbery at the
store in South Central Los Angeles. Thursday, a few blocks away,
black, Korean and Hispanic people, sitting side by side, gathered
at St. Brigid Roman Catholic Church for her funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Even in death, Mama was still making strangers feel like family.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hong did not live in the neighborhood, but her husband,
Chung-pyo, wanted her funeral held there so her customers of more
than 15 years could say goodbye, said city Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas, who represents the neighborhood where Mrs. Hong was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is incredible,'' Ridley-Thomas said as he watched the
mourners on the steps of the church waiting to hug Hong.
</P>
<P>
   Ridley-Thomas said the scene of sorrow was in sharp contrast to
the angry pictures after the shooting of a young unarmed black girl
by a Korean shop owner in 1991 and the burning and looting of
Korean-owned businesses in black and Hispanic neighborhoods during
the riots of 1992 and the suspicions and the fear on all sides ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the stereotype of African-American and Korean-American
relations,'' he said. ``But this radically contradicts that. This
can set an example of what ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   During the riots, the worst the country has ever seen, the Hong
store was not touched by rage or fire. That is one reason that
people in the neighborhood believe that the two people sought in
her killing, described as a pair of young Hispanic men, came from
somewhere else. ``Everyone who knew her,'' said Joyce Rankins, 51,
``would do her no harm.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 people, most of whom were black, filed into the
church. Then the pallbearers, six uniformed city bus drivers who
were frequent customers of the market, wheeled her coffin to the
altar.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hong's son, Edward Hong, 25, who was wounded in the leg
during the robbery and was walking with a cane, said there was no
mystery to his mother's popularity in the neighborhood. ``She just
treated everyone with kindness and respect,'' he said. ``It's the
way everyone else should be treated. Everyone says this is so
unique. But the thing is, this is the way everything should be.''
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time the sounds of ``Amazing Grace'' floated
through the church, Kenneth Wheeler parked his jeep in front of
Mrs. Hong's market. ``I was going to the service at the church,''
Wheeler said, ``but there was no place to park. There are too many
people, so I came here to pay my respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler peered through the security bars and looked at a
handmade sign hanging in the window, ``Thursday Closed. Mama's
Funeral.'' Below that were two wanted posters, in English and
Spanish, offering a $25,000 reward for Mama's suspected killers.
Then Wheeler walked around the side of the building and pointed out
a wall covered in tributes, prayers and vows of vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always love you, Mama,'' one read.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Mama,'' another began. ``A loving angel who specialized in
the role of helping others.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, written in red, was a promise, ``We will find killers _
and they will pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said the message was written by local gang members.
``Whoever killed her,'' Wheeler said, ``must have thought they
could come to this community and kill a Korean store owner and we
wouldn't care. They made a big mistake. They picked the wrong store
and they picked the wrong Korean.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was another message on the wall that sounded much more
like Mama. ``Forgive them Lord,'' it said, ``for they know not what
they do.''

ORTHEASTERN ORDERED TO RELEASE REPORT ON DRUG USE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a ruling that may clarify whether the late Boston
Celtics star Reggie Lewis tested positive for cocaine in 1987, a
judge has ordered Northeastern University to hand over an internal
report on drug use among its athletes the school has kept sealed
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith ruled
attorneys for Gilbert H. Mudge, Jr., who is being sued for
malpractice by Lewis's widow, can examine the commission's report.
The judge ruled that any information pointing to drug use by
players other than Lewis will be impounded. He also said any court
filings growing out of the commission's report will be filed under
seal.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern last week had urged Fremont-Smith to reject Mudge's
request, arguing it would destroy its ability to get students and
faculty to cooperate in internal investigations because the school
could no longer guarantee confidentiality. Thursday, Northeastern
spokeswoman Janet Hookailo said the school is ``reviewing its
options'' with its lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge said the school, as a member of the NCAA, has
always had the responsibility of monitoring its athletes. By
ordering the impoundment of information about alleged drug use by
atheletes other than Lewis, the judge said ``any chilling effect on
individuals' willingness to participate in such investigations
should be minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's lawyers contend Lewis failure to disclose his alleged
drug use to the doctor skewed Mudge's ultimate diagnosis that Lewis
could return to playing in the NBA. Less than three months after
Mudge declared Lewis had minor heart problems, Lewis died of a
heart attack while shooting baskets at Brandeis University in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis reportedly tested positive for cocaine in 1987 when he
lead the Northeastern basketball team to the NCAA championship
tournament. Some school officials have testified during pretrial
depositions in the malpractice case that they had been told Lewis
and another player tested positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But the Northeastern official most involved in the drug testing
then, former school medical director Dr. Job E. Fuchs, has offered
contradictory versions to lawyers in the case. Fuchs, who is now 82
years old, told lawyers most recently that Lewis did not test
positive. He also said he was telephoned by someone who played a
tape recording of his commission testimony to shore up his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Fremont-Smith also ruled that Northeastern general counsel
Vincent Lembo can be deposed by Mudge's lawyers so they can
discover whether he was the person who called Fuchs on the
telephone. A Northeastern lawyer, Jeffrey Jones, said in court last
week that Lembo did not make that call.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's lawyers hope Fuchs's testimony before the commission
will end the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Harris-Lewis, Bridget Asaro, Thursday declined
comment on the judge's ruling except to note that they did not
object to Northeastern being required to hand over the report.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Dailey Jr., Mudge's lead attorney, did not return a
telephone call Thursday.

NASDAQ SOARS IN ITS BIGGEST ONE-DAY GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Pa.)   (af)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Powered by a dramatic rebound in computer-related
issues, the Nasdaq soared more than 4 percent Thursday to its
biggest one-day point gain ever as investors piled back into
beaten-down technology and financial shares.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of any dominating new developments, analysts
cited the cumulative weight of several lesser factors and for once
found a public appearance by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, to be of little consequence.
</P>
<P>
   All major gauges marched steadily higher through the session,
with the blue chips of the Dow Jones industrial average posting a
gain of 186.15 points, or 2.03 percent, to 9,363.46.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 30.49 points, or 2.5
percent, to 1,254.04, and the Nasdaq composite index closed at
2,405.55, up 96.05 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a resurgence of interest in the traditional growth
areas,'' said David Dietze, the president of Point View Financial
Services. ``People are flocking back to the names that did so well
coming off the October bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM, for example, jumped 9|, to 178{, to pace the Dow followed
by Wal-Mart Stores, which was up 4~, to 85 13/16. Merck was up 4{,
to 150}.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also a strong appetite for new issues, with three
initial public offerings more than doubling, the first such
``triple-double'' on record, according to the Securities Data Co.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons for the stock surge was a projection by Compaq
Computer of strong sales to long-depressed Asian markets this year
and a better-than-expected profit report from American
International Group, an insurance company that boasts the biggest
market capitalization of any purely financial company.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq shares climbed 2 7/16, to 44 13/16, while American
International rose 7}, to 106{.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts pointed to the approaching end of the impeachment
trial of President Clinton and the no-news-is-good-news nature of
Greenspan's congressional appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman told the House Banking and Financial Services
Committee that he backed a bill that would make it easier for
financial services companies to combine their businesses. He also
said the move would help the nation's economy remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any real reason'' for the rally, said
George Cohen, a principal at Cohen Klingenstein &AMP; Marks. ``We just
released some of the anxiety we'd built up.''
</P>
<P>
   But technology _ the subject of a Goldman, Sachs conference in
New York this week that was said to lift the mood of specialists _
was the main attraction. The NASDAQ 100, even more heavily
concentrated in computer-oriented stocks than the NASDAQ composite,
leaped 5.17 percent led by gains of 6 5/16 for Cisco Systems, 4
7/16 for Intel, 5~ for Oracle, 4~ for Dell Computer, 2[ for
Microsoft, 16[ for Yahoo and 12 7/16 for Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous appetite on the part of investors to keep
playing the growth story,'' said Eric M. Wiegand, a senior
portfolio manager at First Union in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ gain of 96.05 points was the biggest since the index
was first compiled in 1971. This came just two days after the
index's third-biggest point decline.
</P>
<P>
   Among banks and other financial companies, American Express,
Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab each jumped 4 points or more.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were about the only prominent losers, with Royal
Dutch Petroleum reporting worse than expected profits and Salomon
Smith Barney cutting its 1999 estimate for Exxon, which fell 2
3/16, to 70].
</P>
<P>
   The strongest new-issues were Healtheon, which marketed 5
million shares at 8 and closed at 31]; Verticalnet, which sold 3.5
million shares at 16 and closed at 45]; and Prodigy Communications,
which sold 8 million shares at 15 and traded as high as 32 before
closing at 28[.
</P>

   Two other initial public offerings were largely neglected.
Gabelli Asset Management's 6 million shares edged up to 17 13/16,
from 17, while Korn/Ferry International's 11.75 million shares
wound up at 13, a point below the offering price.

LIKE IT OR NOT, ROMNEY SEEN AS SAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ He did not gallop into the room with streaming
banner and brandished lance. ``I'm not the man on the white
horse,'' Mitt Romney insisted.
</P>
<P>
   But to the embattled and embarrassed Salt Lake Organizing
Committee, the wealthy venture capitalist from Belmont, Mass. is
the savior who will pull it out of its sordid past and point it
toward 2002 and the Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a franchise player here,'' proclaimed Utah governor
Mike Leavitt, after the board of trustees unanimously named Romney
chief executive Thursday morning, then gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Romney, who has never seen an Olympic Games, was
trumpeted as the ``white knight'' that board chairman Robert Garff
said the SLOC needed -- a high-profile businessman with Utah roots
and a clean image. ``He's the right man at the right time,'' said
trustee Bill Stapleton.
</P>
<P>
   It was the right time for Romney, too. Though he said he had
never dreamed of taking the job, he was intrigued by the idea of
returning to his ancestors' home town, and doing the same thing
that he had done at his Boston venture capital firm -- take over a
troubled but promising firm and turning it around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves emergencies and catastrophes,'' his wife Ann said.
``He would never have considered doing it if it wasn't a big
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The mess is ongoing. The US Department of Justice and the Utah
Attorney General are both investigating the SLOC. The committee
still needs to raise $370 million from skiddish sponsors, and rid
itself of its reputation for secrecy and inside deals.
</P>
<P>
   Romney told the board said he will insist on high ethical
standards. That he will make sure Utahns share in the Olympics.
That the Games will not lose money. That he won't use the job as a
political springboard. And that he'll start Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work is to get ready for the Games, get ready for the
athletes,'' said Romney. ``The managers have messed up big-time,
but the athletes haven't. Those errors are not going to be
forgotten and they shouldn't be. The few sometimes disappoint, but
the many get it right. Let's get it right. I'm sure we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Romney said his ``absolutes'' will include an independent ethics
office and a code of conduct, and he urged board members who had
conflicts of interest to resolve them or resign. ``If there is
anything that causes any of you to be a shadow on the Olympics, I
would expect you to step aside,'' he told them.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Layton, who heads the construction company building the
roof for the Olympic speedskating oval and Earl Holding, who owns
the Snowbasin ski resort where the downhill races will be held,
both resigned Thursday, as did long-time member Verl Topham. Romney
said that he would resign from the board of The Sports Authority
and, if necessary, from the Marriott board.
</P>
<P>
   Romney vowed that SLOC would meet its budget (``I will not spend
more money than we bring in. No way. No shortfall is acceptable.'')
and that he would defer his $285,000 annual salary ``until after
the Games are over and we have made clear we have paid our way.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he hadn't come, as some here have speculated,
to run for the US Senate after the Games. ``I've tried that before
and I think I've had enough,'' Romney said, referring to his
unsuccessful 1994 Massachusetts challenge to Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy. ``Besides, I don't think Senator (Orrin) Hatch will ever
leave. He and Senator Kennedy have made a promise to each other
that they'll be there until they go out in boxes. And Senator
(Robert) Bennett isn't an old man.''
</P>
<P>
   Romney will, however, live here full-time for the next three
years. His mission, he said, will be to use the job as a `bully
pulpit' to get Utahns excited about hosting the Games and to get
the organizing committee focused on its future, not its past.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two months of the worst scandal in modern Olympic
history, of venal tales of payoffs to nearly two dozen
International Olympic Committee members, of everyone from its own
ethics panel to the US Department of Justice poring through its
records, the SLOC has desperately wanted to move ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Joklik and Dave Johnson, the committee's two top
executives, had stepped down last month. On Tuesday, SLOC's ethics
panel had issued a 300-page report, laying out the seven-year
vote-influencing campaign in graphic and unsparing detail. The
bylaws were rewritten, the board of trustees and executive
committee reorganized. ``It's about time we separate the future
from the past,'' said chairman Robert Garff.
</P>
<P>
   But until a new chief executive officer was brought on, SLOC
couldn't move ahead. Though his Utah friends thought of Romney as
soon as Joklik resigned, they assumed he would never leave Boston
and Bain Capital to muck out an Olympian stable. ``They were afraid
to call him, so they called me,'' his wife Ann said. ``His initial
reaction was: Are you crazy? No way. This is insane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in a million years had I thought about taking this
job,'' Romney said in an interview with The Globe. ``The idea was
completely foreign to me.'' But the lure of the Olympic rings, the
idea of returning to Utah on a near-spiritual mission and the
challenge of straightening out a $1.5 billion corporation proved
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Bain Capital could live without him for a while, Romney
concluded, and the family nest was empty. In fact, his youngest
three sons will be attending nearby Brigham Young this fall. ``When
I ran for Senate, the boys were right in the middle of the
decision,'' Romney said. ``This time, it's more Ann and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Romney is not a native Utahn, his roots here run deep.
His ancestors crossed the plains with Brigham Young and his parents
grew up here. Romney was a BYU valedictorian, his sons are all
students or graduates of the university and he owns a winter home
in nearby Deer Valley.
</P>
<P>
   When the scandal broke, Romney knew what Utahns were feeling.
``This is a state given to charity, to large families and
volunteerism,'' he said. ``To be cast in that light is as painful
as imaginable for people here. They have to feel enormously
disappointed and embarrassed. I felt that all the way to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Romney was concerned about how deep a quagmire he was
stepping into. Joklik, who had stayed on until a successor was
named, gave him a 90-minute briefing when Romney came out for a
chat nearly two weeks ago. ``I told him he was supremely qualified
for the job,'' Joklik said. ``The only thing is -- are you sure you
want this?''
</P>
<P>
   Romney had talked to dozens of Olympic insiders and conferred
with Leavitt, Garff and US Olympic Committee officials. He spent
Tuesday night and Wednesday talking to SLOC board members and
staffers, as well as reading the ethics report. Though Romney had
indicated he would take the job, he said he didn't make up his mind
until Wednesday night. ``Ann and I went home and talked it over one
more time,'' he said. ``At 3:30, I woke up and began working on my
remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Romney was the only serious candidate, a hastily-formed
selection committee rifled through 42 applicants in barely a day
and concluded it had its man. ``He was head and shoulders above all
the candidates,'' said trustee John Price.
</P>
<P>
   Romney was nominated, seconded and approved in a matter of
seconds. ``Where were you when I needed you,'' he cracked to the
SLOC board. ``I wish I had a few of these voters in 1994.''

 &HT;    SEC follows policy in examining violations
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Securities and Exchange Commission has a policy of
neither confirming nor denying it is conducting investigations of
possible securities laws violations.
</P>
<P>
   But issuing subpoenas is part of the process when the agency's
inquiries reach what's known as a formal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Before a formal investigation, the SEC staff gathers readily
available information and talks to individuals, whose response is
strictly voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it looks like there may have been a possible violation, we
open a `case,' '' said Richard Wessel, the SEC's district
administrator for eight states in the Southeast. Wessel, who
explained the general process, said the name ``case'' has no legal
significance.
</P>
<P>
   If a case reaches the formal stage, the SEC's subpoenas can be
used to require that documents be produced or witnesses give
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, the staff makes a determination as to whether
violations have occurred,'' Wessel said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, it's typical that the subject of the
investigation would be notified that the staff plans to recommend
enforcement action.
</P>
<P>
   The subject then has the opportunity to argue his or her case,
Wessel said. And after that, the SEC staff decides whether in fact
to recommend enforcement action.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual that if the commission authorizes action, that
it also gives the go-ahead for settlement talks, Wessel said.
</P>
<P>
   Cases can be concluded with cease and desist orders, which
require the subject not to repeat the violation, civil injunctions
obtained in federal court, and various penalties.
</P>
<P>
   There are three tiers of fines for individuals and businesses.
The maximum fine per violation category can be $5,500, $55,000, or
$110,000 for individuals, as of April 1, 1998. The maximums for
businesses are $55,000, $275,000 and $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   Disgorgement of profits as well as nonmonetary penalties can be
assessed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Insider-trading violations fall under a separate category that
carries a maximum fine of $1.1 million per violation.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC cannot prosecute criminal cases. Those it refers to the
Justice Department, Wessel said.

CHOKING ON CHINA'S AIR, HONG KONG LOATH TO CRY FOUL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ On clear days at this time of the year, Barrie Cook
used to take out-of-town visitors to the top of Victoria Peak,
where they could see the gleaming skyscrapers of Macao, a
Portuguese colony 38 miles away. Now, he said, ``you can barely see
to the bottom of the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of this winter, Hong Kong has been shrouded in a
yellowish haze that has blotted out its legendary vistas. This is
not brooding, rainy mist of the sort that supplies atmosphere in
James Clavell novels. It is a dry, gritty smog that catches in the
throat and gives the city an odd sepia-tinted glow.
</P>
<P>
   As the haze has become an every-other-day phenomenon in this
city of 6.7 million, it is setting off alarm bells in some unlikely
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is allowed to deteriorate further, it's going to be a
major problem for the economy,'' said Cook, who runs a cement and
concrete company for Hong Kong's most famous tycoon, Li ka-shing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are very concerned about employees working in a
deteriorating environment. They won't want to invest here. They
won't want to put people or facilities here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, tackling pollution raises ticklish political
issues. Much of the smog is generated across the border in mainland
China, where a forest of smoke-belching factories has risen in
Guangdong province over the last two decades. In the winter,
northerly winds blow the fumes into Hong Kong, where they mix with
exhaust from buses and taxis to create what Kim Salkeld, the
government's spokesman on the environment, calls a ``horrendous
cocktail.''
</P>
<P>
   Salkeld said the percentage of days when pollution reduced
visibility to less than five miles doubled from 1991 to 1997, to
more than 8 percent. Hong Kong hit a new low on Jan. 19, when a
particularly murky brew cut visibility to less than 3,000 feet,
despite sunny skies. Ships in the harbor were forced to sound their
foghorns as they crept forward in the midday gloom.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong is still less polluted than Beijing or Shanghai _ not
to mention famously blighted Asian cities like Bangkok and Manila.
But experts here worry that Hong Kong could soon slip into their
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   With China's economy still humming, more factories are likely to
spring up in Guangdong. And Hong Kong, which is clawing its way out
of an economic quagmire, may be reluctant to turn away industrial
development, even if it degrades the environment and alienates
foreign businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really depends on what we're willing to put up with,'' said
William Barron, a professor at the Center for Urban Planning and
Environmental Management at the University of Hong Kong. ``What we
see in a place like Bangkok is how bad things can get, but the
government still doesn't address the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Barron said that while the Hong Kong government regards
pollution as a major threat, it has been loath to confront China
about its role in fouling its newest possession. ``They don't even
want to talk about the pollution coming across the border,'' he
said. ``It is way too sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly this is because of Hong Kong's general reluctance to
ruffle the feathers of its new sovereign, whether it be over issues
of judicial independence or environmental policy. But partly it is
because the government knows that many of the factories in
Guangdong are owned by Hong Kong companies. Hong Kong also has no
shortage of home-grown pollution. The number of cars, taxis and
buses has soared in recent years as more people have moved into the
New Territories, a once-bucolic hinterland that separates Kowloon
from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong's popular shopping district, Causeway Bay, the
pollution readings are often so high that the government urges
people with respiratory conditions to stay indoors. On a recent
afternoon there, the fumes from taxis and double-decker buses all
but choked two women who were standing on the sidewalk, handing out
invitations to join a health club.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 15 years, Hong Kong will not be livable,'' Cindy Ho said as
she packed her things and headed for a restaurant. ``Everybody will
be dead.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Salkeld said the government was determined to clear the air by
banning leaded gasoline, converting taxis from diesel to liquified
petroleum gas, and expanding the rail system by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Hong Kong's close ties to southern China are not helping.
Many trucks burn low-grade diesel fuel that is smuggled into Hong
Kong from the mainland. The police recently uncovered an illegal
pipeline that carried the cheap and far more polluting fuel across
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians here said the government could no longer afford to
tiptoe around China. Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa,
declared in a speech last month that the environment would be ``at
the forefront of our agenda next year, year after next, and every
year thereafter.'' But Tung, a shipping magnate appointed by
Beijing, has said little about cross-border pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't want to see is the government saying, `Just
because the problem is from over there, we can't do anything about
it,''' said Christine Loh, a pro-democracy leader who is active in
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, it is not clear Hong Kong can do much to
influence Beijing's environmental policies. Salkeld said the two
governments were cooperating to harmonize fuel standards. And they
pledged $3 million each to install a pollution-monitoring system in
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
   But Salkeld noted that China's population and economic demands
were so vast that they could make any environmental initiative seem
hopelessly inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, he added, the seasonal wind currents work against
China, too. ``During the summer,'' he said, ``when Hong Kong's air
quality is pretty good, the wind is blowing our pollution into the
mainland.''

BRAVE ALMEIDA IS BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Goncalino Almeida speaks of Brave Act, the
horse who revived his riding career, the way people speak of
Almeida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Brave Act,'' the jockey said Thursday at Santa Anita,
where they'll go for their third straight stakes victory together
in Monday's San Luis Obispo Handicap. ``This horse just has heart.
The horse had a lot of problems, but he came back and he kept
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Almeida and Brave Act were made for each other. It just took a
rare stroke of good luck for the 43-year-old Brazilian to ride the
5-year-old English-bred.
</P>
<P>
   Almeida had rallied Brave Act to an overachieving second behind
Anet in the 1997 Del Mar Derby. But Brave Act injured an ankle, and
when he came back 11 months later, the mount went to Chris
McCarron, the top rider for trainer Ron McAnally.
</P>
<P>
   With McCarron, Brave Act won minor turf stakes last fall at
Santa Anita and Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Almeida was nearing the end of an 18-win year that
would have discouraged anybody else, and trying to rebuild his
business with a new agent.
</P>
<P>
   When Brave Act was entered in the Dec. 28 San Gabriel Handicap
on turf and McCarron chose to ride McAnally's Fragrant Mix instead,
McAnally turned to Almeida, who had the break he needed.
</P>
<P>
   While Fragrant Mix and McCarron finished fifth as 4-5 favorites,
Brave Act and Almeida came between horses to win the San Gabriel
and paid $11.20.
</P>
<P>
   Next time out, in the Jan. 18 San Marcos Handicap, Fragrant Mix
and McCarron finished sixth and Brave Act used stalking tactics to
win at $6.60.
</P>
<P>
   Brave Act earned $180,000 for owner Sidney Craig with the two
victories _ more than the rest of Almeida's horses this meet earned
in 41 races (including five wins).
</P>
<P>
   They'll face as many as nine horses, including Lazy Lode and
possibly Fragrant Mix, in the $200,000 San Luis Obispo at 1{ miles
on grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most things in this business, it's (being in) the right
place at the right time,'' said agent Richie Silverstein, who was
looking for a jockey when Almeida hired him last summer. ``And an
ironclad work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   Almeida gets to the barns at 5:30 most mornings to exercise
horses for prospective clients.
</P>
<P>
   Brave Act, said Silverstein, ``put the spring back in both of
our walks.''
</P>
<P>
   That took some doing for Almeida, who had suffered a string of
injuries, the worst-timed being two broken legs in a January 1996
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The former leading Brazilian rider had enjoyed his best season
in the United States in '95, when he and Earl of Barking won the
Hollywood Turf Handicap and he and Jumron finished fourth in the
Kentucky Derby. He was winning the confidence of trainers who'd
scorned his wiry physique and unorthodox riding style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a different style. He doesn't look as good as the
other guys,'' said trainer Jose DeLima, who rode against Almeida
when both were in Brazil. ``But he's as good as any one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Almeida said he never thought of quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the business,'' he said, cheerful as always.
``You go high and you go low.''
</P>
<P>
   Almeida doesn't get a lot of mounts. But winning with Brave Act
can only help his business. And he should pick up horses from
Martin Pedroza, Silverstein's other rider, who's leaving for the
Chicago tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (bad spell) is past,'' Almeida said. ``It's a new year.''
</P>
<P>
   And the winners are ...: Eclipse Award voting results will be
announced Tuesday night at a dinner in Bal Harbour, Fla. This could
finally be Gary Stevens' year to be honored as the nation's
outstanding jockey.
</P>
<P>
   If Stevens wins, Jerry Bailey fans will claim it's because
voters were tired of going for their man year after year. Wrong:
Stevens earned it with a superior 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Does the suit fit?: The Meadowlands, in New Jersey, is being
sued by harness announcer John Bothe, who claims an assignment to
handicap races on TV could plunge him back into the gambling
compulsion that once bankrupted him. The lawsuit's premise is that
an addiction to betting is a handicap that an employer must
accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   On this topic, the brutal-honesty award goes to the Washington
Post's Andrew Beyer, who quotes academics doubting the very
existence of compulsive gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of us gamblers share this opinion and look with
pity on people like John Bothe who portray themselves as helpless
victims of a disability,'' Beyer wrote. ``We just call them bad
bettors.''
</P>
<P>
   78 days to the Derby: Bob Baffert's latest announced plan has
Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies winner Silverbulletday making her
3-year-old debut against Prime Timber and other colts in the Feb.
28 San Rafael Stakes (1 mile) at Santa Anita, and Exploit and
General Challenge waiting for the March 13 San Felipe (1 1/16
miles).
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting, the other Baffert filly, runs Saturday
against four members of her own sex in the Las Virgenes. Two Las
Virgenes winners, Althea ('84) and Serena's Song ('95), went on to
be favored in the Kentucky Derby, and runner-up Winning Colors
('88) went on to win the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert has 16 horses, second to D. Wayne Lukas' 21, among 396
nominated for the Triple Crown revealed last week. Lukas' team is
led by Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
Santa Anita leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Alex Solis, 36
wins; David Flores, 29; Chris McCarron, 24; Gary Stevens, 23;
Laffit Pincay, 22. Trainers: Bob Baffert, 28; Ron McAnally, 11;
Bobby Frankel and Richard Mandella, 10; Wally Dollase, 8. &QL; 
Handicapper helper: Rain washed away the assumption that
pacesetting horses tire on the Santa Anita turf course.
Front-running winners on grass before the Jan. 26 rain: 4 in 48
races. Since then: 5 in 15 races. &QL; 
On the stakes schedule: At Santa Anita: Saturday, $200,000 Las
Virgenes, 3-year-old fillies, 1 mile; Sunday, $200,000 Santa Maria
Handicap, fillies and mares 4 and up, 1 1/16 miles; Monday,
$200,000 San Luis Obispo Handicap, 4-year-olds and up, 1{ miles on

Mileposts: San Antonio Handicap winner Free House joined Silver
Charm and Richard Mandella-trained Puerto Madero, Event of the Year
and Malek on the probable-starters list for the March 6 Santa Anita
Handicap.... Lord Grillo, fourth in the San Antonio, is aiming for
the 7-furlong San Carlos on Big 'Cap day.... Artax will seek a
shorter race, probably out of town, to ``get his confidence back''
after leading and finishing last behind Event of the Year in the
1[-mile Strub, trainer Randy Bradshaw said. Translation: He's been
overmatched.... Harness driver Rick Kuebler's five victories at Los
Alamitos on Saturday included his 3,000th.... La Canada winner
Manistique was trainer John Shirreffs' sixth winning starter in a
row. Shirreffs intends to keep wearing his Mill Ridge farm cap as
long as the streak lasts. ``One day the wind was blowing so hard
that it blew off my head, right into a mud puddle,'' he said.
``It's a little grungy now, but I've got to keep wearing it. Not
that I'm superstitious.''... Sandy Shulman was 0 for 15 before
saddling Sunday nightcap winner Torre Dei Nolfi ($18.60).... Chris
Antley got the first win of his comeback on the Turf Paradise
Breeders' Cup Stakes undercard in Phoenix on Saturday.... Alex
Solis, Gary Stevens and Corey Nakatani are scheduled to return to
Santa Anita on Saturday after taking part in a jockeys' competition
in Saudi Arabia.... Although Santa Anita won't hold races next
Wednesday, giving everybody two days off following the
holiday-Monday program, it will take bets on Gulfstream, Aqueduct,
Turf Paradise, Turfway Park and three foreign tracks.... Hall of
Fame trainer Henry Clark, 95, died in Maryland.... Stalwart Tsu, a
Del Mar stakes winner, suffered a fatal breakdown in a workout
Sunday.

EDITORIAL: A DISASTROUS MERGER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 12: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt departure of the two top officers of Germany's BMW as
a result of problems at the automaker's Rover subsidiary in Britain
offers a warning about the hazards of the current merger wave in
the automobile industry.
</P>
<P>
   BMW bought Rover in 1994, paying $1.2 billion for the British
company in a move widely hailed as wise because it put the German
luxury car maker in two promising segments: sport utility vehicles
and small cars.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, BMW has lost money on Rover, despite large
additional investments, and now the German company's supervisory
board has ousted the executives deemed most responsible. It is not
clear what the company will do, although there are reports it is
seeking a large British government subsidy to persuade it to keep
Rover's oldest and largest manufacturing plant in operation.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong?
 &UR;  &LR;  In part, BMW's problems reflect worldwide overcapacity in small
cars, which have produced losses that could not be offset by the
profits from large sport utility vehicles. But they also reflect
the difficulties of integrating diverse auto makers, particularly
given national sensibilities about employment levels and
investment. BMW seems to have hesitated to pursue economies from
using the same undercarriage for both its cars and Rovers, thus
leaving costs high. Rather than a harsh overseer, it became a
wealthy parent.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry is now in a period of consolidation, with
Daimler-Benz having taken over Chrysler, Ford agreeing to buy Volvo
and Japan's troubled Nissan seeking a foreign investor. The lesson
of BMW should remind them that mergers often do not work out as
planned, and that savings are easier to anticipate than to realize.

LIKE IT OR NOT, ROMNEY SEEN AS SAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ He did not gallop into the room with streaming
banner and brandished lance. ``I'm not the man on the white
horse,'' Mitt Romney insisted.
</P>
<P>
   But to the embattled and embarrassed Salt Lake Organizing
Committee, the wealthy venture capitalist from Belmont, Mass. is
the savior who will pull it out of its sordid past and point it
toward 2002 and the Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a franchise player here,'' proclaimed Utah governor
Mike Leavitt, after the board of trustees unanimously named Romney
chief executive Thursday morning, then gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Romney, who has never seen an Olympic Games, was
trumpeted as the ``white knight'' that board chairman Robert Garff
said the SLOC needed -- a high-profile businessman with Utah roots
and a clean image. ``He's the right man at the right time,'' said
trustee Bill Stapleton.
</P>
<P>
   It was the right time for Romney, too. Though he said he had
never dreamed of taking the job, he was intrigued by the idea of
returning to his ancestors' home town, and doing the same thing
that he had done at his Boston venture capital firm -- take over a
troubled but promising firm and turning it around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves emergencies and catastrophes,'' his wife Ann said.
``He would never have considered doing it if it wasn't a big
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The mess is ongoing. The US Department of Justice and the Utah
Attorney General are both investigating the SLOC. The committee
still needs to raise $370 million from skiddish sponsors, and rid
itself of its reputation for secrecy and inside deals.
</P>
<P>
   Romney told the board said he will insist on high ethical
standards. That he will make sure Utahns share in the Olympics.
That the Games will not lose money. That he won't use the job as a
political springboard. And that he'll start Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work is to get ready for the Games, get ready for the
athletes,'' said Romney. ``The managers have messed up big-time,
but the athletes haven't. Those errors are not going to be
forgotten and they shouldn't be. The few sometimes disappoint, but
the many get it right. Let's get it right. I'm sure we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Romney said his ``absolutes'' will include an independent ethics
office and a code of conduct, and he urged board members who had
conflicts of interest to resolve them or resign. ``If there is
anything that causes any of you to be a shadow on the Olympics, I
would expect you to step aside,'' he told them.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Layton, who heads the construction company building the
roof for the Olympic speedskating oval and Earl Holding, who owns
the Snowbasin ski resort where the downhill races will be held,
both resigned Thursday, as did long-time member Verl Topham. Romney
said that he would resign from the board of The Sports Authority
and, if necessary, from the Marriott board.
</P>
<P>
   Romney vowed that SLOC would meet its budget (``I will not spend
more money than we bring in. No way. No shortfall is acceptable.'')
and that he would defer his $285,000 annual salary ``until after
the Games are over and we have made clear we have paid our way.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he hadn't come, as some here have speculated,
to run for the US Senate after the Games. ``I've tried that before
and I think I've had enough,'' Romney said, referring to his
unsuccessful 1994 Massachusetts challenge to Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy. ``Besides, I don't think Senator (Orrin) Hatch will ever
leave. He and Senator Kennedy have made a promise to each other
that they'll be there until they go out in boxes. And Senator
(Robert) Bennett isn't an old man.''
</P>
<P>
   Romney will, however, live here full-time for the next three
years. His mission, he said, will be to use the job as a `bully
pulpit' to get Utahns excited about hosting the Games and to get
the organizing committee focused on its future, not its past.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two months of the worst scandal in modern Olympic
history, of venal tales of payoffs to nearly two dozen
International Olympic Committee members, of everyone from its own
ethics panel to the US Department of Justice poring through its
records, the SLOC has desperately wanted to move ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Joklik and Dave Johnson, the committee's two top
executives, had stepped down last month. On Tuesday, SLOC's ethics
panel had issued a 300-page report, laying out the seven-year
vote-influencing campaign in graphic and unsparing detail. The
bylaws were rewritten, the board of trustees and executive
committee reorganized. ``It's about time we separate the future
from the past,'' said chairman Robert Garff.
</P>
<P>
   But until a new chief executive officer was brought on, SLOC
couldn't move ahead. Though his Utah friends thought of Romney as
soon as Joklik resigned, they assumed he would never leave Boston
and Bain Capital to muck out an Olympian stable. ``They were afraid
to call him, so they called me,'' his wife Ann said. ``His initial
reaction was: Are you crazy? No way. This is insane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in a million years had I thought about taking this
job,'' Romney said in an interview with The Globe. ``The idea was
completely foreign to me.'' But the lure of the Olympic rings, the
idea of returning to Utah on a near-spiritual mission and the
challenge of straightening out a $1.5 billion corporation proved
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Bain Capital could live without him for a while, Romney
concluded, and the family nest was empty. In fact, his youngest
three sons will be attending nearby Brigham Young this fall. ``When
I ran for Senate, the boys were right in the middle of the
decision,'' Romney said. ``This time, it's more Ann and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Romney is not a native Utahn, his roots here run deep.
His ancestors crossed the plains with Brigham Young and his parents
grew up here. Romney was a BYU valedictorian, his sons are all
students or graduates of the university and he owns a winter home
in nearby Deer Valley.
</P>
<P>
   When the scandal broke, Romney knew what Utahns were feeling.
``This is a state given to charity, to large families and
volunteerism,'' he said. ``To be cast in that light is as painful
as imaginable for people here. They have to feel enormously
disappointed and embarrassed. I felt that all the way to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Romney was concerned about how deep a quagmire he was
stepping into. Joklik, who had stayed on until a successor was
named, gave him a 90-minute briefing when Romney came out for a
chat nearly two weeks ago. ``I told him he was supremely qualified
for the job,'' Joklik said. ``The only thing is -- are you sure you
want this?''
</P>
<P>
   Romney had talked to dozens of Olympic insiders and conferred
with Leavitt, Garff and US Olympic Committee officials. He spent
Tuesday night and Wednesday talking to SLOC board members and
staffers, as well as reading the ethics report. Though Romney had
indicated he would take the job, he said he didn't make up his mind
until Wednesday night. ``Ann and I went home and talked it over one
more time,'' he said. ``At 3:30, I woke up and began working on my
remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Romney was the only serious candidate, a hastily-formed
selection committee rifled through 42 applicants in barely a day
and concluded it had its man. ``He was head and shoulders above all
the candidates,'' said trustee John Price.
</P>
<P>
   Romney was nominated, seconded and approved in a matter of
seconds. ``Where were you when I needed you,'' he cracked to the
SLOC board. ``I wish I had a few of these voters in 1994.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 12: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The $51.5 million judgment against Philip Morris Cos. by a
California jury could well trigger a slew of individual lawsuits by
people who have gotten sick or died from smoking. The $1.5 million
in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages awarded
to a 53-year-old smoker who has inoperable lung cancer may still be
overturned on appeal, as have verdicts in the past that have
favored smokers.
</P>
<P>
   But many potential plaintiffs, and those who already have filed
lawsuits elsewhere in the country, will be encouraged by this case
and other recent developments. President Clinton's decision to sue
the tobacco industry for billions of dollars spent treating
tobacco-related illnesses under Medicare and other federal medical
programs will compound the industry's problems.
</P>
<P>
   New evidence that has been unearthed in state lawsuits shows
that the industry tried to conceal the health hazards of smoking
and the addictive nature of nicotine. Juries that are faced with
such information may be less apt than earlier juries to blame
smokers for assuming the risks of smoking, and more eager to punish
cigarette makers for fraud and deception. Even if big verdicts are
reduced or overturned, simply defending hundreds of cases could be
financially debilitating for the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of fighting endless private and federal lawsuits
could cause the industry to seek a deal with Congress. Such a deal
could settle the potentially enormous federal claims, but it must
not give the industry immunity from other lawsuits, which remain a
useful hammer to compel responsible behavior. The industry already
has agreed to pay the states $246 billion over the next 25 years to
recover their Medicaid costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's tobacco bill would have granted the Food and Drug
Administration authority to regulate tobacco and nicotine, greatly
restricted marketing practices that attract teen-age smokers and
required the industry to pay penalties if youth smoking rates do
not go down in the next decade. Those elements ought to be part of
any new legislative proposal.

 WASHINGTON: he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said he had initially leaned toward
acquitting Clinton of perjury but voting to convict him for
obstuction of justice. But he decided to vote to convict Clinton on
both counts because a president with ``a capacity to lie about
anything'' threatens the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the trial proceeded, however, something was gnawing at
me,'' he said in a statement. ``The perjury charge kept creeping
back into my mind. That something, as I confronted it, was my
experience with the Clinton apparatus and its modus operandi. At
the heart of everything that apparatus and its operatives do,
whatever the situation, is the process of lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they said they would vote to acquit Clinton, Democrats
were no less harsh. ``The president acted immorally,'' Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., said in a statement. ``He acted recklessly. He
acted disgracefully. He willfully misled the American people, the
members of his Cabinet, his staff and his judicial system. In doing
so, he brought shame and dishonor upon the office of the president
and especially upon himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Feinstein, one of the main proponents of censure, said that
she did not believe the House prosecutors charges were ``proven
beyond a reasonable doubt or by clear and convincing evidence or by
a preponderance of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., also called for censure. ``No
matter how deeply disappointed I am that our president, who has
worked so successfully to lift up the lives of so many people, so
lowered himself and his office, I conclude that his wrongdoing in
this sordid saga does not justify making him the first president to
be ousted from office in our history.''

 &HT;    Stage set for Clinton's acquittal
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although President Clinton's legal problems may be
far from over, the Senate today will wash its hands of his affair
with Monica Lewinsky and vote to acquit him of charges that he lied
about the relationship and obstructed justice to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will convene at 9:30 a.m., and a vote is expected
before noon. Clinton is expected to make a short statement
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   With a Senate censure resolution very unlikely, the only
remaining question to be answered today will be how many senators
ultimately vote to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Enough Republicans and Democrats are on record against the
article alleging Clinton perjured himself in a federal grand jury
appearance last year to ensure that charge will fail to win even a
simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   The second article, alleging Clinton obstructed justice by
attempting to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky from Paula
Corbin Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who filed a sexual
harassment lawsuit against him in 1994, could fall just short of a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Jeffords (R-Vt.), the first of three GOP senators to
announce his opposition to both articles Wednesday, said Thursday
the obstruction charge will get at most 50 votes, ``assuming
everyone votes the way they said they were going to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to keep it below 50 on obstruction,'' Jeffords
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) on Thursday became the fourth
Republican to announce she will not vote to convict on either
impeachment article.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I could approach this case was to ask myself, if
I were the deciding vote, could I remove this president under these
circumstances?'' Snowe said. ``The answer, I conclude, is no.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Gordon Smith (R-Ore.), a West Coast moderate, said
Thursday he will vote to convict Clinton on both articles, despite
his personal admiration for the Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be in his presence is to experience the magic of his
enormous personal and political talents,'' Smith said. ``But it is
the magnitude of his talents that makes the magnitude of his
misdeeds that much more deplorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats, the only remaining question is how Sen. Robert
Byrd (D-W.Va.) will vote. Byrd, the Senate's constitutionalist, has
said it will be ``very difficult to stand and say not guilty, very
difficult.'' But Byrd also made the motion to dismiss the charges
against Clinton and end the trial two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   A second possible Democrat to vote to convict Clinton, Sen. Russ
Feingold (D-Wis.), will instead vote to acquit, according to Sen.
Herb Kohl (D-Wis.). Kohl said Thursday that no Democrats had spoken
for conviction in closed session. Asked whether Feingold had
spoken, Kohl said, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl also said no more Republicans had spoken in closed session
Thursday of acquitting Clinton on both charges.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen senators announced their verdicts publicly
Thursday, putting about one-fourth of senators on record as to how
they will vote. Aside from Snowe, surprises were few.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a New York Times story Thursday alleging that Clinton
planned revenge on House prosecutors in the 2000 elections was
enough to whip up much anti-Clinton sentiment on the impeachment
articles.
</P>
<P>
   While decrying the story, several prominent Republicans said
they did not believe the story would change any GOP votes.
</P>
<P>
   Today's historic vote will follow a ritual that has been played
out only once in the nation's history, when the Senate failed to
convict President Andrew Johnson on May 16, 1868, by just one vote.
</P>
<P>
   White House defense lawyers will be in the chamber, along with
Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), the lead prosecutor and chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee. Several other House prosecutors left
town Thursday, including Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), who departed saying
he was now in ``7th District mode,'' a reference to his suburban
Atlanta district.
</P>
<P>
   Senators have left themselves two hours of closed deliberations.
After the invocation and the call to order when they return to
public session, the secretary of the Senate will read the first
impeachment article against Clinton, alleging perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist will then pose the following
question to all 100 senators: ``Senators, how say you? Is the
respondent, William Jefferson Clinton, guilty or not guilty as
charged in this article?''
</P>
<P>
   Called in alphabetical order, each senator will respond
``guilty'' or ``not guilty.'' The impeachment rules also permit a
senator to record a vote of ``present.'' Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.)
has said he will vote ``not proven,'' a judgment that probably will
provoke a ruling from Rehnquist on whether such a response is
admissible.
</P>
<P>
   After all the votes are recorded on the first article, the
Senate secretary will read the second impeachment article, alleging
obstruction of justice. Rehnquist will repeat the question to all
100 senators, who will respond ``guilty'' or ``not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   In Johnson's trial, the drama surrounding his fate continued up
until the final vote was called.
</P>
<P>
   No such drama will surround today's vote. Clinton's fate was
sealed two weeks ago when 44 Democrats voted to dismiss the charges
against him, assuring that House prosecutors would not get the 67
votes needed for conviction and removal.
</P>
<P>
   After both votes today, Clinton's acquittal will be entered into
the trial record as an order and transmitted by the Senate
secretary to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Majority leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) probably will thank
Rehnquist on behalf of the Senate for his service and a motion will
be made to adjourn the court of impeachment sine die, ``without
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Minority leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said he will make one
attempt to win a vote on censuring the president immediately after
the trial's adjournment, but the effort is almost certain to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate's complicated procedures, it would take a vote
of 67 senators to suspend Senate rules and take up a censure
motion. Presuming the vote fails, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)
said she will submit to the record a letter of censure signed by a
majority of the 45 Democrats and a handful of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Today's vote will end more than five months of near paralysis in
Congress stemming from the impeachment referral delivered to the
House on Sept. 9 by independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's referral consumed the House in the two months leading up
to the Nov. 3 elections. Democrats gained five seats in those
elections, and Republican efforts to impeach Clinton were widely
believed to have angered the public.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans nonetheless pressed on with Clinton's
impeachment, voting out the two articles on Dec. 19. Senators began
on a bipartisan footing, and even though subsequent votes on
witnesses and dismissing the case ended on partisan lines, there
was far less partisan sniping.
</P>
<P>
   During a closed meeting of Republicans on Thursday, GOP senators
sought to refocus on their legislative agenda of tax cuts and
Social Security reforms, which they hope to return to after next
week's President's Day recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody realizes that it's time to get back to the people's
business,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters Thursday that
Clinton is also ready to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He accepts responsibility for what he's done, and he's
determined to do the best job he can as president, moving forward,
doing the best job for the American people and, in a political
sense, determined to help the Democratic Party prevail in the next
election,'' Lockhart said.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 12: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few African countries have followed a more disappointing
trajectory over the past two decades than Zimbabwe. Once a model of
democracy, law and tolerance, this nation of 13 million people is
becoming a fearful, militarized autocracy. President Robert
Mugabe's latest diatribes against journalists and judges are
particularly troubling. Zimbabwe's foreign friends, including the
United States, must press Mugabe to halt this sad slide into
tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis began last month when Zimbabwe's army arrested and
tortured two journalists who had reported a failed military coup
attempt. Three supreme court justices then called on Mugabe to
affirm the rule of law by reminding the army that it had no right
to arrest civilians and that torture by anyone was unacceptable.
Instead Mugabe defended the military's conduct, denounced the press
and called on the justices to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Zimbabwe, born after guerrilla warfare and
international diplomacy ended the injustices of white minority
rule, at first embraced a philosophy of racial and social
reconciliation. A new Constitution protected minority rights. White
farmers were left on their land and even the white former prime
minister, Ian Smith, retained a seat in Parliament. But as years
passed, Mugabe grew obsessed about threats to his power and began
demonizing critics of all varieties.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, his soldiers killed innocent civilians while
crushing an insurgency based in the minority Ndebele people. Then
he set out to marginalize political opposition groups and create a
virtual one-party state. More recently he has turned against white
landowners, student groups, labor unions and homosexuals. Official
favoritism and corruption have marred his rule at home, while
abroad he has sent Zimbabwean troops to prop up Congo's dictator,
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe should break off this costly and unpopular foreign
adventurism and pay attention to Zimbabwe's own pressing needs,
including rapidly rising food prices, severe unemployment and an
AIDS epidemic now estimated to affect almost one in four adults.
</P>
<P>
   The growing economic pressures have brought months of unrest, to
which the government's main response has been repression. Instead
of harassing potential opponents, Mugabe should, at age 74, be
making room for new leaders to step forward when his term ends in
2002. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE MAYOR'S OTHER CRIME RATING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 12: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani rightly can stand at any lectern around
the country and boast about how dramatically the crime rate has
dropped in New York City. He honestly can assert, as he did
Wednesday, that New York's police officers fire their weapons less
frequently than in Boston, Washington or Chicago, and that even
though arrests have increased dramatically, the 19 shootings by
police last year are the fewest since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics, however, do not constitute an adequate
leadership response to the outcry over Amadou Diallo's death last
week after four members of the Street Crimes Unit fired 41 bullets
at the West African immigrant. The shooting is under investigation
by the Bronx District Attorney and is being monitored by the U. S.
Attorney's office. A lawyer for the police officers has said that
they were looking for a serial rapist and that Diallo was acting
suspiciously. They thought he was reaching for a weapon but later
found only keys, a wallet and a beeper in his pockets or near his
body.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has cautioned against jumping to conclusions before an
official inquiry. That is a reasonable but narrow point at a time
requiring a broad and calming mayoral reaction. The mayor's
decision to attend the Diallo memorial service Thursday is a good
start toward that kind of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo case could be an even more difficult police issue
than such cases as the torturing of Abner Louima, where fellow
officers could blame a few bad cops. This particular unit is one of
the Police Department's success stories, but the very
aggressiveness and independence of the Street Crimes Unit, with its
macho slogan ``We own the night,'' warrant the mayor's attention.
</P>
<P>
   There are law enforcement and community relations issues that
need to be discussed at the neighborhood level. Giuliani said
Thursday that the force had spent over $15 million on diversity and
sensitivity training for police officers. But minority citizens
complain that the Street Crimes officers are too aggressive toward
young black and Hispanic males.
</P>
<P>
   While it could be some time before the details of the Diallo
case are available, there is no time constraint on dealing with the
specific kinds of dismay and outrage that have swept the minority
and immigrant communities. These New Yorkers are worried that young
men of color are being fired on in situations where white suspects
would not be. This means the mayor needs to work harder at his job
as First Citizen. He must build trust in poorer areas that the
police are not an alien force whose mission is to harass their
young.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is a battler with many successes, but his reputation
for listening to critics and building consensus needs work. He has
criticized and demoralized the Civilian Complaint Review Board,
which hears complaints about police. He has made it difficult for
independent groups to gain access to the most basic police data. He
set up a task force to analyze police abuse and then derided its
conclusions. The mayor has some prominent black supporters, but he
needs to reach more minority leadership figures who can help him in
times like these.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has run a city that is good at fighting crime. If only
he were as good at realizing that community unrest is a problem
that sometimes needs soothing rather than rebutting. His appearance
Thursday needs to be the start of a broad, continuing dialogue. &QL;

TEAM EXCELS FOR COACH GIBBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ They ran in separate Twin 125-mile
qualifying races at the Daytona International Speedway yesterday,
and they ran up front. On Sunday, new teammates Tony Stewart and
Bobby Labonte will start the Daytona 500 second and third,
respectively, with an eye on first.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, Joe Gibbs Racing appears to have created the
kind of team chemistry that creates front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chemistry in sports, it's one of the things I love about it,''
said Gibbs, who won three Super Bowls as coach of the NFL's
Washington Redskins before assembling his first NASCAR Winston Cup
team in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't step into the NFL, you can't step into Winston Cup
and buy it,'' said Gibbs, referring to that elusive championship
combination. ``You have to put together the right people. It's got
to be the chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a Winston Cup rookie but former champion of the Pep
Boys Indy Racing League, locked up the No. 2 starting spot during
Saturday's qualifying for the Daytona 500. Stewart toured the
high-banked, 2.5-mile speedway at 194.589 mph. Only a
late-afternoon lap by Jeff Gordon at 195.067 mph knocked Stewart
off what would have been an improbable pole.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Stewart started from the pole in the second Twin
125-miler and led the first seven laps before reigning Daytona 500
champion Dale Earnhardt passed him on the outside and hung him
``out to dry'' outside the draft. Stewart recovered to post a
sixth-place finish. And he did not put a scratch on his new No. 20
Home Depot Pontiac Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not worrying about whether we're making a splash or
not,'' said Stewart, a 27-year-old resident of Columbus, Ind. ``I
learned a lot today'' about drafting.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte said Stewart did a fine job in what amounted to his
Winston Cup racing debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finished the race,'' Labonte said of his brash teammate.
``That's what he needed to do. We'll work together more \Rin
practice\S than we have the last couple of days. There's a good
shot we'll be within arm's reach all day'' Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Labonte shuffled past Gordon in traffic on lap 39 of
the opening 50-lap sprint and held off Gordon and Jeff Burton for
his first Twin 125 victory. Labonte, 34, will line up on the inside
of Row 2 on race day, alongside Earnhardt, who won the second Twin.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte finished a career-best sixth in points in 1998, and
posted his sixth and seventh Winston Cup victories in the No. 18
Interstate Batteries Pontiac. The Corpus Christi native also was
runner-up in last year's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the game plan from Coach Gibbs for Labonte is all
about winning the Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to step up into that top three and run up there.
That's a hard step,'' Gibbs said. ``But I think we've got our best
chance at the title because of Bobby's maturity and the maturity of
the race team.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's assignment, Gibbs said, is to learn on the wide-open
fly, and help Labonte run up front. Stewart scored two pole
positions in 22 NASCAR Busch Grand National Series starts last year
and finished second in two races. He also ran the entire 11-race
IRL schedule, bagging four poles and two victories.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he is proud of his U.S. Auto Club and IRL
open-wheel roots, and still yearns to win the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my dreams and aspirations have always been to come to
Winston Cup,'' he said. ``What people don't understand is I've ran
twice as many stock-car races as IRL races. I've knocked down as
many walls as Cole Trickle \Rin the movie ``Days of Thunder''\S. I
think a race-car driver's a race-car driver, and a good race-car
driver can drive anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be a rookie, no matter what. But I feel like I've
got the best car, best teammate, the best sponsor in the series.
Joe's done his job. Bobby does everything he can to babysit me
everywhere we go. At this point, it's up to me.''

ONE PLAY EXEMPLIFIES TEXAS TURNAROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Addressing his team's performance in a
three-game sweep of top-ranked Southern California last weekend,
Texas coach Augie Garrido recalled one particularly thrilling
moment.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred in the eighth inning of the third game, in which the
Trojans had taken the lead with a four-run rally featuring nine
batters and only one ball hit out of the infield. The Longhorns,
after two impressive victories, appeared to be crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   With two out and the bases loaded, a USC hitter smacked a line
drive that seemed headed for the gap in right-center. But,
suddenly, second baseman Tommy Nicholson rose from the turf to make
a spectacular leaping catch, and the Trojans were through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was that a hell of a play?'' Garrido said. ``That one play
made everything that came later possible.''
</P>
<P>
   What came later was a Texas rally capped by a dramatic
ninth-inning home run to win the game by freshman first baseman
Jeff Ontiveros _ producing a sweep of the defending national
champions.
</P>
<P>
   To Garrido _ whose two years at Texas have hardly been the
crowning glory of an otherwise distinguished career _ Nicholson's
leaping stab may have represented the difference between Longhorns
present and Longhorns past.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least, the recent past _ in which the Longhorns first
ended an 18-year run of consecutive playoff appearances, then
established a school record for season losses (32).
</P>
<P>
   ``You rarely see a play like that from a team that's down,''
Garrido said. ``When things are going badly, confidence erodes and
so does the level of play. But this is a team that was confident
every day that they were going to win _ and Nicholson's play was an
example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a feeling expressed earlier by Scott Dunn, who struck out
eight and allowed the Trojans one earned run in six innings in the
opener, earning Big 12 pitcher-of-the-week honors.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that all three games came down to a clutch ninth-inning
performance _ Ontiveros' home run and three gritty relief jobs by
Phil Seibel _ Dunn said, ``In every case, we were sure we were
going to win. Last year in those situations, we were just kind of
waiting around for a screw-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Resting Seibel and front-line starters Dax Leone and D.J. Jones,
the Longhorns (5-1) lost to UT-San Antonio, 11-10, Tuesday, but
moved up to 17th in the polls. Texas opens a three-game series at
No. 3 Louisiana State today. Tech starts hot Texas Tech (5-0)
outscored Howard by a combined 81-11 count last weekend before
beating TCU on Tuesday. Staff ace Shane Wright (14-1 last year) is
already 2-0 with wins over Howard and the Frogs, and the Raiders
are hitting .450 as a team. Coach Larry Hays, as usual, is
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this week we embark on a little trip to play eight games
out on the coast _ including three against USC and a couple against
UCLA and Oregon in a tournament in San Diego,'' Hays said. ``If
we're not mentally ill when we get back from that, we may have a
pretty good idea where we are at this point.'' Baylor nicked Baylor
(2-3) opened on the coast, losing two of three decisions _ all
decided by one run _ to Long Beach State, which finished third in
the College World Series last year. The Bears then split two at
Northeast Louisiana. Team USA veteran Jason Jennings got the Baylor
win _ giving up only a bunt single in a shutout win. Jennings hit
93 mph most of the day and was clocked at 91 in the ninth inning.
A&AMP;M impressive Texas A&AMP;M (3-0) outscored UT-Pan American, 48-8, in
a weekend series. Preseason All-American Casey Fossum allowed one
hit and struck out 13 in a six-inning stint, and Daylan Holt tied a
school record with three home runs in one game. The Aggies, hitting
.442 with nine homers, will open a three-game set at Arizona today.

REPUBLICANS ANGRY AT REPORTS OF CLINTON'S VENDETTA AGAINST FOES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans reacted with disbelief and outrage
Thursday to reports that the president is bent on a personal
vendetta to unseat those Republicans who supported his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the height of arrogance,'' said Rep. Christopher
Cannon, R-Utah, one of the House prosecutors in the impeachment
trial. The Senate expected to vote Friday to acquit Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said that instead of vengeance, the
president should be worrying about ``leaving an eensy-weensy,
itsy-bitsy better legacy than he has so far.'' He added: ``It's a
sad day if revenge is the order of the day. If I were the
president, I'd worry about rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National
Committee, decried Clinton's electoral mission in the most searing
and personal of terms. ``Unlike you, I've seen real combat,'' he
said bitterly, as if speaking to the president, ``and you'll have
to get by me first.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, a West Point graduate and decorated army ranger who
served in Vietnam, reflected the longstanding cultural wars that
seem to lurk just beneath the surface of the partisan impeachment
battle.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, he reflected the Republicans' anger that the
politically adroit Clinton, who avoided the draft in the 1960s and
is on the verge of avoiding conviction in the Senate, would
outmaneuver them once again.
</P>
<P>
   Stirring these sentiments was a report in Thursday's New York
Times that Clinton was committed to an all-out campaign to take
back the House, both to rescue his political legacy from the
yearlong impeachment ordeal and to exact revenge on those
Republicans who he believes dragged out the process needlessly and
unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential advisers said Thursday that Clinton himself was
furious that word leaked of his private ruminations, which counter
his publicly expressed desire to work with Congress. Several said
that he was trying to ferret out the source of the report.
</P>
<P>
   The president's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, did not deny the report
but cast doubt on it by saying there were ``thousands'' of
so-called advisers to the president who purported to know his frame
of mind and only spoke anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   He said the administration was ``a little bit smarter'' than to
campaign on a personal vendetta. ``I can't think of a worse, more
dumb strategy than going after people based on whether they were a
House manager or not,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the House managers, and the vast majority are in
safe seats or unopposed seats.'' The article said that Clinton was
particularly angry at the managers, but noted their safe seats.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart continued to advance the White House view of the
unfairness of the House proceeding, which ended Dec. 19 in support
of two articles of impeachment. ``It seemed at times more based on
a partisan agenda than a search for what happened here and a search
for the truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aggrieved Republicans, who have sunk in the polls as Clinton has
stayed high, were quick to leap at the notion that Clinton appeared
far from the ``gloat-free zone'' that Lockhart had previously
asserted the president would inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said,
``It is deeply troubling that the president views closure of this
constitutional process as an opportunity for revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said, ``The president has to have
contrition. He can't have a get-even attitude. I don't know if he
does, but he shouldn't. Any effort to get even just keeps the
poison in the body politic, and it will spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Senate chaplain was moved to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time neither for gloating over victory nor grimness
over losing, but rather a period for grief for all that has brought
us to this day,'' Lloyd H. Ogilvie, the chaplain, lamented in his
prayer as the Senate convened.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mann, an expert on Congress at the Brookings Institution,
said that Republicans had good reason to feel exasperated and
angry. They lost House seats in the last election and lost a
speaker and a speaker-designate while Clinton has managed to
survive and thrive, in part because of a booming economy, in part
by cleverly co-opting Republican issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at his ability to really destroy their wedge issues,''
Mann said. ``Now it's the Democratic Party that's good on welfare
and crime and fiscal responsibility and even taxes. It's an amazing
achievement for a man who has been personally under siege
throughout his presidency and who has widely acknowledged flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Republicans, he said, ``they are not only scarred
with the tar of impeachment, but they look and they find they don't
have any agenda. It's inevitable they will look for openings, for
signs of hubris, of revenge, of anything that will give them an
ability to change the subject and begin to regain some of their
lost ground.''
</P>
<P>
   In an overt attempt to do so, many in the House took the high
road in discussing the president's mood, saying they were sticking
to their knitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our work to do,'' said Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas.
John Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker Dennis Hastert, said,
``People want us to get to work on their business, not on political
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., said the party had to
prepare for the full power of another Clinton campaign. ``It's
payback time, and payback time is hell,'' he said. He said the
president was a ``savvy, hardball politician, and you've got to
fear his ability and respect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, the party chairman, vowed vengeance on the avenger.
He said the Republican Party would match the presidential effort in
every district across the country, and he said the Republicans whom
the president has targeted should be proud of their votes on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far from being ground under the heels of Bill Clinton's tawdry
effort to celebrate his impeachment trial,'' Nicholson said,
``these men and women will be rewarded by the people they represent
and remembered as giants.''
</P>
<P>
   A few Democrats seemed chagrined by the president's desire to
unseat his accusers. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said Clinton should
be part of the necessary healing after Friday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that the president play a critical role in
conveying to people a measure of understanding what he has put the
country through,'' Kerry said.

   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Mark Grudzielanek
will make $1.9 million this season, $700,000 less than what he was
seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrator Nicholas Zumas heard the case in Tampa, Fla., where
Grudzielanek is working out, and ruled in favor of the Dodgers on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach was to let the numbers speak for themselves,''
said Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone. ``I think both sides
presented their cases as far as what both sides thought. It's what
we thought someone with three-plus years of experience with his
numbers (should earn).''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who made $350,000 last year, was seeking $2.6
million after hitting .272 with 21 doubles, 10 homers, 62 RBI and
scoring 62 runs in his time split between Montreal and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Grudzielanek is a career .279 hitter with 21
homers and 182 RBI, but he's also part of an intriguing situation
for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   He's expected to battle for the starting shortstop position with
Jose Vizcaino, who missed the last three months of the season with
an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that Malone would try to sign
Grudzielanek to a multi-year deal before the case went to
arbitration, but Malone said that's not in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure it's a guy we want to commit to in the
future,'' Malone said. ``We want to see how he's improving
defensively. He's capable. He's got the ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season Grudzielanek committed 33 errors, including 10 in 51
games for the Dodgers after being traded by Montreal on July 31.
He's spent part of the offseason in Florida working on his defense.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Linda Tripp, the woman whose secret tape recordings
made her the reviled symbol of a double-crossing friend, says now
that her deepest regret is the pain that she caused Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In her first lengthy interview since the scandal began 13 months
ago, Mrs. Tripp said she betrayed Ms. Lewinsky to save the young
woman from being abused by the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mom, especially with a daughter close in age to Monica, I
would hope some other mom would do for my daughter what I did for
Monica, despite the fact that it looks horrible, that it looks like
betrayal,'' Mrs. Tripp said as she broke down in tears toward the
end of a two-hour conversation here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Her interview with The New York Times was the first in a series
of media appearances she has scheduled in an attempt to
rehabilitate her image. She will appear on NBC's ``Today'' show on
Friday morning and on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' show on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   It might strain credulity that Mrs. Tripp now portrays herself
as Ms. Lewinsky's surrogate mother, a woman who had no choice but
to teach some tough lessons to a wayward daughter, even if the
methods were unorthodox. Her tone in the interview contrasted
sharply with the Linda Tripp heard on her now-infamous audiotapes,
where she seemed manipulative, pushing Ms. Lewinsky to demand
high-powered help from the president's friend, Vernon Jordan, in
finding a job, and encouraging her to insist on getting one before
signing her false affidavit in the Paula Jones lawsuit against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   It was her decision to turn over those tapes to Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel, that transformed a private Washington
affair into a public scandal. But Mrs. Tripp contends it was
Lucianne Goldberg, a New York literary agent, who encouraged her to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me to go to Ken Starr,'' Mrs. Tripp said.
``It wasn't on my radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also Ms. Goldberg, she said, who pushed her to reveal Ms.
Lewinsky's affair with the president to lawyers for Mrs. Jones, who
was suing Clinton for sexual misconduct. It was Ms. Goldberg who
gave the Jones lawyers Mrs. Tripp's unlisted telephone number, she
said, adding that she spoke at length with one of those lawyers in
October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Told about Mrs. Tripp's remarks on Thursday night, Ms. Goldberg
said simply, ``Whatever Linda says, Linda says.'' She declined to
comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mrs. Tripp describes herself as Ms. Lewinsky's protector,
perhaps her ``only friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always saw Monica as a kid, I always saw her as a lost
soul,'' Mrs. Tripp said. ``I believe she and the country will never
understand that I believed this was in her best interest, and that
makes me very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old Pentagon employee, who has lost 40 pounds and
appeared poised and articulate, said that she is now convinced that
Ms. Lewinsky was so distraught about her affair with Clinton that
she feared she might do herself harm. ``I didn't believe that
Monica could put this behind her unless it was severed once and for
all,'' Mrs. Tripp said.
</P>
<P>
   She bristled at the notion that the president's relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky was sex between consenting adults, as many have
described it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the farthest thing from that,'' she said angrily. ``It
was horrifying, is what it actually was. This was a young girl who,
as an enthusiastic participant in this relationship, fell head over
heels in love with the president. He clearly did not share those
feelings and his callous abuse in discarding Monica Lewinsky made
it look as if he thought of her as a servicing contract, a woman
who could be easily discarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans view Mrs. Tripp as the villain in the Clinton sex
scandal, and see her as an archetype of a girlfriend betraying a
girlfriend. They were most incensed at Mrs. Tripp's advice to Ms.
Lewinsky not to dry-clean that navy blue dress from the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Starr report, Mrs. Tripp had told Ms. Lewinsky
that she looked fat in it and that she should not think about
wearing to a Thanksgiving dinner. Mrs. Tripp even plotted with
Goldberg about stealing it from Ms. Lewinsky's closet.

 &HT;    Barnes will join effort to boot Barr
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Democrats are targeting three Georgia
Republicans for defeat in 2000, including Rep. Bob Barr, and will
have the help of President Clinton and Gov. Roy Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.), the new chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, praised Clinton on
Thursday for his plans to aid Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy denied Clinton's involvement was prompted by
vengeance against House members who supported impeachment,
particularly the 13 Republican prosecutors in the Senate's
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no secret attack and we will not be wasting money in
districts we can't win,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The other Republican representatives on the Democrats' hit list
are Saxby Chambliss and Charlie Norwood, who represent districts
that Clinton carried in 1996. Democrats vainly targeted them for
defeat in 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, though he represents a solidly GOP district, is the
Republican that Democrats would most like to beat. A member of the
prosecution team, Barr has been a persistent critic of Clinton
since running for Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, whose Mableton, Ga., home is in Barr's 7th Congressional
District, will be an ``enormous'' help in the campaign, said John
Kirincich, executive director of the Georgia Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is not happy that Bob Barr is his congressman,''
Kirincich said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Barr joined other Republicans in criticizing the
president, who, The New York Times reported, will be seeking
revenge against impeachment-minded Republicans and especially the
13 prosecutors, or managers, most of whom represent safe Republican
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report does not come as a great surprise,'' Barr said.
``When we began our effort to hold the president accountable for
committing felonies in office, we knew he would attack us
personally and politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said Clinton should instead be
focusing on another word that begins with the letter ``r,''
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson said he
would ``meet Clinton's challenge head on, district for district,
candidate for candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   And Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) criticized any
White House talk of defeating Republicans on the eve of the vote.
``It is deeply troubling that the president views closure of this
constitutional process as an opportunity for revenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, echoing Kennedy, said
Clinton would campaign aggressively to help Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``I can't think of a worse or more dumb strategy
than going after people based on whether they were a House manager
or not. ... I think we're a little bit smarter than that.''
</P>
<P>
   One House prosecutor, Rep. George Gekas (R-Pa.), said
Republicans should expect the Democratic president to lead his
troops in the campaign, saying that the revenge aspect should
``only strengthen Republican resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr did not appear disturbed by the prospect of an organized
Democratic campaign against him, feigning fright when reporters
raised the subject with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton wants to come to the 7th District, if he thinks
he's going to find a lot of support there, I'd like to follow him
around,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Barr recalled printing campaign fliers and T-shirts with a
photograph of Clinton jogging with then-Rep. George ``Buddy''
Darden, his 1994 opponent. A huge reproduction of the photograph
hung on the outside of Barr's Marietta, Ga., campaign headquarters
that year.
</P>
<P>
   A net change of six seats in the 2000 election would elevate
Democrats to a majority in the House, a status they have not held
since the Newt Gingrich-led Republican takeover of Congress in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Barr was held to 55 percent in the last election, despite
running against a poorly financed Democrat who was little-known in
the Cobb County population center of the 7th congressional
district.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy acknowledged that ousting Barr is a longshot. ``But from
everyone I've spoken to down there, there is going to be a big
drive to support a candidate against Bob Barr,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting a strong candidate has been the biggest problem
Democrats have faced in Barr's district as well as in Chambliss'
and Norwood's.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially strong candidates backed out of races against
Chambliss and Norwood last year. The Republicans also are strong
campaigners with healthy campaign bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Kirincich confidently predicted a different outcome in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the 7th District, he said former state Rep. Tim Perry, who
recently sold a small grocery chain, and longtime Democratic
contributor Roger Kahn, who sold his interest in Empire Liquor
Distributors, are thinking about running against Barr.

STATE LIMIT ON WORKERS' COMPUTER USE IS UPHELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAMELA MENDELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying that the government has a right to control the
job-related speech of its workers, a federal appeals court has
upheld a Virginia law that forbids state employees from using
computers at work to gain access to sexually explicit material.
</P>
<P>
   The case is a setback for the American Civil Liberties Union
which, over the last three years, has brought a string of lawsuits
challenging restrictions on online content or access to it.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Virginia attorney general's office in Richmond
hailed the court's 3-0 ruling as a victory for the public as the
ultimate boss of state employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along that this case was about the rights of
taxpayers not to have their resources used by state employees on
state time to access pornography on the Internet,'' William Henry
Hurd, senior counsel to the attorney general, said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ann Beeson, a staff lawyer for the civil liberties group in
New York, said the decision was a defeat for First Amendment
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It warps the general rules for when public employees are
entitled to free speech protection,'' Ms. Beeson said.
</P>
<P>
   The group's lawyers have not yet decided whether to appeal the
decision, which was handed down late Wednesday by Judges William
Wilkins, Michael Luttig and Clyde Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   The law, enacted in 1996, bars state employees from using
government computers to obtain descriptions or images of a ``lewd
exhibition of nudity'' or other sexually explicit material, unless
they have permission, in writing, from agency officials.
</P>
<P>
   The civil liberties group brought the case on behalf of six
professors at state universities and colleges who said that their
research and other academic activities would be unduly constrained
by the law, in violation of the First Amendment. The lawyers also
argued that the law would impermissibly affect other state
employees, like social workers handling sexual abuse cases.
</P>
<P>
   But a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
said that the state had more power to restrict free speech of its
employees than to restrict the speech of ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act regulates the speech of individuals speaking in their
capacity as commonwealth employees, not as citizens, and thus the
act does not touch upon a matter of public concern,'' the judges
said. ``Consequently, the speech may be restricted consistent with
the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil liberties group can request review of the decision
before all of the judges in the 4th Circuit or try to appeal the
decision to the United States Supreme Court. One house of the
Virginia General Assembly, the House of Delegates, voted recently
to repeal the law and replace it with a policy on state employees'
use of computers in the workplace.

 Old BofA's No. 2 Exec Quits to Be CEO of Barclays  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
In another sign of the demise of the old BankAmerica, Michael
O'Neill, the old BofA's No. 2 executive, announced yesterday that
he is quitting the new BofA to take the top job at Barclays,
Britain's second-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, 52, is the most senior executive of the old BofA to
leave the new bank since David Coulter, the company's former
chairman and chief executive, was forced out in October, shortly
after North Carolina's NationsBank took control and adopted the
BofA name.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill has been head of the new bank's asset-management and
investment businesses and a member of its six-member policy
committee, its highest management body. He had been the old BofA's
chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   His departure, which takes effect next month, leaves corporate
and global investment banking chief Michael Murray as the only
senior executive of the old BofA left at the new bank.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's resignation was widely expected. He wasn't comfortable
with the culture and direction of the combined bank and objected to
NationsBank's moves to seize power, people close to him said before
yesterday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they said, he clashed with bank Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Hugh McColl over the way Coulter was pushed out.
Both McColl and O'Neill were officers in the Marines and are known
for speaking bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, O'Neill stressed that he is leaving to
take advantage of the opportunity to run one of Europe's major
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``the BankAmerica-NationsBank transaction hasn't gone
exactly the way we hoped it would have gone,'' he said. ``The way
this has been implemented is different from the way I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said his ``enthusiasm remains strong'' for the financial
benefits of the takeover to the combined bank. He noted that McColl
had personally treated him fairly.
</P>
<P>
   The former chief financial officer is eligible to collect a
package of benefits including three years' of salary and bonuses
worth tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, McColl wished O'Neill well, calling the
Barclay's job ``a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BOFA12 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  For his part, Murray, 54, said he intends to stay at BofA. ``I
plan to hang around here,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Both O'Neill and Murray joined the old BofA when the bank bought
Chicago's Continental Bank in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   O`Neill is no stranger to Britain. He worked in Continental's
London office for nine years in the 1970s and 1980s, eventually
rising to manager of the bank's operations in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays, where O'Neill will be group chief executive and a
director, is a consumer and corporate banking powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, its profits and stock performance have suffered
because of investment banking losses. Martin Taylor, the bank's
former CEO, resigned abruptly late last year, reportedly over
conflicts with bank directors about the future of Barclays'
investment banking unit.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's size and mix of retail and corporate business
resemble the old BofA, O'Neill noted. O'Neill said he plans to
examine the profit performance of each of the bank's businesses and
to channel capital where it can make the most money.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bank's key businesses is Barclays Global Investors, a
San Francisco money-management operation that specializes in
computer-driven investments for institutional clients linked to
stock and bond indexes. O'Neill said he will return to San
Francisco periodically to consult with the unit's managers.

 The Incredible Growing Workweek   By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Since Chip Goldstein started work as registrar at the College of
Notre Dame in Belmont 10 years ago, student enrollment has shot up
by 60 percent. His office has added complex new services like
online registration.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of full-time employees in Goldstein's office
hasn't grown at all.
</P>
<P>
   So Goldstein stays at work until 7 in the evening. He eats lunch
at his desk. He takes reading home with him at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was essentially a 40-hour-per-week job has evolved to a
50- to 60-hour-per-week job,'' Goldstein muses.
</P>
<P>
   Like Goldstein, many Americans today find themselves working
longer hours than they used to _ hours that go far beyond the
traditional 40-hour workweek.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of people working very long schedules of 49 hours
per week or more is on the rise, from 13 percent in 1976 to 18.8
percent in 1998, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the average workweek also seems to &LR;   &LR; have risen
since the 1970s _ by somewhere between a fraction of an hour and
three hours per week, depending on which researcher is doing the
counting.
</P>
<P>
   What's particularly noteworthy is that today's extended
workweeks aren't limited to Silicon Valley programmers and
managers, who have long been known for all-night work marathons and
80-hour weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Workweeks that run 50 or more hours now can be found everywhere,
from banks and utilities to nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is very clear is that we have a division in the
workforce, with a growing chunk of the population working extremely
long hours and another group working shorter hours than they
want,'' said Robert Drago, an economist at the University of
Wisconsin at Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for today's longer workweeks is the entry of
women into the labor force: Many women who would have worked on a
part-time basis 25 years ago now hold full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But some academics say today's longer weeks are also an
outgrowth of the recession and mass layoffs of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Companies became leery of adding new staff. So when the economy
improved and their work volume increased, they tried to get the
work done with their existing workforce.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, these academics suggest, long workweeks have helped
fuel America's current economic boom by putting a damper on the
wage inflation that usually accompanies a period of low
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of having to raise wages to attract more workers,
firms have increasingly been able to fill their additional need for
labor by employing their own workers longer,'' said Barry
Bluestone, a professor of political economy at the University of
Massachusetts in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, individual workers are willing to put in longer hours
for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Some _ including many professionals in places like Silicon
Valley _ simply live and breathe their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Others accept long hours as the price they must pay to advance
their careers or simply stay employed in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Saltres &LR; e &LR; , an administrative assistant at GATX Capital in
San Francisco, has seen her job expand from 40 to 45 hours per week
over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is me, that I can do more now because I'm more
experienced,'' Saltres &LR; e &LR;  said. ``Another part of it is that the
business has increased, but the company hasn't added people.''
</P>
<P>
   Saltres &LR; e &LR;  arrives early and rarely takes a lunch break to
ensure that she can leave on time each day. Because she still feels
the pain of being laid off during the recession of the early 1990s,
she doesn't complain about the long hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think: `At least I have a job,''' Saltres &LR; e &LR;  said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of HOURS12 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Managers and professionals tend to put in longer workweeks than
anyone else: Nearly half of all male managers spent more than 49
hours per week at their jobs last year.
</P>
<P>
   But they're not the only ones working longer than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing workers logged an average of 4.6 hours of overtime
each week in 1998 _ up from 3.9 hours in 1988, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   And in California, many hourly workers found themselves with
longer workdays last year after state officials replaced the
eight-hour day with the 40-hour week as the threshold for receiving
overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, who works a 9:30-to-6:30 shift at a major bank, found
that her supervisors started to schedule weekly meetings at 8 a.m.
once they no longer had to pay daily overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Her bosses now tell her to take an hour off later in the week to
make up for those 8 a.m. meetings. But that still leaves her with a
10- or 11-hour workday, and no time to see her young son.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is barely getting up when I leave, and he's going to
bed when I get home,'' said the woman, who asked to remain
anonymous. ``I enjoy my job and love what I do. But I'm sorry: When
it comes to these long days, I'm just not as productive after eight
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   For employees faced with growing work hours, technology has
proven to be a double-edged sword.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say computers and other electronic devices allow
them to do more work in less time.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that technology has simply extended work into all
corners of their lives _ letting them check e-mail at midnight or
write memos on Sunday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Carlin, a computer systems administrator who lives in
Concord, normally works a straightforward 8:15-to-5:15 schedule at
the Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   But when he leaves, he takes his pager and cell phone with him
just in case one of his co-workers needs to reach him. He wears
them everywhere _ to the movies, walking his dog and, until
recently, to his acupuncture sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I was sitting there with all these needles in me and
the pager went off,'' Carlin said. ``The stress comes not so much
from my workload, as from not having time really and truly away
from work. ...Maybe technology has put us back to an earlier era
before vacations and two-day weekends came into existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employees make a conscious choice not to work beyond a
certain point _ even if it means bucking the culture of their
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've managed to ratchet my schedule down so I can have an
outside life,'' said Doug Shoemaker, a San Francisco architect with
Gensler who tries to be home by 6 each night. ``I'm a highly
organized guy, I really focus on tasks, and I get them done.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a few workplaces, a quiet backlash is brewing against
long hours.
</P>
<P>
   David Green, a time management consultant for Franklin Covey,
has spotted the same anonymous note on bulletin boards at several
different high-tech Valley companies.
</P>
<P>
   It reads: ``Staying late and working at the office until 8 p.m.
really means that you were too lazy, incompetent or disorganized to
get your work done by 5 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I hold that sign up in a seminar, about 20 people
come up and ask for copies,'' Green said.

LYCOS SHARES LEAP AMID MIXED MESSAGES ON DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl) 
By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of Lycos' stock continued to fluctuate Thursday as
contradictory reports emerged about the prospects for its proposed
merger with the electronic commerce assets of USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock jumped by 18 percent to close at $103.25,
after a brokerage firm analyst wrote that the company's largest
shareholder, CMGI, was not going to support the deal. That report
was later partially contradicted by a CMGI statement that the
company was ``generally supportive'' of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The shares of Lycos had dropped by 45 percent from $127.25 on
Monday night before the deal was announced, to $87.25 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had been unhappy that the complex deal did not accord
them the sort of huge takeover premium seen in other recent
Internet takeovers. In both Yahoo's acquisition of Geocities and At
Home Network's buyout of Excite, the deal was struck considerably
higher than the market price of the target stock.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a premium is not even relevant to the Lycos-USA
deal, because although USA winds up controlling Lycos, Lycos is
technically buying Home Shopping Network and Ticketmaster, and
Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch from USA, paying for them by giving
USA 60 percent of Lycos' shares. And acquisition premium would only
be calculated if Lycos were the seller, rather than the buyer, as
it technically is in this deal.
</P>
<P>
   This complexity has contributed to the deal's lack of popularity
with investors.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Lycos' stock was downgraded by a number of Wall
Street analysts, including Alan Braverman at Deutsche Bank, Bruce
Smith at Jefferies &AMP; Co. and Henry Blodget at CIBC Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   But by Thursday morning, Paul Noglows, the highly regarded but
often contrarian analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist issued a report to
clients upgrading Lycos from a buy to a strong buy.
</P>
<P>
   Noglows praised the deal as sound strategically. But what the
market seized on was one paragraph at the end of Noglows' report
based on a conversation he had held with a top CMGI executive
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned that CMGI-which owns about 20 percent of
Lycos, will not vote in favor of the merger at Lycos' current
price,'' he wrote. ``If Lycos' stock continues to wane, we believe
CMGI will push for a restructured deal that gives Lycos a higher
percentage of the merged company than the proposed 30 percent
stake.''
</P>
<P>
   CMGI is a publicly traded company with its roots in the direct
mail business that has transformed itself into one of the most
successful investors in Internet companies. It had paid $5.8
million for a 27 percent stake in Geocities that turned into $858
million worth of Yahoo stock. CMGI chairman David Wetherall sits on
Lycos' board, and he voted for the deal with USA just a few days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherall did not return repeated calls for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the prospect that CMGI might vote the deal down,
investors were free again to dream of a huge takeover premium, and
thus shares in Lycos surged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   (Internet stocks generally rebounded Thursday after their
weeklong slide. Yahoo rose $16.125, to $158.50, and America Online
rose $13.8125 to $164.6875.)
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, in response to a request for comment from
Nasdaq, Weatherall issued a statement that CMGI was generally
supportive of the deal ``but reserves the right to reassess its
position as developments unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Networks, which spent much of Thursday meeting with
investors to tout the merits of the deal, issued its own statement
in the afternoon saying ``CMGI voted for the transaction at the
board level and does support the transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Noglows interpreted these seemingly contradictory responses as a
sign that CMGI would support the transaction so long as Lycos'
stock remained high.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, Noglows argued that any scenario would press
Lycos' stock up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most likely outcome is that the company gets the word out
and people become convinced as to the merits of the deal,'' he said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock nonetheless languishes, ``CMG will push USA for a
better deal, and that will push Lycos' stock up,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the deal blows up, then ``Lycos goes back to where
it was three days ago, and everybody hopes for a different deal.''
</P>
<P>
   And are those hopes for a big takeover premium warranted?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, Noglows said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock was already up 135 percent for the year, and so a
takeover premium was already built in,'' he said. ``I can't imagine
it selling for more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course, that was exactly the prospect that had Lycos'
stock bouncing up from the bottom of its crater.

 BofA Is Putting Up Big Bucks to Rebuild Its Montgomery Unit  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
San Francisco is no longer the sick ward for NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities' ailing health care practice.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Montgomery, a unit of Hugh McColl's
Charlotte-based Bank of America, hired two investment bankers from
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York to give the investment
bank's health care practice a booster shot.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery paid top dollar to lure the head of Morgan Stanley's
health care services group, Brian Brille, away from one of the
Street's top-tier banks in attempt to rebuild Montgomery's
decimated health care ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Brille, Montgomery also hired one of his Morgan
Stanley colleagues, Charles Ditkoff, who will report directly to
Brille. They will run the practice out of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Street Smarts made hay out of Montgomery's fading
commitment to health care banking, specifically in biotechnology
and medical technology. Those columns reported a rash of demotions
and defections that hit Montgomery's health care practice since
founder Thom Weisel quit last September over a flap about who would
oversee junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
   As one Montgomery employee puts it: ``Business schools will, one
day, study this (transition) as a model of mismanagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Jeff Child _ who specialized in physician groups and
health management organizations _ was acting as head of the
investment bank's health care group. But in the wake of Brille's
hiring, Child has been reassigned to a position in Montgomery's
equity markets group.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brille says he's committed to all categories of
health care banking, including biotech and medtech. Both categories
are highly risky and take years for companies to bring products to
market.
</P>
<P>
   Health care ``is one of our most important industry groups.
Period,'' said Brille in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he just left one of the world's top-flight investment
banks to run the health care show at an outfit in disarray. What
are we to expect him to say?
</P>
<P>
   But health care is a broad term that also includes ``big
pharma'' and huge HMOs, which is where Montgomery's emphasis is
expected to shift. The new strategy is to focus on raising capital
for existing commercial clients of the former NationsBank and the
old BofA, many of which are HMOs and physician practices firms.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET12 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  South San Francisco startups, with their promising cures for
cancer and other scientific breakthroughs, will probably have to
turn elsewhere, perhaps to such places as Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, for
underwriting and banking services. Yet none of this should come as
a total surprise. Critics of then-NationsBank's acquisition of
Montgomery predicted that top talent would defect. They also
forecasted that BofA would steer its investment banking arm away
from IPO underwriting and toward services, such as bond and
secondary stock offerings, that cater to the parent's bevy of
commercial banking clients. The idea was to get those traditional
clients to do more than just borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   But few observers thought BofA's buyout of Montgomery would turn
out to be such a debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a neutron bomb hit the place. It's a ghost town,''
needles a top Bay Area investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   In investment banking, the people are the assets. And BofA has
watched much of Montgomery's asset value walk out of the door (a
lot of which can be found parked at Thomas Weisel Partners).
</P>
<P>
   To replace that talent, Montgomery's new chief, Carter
McClelland, the former head of Deutsche Bank in the United States,
must pony up and pay a premium. According to rival bankers,
Montgomery is offering compensation packages to Wall Street
veterans such as Brille that are twice as lucrative as what they
were getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the classic commercial banking paradigm'' for building an
investment banking arm, the rival investment banker says.
</P>
<P>
   BofA (then-NationsBank) paid more than $1.2 billion to purchase
Montgomery. Now it is restocking its stables with, albeit, proven
talent at twice the cost of what the top investment banks in the
business are willing to pay, critics contend.
</P>
<P>
   So, BofA paid a purchase-premium up front, and now it is paying
double to recruit bankers and researchers to fill the jobs of
people that it ran off.
</P>
<P>
   Do the math. How is that going to add to BofA's bottom line?

 Healtheon Quadruples on First Day  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The stock of Healtheon Corp. nearly quadrupled in its first day of
trading yesterday as the young company finally cashed in on the
Internet craze, four months after pulling the plug on its original
IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Santa Clara company, which provides technology
that lets doctors, hospitals and insurance companies share patient
information on the Internet, soared from their asking price of $8
to $31.38 on the Nasdaq market. Earlier, the stock touched $33.25
per share.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon, which sold 5 million shares to the public, had a
market value of $2.2 billion when the dust settled yesterday,
making it the latest Internet startup to crack the billion-dollar
level overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The company, chaired by Netscape Communications and Silicon
Graphics co-founder Jim Clark, postponed its offering in October
because of weak demand for new stock sales. As late as October 1,
Healtheon said its IPO would value the company at $430.1 million.
Healtheon's decision to postpone its stock offering prompted
several others _ including Theglobe.com and NetGrocer _ to stall
their IPO plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the best of companies can be at the mercy of external
factors influencing the market,'' said Dr. Charles Saunders, vice
president and medical director for Healtheon. ``Given the
circumstances of the market of late, we're very pleased with our
offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon is one of many competitors hoping to cash in on
consumers' growing interest for health services online, but _ like
many Internet startups _ it has yet to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission last month, the company disclosed net losses of $35.6
million for the nine months ended last September 30, compared with
$21.3 million lost during the first nine months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sales improved to $33.2 million in the first nine months of
1998, from $7 million in the same period in 1997.

 When Does Job Hopping Make Sense?  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I just finished reading a book entitled ``Quit Your Job
Often and Get Big Raises.'' Basically, the author advocates job
hopping as a career strategy. This guy changed jobs four times in
five years and quadrupled his salary. I liked the book, and
evidently it worked for him, but do you think it's a viable
strategy?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Answer: &LR;  There's no question that people change jobs more
often now than in the past. It's also clear that you can boost your
pay and career by changing jobs in a well-thought-out manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in this business about 15 years ago, clients
wanted us to find senior executives who had been with a company for
15 or 20 years,'' said David Nosal, managing director of the
northwest region of Korn/ Ferry International, an executive
recruiting firm. ``Now they want us to find people who have been
with a firm for five to seven years and have built shareholder
value during that time.''
</P>
<P>
   But you won't do your career any favors if you simply change
jobs indiscriminately every 12 months like a game of musical
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   You should have good reasons for taking any new position. Will
it help you gain new skills? Will it give you an opportunity to
make a difference and shine? Will you fit in with the company
culture? Will the new job move you closer to your long-term career
and life goals?
</P>
<P>
   You should also be careful not to burn your present employer
when you move.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you walk out of a job at a critical time for a few more
dollars, that kind of message will follow you around,'' said Susan
Gould, a Palo Alto career consultant and author of the book ``Free
Agents.'' She added, ``future employers will question whether you
will hang in there to finish the project they're hiring you for.''
</P>
<P>
   So how long should you stay at a job nowadays? The rules are no
longer as clear as they once were, when two years were considered
the bare minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on the supply and demand for your skills in the
workplace,'' said Julia Hartman, a software executive and author of
``Strategic Job Jumping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With Y2K programmers, it's accepted that they can move from
assignment to assignment,'' she said. ``But with other kinds of
careers, the demand isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at your peers in your profession,'' Hartman
continued. ``Figure out if you've moved more or less often than
they have. If you've moved more often, you'd better have very
valuable skills. ... If you want to adopt a (job-hopping) strategy,
you'd better be prepared to be a superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   (Note: The ``Quit Your Job Often'' book mentioned by this
letter-writer is by an author named Gordon Miller. I haven't read
it, but would be interested in hearing from readers who have _ or
who have opinions on the pros and cons of job hopping.)
</P>
<P>
   Pay for Travel Time
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife works on an hourly basis for a retail company. About
six times a year, she's required to staff the company's booth at an
out-of-town trade show. How should she be paid for her time at
these shows? Should my wife be paid from the moment she wakes up
until dinner, when she and her boss go over the day's events?
Should she be paid for her travel time to and from the airport? Or
is she just entitled to be paid for the 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. hours of
the trade show?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Employees who are exempt from overtime can be paid their
regular salary when they go on a business trip, no matter how many
hours they put in.
</P>
<P>
   For nonexempt employees like your wife, here are the general
rules:
</P>
<P>
   They should be paid for all the time they work. They should not
be paid for things they'd normally do in the course of their daily
lives _ like sleeping, eating or watching TV in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're doing anything they wouldn't be doing at home, like
conducting business over dinner, they should be paid,'' said Ralph
Yanello, CEO of Lexcom, an employment law information service in
Walnut Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a typical trade-show day as an example. Your wife
wakes up at 7, showers, gets dressed and grabs a pastry on her way
to the show. She'd have to shower, dress and eat breakfast if she
were at home, so she shouldn't be paid for that time.
</P>
<P>
   She staffs the booth from 8:30 until 6, with a half-hour break
for lunch. That's clearly work time, and she should be paid for all
of it except her lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   Then your wife joins her boss for dinner, where they talk about
work.
</P>
<P>
   This is a gray area. If your wife is required to attend the
dinner, that should be paid time. Or if she and her boss are
strategizing about work, that should be paid time. But if it's a
mostly social occasion, it probably shouldn't be paid time.
</P>
<P>
   What about your wife's time in transit? Most states follow
federal law, which says that travel time is generally unpaid,
according to Yanello.
</P>
<P>
   But some states like California say that employees must be paid
for travel time with a couple of exceptions _ time spent commuting,
eating or relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose your wife spends two hours on the plane writing notes
for the trade show and one hour eating the delicious airline meal
and reading People magazine. According to California law, the
company should pay her for two hours of work.
</P>
<P>
   And suppose your wife normally has a half-hour commute to work.
If her drive to the airport also takes a half-hour, that wouldn't
be paid time. But if it takes her a full hour to get to the
airport, California law requires the company to pay for the extra
half hour beyond her normal commute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real lesson here is don't take nonexempt employees on the
road,'' Yanello said. ``It can get very expensive.''

 2 Suits May Change Net Advertising  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Estee Lauder and Playboy Enterprises are suing Excite and Netscape
Communications in separate trademark-infringement actions that
could alter a major form of advertising on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The perfume-maker and publisher claim the two Web portals
routinely sell keywords for online searches to advertisers who want
their banner ads to appear whenever certain keywords are entered.
</P>
<P>
   On Excite's Web site, for example, a computer user who types in
words ``Estee Lauder'' gets a list of Web pages mentioning the
company, but also a prominent banner ad touting the Fragrance
Counter, a rival New York cosmetics firm that paid Excite.
</P>
<P>
   Estee Lauder sued Redwood City's Excite last month in federal
court in New York City. It alleged the keyword ads infringe its
trademark, and constitute unfair competition and false advertising.
The suit seeks an injunction barring the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy Enterprises sued Excite and Netscape last week in
federal court in California, but takes its complaint a step further
than Estee Lauder. The Chicago publisher said the sites ``hijacked
and usurped'' its brand name by linking it to ads for X-rated
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Internet legal experts said the unusual cases could profoundly
affect the rules of online ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since these suits were filed, I've received calls from
companies in the Internet industry who are closely watching,'' said
Neil Smith, trademark attorney at Limbach &AMP; Limbach in San
Francisco. ``Both cases are cause for uncertainty, since brand name
recognition is so critical on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyword ads, which sell for about $40 for every 1,000 times they
are displayed, account for a quarter of online advertising
revenues, which totaled $2 billion in 1998, according to the
Internet Advertising Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Estee Lauder may be able to mount a strong case for its company
name, cyber law experts said, but the cosmetics giant faces an
uphill battle controlling the use of generic words ``Clinique'' and
``Origins,'' two Lauder brand names also linked to Fragrance
Counter.
</P>
<P>
   None of the companies involved in the suits would comment.

 WHITNEY TOWER, WRITER AND LEADER IN HORSE RACING, DIES AT 75 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whitney Tower, the longtime racing writer and former president
of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, who became a
legendary figure at race tracks throughout the world with his
courtly manner and rich personal pedigree, died Friday at his home
in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a stroke he suffered last year,
his wife, Lucy, said.
</P>
<P>
   An elegant figure with an extraordinary family history, Whitney
Tower became one of the most visible leaders in thoroughbred racing
both as a newspaper and magazine writer and later as an official of
the sport's archives. He wrote about the golden years of racing, of
Calumet Farm's glory and of great horses like Citation, Kelso, Dr.
Fager and Secretariat, and he later helped to create a museum in
Saratoga Springs, where their history would be assured.
</P>
<P>
   After a 22-year career as the turf editor of Sports Illustrated
and five more years as turf editor of Classic magazine, he spent
eight years as president of the National Museum of Racing across
Union Avenue from Saratoga Race Course. Then he spent 10 more years
as chairman, supervising a major expansion and new directions for
both the museum and the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Tower was born in Roslyn, N.Y., on June 30, 1923, the son of
Roderick and Flora Payne Whitney Tower. He was a grandson of
Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, founder of the Whitney Museum, and of
Charlemagne Tower, president of the Duluth and Iron Range Railroad
and U.S. ambassador to Germany, Austria and Russia. He was a
great-great-grandson of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, the
railroad tycoon and founder of the family dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Whitney Tower attended St. George's School in
Newport, R.I., and Harvard College, graduating in 1945 with a
bachelor's degree in English. During World War II, he served in the
Army Air Forces, flying reconnaissance missions over North Africa,
Italy and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   He turned to journalism in 1948 as a sports reporter on The
Cincinnati Enquirer. Then in 1954 he became turf editor of the new
Sports Illustrated magazine, covering racing events around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   He won the Thoroughbred Racing Association award for magazine
writing in 1967 and the Eclipse Award for magazine writing in 1976
and 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was from the old school,'' George Plimpton, the writer and
editor, recalled Thursday. ``I've seen pictures of him in top hat
attending the races. There was a certain elegance in his style. I
remember that Sports Illustrated used to invite famous writers to
go to the Kentucky Derby and write their impressions. John Marquand
and William Faulkner did it one year, and I recall that Faulkner
wrote his story on Western Union paper. And Whitney was always put
in charge of the care and feeding of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Tower was also the author of two books: ``The Art of Race
Riding,'' with Eddie Arcaro, and ``Saratoga, The Place and the
People.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Lucy Niblack Lyle Tower, he is survived by six
children: a daughter, Aurora, and a son, Alfred; and, from his
first marriage, to Frances Cheston, by two sons, Whitney Jr. and
Harry Payne, and two daughters, Alexandra Thorne and Frances
Thacher. His first marriage ended in divorce, as did his second
marriage, to Joan Baker Spear Elisofon. &QL;

   &UR; KISSER GETS TOSSED &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Madame Molotova &LR; , self-proclaimed expert on the art of kissing,
was thrown out of the Bridal Faire in San Francisco last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Molotova, to be perfectly honest, was going around talking up
her Borders lecture on ``The Art of Kissing.'' The bouncers told
her she had to leave because she couldn't hawk her own product
without having rented a booth.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Molotova was outraged to find exhibits about
limousines, dresses and invitations but ``no mention of sex at the
entire Faire.'' ``Why do people get married?'' she asked. ``Is it
simply to go shopping?''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Couples interested in doing more than shopping together
might take a look at ``How to Do It: Guides to Good Living for
Renaissance Italians'' (University of Chicago; $27.50), in which
 &UR; Rudolph &LR;   &UR; Bell  &LR; shares an ancient prescription for inspiring female
arousal: Take 90 grubs and toss them into a liter of olive oil, let
this steep in the sun for a week and then rub it on the body of the

ROBERT SCOTT, MEDAL OF HONOR WINNER, DIES AT 85  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Texas )   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Col. Robert S. Scott, who as a junior Army officer won the Medal
of Honor in World War II for beating back a Japanese counterattack
in the battle for an airstrip in the Solomon Islands and killing 28
enemy soldiers, despite being wounded twice, died on Feb. 5 at his
home in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of July 1943, Scott, then a second lieutenant,
came ashore on the heavily defended main island of New Georgia in
the Central Solomons with the 172d Regiment of the untested 43d
Infantry Division.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months earlier, he had a harrowing experience even before
stepping foot on Pacific soil. While approaching the harbor at the
island of Espiritu Santo near Guadalcanal, his troopship, the
President Coolidge, hit a mine and sank. Scott was picked up by a
boat, and virtually everyone aboard was saved, although all the
equipment was lost.
</P>
<P>
   In midsummer 1943, Scott and his men had their first taste of
combat in some of the worst terrain of the Pacific campaign, dense
New Georgia jungle clinging to hillsides with 9,000 Japanese
defenders hiding in superbly camouflaged pillboxes.
</P>
<P>
   The objective of the 45,000-man invasion force _ three Army
divisions and marines _ was to capture the Munda Point airstrip,
which was needed as a base for Marine fighter planes that would
escort heavy bombers on their run to the Japanese stronghold of
Rabaul.
</P>
<P>
   Over four weeks, the troops made slow progress in reaching the
airstrip, seven miles from the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, Scott's platoon was bogged down in front of a
hilltop overlooking the airstrip. He advanced with his exhausted
troops, urging them on in the face of rifle and machine-gun fire.
He had pushed forward to a point midway across a hilltop, 75 yards
from Japanese defenders, when enemy troops emerged from dugouts
firing and throwing grenades. Suddenly, Scott found himself alone,
the soldiers with him having withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   He crouched behind a tree stump, blasted away with his carbine
and threw grenades. He continued to fight despite suffering a
bullet wound in the left hand and a painful shrapnel wound in the
head after his carbine had been shot from his hand.
</P>
<P>
   He hurled about 30 grenades at the Japanese dugouts, finally
forcing the enemy to withdraw. His fellow troops then captured the
hill and found 28 Japanese dead in the bunkers that Scott had
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   American forces took the airstrip on Aug. 5, and a week later
the Seabees expanded it to accommodate Marine fighters.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1944, Scott received the Medal of Honor, the
military's highest award for valor.
</P>
<P>
   But success in the New Georgia campaign came at a heavy cost.
More than 1,100 U.S. troops were killed, among them another Medal
of Honor winner, a sergeant from the 37th Infantry Division whose
destruction of a Japanese machine-gun nest would be recounted in
one of World War II's best-known patriotic songs, Frank Loesser's
``The Ballad of Rodger Young.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sheldon Scott was born in Washington, the son of a
doctor, and moved to Albuquerque, N.M., with his family as a
youngster. He graduated from the University of New Mexico in 1937
with a degree in English, was drafted in September 1941 and
obtained a commission.
</P>
<P>
   Scott remained in Pacific combat after the New Georgia campaign,
then was discharged from the Army after the war. He re-enlisted in
1947, served in the Korean War and remained in the service until
retiring as a colonel in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the New Mexico Legislature proclaimed Scott's birthday,
Nov. 30, as Robert Scott Day. But Colonel Scott's son, James, of
Weatherford, Texas, who survives him with three grandsons, said his
father did not seek any public plaudits for his Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't talk about it,'' James Scott said. ``He disliked it
when people regarded him as a hero. He felt he had a job to do, and
he did it.''

LEONARD MINTZ, DOCTOR WHO WROTE ON EATING DISORDERS, DIES AT 72 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa.)  By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ira Leonard Mintz, a child psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who
wrote extensively on eating disorders afflicting children, died on
Tuesday at his home in Closter, N.J. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Mintz, who had his private practice in Englewood, N.J., was a
supervising child psychoanalyst at the Columbia University
Psychoanalytic Training Center and an associate clinical professor
of psychiatry at the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry.
He retired about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He edited three basic textbooks for specialists and medical
students: ``Fear of Being Fat: The Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa
and Bulimia,'' ``Psychosomatic Symptoms: Psychodynamic Treatment of
the Underlying Personality Disorder'' and ``Psychodynamic Technique
in the Treatment of Eating Disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Paterson, N.J., Mintz studied at Brooklyn College
before being drafted into the Army Air Forces toward the end of
World War II. He obtained his medical degree at New York University
College of Medicine in 1950 and trained at Bellevue Psychiatric
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He received his adult psychoanalytic training at Columbia and
completed his studies in child psychiatry at the New York
University Psychoanalytic Institute. He served as deputy chief of
psychiatry at the United States Public Health Service Hospital in
Stapleton, N.Y., early in his career. Returning to Columbia, he
started as a lecturer at the College of Physicians and Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   Mintz is survived by his wife of 42 years, Nancy Donnenfeld
Mintz; two daughters, Susan Berger of Englewood and Karen Mintz of
New Hope, Pa.; a son, Robert, of Pennington, N.J.; a sister, Diane
Klein of Woodmere, N.Y.; and four grandchildren.

Sheet music for ``Lift Every Voice and Sing,'' written by James
Weldon Johnson. Since Aristotle, and on through Newton, Baudelaire
and Scriabin, progressive thinkers have linked the aural sensation
of music to the visual sensation of color. But is the color of the
composer ever audibly discernible? The distinguished American
mezzo-soprano Florence Quivar explores that question Sunday
afternoon, when she and the pianist Wayne Sanders present a recital
of art songs by black composers at the 92d Street Y. (Chester

ROSIE-PEREZ-FILMS, 2-11 -- Rosie Perez poses for a portrait at
Tillies a cafe in Brooklyn. Perez has built an improbable acting
career, which began with a chance encounter with the director Spike
Lee, on being pretty much what she is: an intense, voluble,
working-class Puerto Rican from Brooklyn who is indelibly from her
own unfashionable patch of turf. In her new film, ``The 24-Hour
Woman,'' written and directed by Nancy Savoca, she plays a familiar
character but with a twist. (Andrea Mohin/New York Times Photo)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At 2:30, Mark Bittner peeked through his window
shades, sure that the parrots would arrive for an afternoon visit
at any minute.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:31, they showed up, 50 birds announcing their presence with
authority, squawking and singing and flapping so that the whole
neighborhood knew that the wild green parrots of Telegraph Hill
were about to swoop down on the ivy-choked mirror plant outside
Bittner's front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really feisty today,'' Bittner said as he grabbed a
sunflower seeds from a 50-pound bag to throw into the bowl on his
porch.
</P>
<P>
   After more than five years, the parrots' visits with Bittner run
like clockwork. But they still stop traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The parrots and Bittner, who calls himself ``a friend of the
flock,'' have become such local celebrities that they are mentioned
at length in the city's newest tourist guide and are the subjects
of a documentary and a children's book that are both in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when The San Francisco Examiner reported on the front
page that Bittner would be moving away in the next several months _
the owners of the cottage where he has been living for 10 years
want to renovate it _ there was an outpouring of dismay and
concern. Bittner, swamped with calls and e-mail from fans of the
flock, was prompted to reassure the world that the birds would be
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are wild,'' he wrote in his online journal, The Flock
Report (www.wildparrot.com). ``They are strong ... they are
parrots.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, at a fund-raiser for the documentary about the flock
and their friend, San Francisco formally declared Feb. 11 to be
Wild Parrot Day, while officials from the Commission of Animal
Control and Welfare were beginning discussions on how the birds
will be handled once Bittner moves.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if San Francisco is the only city in the country
with wild exotic birds. Flocks of wild parrots or parakeets inhabit
Chicago, parts of Florida and Austin, Texas, to name a few. San
Francisco itself is home to an older colorful flock of about 20
canary-winged parakeets.
</P>
<P>
   But the city has embraced the parrots like a wide-eyed child,
relishing the sight of a flock of tropical birds that came from who
knows where as they munch blackberries, loquats and pine nuts in a
hidden hillside neighborhood and gather on an ivy-covered porch to
eat from a man's hands, stand on his head and perch on his
shoulders, wrists and arms.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Irving, an award-winning local filmmaker, began hearing
about Mark Bittner and the parrots at least four years ago but did
not start filming them until recently. ``The stories finally
reached a critical mass,'' she said. ``I knew I had to meet him,
and it's been such fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Bittner, a 47-year-old sometime guitarist and odd-jobber, seems
surprised at all the fuss. He came to know the parrots by accident,
when he set out a feeder to attract scrubjays on a warm day in
October 1993. He had first noticed the parrots in 1989, when there
were only four in the flock: a mated pair and their offspring. By
1994, he and his neighbors were counting 26. How these South
American parrots ended up here is a mystery. The original two were
wearing quarantine bands (suggesting that they had been released by
importers or had escaped from them), and so were some of the later
ones.
</P>
<P>
   They are obviously not all related: at last count, there are 43
cherry-headed conures, one mitred conure (with a half-red,
half-green head), one blue-crowned conure and five
mitred-cherry-head hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Bittner has spent a great deal of time documenting the parrots'
social structure and, not least, taking in sick and injured birds.
In his spartan cottage, the living room is given over to two giant
cages where he keeps four former members of the flock who could no
longer keep pace. All had come down with a pigeon virus that had
sapped their ability to fly, although one, Mingus, is healthy
enough to return to the wild and has simply resisted doing so.
(When Bittner brought him outside to have a newspaper photo taken,
Mingus flew back inside at the first chance.)
</P>
<P>
   Those four will go with him when he moves from San Francisco; he
is not sure to where. As for the others, he has made peace with
saying goodbye, even to his favorite, Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to get some distance from them so I can write,'' he
said, He is working on a book, which he plans to call ``Tales From
an Urban Jungle: The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill.''

GIDEON RAFAEL, A FOUNDER OF THE ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTRY, DIES AT
85

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Gideon Rafael, a founder of the Israeli Foreign
Ministry and one of its most accomplished and longest-serving
diplomats, died on Wednesday in Jerusalem. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that began before Israel was established in 1948,
Rafael negotiated with the Nazis to send Jews to Palestine, served
at the United Nations and in Europe and conducted secret contacts
with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Berlin in 1913, Rafael left Germany after Hitler's rise
to power and immigrated to British-ruled Palestine in 1934. In 1940
he was sent to Europe by the Haganah, the Jewish armed force in
Palestine, to negotiate the rescue of 40,000 German Jews. He met in
Italian-controlled Rhodes with a representative of Adolf Eichmann,
the Nazi official, to discuss a plan to send Jews to Palestine
through a transit camp on the island. The scheme failed when Italy
entered World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After serving with the British Army in the war, Rafael joined
the political department of the Jewish Agency, where he worked in
intelligence and directed efforts to recover Jewish property lost
in Europe. In 1947, he was a member of the Jewish Agency delegation
to the United Nations when the General Assembly voted to partition
Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. After Israel declared
independence in May 1948, he founded its Foreign Ministry in Tel
Aviv with Moshe Sharett, the first foreign minister of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``So three of us became the Foreign Ministry, Sharett, myself
and the secretary,'' he recalled in an interview last year. ``Our
assignment was to send out the pronouncement of the birth of
Israel. At 2 a.m. on May 15, we sent the driver to the post office
with the telegrams. He came back, saying the clerk would not accept
them without payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I started my first diplomatic mission, to convince him that
the State of Israel can give instructions. He said he would accept
them only from the British. By 3 a.m. we found the man appointed by
Britain to handle the transition. He wrote a note approving the
expense, and Israel's birth was pronounced to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafael became an adviser to the Israeli delegation to the United
Nations, and from 1953 to 1957 he was in charge of Middle Eastern
and U.N. affairs at the Foreign Ministry, conducting secret
contacts with Arab officials. He maintained those contacts into the
'70s, working on problems like the future of Jerusalem and of the
Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael was Israel's representative at the United Nations during
that war. Earlier, he had been the envoy to Belgium, the European
Community and U.N. organizations in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   After working as director-general of the Foreign Ministry from
1968 to 1972, he was ambassador to Britain from 1973 to 1978, when
he retired.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael published an autobiography, ``Destination Peace _ Three
Decades of Israeli Foreign Policy'' (Weidenfeld &AMP; Nicholson, 1981).
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Nurit; three children, Amnon, Michal and
Ruth; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

GYMNASTS AT CAL POLY POMONA FOR PAN AM TRIALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of the nation's best female gymnasts, including Vanessa
Atler, Jamie Dantzscher and Tabitha Yim of Charter Oak Gymnastics,
will gather this weekend at Cal Poly Pomona for the Pan American
Games Trials.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are six spots on the team that will represent the
United States this summer in Winnipeg. Many of the same gymnasts
likely will compete for the U.S. at the Sydney 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's event will feature 31 gymnasts in the Junior
International Division at 7 p.m. The Senior International Division,
showcasing 37 gymnasts, is scheduled for Sunday at 2 p.m. at
Kellogg Gym.
</P>
<P>
   The format calls for one round of all-around competition per
division of optional exercises only. The top six all-around scores
-- the total of all four apparatus -- of any age-eligible gymnast,
regardless of division, will comprise the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gymnasts coming in from all over the country,'' said
promotions director Anna Furman of SCATS Gymnastics, the host club
for the Trials. ``Basically, it will be a chance to see the best in
women's gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   Meet director Don Peters, also the director for SCATS, said both
sessions will feature top-flight talent, despite the junior and
senior designations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is that because of the junior tag for Saturday's
meet, I think people see that and automatically think it's a lesser
event,'' Peters said. ``But there's a lot of kids in that session
that have a really good shot. I will go out on a limb and predict
that some of those kids will make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the gymnasts competing are three who train at Charter Oak
Gymnastics in Covina; Atler, of Canyon Country, Dantzscher, a San
Dimas High student, and Yim, of Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Atler, ranked No.2 in the country after finishing as runner-up
U.S. National Champion in 1998-99, held the country's top spot in
1997-98 and was the U.S. Junior National Champion in 1996-97. She
will compete in Sunday's competition.
</P>
<P>
   Dantzscher, also a Sunday competitor, is ranked No.9 overall and
is a current U.S. national team member. Yim, 13, who joined Charter
Oak two months ago, will compete in Saturday's session.
</P>
<P>
   The other notable entry from Southern California is Jeanette
Antolin, who trains at SCATS in Huntington Beach and is ranked No.6
in the nation.

A LONG, LONG, LONG DAY BEFORE THE VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Utah, Mass., Mont., W.Va., Fla.)   (af)  
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``I'm okay, but my butt's getting flat,'' said Sen.
Frank Murkowski who is big and bluff like his home state of Alaska.
``It's an awful long day,'' he said, lumbering back to the trial
cloister as the impeachment deliberation hours dwindled toward a
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Down the corridor, Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah sounded vaguely
like someone trapped in a building: ``I'm doing just fine. I drink
lots of water and move around a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   There were moments Thursday when the Capitol countdown to the
verdict in President Clinton's impeachment trial offered all the
historic aura of a bus terminal. As on other recent days, waiting
bystanders were more likely to quote not the founding fathers but
Richard D. Llamas, the unemployed carpenter arrested a week ago
when he rose in the gallery and shouted down to the senators: ``God
almighty, take the vote and get it over with!''
</P>
<P>
   Lingering in his Senate hideaway after a formal trial recess,
Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts sat in a wing chair and slowly
described the court scene. ``It's going on and on,'' he said. ``And
on and on,'' he continued, the ``on'' sounding a New England-nasal
dirge. ``And on and on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   With a can of Diet Coke resting on his thigh, the senator sat
back and wondered about his court colleagues. ``I hope thesecret
doesn't leak out that I'm not down there,'' he said, fully masking
any regret.
</P>
<P>
   In a passing corridor scene, Sen. Conrad Burns of Montana asked
no one in particular, ``What is today? The eleventh?'' He was
signing a Senate autograph sheet for a tourist clearly wise in the
provenance requirements of marketable historic artifacts. ``It was
my day on the treadmill,'' the senator mused happily as he signed,
speaking of aerobics, not impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia
first said no, then yes when asked if the task grew tedious. ``It
is tedious if you look at it minute to minute,'' he conceded, ``but
not in terms of its historic meaning. The deal is either he's
thrown out of office or he's not: That's all that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1868, when the Senate court wrestled through long and
doubt-crazed deliberations for the barest one-vote acquittal
verdict in President Andrew Johnson's impeachment, the waiting
period was excruciating and a source of great enterprise among
newspaper correspondents and other Capitol workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wagers figuring up an enormous total were laid on the issue,''
Francis A. Richardson, a trial correspondent, later recalled of the
tense speculations about the momentous question of whether the
nation would see its president banished from office.
</P>
<P>
   Without benefit of focus group or public opinion poll, W.W.
Johnson, a presidential secretary, won thousands of dollars when
Johnson ``escaped by the skin of his teeth,'' in the regretful
words of one his antagonists, Sen. Charles Sumner.
</P>
<P>
   Today, no one in the Capitol was offering even long-shot
perfecta odds against the widely anticipated verdict of acquittal
in Clinton's trial. The only really open question stirred not a
sous of action: whether the Senate Republicans, considered certain
to fall short of the necessary 67 votes to oust Clinton, might
embarrass House Republican prosecutors further by not mustering
even a simple majority on either impeachment article.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aftermath will be the aftermath; I'm not really concerned
about it,'' said one Republican, Connie Mack of Florida, sounding
more than ready to let the chips fall.
</P>
<P>
   The day was beautiful outside the Capitol, a balmy foretaste of
spring. Six hours after first gathering, a few senators emerged
into the sunlight on a coffee break to wander and stare, as if in
deliberation of life's undeniable power to regenerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but like Bill Clinton,'' admitted Burns, as he
walked past the television camera pen on the Capitol lawn, talking
gently. ``I mean, just think had this thing not come along in his
presidency _ the talent he had has pretty much been squandered. And
that's the real sadness of the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator did not discuss his eventual verdict as he ruminated
on finding himself and his colleagues in the extraordinary position
of settling the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got a feeling the Senate's here not to be a weathervane
but a compass,'' he said, lingering beyond the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we followed the Constitution as the founders would
have us,'' Burns said in a hopeful tone, addressing the fact that
there is more than one politician's legacy at stake in the
impeachment test. ``I think the founders are still speaking to us
today. You get a feeling every now and then that we will test the
generations to follow us on (italics)their(end italics) degree of
dedication that we are a land of laws and not of men.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator suddenly laughed out loud. ``I ran for the office
and everything that goes with it,'' he said as time ran out on his
break from the trial. ``And we've got it all _ the good, the bad,
the ugly.''

   It dazzles the elite who gather annually atop the snowy hills of
Davos, and it defies gravity in the canyons of Wall Street. It's
America's supercharged economy. But according to a new book by
Edward Luttwak, the machine has become excessively lean and mean.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Turbo Capitalism: Winners and Losers in the Global
Economy'' (Harper Collins, $26), Luttwak acknowledges that the
American-led free market is creating lots of new wealth. But he
argues that such an economy _ highly privatized, deregulated and in
the midst of globalization _ also brings peril.
</P>
<P>
   This unfettered American capitalism of the last decade doesn't
travel well, he writes. Yet it is spreading to other countries,
raising the specter of financial ruin, in Asia and elsewhere, or
social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   At home, meanwhile, the turbocharged economy is moving too fast
to pick up the poor or to reassure an anxious middle class. With
the spread of downsizing, white-collar job security is vanishing,
he writes, bringing some unpleasant cultural consequences. And the
poor? They're going to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The author, whose most recent previous book is ``The Endangered
American Dream'' (1994), is not the first writer to worry in print
about post-cold war capitalism. We've read before about the
winner-take-all society, an alienated ``flexible'' work force, and
manic debt-fueled consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   But Luttwak, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, has written an original,
provocative book that takes up all these questions at once, and
more. (When did you last read about the link between economic
policy and the telling of dirty jokes?)
</P>
<P>
   Luttwak believes that some form of ``controlled'' capitalism _
like the regulated and protected American economy that lasted from
1945 to the 1980s _ is a better choice for most of the world than
the untethered variety that has held sway since the days of Ronald
Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   He includes an excellent chapter on the problems of Russian
capitalism, including a vigorous _ and perhaps necessary, he says _
mafia. Although Luttwak thinks controlled capitalism is preferable
for many countries, he does not advocate extensive regulation in
post-Communist economies like Russia's.
</P>
<P>
   It is dangerous for the United States to globalize its mostly
unregulated capitalism, he argues, because it is exported without
the two distinctly American forces that balance its power at home:
an aggressive and activist legal system and an enduring Calvinist
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Bless those infamously ``greedy'' private lawyers, he says, for
bringing lawsuits that oblige corporations to curb dangerous
products and blatant discrimination in their ranks. Bless, too, the
eager staff lawyers of the government regulatory agencies that
remain _ the tax bloodhounds, the securities-law enforcers, the
antitrust troops.
</P>
<P>
   (Without taking a stand on the current Microsoft case, Luttwak
concludes that other countries would treat a Bill Gates very
differently. Instead of answering charges in court, he would be
subsidized in Italy, protected in Japan and ``a life peer in the
House of Lords'' in Britain.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And what is capitalism without Calvinism? Trouble, Luttwak
writes, somewhat cynically.
</P>
<P>
   In America, earned wealth is still viewed as virtuous
accomplishment, says the author, a native of Romania who was
educated in Europe and the United States. But the rich, he says,
must not enjoy themselves too much. (Frequent seminars at Aspen are
O.K.; frequent romps on the Riviera are not.) Limiting conspicuous
consumption legitimizes wealth, according to Luttwak, and cuts down
on envy and ``its political and even violent expressions.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvinism, with its emphasis on self-reliance, also persuades
the unsuccessful in America to blame themselves, not the system. In
other nations, people tend to be less quiescent when a huge gap
opens between rich and poor, he observes.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the unfettered economy is creating
breathtaking efficiencies, the author notes. But the ``creative
destruction'' of outmoded industries is happening too quickly for
all the displaced employees to be re-absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a myth that the Microsofts and Intels of the world will
create enough new jobs, he argues, even if all laid-off workers
could be retrained for them.
</P>
<P>
   Luttwak supplies statistics showing the widening gap between the
nation's rich and poor, a theme he has struck before. For most
Americans, wage increases are held in check in part because
monetarism has become a religion in America, Luttwak argues, with
central bankers playing God and any hint of inflation demonized.
</P>
<P>
   His most provocative theory, although a stretch, holds that the
current ultra-free-market economy is creating an ``illiberal
democracy'': Displacing its economic resentment onto others,
middle-class America is clamoring for stricter laws and harsher
sentences, including the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellious (non-Calvinist) poor, he writes, are being
conveniently locked away under harsh anti-drug laws. And an
increasingly anxious middle class is embracing new Calvinist
``prohibitions'' _ against overeating and other unhealthy
pleasures, against flirting in the office or telling off-color
jokes. Only shopping is safe from censure, he notes wryly.
</P>
<P>
   Luttwak offers few solutions, but he does call for the return of
some regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations are not moral entities,'' he writes; ``they exist
to earn profits, and so it should be.'' So governments, Luttwak
says, should temper capitalism ``on behalf of the citizens they are
supposed to equally represent.''

 &HT;    They still love this game
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All in all, the first week of NBA action was
faaaan-tastic. OK, there was lots of shoddy play _ a fallout of the
protracted labor dispute, no doubt. But the fans came out, at
least, which was reason for commissioner David Stern to sit on high
in New York with a smile of contentment and relief.
</P>
<P>
   No one quite knew what to expect of the product or the reception
to the league that started three months late because of the
owner-imposed lockout. But many arenas around the league were
filled to capacity, with the aid of cheap-ticket promotions, and
the television networks that broadcast the games have been
satisfied with viewership. So far.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the NBA, which had never lost any games to labor strife,
seems on its way back to prominence. En route to that position,
however, it appears that one of the projected lockout backlashes is
coming to a frightening fruition.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries piled up during the brief but demanding training camps
and in the first week of the season. Whether it was because players
were so out of shape that their bodies went into shock from the
rigors of NBA-level basketball is hard to determine.
</P>
<P>
   The names were significan, too: Latrell Sprewell (five weeks),
Voshon Leonard (two months), Glen Rice (five weeks), Anthony Mason
(season), Jamal Mashburn (two weeks) and Ron Mercer (one week),
plus Joe Dumars, Lawrence Funderburke, Walter McCarty, Will Perdue,
Scott Williams and Anthony Peeler.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a fear of everyone's,'' Cleveland forward Johnny
Newman said. ``But it's really something you can't avoid at this
point. Injuries are a part of the game. You just hope that they are
limited. No one wants to see another player go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's televised doubleheader on NBC drew a 5.5 average
rating, up 20 percent from last season's average. The first three
games carried by TNT were up 17 percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although NBA buildings were 93 percent sold, just under the 94
percent at this stage last season, a few attendance trends could be
alarming.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls sold out their home opener against the Hawks, but
without Michael Jordan they drew less than 7,000 in Los Angeles on
opening night against the Clippers. It's their first non-sellout on
the road since March 18, 1995 _ the game before Jordan made his
return from his journey into baseball. What will happen in other
cities _ Washington, New Jersey, Detroit, Philadelphia, Miami _
that sold out buildings inconsistently, but always when Jordan
came?
</P>
<P>
   And Phoenix, a longtime model franchise for the smaller-market
teams, had its first non-sellout in nearly nine years _ 390 games.
</P>
<P>
   To head off any significant dropoff, the NBA dropped the lowest
ticket prices around the league to $10 and has encouraged teams to
be more market savvy. The league even jumped into the fray,
launching a special Valentine's Day program that features greeting
cards signed by NBA players, print and electronic direct mail to
700,000 people worldwide and a television commercial that runs
nationally throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together with our players, we're inviting fans back to NBA
basketball and letting them know they're appreciated,'' Rick Welts,
the league's chief marketing officer and president of NBA
Properties, said in a release.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300,000 ``Happy Valentine's Day'' cards are being sent by
mail this week from all 29 NBA teams and the league office. The
team cards _ signed by NBA players, coaches, general managers, and
owners _ are headed to all season-ticket holders and team business
partners. Stern signs all cards from the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge for all teams to appeal to the fans after the
lockout,'' Hawks executive vice president Lee Douglas said. ``It's
uncharted waters, but it's exciting, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said for all of the action. Players such as
Sacramento's Chris Webber, the Lakers' Kobe Bryant and Shaquille
O'Neal, and Utah's Karl Malone have been brilliant. And rookies
Paul Pierce of Boston and Jason Williams of Sacramento have shown
star appeal. But the pace of the games _- especially in the East _
has been slow and sometimes unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens said it'll take about 10 games before
many coaches find their player rotations and teams find their
rhythm. Until then, Miami coach Pat Riley said, ``The way to take
care of some of the sloppy play right now is we will slow it down
to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has not driven its game down the fans' throats _ yet.
But make no mistake: The billion-dollar marketing machine is in
motion.

 &HT;    Tech's prankster: Practical jokes par for course with Kuchar
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gentleman Matt Kuchar, the man whose smile in the
endorsement world is worth perhaps as much as his golf swing, has
another side.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Georgia Tech star, already touted as the next
David Duval or Tiger Woods, is an all-world practical joker. He
can't be trusted, even as far as he can hit his pitching wedge.
</P>
<P>
   The man who won the 1997 U.S. Amateur and finished as the low
amateur in last year's Masters and U.S. Open might just sneak onto
the Augusta National course some night and move a few tee markers
or change some pin placements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never ending. It's nonstop. It's unbelievable,'' Tech
golf coach Bruce Heppler said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar begins his junior year of college golf with his Tech
teammates at the Big Island Invitational this weekend in Kona,
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Heppler should have known what he was in for the day Kuchar
called him from his home in Lake Mary, Fla., to tell him where he
had decided to accept a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I've got bad news, Coach. I made a list of the pros
and cons of all the schools and Georgia Tech didn't come out on
top. Duke did.' After a pause, he said, `But I'm coming to Tech
anyway.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since Kuchar arrived, Heppler's life hasn't been the same, and
he's glad _ about 90 percent of the time. Recently, Heppler was
sitting in his office talking to Kuchar when a reporter called for
an interview with the player. When Heppler handed over the phone,
Kuchar told the reporter that Kuchar was in class, then conducted a
40-minute interview posing as Heppler.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some great quotes about himself,'' the coach said. ``He
told the guy what a great player he was, but also told him, `Matt's
a better person than he is a player.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Other Kuchar moves include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Unscrewing the light bulb in the dorm bathroom and putting
cellophane over the toilet seats. ``Sometimes there's an awful mess
in there,'' Heppler says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Short-sheeting Heppler's bed during a tournament in Puerto
Rico when the two were rooming together. ``He told me he had
nothing to do with it, (that) four other players came in and did it
and he tried to stop them but was outnumbered.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Pointing the shower heads in the dorm at such an angle that
the unsuspecting bather gets it in the face when he turns on the
water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Putting scotch tape over the spray hose on the kitchen sink so
when someone tries to use it, they get soaked.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gluing shut his teammates' dorm and motel doors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sneaking into the locker room during a tournament in which
both Tech and Georgia participated, finding a UGA bag and writing
``Georgia Tech'' and ``Yellow Jackets'' on all of the golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Switching roommate Wes Latimer's golf bag, so when he appeared
for a qualifying tournament, Latimer had the wrong bag and was
fined. It rained, and, Heppler said, ``When (Latimer) finished, he
looked like a wet dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt's got this wig,'' his coach said. ``It's kind of a hippy
wig, real stringy, that hangs down in his eyes. He wore it to study
hall the other night, and one of the academic counselors was
working with him, and he said, `Hey, man, have you ever worn your
hair like this? I love it, but it gets in my eyes.' The counselor
didn't know who it was. He swears he's going to wear that wig in
the Hawaiian tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sometimes, the victims strike back. When Kuchar went
to get in his car one recent morning, all four tires were flat and
the valve stems were missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was mad,'' Heppler said. ``He doesn't take a joke very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   BIG ISLAND INVITATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   _ What: A college golf tournament for 24 teams from around the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: The 6,594-yard, par-72 Kings Golf Course and the
6,566-yard, par-70 Beach Golf Course in Kona, Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   _ When: Through Saturday
</P>
<P>
   _ Who: Field includes six teams ranked in the top 25, including
No. 6 Georgia Tech and defending NCAA champion UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ga. Tech team: Matt Kuchar, Bryce Molder, Carlton Forrester,
Wes Latimer, Kris Mikkelsen.

 &HT;    IOC tries to stroke sponsors
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The International Olympic Committee's marketing arm
shifted into crisis management mode Thursday, with new revelations
of still more palm-greasing in Salt Lake City as a backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, head of the IOC's internal bribery probe, portrayed
the corporate sponsor family as supportive, but the bankrollers of
the Games appear edgy and on the verge of splintering.
</P>
<P>
   As public opinion polls showed serious damage to the Olympic
brand _ and with at least one sponsor refusing to buy TV
advertising time and yanking the five rings off the company annual
report _ the IOC called family members to the table in Manhattan to
buck up sagging spirits over their multimillion-dollar pledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still a fabulous investment,'' Pound, who negotiates key
television and marketing deals, said during a media conference call
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all of the 11 global companies that make up The
Olympic Partner program (TOP) are so certain. And with only two
having renewed their four-year tickets past the 2000 Sydney Games,
the group has leverage at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola and Sports Illustrated/Time have re-upped through 2008
and 2004, respectively. And SEMA Group has stepped in to replace
IBM as the technology sponsor from 2001 through 2008. But
negotiations have ground to a halt, or have yet to begin, for the
eight remaining corporations that collectively pumped $500 million
into the Games this quadrennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a whole, the sponsors have said as soon as this thing can
be cleaned up we will go forward, but it seems to be going in the
other direction,'' said Merrill Squires, a Dallas-based sports
marketing consultant, who spent 12 years managing Sports
Illustrated's worldwide Olympic marketing program. ``I think
they've got to feel very comfortable that Sydney is not going to
become a target of the next major investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors were expected to exert pressure at the Manhattan
meeting on Pound, who is considered the IOC marketing expert, and
Michael Payne, the IOC's staff marketing director, to persuade IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who believe (that) until a change at the top
is made you won't see a change in the direction of the Olympic
Games as a business and an entity,'' said Squires, who has served
on the IOC's sponsor advisory group.
</P>
<P>
   Pound insisted Samaranch needs to lead the charge to re- form.
``This is a problem that he acknowledges has arisen on his watch
and has become a serious problem. He wants to make sure it is dealt
with and cleaned up.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound downplayed sponsors' concerns. ``The sponsors have been
very supportive of our effort to date to clean up this problem,''
he said. ``There is nobody that has withdrawn. They say, `We
understand you have problems, we appreciate what you are doing to
clean it up, and we are supportive of your efforts to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The only outspoken critic among the sponsors has been David
D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
His company is canceling negotiations with NBC for $20 million in
ads, to protest the IOC's handling of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro said John Hancock will remove the Olympic rings
from its annual report, company stationery and certain venues.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said he thinks D'Alessandro is only trying to help the IOC
by keeping up pressure on the committee to deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   He also said such tactics are not necessary. He said the IOC
hoped to clean up the scandal fallout by its meeting in June, when
the host city for the 2006 Winter Games is selected. ``What we
don't know about is how the pace of these government investigations
will proceed,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department and the federal General Accounting
Office also are investigating the Salt Lake City bribery
allegations and have yet to release findings.

 &HT;    New challenger for Gordon
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ For four years, NASCAR has waited eagerly
for someone to step forward and halt Jeff Gordon's dominance of
Winston Cup racing.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1999 season opens with Sunday's Daytona 500, NASCAR
might have found its answer in rookie Tony Stewart. Like Gordon,
the two-time defending Winston Cup champion, Stewart is a veteran
of open-wheel racing.
</P>
<P>
   Both are products of the United States Auto Club, and both will
start on the front row Sunday. Stewart will be in the No. 20
Pontiac of owner Joe Gibbs, the former coach of the NFL's
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who turns 28 on May 20, earned the outside pole with
the second-fastest average speed in last week's first-round
qualifying, at 194.599 mph. He covered the 2.5-mile oval of Daytona
International Speedway only .468 seconds slower than Gordon, who
already has 42 victories in six full Cup seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to have Tony on the front row,'' said Gordon,
who will be 28 on Aug. 4. ``I remember him when I was running
midgets and sprint cars. I remember hearing Tony's name a lot and
knew he was really going to be a great race-car driver. It's great
to see him here. I think it's a great asset to NASCAR Winston Cup
racing to have him in this series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daytona 500 will be Stewart's first Winston Cup race after
starting 27 Busch Grand National events during the past two seasons
while still running a full Indy Racing League schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the 1997 IRL champion and third-place finisher in
points last year, certainly has been on the front row before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been preparing for this for 20 years,'' he said, ``so
even though it will be my first Winston Cup race, it's not as
though I haven't been in this sort of a position before. I started
on the pole in my first Indianapolis 500, and I've been on the pole
in a couple of Busch races.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart will be the first driver to start on the front row in
his first Winston Cup race since Kenny Irwin, the '98 rookie of the
year, started second at Richmond on Sept. 9, 1997. Mike Skinner was
a rookie when he won the pole for the '97 Daytona 500, but he
already had started several Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to figure out how to mount a pen and a pad
of paper in the car so every time I learn something, I can write it
down and not forget,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got plenty of reasons to be patient,'' he said, ``because
I want to be here for a long time. I want to show the other drivers
and teams that I want to be here for a long time. I don't want to
be the guy that causes a 20-car pileup on Sunday, so you're going
to see me be real patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who started on the second row at Daytona as a rookie six
years ago, says he knows what Stewart should expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of reminds me of '93 when I was a rookie,'' Gordon
said. ``I hope that he doesn't get the schooling I got from (Dale)
Earnhardt, because I went from second to fifth in about two laps. I
told Tony he's going to learn quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gordon might learn if he finally has a challenger.

 &HT;    Earnhardt sends message
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ ``The Intimidator'' might have some
intimidation left after all.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt won the second 125-mile qualifying race Thursday
and will start fourth in Sunday's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who won last year's Daytona 500 but failed to find
victory lane in the next 32 races, says he's ready to challenge
pole-sitter Jeff Gordon in the Winston Cup season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any more questions?'' Earnhardt asked reporters Thursday at
Daytona International Speedway. ``Save some for Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte won the first qualifying race, ending Pontiac's
18-year drought in the twin 125s, and will start third Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Winston Cup rookie Tony Stewart, who had the top
speeds in last week's first-round qualifying, will start on the
front row of the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you run a race like that, when you don't come in and get
tires and fuel, that's the best test you can have,'' said Gordon,
who placed second in the opening qualifier. ``We've got a car
capable of winning the 500.''
</P>
<P>
   But Earnhardt, who took the lead from Stewart after seven laps
and led the remaining 43, left little doubt that he'll be a factor.
Earnhardt would become Daytona's first back-to-back winner since
Sterling Marlin won consecutive 500s in 1994 and '95.
</P>
<P>
   It was Earnhardt's 10th victory in a row in the twin 125s since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come back every year thinking this is going to be the year I
lose the qualifying race, and then we go out and win it again,'' he
said. ``It's a great streak to have. I ain't seen nobody else do
it. I think it will be a while before you see it again.'' Both
qualifying races included plenty of fireworks. On the first lap of
the opening qualifier, Wally Dallenbach sparked a five-car pileup
on the first lap, knocking four cars out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured we'd at least get to the second turn before somebody
tried something crazy,'' John Andretti said.
</P>
<P>
   After the second race, 57-year-old Dave Marcis jumped out of his
No. 71 Chevrolet in the garage area and stormed after Ernie Irvan,
whom Marcis accused of trying to run him off the track. Irvan had
already left his No. 36 Pontiac. Both made the Daytona 500 field
based on qualifying speeds from earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Among those not making the field was rookie Buckshot Jones of
Tucker, who finished 21st in the first race.

 &HT;    O'Brien out to prove he's not finished

<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics,
decathlon gold medalist Dan O'Brien will perform on the Atlanta
stage when he competes in the USA Indoor Track and Field
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien is expected to tune up for the outdoor season by
entering the 60-meter hurdles and long jump at the indoor
championships Feb. 26-27 at the Georgia Dome. With a gold-medal
performance last summer at the Goodwill Games, O'Brien, 32,
re-established himself as the early decathlon favorite for the 2000
Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In July, in his only decathlon since the 1996 Games, O'Brien
tallied 8,755 points, 13th highest ever, and put to rest talk of
his demise. O'Brien has largely stepped away from the sport,
dabbling as an occasional television track analyst and playing the
role of celebrity fitness guru. His shoe sponsor, Nike, lost faith
and failed to agree on a new contract last summer.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien pronounced himself back during a promotional appearance
here Thursday, saying that his goals before retirement are winning
the gold medal in Sydney, and inthe next two world championships,
and hiking his decathlon world record above 9,000 points as early
as this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to compete and get my face out there, because I live
off of sponsorships and endorsements,'' O'Brien said. ``That's just
how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien predicted that the indoor championships will start the
drive toward the Sydney Games for many top athletes. At the same
time, organizers are promoting the meet as the legacy event from
the 1996 Games and hope to attract 15,000 fans for Saturday's
finals. The two-day meet runs in conjunction with the Georgia High
School Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien competed in indoor meets last weekend in New York and
Boston and is entered Saturday night in the Los Angeles
Invitational. He plans to run the 60-meter hurdles against a field
featuring world-leader Mark Crear, NCAA indoor champion Larry Wade
and U.S. outdoor 110-hurdle champ Reggie Torian. The televised
indoor circuit continues the following weekend with the adidas D.C.
Invitational in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the indoor championships will be the culmination
of the four-meet Golden Spike Tour. The Georgia Dome stop figures
to attract top American indoor stars because it serves as a
qualifier for the world indoor championships in Maebashi, Japan,
where O'Brien already has qualified in the heptathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Former Decatur teacher Tisha Waller, fresh from national indoor
and outdoor titles last year, will be the favorite here in the
women's high jump. The men's pole vault features American
record-setter Jeff Hartwig taking on a slew of 19-foot vaulters,
and Melissa Morrison will look to extend her winning streak in the
women's 60-meter hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   USA INDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS
</P>

BUMPER COCA CROP LEADS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT U.S.-BACKED ERADICATION
PROGRAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The U.S.-backed offensive to wipe out coca
plantations in Colombia through aerial fumigation has come under
increased scrutiny after farmers produced another bumper crop of
drugs last year.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of Colombian land devoted to the cultivation of coca,
the raw material for cocaine, increased by 28 percent to 251,446
acres, according to a report released this week by Barry McCaffrey,
the White House National Drug Policy Director.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Colombia the world's No. 1 producer of both coca
leaves and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian police pilots, supported by U.S. technicians, flew
more than 1,000 crop-dusting sorties last year and poisoned nearly
150,000 acres of coca in the largest aerial eradication program in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet farmers migrated farther into the jungle, out of reach of
the planes, and planted more coca, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Colombian officials argue that they need more aircraft
and refueling bases to fumigate drug crops in remote areas like
southern Putumayo state on the Ecuadorean border, where coca
cultivation is exploding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only strategy I can see that will attack the
source,'' said one U.S. official. ``If there had been no spraying,
what would the results be?''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say, however, that the 5-year old program is a
proven failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, the U.S. has limited resources, and the amount of
jungle that has yet to be planted with coca is huge,'' said
Winifred Tate, a Colombia expert at the Washington Office on Latin
America, a think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been (fumigating) for years, and it hasn't solved the
problem,`` added Rodrigo Losada, a political science professor at
Javeriana University in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. officials, coca production in Colombia has
steadily increased since widespread crop dusting began in 1994.
Part of the problem appears to be a so-called ``balloon effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombian drug mafias used to import tons of coca paste from
Peru and Bolivia. But crackdowns in those countries forced dealers
to consolidate cultivation and production operations in Colombia,
where huge tracts of land are dominated by Marxist rebels and
right-wing paramilitaries, McCaffrey said in a Wednesday statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is paying for the success in other regions,'' said a
diplomat based in Bogota. ``It has pushed the problem up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of anti-drug operations in Peru and Bolivia, McCaffrey
said that the potential cocaine production from the Andean region
of South America dropped for the third year in a row _ from 780
metric tons in 1995 to 550 metric tons last year.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that Colombians are growing a high-yield
variety of coca and that the country's potential cocaine production
``is likely to skyrocket over the next year or two, offsetting the
gains achieved in Peru and Bolivia.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombian police are paying a huge price for their anti-drug
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   They are unable to send in machete-wielding ground troops to
eradicate drug crops, because most of the coca is grown in areas
controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
Colombia's largest rebel organization, and right-wing
paramilitaries. Both groups earn millions of dollars annually by
taxing and protecting drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, police use about a dozen U.S.-supplied crop dusters and
support helicopters on low-flying missions that make them easy
targets for sharpshooters.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, 62 Colombian pilots or crewmen have
been killed, 102 have been injured, and 61 have been kidnapped,
according to Capt. Ricardo Blanco, a spokesman for the Colombian
police anti-narcotics unit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a U.S. State Department official predicted that the
flights eventually will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the figures show is that in areas where we are spraying,
cultivation is controlled,'' the official said. ``Putumayo is the
one area we haven't been able to touch. It's where the crop is
growing most rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Putumayo Gov. Jorge Devia said that the amount of land devoted
to coca cultivation in his state was nearly 100,000 acres. Efforts
to build a refueling base for crop dusters in Putumayo state last
year were put on hold following a fierce offensive by the FARC. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Despite the statistics on Colombian coca cultivation, which
were culled from CIA satellite photographs, many analysts expect
the Clinton administration to certify Colombia as a cooperative
partner in its annual review of global anti-drug efforts later this
month.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; McCaffrey said that the United States has received ``superb
cooperation'' from Colombia's police and military.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian President Andres Pastrana, who took office last
August, was at first critical of aerial fumigation but changed his
mind following a series of meetings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts argue that coca farmers need more incentives to
grow alternative crops. Pastrana has promised a massive rural
development program financed by international loans, government
funds and a ``peace tax`` on wealthy Colombians.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, however, is providing Colombia with just $15 million
over the next three years for crop-substitution programs, compared
to $289 million in police and military assistance this year for the
drug war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is the U.S. following a failed policy, but it is
preventing other kinds of policies from being developed,'' said
Tate, the analyst, who recently toured Colombia's coca-growing
regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give (farmers) incentives to grow other things,''
said the diplomat based in Bogota. ``I don't think anyone believes
that we should completely give up eradication. But it's got to be a
balanced approach.''

MORE SENATORS SPLITTING FROM GOP ON CLINTON VOTE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., may have
disappointed some in his party with the announcement that he would
vote to acquit President Clinton, he undoubtedly delighted his
constituents back home. Up there, they adore Clinton, and they like
their Republicans tempered and iconoclastic.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., seemed to defy his conservative
bearings when he announced that he would vote for a split verdict:
guilty on obstruction of justice, not guilty on perjury. But he
stayed true both to a maverick streak that has run through his long
political career and a role in the impeachment trial as an advocate
of compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In a process that has been marked so often by firm allegiance to
party lines, the full or partial defection of a small brigade of
Republicans was instantly riveting. But the actual ranks of
renegades were really not so surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The group grew Thursday night when Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine,
whose vote was considered difficult to predict, announced that she,
like Chafee, would vote to acquit Clinton on both articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed as she left the chamber Thursday night, Ms. Snowe
said she had reached her decision about a week ago, and was acutely
conscious that it was at odds with most of her Republican
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard when you know that most are going in one direction
and you're going in another,'' she said. But, she added, ``In these
decisions _ these tough decisions, these really difficult decisions
_ you can only do what's right and true, because I have to live
with this for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement explaining her vote, Ms. Snowe said she
had started the trial five weeks ago with ``an open notebook and an
open mind'' and came to believe that Clinton's conduct was
atrocious.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a supporter,'' she said, ``I would abandon him. If I
were a newspaper editor, I would denounce him. If I were a
historian, I would condemn him.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a senator safeguarding the good of the country, she said,
she could not conclude that he had committed, beyond a reasonable
doubt, the kinds of high crimes and misdemeanors that warranted his
expulsion from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   With Ms. Snowe's announcement, the number of Republican senators
who had said publicly that they would vote for acquittal on both
counts reached four. In addition to Ms. Snowe and Chafee, those
senators were James Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several senators said that Ms. Snowe's fellow
senator from Maine, Susan Collins, had privately indicated that she
would vote not guilty on both articles of impeachment. Ms. Collins,
however, had not made any public pronouncements. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another two Republican senators _ Gorton and Ted Stevens of
Alaska _ had said that they would vote to acquit Clinton of
perjury, and Richard Shelby of Alabama had told colleagues he would
also take that position.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snowe, Chafee and Jeffords represent a swath of New England
states that shun conservative Republicans and embrace moderates and
mavericks. Vermont has the nation's only independent congressman;
Maine has one of only two independent governors.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Snowe, Chafee and Jeffords all said they were
heeding their minds and hearts, none is likely to suffer any
backlash from voters. In fact, they would arguably have more cause
for worry if they were to vote with fellow Republicans to convict
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday night, Chafee acknowledged that calls
to his office from constituents were ``heavier on the president's
side.'' Chafee also said he did not think his Republican colleagues
in the Senate, whose positions he frequently bucks, would punish
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of us knows we have to struggle with these things,''
Chafee said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton and Specter fit a slightly different niche: senators
whose senses of themselves as particularly analytical and
thoughtful lawmakers sometimes nudge them toward contrary
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, a
nonpartisan journal, noted that Specter often revels in his
unpredictability. ``He likes to think of himself as a smart, clever
guy who doesn't go along with the crowd,'' Rothenberg noted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Specter thwarted convention with his quirky explanation
Wednesday of his position, that the case against the president was
``not proven'' _ a concept he said he borrowed from Scottish law _
because the proceeding had fallen short of a thorough trial.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said in an interview Thursday that his decision was so
carefully considered and rendered that he had written at least 10
drafts of the seven-page statement that explained it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a matter of individual conscience,'' Gorton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has flexed that conscience in maverick ways before. When
he was the state attorney general of Washington, he was one of the
first prominent Republicans in the country to recommend the
resignation of President Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   During this trial, he and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., forged
a partnership and several times recommended bipartisan compromises
to expedite the pace of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said he did not know if his vote would upset Republicans
in Washington, because he was not monitoring the responses from
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   But his intended vote to convict Clinton on at least one article
of impeachment will give him political cover. That holds true as
well for Stevens of Alaska, whose state is solidly Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens confirmed Thursday that he would render a split verdict
but declined to elaborate. Shelby did not talk about his position.

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14)
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: (AT) in the e-mail address in the last graf should be
replaced with the typographical symbol.) 
Keith G. McWalter is a lawyer, investment banker and writer who
lives in Portola Valley, Calif. 
(af) 
 By KEITH G. McWALTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I and many others like me have come to lead truly privileged
careers. Put more crassly, simply because we work for corporate
America, people like me are showered with a lot of luxury, largess
and opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   To many of us, this is sensitive ground politically and
personally _ akin to talking about one's salary. It is also a
sensitive issue for a young person entering the workplace, who may
be embarrassed, even outraged, by the derivative riches that
mainstream corporate work often confers on those who need it least.
</P>
<P>
   I remember how embarrassed I was when I first started working at
a big law firm in New York early in my career. A black man with a
shoeshine kit entered a partner's office _ where I was dutifully
scribbling down an assignment _ and started buffing the senior
lawyer's shoes. Then he offered to do mine.
</P>
<P>
   What was this, feudal France or the antebellum South? I was
sitting atop an iceberg of privilege whose size I couldn't yet
guess.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, my father worked long and hard for a series of
corporations for almost 40 years after World War II but saw little
in the way of corporate largess. As a salesman, he worked from his
car more than from an office. For him and most other white-collar
workers of his day, there were no corporate junkets to the
Caribbean or golf ``conferences'' in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   But today, for those who toil just a rung or so above his level
on the corporate ladder, a huge system of corporate welfare is at
work. And it is spreading outward across many job descriptions and
trickling ever downward through the white-collar world.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, an entire ``business class'' out there
that travels around the globe on other people's money, sits in
first class (or at least business class) on airplanes, stays in the
best hotels, dines in the best restaurants and generally enjoys a
breadth and refinement of experience that previously was available
only to industrial moguls, movie stars and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``entertainment.'' This usually involves taking
clients to an expensive restaurant or resort or treating them to
front-and-center seats at a prime sports event _ all to induce this
or that business result, even if it's just ``building a
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But while entertaining, of course, the host reaps all the
benefits of that activity himself. The scale of corporate
entertainment, much of which is still tax deductible and thus
subsidized by taxpayers, keeps some hotels, restaurants and
professional sports franchises in the black.
</P>
<P>
   Through such benefits, the business class has achieved a
sophistication of sorts, sometimes to the point of snobbishness.
One need only sit in the first-class cabin of any commercial jet to
see unearned, nouveau riche imperiousness in full flower.
</P>
<P>
   Bristling with laptops and pagers, and calling out
transcontinental directives over the phones at their seats, never
before have so many tried so hard to make their time seem so
valuable. But it is a wholly derivative form of wealth and
sophistication, and can be removed at any moment, which adds to the
rather churlish insecurity so typical of the breed.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a large and growing part of the work force is
receiving these perks. So large, in fact, that a sizable portion of
individual income probably goes unreported in the form of corporate
lifestyle subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it has spread so broadly to people who couldn't
have acquired it by themselves suggests that a powerful force is at
work in the economy, raising the level of common experience and
expectation to heights that de Toqueville could never have
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the cultural impact of this phenomenon is profoundly
materialistic. The embarrassment of riches found, say, at the
average accountants' convention in Scottsdale, Ariz., lets few
impressionable people come away without heightened expectations for
their next meal, next vacation, next car or next round of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, you can't keep 'em down on the farm after
they've seen Pebble Beach, and as the business world keeps
percolating this kind of experience through ever broader
white-collar populations, we run the risk of squeezing out
frugality, modesty and humility. &QL;

   Q: I have been a teacher of English as a Second Language in New
York City public schools for 10 years. I have also given many
training presentations to fellow teachers. After I get married in
June and move to New Jersey, I would like to explore opportunities
in the corporate world. How can I identify jobs that use my
teaching and presentation skills? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Start with the basics. Make a list of your assets:
public-speaking skills, a facility for languages and so on. Then
consult with friends, family and anyone you know in the corporate
world about what jobs might suit you best, advised Jay Block, a
career coach based in West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have lunch with that friend of your father's who runs a
company and say: `These are some of my skills. Do you see ways to
use them?' '' Block suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The more you can use these skills in your new career, the easier
the transition. A job in corporate training, for example, might let
you keep doing much of what you do now.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations are bemoaning the inability of many immigrant
workers to speak fluent English, said Marty Nemko, a career coach
in Oakland, Calif., and author of ``Cool Careers for Dummies'' (IDG
Books Worldwide, 1998). As a result, many companies with large
entry-level work forces are also becoming English as a Second
Language academies.
</P>
<P>
   Larger companies are better bets, Nemko said, because smaller
businesses ``usually can't afford to put resources into training.''
</P>
<P>
   You can also call the local chamber of commerce, which Nemko
calls ``the ultimate networking organization.''
</P>
<P>
   It knows ``the littlest stuff about local companies that doesn't
get into print,'' he said. The chamber can also tell you about your
new corporate neighbors, giving you an idea of which ones are
growing and, perhaps, which ones are focusing on training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Another excellent research tool is the Internet. Find the World
Wide Web site of your new county or town; it might have links to
major local employers.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're determined to find a job in the private sector,
check out the training programs run by local governments. Committed
to diversity, Nemko said, they often hire entry-level workers who
may need your language training.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have a handful of potential employers on your list,
start gathering data. Make appointments for networking meetings
with trainers ``to find out what skills they're looking for and
what makes a business trainer tick,'' said Mary McCoy, a human
resources consultant in Yellow Springs, Ohio. ``Start getting a
feel for what it would be like to work in that business by talking
with someone who does.''
</P>
<P>
   These sessions can introduce you to a potential employer and
give you a sense of whether its personality is in sync with your
own.

SCIENTISTS SAY THEY CONFIRM TESTS ON CANCER DRUGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mass., N.C.)   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists at the National Cancer Institute say they finally
have duplicated some of the extraordinary experiments performed by
Dr. Judah Folkman, who reported in 1997 that his research team at
Harvard had destroyed cancerous tumors in mice by giving the
animals drugs that cut off the tumors' blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   The confirmation of Folkman's results, first reported Thursday
by The Boston Globe, is a turnabout by the institute and comes less
than three months after scientists there said publicly that they
could not reproduce Folkman's work. His research had generated
intense interest among other scientists, and hope among the public
as well, particularly after it was described in a front-page
article in The New York Times in May.
</P>
<P>
   But the complaints that government scientists could not match
Folkman's discoveries cast doubt on the findings; it is a basic
rule of science that no experiment is trusted unless it can be
reproduced by other researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, reassured by its recent successes, the institute has begun
planning the first tests in people of one of the drugs developed by
Folkman and his colleagues, endostatin. This week the institute
invited medical centers to design experiments to test the drug in
cancer patients. The studies are expected to begin late this year.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the institute emphasized Thursday that the
studies would include only a small number of patients and would be
the most basic type of study done in people, known as a Phase I
trial. Such studies are designed primarily to test whether a drug
is safe for people, not whether it is effective.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James M. Pluda, a senior clinical investigator at the cancer
institute, said the studies would accept only people with solid
tumors, meaning cancers of the colon, breast and other organs.
Patients with leukemia and other cancers affecting the blood will
be excluded.
</P>
<P>
   He also cautioned, as Folkman and others have, that successful
tests in mice are no guarantee that drugs will work in people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of drugs have had great activity in mice and then have
not worked in people,'' Pluda said. ``It's very premature to
extrapolate from mouse data that this drug will have the same
activity in people that the mouse version had in mice in Folkman's
lab. We need careful clinical trials to evaluate whether this drug
will have any activity at all.''
</P>
<P>
   When government researchers first tried to reproduce Folkman's
results, they found that mouse endostatin slowed the growth of
tumors only slightly. So the cancer institute and Folkman agreed
that institute scientists should visit his laboratory at Children's
Hospital in Boston and learn his techniques for dealing with the
substances, which are difficult to manufacture, transport, store
and handle.
</P>
<P>
   The other substance developed by Folkman and his colleagues is
called angiostatin. Both endostatin and angiostatin work against
tumor blood vessels. Children's Hospital has made agreements with
Entremed, a small biotechnology company in Maryland, to work with
both.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Entremed made an agreement with the Bristol-Myers
Squibb Company to develop angiostatin, but on Tuesday Bristol-Myers
announced that it was suspending the deal because of its concerns
over whether it would be possible to make enough angiostatin to
test it in people.
</P>
<P>
   Entremed's stock price, which tumbled on that news, regained the
lost ground Thursday, after the cancer institute's action was
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Sundeen, a spokeswoman for Entremed, said it had contracted
with Covance Biotechnology Services Inc. of Research Triangle Park,
N.C., to produce large quantities of the drug. She said it would
make two pounds of endostatin, more than enough for a Phase I
study, in time for the trials to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sundeen also said Entremed expected to be able to
manufacture angiostatin as well, and hoped to be ready before the
end of this year to seek approval for testing it in humans. A
spokesman for Bristol-Myers Squibb said the company might resume
its involvement with angiostatin if Entremed could develop a
reliable manufacturing process and make a form of angiostatin that
proved safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
   Angiostatin is more difficult to make than endostatin. So far,
it seems that endostatin is the more powerful drug against tumors.
But the best results in the tests on mice were achieved when the
drugs were combined.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer institute scientists, the next step will be to do the
same experiments at the Bethesda, Md., laboratories, with
endostatin made in Boston by Folkman's team and with a version made
at government laboratories.

 WASHINGTON: Lewinsky's closet.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp was joined during the interview by her friend and
spokesman, Philip Coughter, and two lawyers, Joseph Murtha and
Anthony Zaccagnini. Although she was clearly nervous and
uncomfortable as the interview began, she quickly relaxed and
talked thoughtfully _ and, at times, emphatically _ about her
feelings about the president, Ms. Lewinsky and the momentous
consequences of her decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp said it was obvious that her self-imposed silence, in
deciding not to give interviews over the last year, had shaped
``the conventional wisdom right now as it defines Linda Tripp.''
And Mrs. Tripp acknowledged that the public's general opinion of
her would be difficult to change. ``It's so untrue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of her friends agreed this week that Mrs. Tripp's public
image was damaged by the self-serving public statement she
delivered last August on the courthouse steps after testifying to
the Starr grand jury. ``I'm you,'' she said then. ``I'm just like
you. I'm an average American who found herself in a situation not
of her own making.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Mrs. Tripp said, ``To the extent that I can
allow people to know me just a little bit, I hope that I can change
a small degree of public perception about me and, more importantly,
what drove me to make the decisions I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she fears that she might be dismissed from her Pentagon
job, Mrs. Tripp continues to work from home, and she recently
received a raise to $92,000 a year. While she did not rule out a
book deal in the future, she said she had no current plans to write
a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole country has suffered from having to hear the
indignities of the actions the president took, the choices he
made,'' she said. ``His family has suffered. All of us have, in one
way or another, paid a price for the choices he's made.'' She later
added, ``I don't know that we'll ever know, or at least not for a
long time, whether we've learned a national lesson through it all
or not.'' She did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking her head, Mrs. Tripp said softly that ``a year's worth
of national tragedy'' could have been easily avoided by ``some
honesty from the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her deep animosity toward Clinton, Mrs. Tripp said she
believed that removing him from office was too severe a punishment.
She said she hoped the Senate would pass a bipartisan censure
resolution in which the president would be required to acknowledge
that he had lied under oath and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally so far,'' she said, ``it appears that he will suffer
no dire consequences for his actions. The fear I have is that he
will take from this a sense of his own omnipotence, that he truly
can defy all odds and do something, virtually anything short of
murder and Houdini his way out of something that most people would
find it very difficult to explain away.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times, Mrs. Tripp expressed her ``high esteem'' for
Starr and the professionalism of his prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the tragedies of this story is that a man held
in such high regard professionally as Judge Starr would be so
roundly denigrated to the point of shamefulness,'' she said. ``What
a price to pay to do his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp said her decisions to secretly record the confidences
of her young friend _ and then turn over those tapes to Starr _
were motivated by a combination of fear and outrage at the
president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear, certainly, and foremost,'' she said. ``And secondly, a
sense of building outrage. Monica Lewinsky was, in fact, what I
refer to privately as the straw that broke the camel's back.''
</P>
<P>
   Banished in 1994 from the White House, where she worked in the
counsel's office, to a basement cubicle in the Pentagon, Mrs. Tripp
had an almost Zelig-like quality of being front and center at
several Clinton administration scandals. In November 1993, Mrs.
Tripp was the first woman to talk with Kathleen Willey after the
White House volunteer claimed that the president forced himself
upon her sexually just outside the Oval Office. And Mrs. Tripp was
the last White House employee to speak with Vincent Foster, the
White House lawyer who committed suicide in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't create these scandals,'' Mrs. Tripp said. ``I was
given a ringside seat to witness them.''
</P>
<P>
   And although she planned in 1996 to write a tell-all book
chronicling what she believed were the secrets and lies of the
Clinton administration, Mrs. Tripp denied that a lucrative book
contract is what motivated her to seek the advice of Ms. Goldberg
in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Ms. Goldberg urged Mrs. Tripp to begin
tape-recording her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. ``You've got to
really rat and you've got to tape,'' Ms. Goldberg told Mrs. Tripp
at the time, according to a transcript of their phone conversation.
Mrs. Tripp agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp said she spoke at length about Ms. Lewinsky with one
of the Jones lawyers, David Pike, in late October 1997. ``I never
called them,'' she said. ``He called me at home. I have an unlisted
number. He got my number from Lucianne.'' She added that she does
not share Ms. Goldberg's political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp spoke publicly for the first time about the talking
points, the three-page document Ms. Lewinsky gave her on Jan. 14,
1998, that purportedly coached Mrs. Tripp on how to testify in a
deposition in the Jones lawsuit. Early on in Starr's inquiry, the
talking points were seen as the key to the obstruction of justice
investigation. But that expectation was deflated after Ms. Lewinsky
testified that she wrote the talking points memo herself _ a
statement that Mrs. Tripp dismissed with a roll of the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that Monica wrote those on her own is about as
likely as her coauthoring the Gettysburg Address with Lincoln,''
she said. She added that she believes they were ``dictated by a
senior White House official,'' but did not say who.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Starr's prosecutors and agents confronted Ms.
Lewinsky at the Pentagon City Mall in suburban Virginia, where she
had gone to meet Mrs. Tripp at the Ritz Carlton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp recalled that Ms. Lewinsky told her, ``Thanks a
lot,'' in a sarcastic way.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said it like a recalcitrant little child,'' Mrs. Tripp
said. ``Of all the things she could have said, I think that was
rather bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp recalled that she told Ms. Lewinsky, ``They did it to
me, too.'' But Mrs. Tripp acknowledged that the remark _ a
reference to her also being the target of Starr's sting operation _
was a lie. Mrs. Tripp said that brief exchange was the last time
she had spoken with Ms. Lewinsky, and she added that she deeply
regrets how their friendship ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so fond of Monica,'' Mrs. Tripp said. ``I remain as fond
of her today as I always have been. And I wish her nothing but the
best.''

THREAT OF FILIBUSTER MAKES A VOTE ON CENSURE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas was loping past a gaggle
of reporters on his way to the Senate floor Thursday, ignoring one
plea after another to speak before the microphones and television
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one correspondent yelled, ``What about censure?''
Gramm, halfway through the swinging double doors to the chamber,
suddenly stopped and pivoted toward his questioner, a huge grin
spreading across his bespectacled face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure's dead!'' Gramm bleated happily in his Texas twang.
With that, he wheeled around and marched into the Senate's closed
impeachment deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with an unshakable conviction and the formidable threat of
a filibuster, Gramm has almost single-handedly derailed the censure
train in the Senate. He has argued that such a reprimand would
violate the separation of powers, set a bad precedent for future
Congresses, and wouldn't be worth the paper it's written on.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Gramm reminds anyone who asks, whose image is on the
$20 bill? Andrew Jackson's, of course, even though he was censured
in 1834. President Jackson's allies repealed the reprimand when
they regained control of the Senate three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's firm stance, and his stature within his caucus, have
steeled many wavering Senate Republicans who were mulling over a
toughly worded censure written by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
and Robert F. Bennett, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Texan's filibuster threat made it virtually
impossible for censure supporters to muster the 60 votes needed
break the impasse, and do it before a weeklong holiday recess
begins this weekend. Senators say there will be little appetite for
censure when they return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish people like Senator Gramm would just content themselves
with voting against censure instead of depriving the rest of us in
both parties who favor censure, from expressing our point of
view,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are expected to ask for a test vote on censure on
Friday, after the vote on the articles of impeachment. That vote,
on a motion to suspend the rules, requires 67 votes, which
supporters say they lack, but it will at least demonstrate a
flicker of bipartisanship. Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader,
has assured Democrats he will forego any legislative sleight of
hand to block that vote.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Feinstein says she will also draft a statement condemning
the president's behavior and circulate it for senators to sign.
About 40 of the 45 Democrats are likely to support the measure, as
well as 10 to 12 of the 55 Republicans, Senate aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I'm running into among Republican senators, is that
they're saying our vote to convict is our statement of censure, and
we don't want to be seen as piling on,'' Bennett said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rebuke would be included in the Congressional Record and
delivered to the president. It would not require Clinton's
signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I and many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle believe
that the president's actions merit strong condemnation and
censure,'' Mrs. Feinstein said Thursday in announcing that she
would vote to acquit the president on the two impeachment articles.
``The president acted immorally, he acted recklessly, he acted
disgracefully.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gramm is not alone in attacking censure. Many Republicans
view the measure as a political ploy designed to give Democrats
cover for their acquittal votes. Others say it would pit the
executive and legislative branches against each other in a
constitutional struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to persecute or prosecute the man,'' said Sen.
Rod Grams, R-Minn. ``We're just here to decide the question of
impeachment.'' Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., put it even more
bluntly: ``We're not paid to call the president names.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebuking Clinton over his affair with Monica Lewinsky and his
effort to conceal it would set an unwise precedent, Senate
Republicans warn. ``If there were some kind of censure that would
wound him, I think that would be a bad precedent,'' said Sen. Peter
Fitzgerald, R-Ill. ``Our Founding Fathers didn't want a wounded
president. That's why they created an all-or-nothing procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Democrats, including Tom Harkin of Iowa and
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, oppose censure for many of these
same reasons. Other Democrats are lukewarm on the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a censure would make any difference,'' said Sen.
Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii. ``If you want a censure, you can go up
there and give a speech. All of us, in our own way, have censured
the president.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Thursday suspended the
construction of new logging roads in most of the undeveloped back
country of the national forests, decisively shifting forest policy
toward conservation after a year of heated public debate.
</P>
<P>
   The move sets the stage for a comprehensive review of long-term
forest policy. The administration will study not only the remote
roadless areas affected by the suspension but also other
undeveloped areas excluded from the moratorium and the larger
expanses that are already crisscrossed by an estimated 400,000
miles of roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some frontiers are not to be conquered,'' Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman said, expressing bluntly that the
administration no longer wants to make logging and other
development the main purpose of the national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Road building will be suspended for the next 18 months,
temporarily protecting about 33 million acres of publicly owned
land. The moratorium, in effect, began more than a year ago, when
the suspension was proposed in January 1998. Meanwhile, the agency
collected some 50,000 comments from the public and felt the ire of
powerful logging interests and their allies in Congress, but it
built few new roads, if any, in the roadless areas.
</P>
<P>
   Roads do more than open up areas to logging. The construction
causes erosion that damages water quality and breaks up habitats,
which endangers wide-ranging species. It also allows for the
introduction of disease and pests into pristine areas.
</P>
<P>
   The timber industry and lawmakers from the West who favor
logging and other development on public lands called the plan
irresponsible. But environmental advocates said it was just a first
step toward permanently protecting all forests where there has been
no logging, mining or grazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their long-term vision is to accede to the extremists,
which is basically to get everyone out of the forest,'' said W.
Henson Moore, the head of the American Forest Products Association,
a trade association that represents timber and paper companies.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said building roads in national forests provides more than
logging jobs. Other benefits include offering access to the land
for recreation and other uses, including firefighting.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a state with huge undeveloped
forests, said the proposal ``has been widely unpopular and severely
disrupted Idaho's rural communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservation groups said they would work during the moratorium
to seek permanent protection for all areas without roads and to
shape the agency's policies in areas that already have roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protecting existing roadless areas isn't enough,'' said David
Bayles, conservation director of the Pacific Rivers Council, an
environmental group in Eugene, Ore. ``Restoration is needed as
well. With a real change in direction, the Forest Service could
begin to reverse some of the damage from the past and start to heal
the places that need it most _ the lightly roaded but still
relatively healthy watersheds that support sensitive species such
as grizzly bears and native cutthroat trout.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The administration made few significant changes to its initial
proposal for a moratorium. Several large forests where new
management plans are already in place or proposed were exempted;
among them are the Tongass National Forest in Alaska and the
Pacific Northwest forests where a dispute over logging in the
habitat of the imperiled spotted owl was settled in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the national forests consist of about 192 million acres,
of which about 35 million acres of land without roads are already
protected by wilderness status. About 33 million acres of
additional roadless areas, mostly in tracts of 5,000 acres or more,
will be protected by the moratorium; about 8 million acres of this
land are actually suitable for logging.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 million acres of roadless areas in several national
forests were excluded from the moratorium, but even some of that
land will not be open for road building because of other
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation groups complained that some relatively small
undeveloped areas were not protected by the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some areas in the Sierra Nevada deserving protection will not
be spared from logging and road building,'' said Brian Vincent, a
California organizer for American Forests, a conservation group.
For example, he said, Devils Canyon in the Tahoe National Forest,
which contains the largest stand of old-growth timber in Nevada
County but is not protected because it is smaller than the
5,000-acre minimum set by the administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 people have commented on the road building
moratorium in the past year, and the agency is likely to consider
many more comments on its long-term road building policies in the
months ahead, agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the moratorium would defer 200 to 300 miles
of roads that might otherwise have been built and would probably
reduce the amount of timber cut in national forests during the next
18 months by about 200 million board feet. Each year, the agency
sells about 4 billion board feet of wood from national forests.
</P>
<P>
   But agency officials said that only a few hundred jobs would be
lost and that the overall economic harm would be relatively slight
_ an estimated $22 million to $33 million _ because much of the
demand for wood would be filled instead by private landowners.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the administration eventually decides to manage
areas that are still free of roads, it must also struggle with
managing those parts of the forest that are already full of roads.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the roads were originally built for logging trucks, but
now carry an estimated 1.7 million vehicles a day: mostly mundane
rural traffic, but also visitors to the national forests. Fewer
than half the roads meet safety and environmental standards. The
Forest Service says it has a maintenance backlog of $8.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is seeking $123 million for road
maintenance in the forests next year, an increase of about 25
percent, but this amount is nowhere near what is needed to make
necessary repairs. Therefore, the agency faces some decisions _
which roads should be improved and which shut down.

<P>
   In a Memphis, Tenn., courtroom, the families of four deceased
smokers including a homemaker and a long-haul truck driver are
suing the nation's three biggest tobacco companies for $660 million
in damages.
</P>
<P>
   In Akron, Ohio, jury selection will begin this month in a
lawsuit against the tobacco industry by a labor union health fund,
in the first such case to reach trial. The health fund is seeking
$750 million for starters, and far more if it can prove civil
racketeering charges against producers.
</P>
<P>
   And in a Miami courtroom, a major class-action case brought on
behalf of all Florida smokers has been under way for months.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, the tobacco industry thought it had
vanquished its greatest legal threat when it agreed to settle all
remaining claims brought by states seeking to recover Medicaid
expenses, by paying the states $206 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But in the months of jockeying that led to the settlement, there
was a steady growth in the number of lawsuits against cigarette
makers by individual smokers and others. And this week the
industry's calm was shattered when a California jury, in a suit
brought by a woman who had smoked Marlboro cigarettes since age 15,
ordered Philip Morris Cos. to pay her $51.5 million in compensatory
and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment represents the largest award by far ever issued
against a tobacco company. And in the past two days, the prices of
tobacco stocks have fallen sharply on Wall Street as investors have
reacted with uncertainty.
 &UR;  &LR; Tobacco producers had traditionally viewed a claim by a single
smoker as of small financial concern, in large part because few
cases succeeded, awards were small and all were overturned on
appeal. But the California verdict, coming after years of
relentless pounding of the industry in the court of public opinion,
suggests that the calm enjoyed by producers since the announcement
of the settlement with the states late last year is over.
 &UR;  &LR;  Robert Rabin, a professor of law at Stanford University who
follows tobacco litigation, said he believed that the steady
disclosure in recent years of damaging documents from cigarette
company files might have shifted public attitudes toward the
industry from the benign to the hostile. Those documents revealed,
for example, that some companies sought to recruit teen-agers as
``replacement smokers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis is no longer just on the product being dangerous,
but on the industry being malevolent in trying to cover up those
dangers,'' Rabin said. ``And it is not just happening in the juror
room but in the general way people think about the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris officials have said they will appeal the
California verdict, which was meted out by a state jury in San
Francisco. And there is a strong likelihood that the stunning
verdict, which included $50 million in punitive damages against
Philip Morris, the country's largest cigarette maker, may be
reduced or even thrown out on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Madelyn J. Chaber, the lawyer who represented the smoker,
Patricia Henley, had asked jurors to award $15 million in punitive
damages, which are intended to punish the company.
</P>
<P>
   William S. Ohlemeyer, a lawyer representing Philip Morris, said
he believed that the size of the verdict represented not only
sympathy by jurors for Ms. Henley, who said her lung cancer
resulted from smoking Marlboros for 35 years, but also a deep
antipathy for cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These lawsuits should be decided on the facts rather than
emotion,'' Ohlemeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But for jurors these days, emotions may be a part of how they
view such facts. While Ms. Chaber did not introduce any evidence
that had not been considered in previous lawsuits, she apparently
made extensive use of documents produced by cigarette makers in
recent years like those that indicated they manipulated nicotine
levels to keep smokers hooked and marketed ``light'' cigarettes _
those with lower tar levels _ to smokers concerned about their
health.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, Gwen Leath, a banker from San Francisco, said she was
particularly disturbed that Philip Morris had tried for decades to
cast doubt on scientific reports by government officials that
smoking was addictive and caused cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``With publicity and advertising, they really tried to downplay
it as a controversy between the surgeon general and responsible
medical people,'' said Ms. Leath, 47. ``It all seemed kind of
deceiving, and they were kind of saying, like, `Oh, this is just
business.' ''

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The jury's foreman, George Loudis, said he believed that the $15
million sought by Ms. Chafer in punitives damages to send Philip
Morris what she called a ``strong message'' should have served as a
maximum for the jury's award. But while he declined to disclose the
amount he had suggested, he added that some jurors had considered
punitive awards in the hundreds of millions, with one juror going
as high as $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People felt that the tobacco companies were suppressing what
they knew and misstated what they knew from their findings to be
true.'' said Loudis, 37. ``That was proven to us, that they
suppressed knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henley, 53, said on Thursday at a news conference in San
Francisco that she would use the money to finance programs to keep
children from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't touch a nickel of somebody's blood money,'' she
said. ``But I have to hand it to the jury: they awarded that money
not knowing that I wasn't going to keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the recent settlements with the states nor the proposed
$368.5 billion deal reached in June 1997 between cigarette makers
and state attorneys general would have barred individual cases like
Ms. Henley's. But the 1997 proposal, which fell apart in Congress
last year, would have banned class-action cases like the one now
under way in Miami and the one about to start in Akron.
</P>
<P>
   The California verdict was only the fourth time in more than a
decade that a jury has awarded damages in tobacco case brought by
an individual smoker. And the previous awards, including the most
recent two cases in Florida against Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Co.,
were overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The highest previous award in a smoker's case was for $1 million
including punitive damages and that was set aside on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of both individual cases as well as class-action
lawsuits against cigarette makers has been steadily growing. In a
recent financial filing, Philip Morris said, for example, that
there were some 510 smoking and health cases filed by individuals
against it at the end of 1998 compared with 375 a year earlier.
Meanwhile, the number of class action cases grew to 60 from 50, the
company reported.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, a major class-action lawsuit brought on behalf
on all smokers in Florida has been under way in a Miami courtroom.
It is expected to go to the jury soon.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the size of the latest award may also set off a
stampede, some financial analysts believe. Until 1997, product
liablity claims by smokers were barred after a state law was passed
more than a decade ago that held that dangers of smoking were
well-known. According to a spokesman for Philip Morris, about 63
cigarette cases have been filed in California since the law's
repeal. About 20 of those cases are from individuals and the rest
are class-action cases.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued on Wednesday, Gary Black, a tobacco industry
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. in New York, said the award
to Ms. Henley, who is viewed as a relatively unsympathetic
plaintiff because she had tried to stop smoking only once in 35
years, meant that companies could face particular risks in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs there can collect damages even if they bear the vast
majority of blame for their health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a number of foreign government including Bolivia, Panama
and Nicaragua have filed claims in the United States against
tobacco companies, and President Clinton also recently announced
that he had directed the Justice Department to begin preparing a
lawsuit against cigarette makers to recover Medicare and other
federal funds spend treating smoking-related ills.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin, the university professor, said he believed that cigarette
producers had the financial resources to withstand five to six
judgements against them annually, even if some of them involved
substantial punitive damage awards.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that while the industry worked long and hard to put
the most troublesome cases, those brought by the states, behind it,
the bright new day of financial certainty that it anticipated may
be long time arriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If plaintiffs win a handful of these cases each year, the
industry can deal with that because they can get some of them
reversed on appeal,'' Rabin said. ``But every victory with a big
price tag bloodies the waters and creates powerful incentives for a
great deal of additional cases to be brought''

NEWS ANALYSIS: AS BARNEY'S EMERGES FROM BANKRUPTCY, NEW OWNERS FACE
ROUGH ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Barney's Inc., the high-end retailer whose
Barneys New York stores turned basic black pants into a uniform of
Manhattan chic, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early
1996, it did not take long for two types of investors to swoop in.
</P>
<P>
   There were other retailers who were itching to buy the
prestigious name. Saks Fifth Avenue offered $290 million in 1997
for its archrival. Dickson Poon, a Hong Kong entrepreneur whose
Dickson Concepts also owns Britain's Harvey Nichols department
store, bid $280 million. Last year, the DFS Group, no stranger to
luxury goods through its many airport duty free shops, also flirted
with the company, valuing it roughly the same as Poon.
</P>
<P>
   The other interested parties were so-called vultures _ investors
who acquire a distressed company's unpaid bills in secondary
markets in hopes of collecting more later. The Barney's vultures
ended up as its largest creditors, rejecting the bids from the
retailers as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   So, as Barney's emerges from bankruptcy this month, control of
the purveyor of Jil Sander suits and $300 T-shirts belongs to two
vulture groups, Whippoorwill Associates of White Plains and Bay
Harbour Management of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Pressman family, who founded and ran Barney's for most of
the century, has more or less left. Even more critically, the
management team that turned the company's balance sheet around is
leaving this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the vultures have laid claim to Barney's, what have
they received for their money? While highly successful as buyers of
distressed debt, the investors have no experience running a
specialty retailer. And that won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chief executive, Thomas Shull, is departing
because the new owners want a ``growth chief executive,'' said Doug
Teitlebaum, of Bay Harbour. Teitlebaum and David Strumwasser, who
heads Whippoorwill, together control about 70 percent of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving with Shull is the chief financial officer, Edward
Lambert, and Paul Jen, the head of marketing, all from Meridian
Ventures, a turnaround specialist. Shari Gregerman, head of stores,
also left recently.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Pressman, who shared the chairmanship of Barney's with his
brother Bob, has packed up his office even though he has a two-year
consulting contract. His wife, Bonnie, who ran the women's
business, is now an executive at Polo/Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Pressman, who helped work out the deal with the vultures, is
no longer involved in day-to-day operations. All this has drained
the company of much high-octane talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vultures are much better at going in and very quickly making a
decision than traditional creditors,'' said Jeff Manning, a
managing director of Rodman &AMP; Renshaw, a New York investment bank.
``But there are very few of these distressed investors who you
really want to see operating your companies.''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the investors now have to prove they can deliver
the goods, because their deal actually valued the company at less
than what the retailing bidders offered. The two bought the
majority stake at $240 million, betting that a brighter future
would let them unload Barney's for considerably more later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dickson wanted to buy the company because he thought he could
make a profit,'' Teitlebaum said. ``We think we can make it more
profitable. Why sell it at a low price and leave the future value
for someone else?''
</P>
<P>
   Teitlebaum originally bought the Barney's claims for roughly 30
cents on the dollar, and Strumwasser's purchases averaged about 50
cents. They expect their investment to rise substantially but, at
least judging from the market for remaining trade claims _ now
selling at about 15 cents on the dollar _ they are wildly
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   At best, many analysts say, Barney's may not be worth much more
for quite a while. Shull did much to turn around the troubled
merchant. Many of its money-losing smaller stores were shuttered,
leaving the company with seven stores and 11 off-price outlets. He
cut the company's sizable debt and took advantage of its
credit-card list for marketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel strongly about the team that worked hard to create all
this value,'' said Shull. ``We shifted the priority from a focus on
the image to making money.''

 NEW YORK: making money.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Barney's also faces a huge bill simply for rent. The company
built its three flagship Barneys New York stores _ one on Madison
Avenue, the others in Chicago and Beverly Hills, Calif. _ with the
help of the Isetan Co. of Japan, its partner in the 1980s. Barney's
and Isetan later had a falling-out concerning who owned the stores;
that dispute was at the core of the bankruptcy case.
</P>
<P>
   Isetan won the dispute and is supposed to receive, in addition
to some cash and a small equity stake, $15 million a year in rent _
about 7 percent of today's sales. Compared with the roughly 4.5
percent Saks pays for its rent and the 2.8 percent at Neiman
Marcus, that is a hefty fixed cost for a company that relies on a
strong stock market and booming economy to keep its affluent
clients coming through the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Already, sales at Barneys New York average roughly $575 a square
foot, almost double that of most other specialty retailers. Some
analysts question just how much more can be squeezed out.
</P>
<P>
   Under the reorganization plan, sales in stores open at least one
year are projected to grow about 5 percent a year during the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at existing Barney's stores grew 10 percent in 1998 _ an
exceptionally strong number _ but how will the company top that?
Maintaining even half that pace will be quite a challenge,
especially without a new merchandising genius.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of talented merchants is not terribly deep. Saks, for
example, has yet to replace its president, Rose Marie Bravo, who
left in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Teitlebaum said that the company can prosper without bringing in
another top merchant. ``You can't get caught up with titles,'' he
said. ``Barney's has a team culture. We have all the players on the
field, and to me that is hugely significant.''
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if he will get a chance to test that thinking. None
of those interested in Barney's before seem interested in buying it
now.
</P>
<P>
   Poon has not made new overtures and Myron E. Ullman III, the
chairman of DFS, suggested that he saw no reason to pay more than
his first bid. ``I think,'' he said last week, ``that we made a
sound decision.''

GOVERNMENT EXPECTED TO CLEAR WAY FOR IRRADIATION TREATMENT OF RED
MEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Neb., Minn.)   (af)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Department of Agriculture is expected to
announce on Friday the approval of irradiation for red meats to
control bacteria like salmonella and potentially deadly strains of
E coli.
</P>
<P>
   The department would require that irradiated meat be labeled,
with a symbol and statement indicating that the product had been
treated.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the public will accept irradiated meat is unclear, since
there has been so much resistance by consumers to the technology in
the past. Only a small percentage of the American food supply is
irradiated, even though it is permitted for fruits, vegetables,
pork, poultry and spices.
</P>
<P>
   But outbreaks of food poisoning in the past few years have
focused attention on irradiation to combat the spread of harmful
bacteria, like listeria. Listeria, which has been responsible for
the recall of millions of pounds of prepared meats in the past
several months, might have been eradicated through irradiation. It
is particularly dangerous to pregnant women because it can cause
miscarriages and stillbirths.
</P>
<P>
   The meat industry has long sought approval of irradiation for
ground beef, which is the source of the greatest contamination in
beef products. But IBP Inc., the largest supplier of beef in the
United States, said the Agriculture Department's approval would not
immediately prompt it to begin irradiating meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have some customers who would like to test market it,''
said Gary Mickelson, a spokesman for the Nebraska company, ``we may
do it but it will depend on consumer demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Irradiated meat is expected to cost about 5 cents more a pound,
officials said. But even if consumers are willing to pay the
additional money and overcome their suspicions about the treatment
process, one problem remains _ the taste and smell of the food,
especially ground beef patties that are the most likely form of
beef to be irradiated.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the packaging is just right, the level of irradiation
exact, the fat in the beef can cause unappealing odors and taste.
The color of the raw irradiated beef is also darker than fresh
beef.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved irradiation of red
meat in December 1997, but the process could not be used until the
Agriculture Department established rules. Irradiation, which has
been available for almost 50 years, does not make food radioactive.
The food is passed through a chamber containing radioactive
cobalt-60, electron beams or X-rays that bombard the food and kill
bacteria, insects and mold.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys have shown that few people know what food irradiation
is. ``People think it will make them glow in the dark,'' said Carol
Tucker Foreman, a former Agriculture Department official and a
partner in Foreman and Heidepriem, a Washington public policy
consulting firm. Ms. Foreman says irradiated food itself is not
unsafe, but she and some consumer groups say there are other
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irradiation is not a panacea,'' Ms. Foreman said. ``You want
people to have good sanitary conditions and avoid contamination to
begin with, and irradiation tempts people to have less than
pristine sanitary conditions.'' Irradiated contamination will not
make you sick, she said, but it is still contamination.
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, ``Irradiation kills harmless as well as disease
producing bacteria, but it does not prevent further contamination.
There is some reason to believe that disease-causing bacteria may
multiply more rapidly after irradiation because there is no
harmless bacteria to compete with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
Washington-based consumer group, says safety issues are worrisome.
``Irradiation raises concerns about worker safety and environmental
safety as they transport the nuclear fuels around the country,''
said Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for the center.
Elaborate safety measures are supposed to be in place to prevent
exposure when irradiation equipment is in use.
</P>
<P>
   Installation of equipment to treat the beef is expected to cost
individual companies about $10 million. Ms. DeWaal said that
``companies are looking for less expensive technologies that don't
have the same consumer acceptance problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Klein, a spokesman for Excel Corp., the nation's second
largest supplier of beef and the company that developed steam
pasteurization, a method to rid beef of harmful bacteria, said the
corporation would test-market irradiated beef before it made plans
to spend any money on the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan would be to let consumers know and then make a
decision,'' Klein said. ``This should not be used as a replacement
for any other food safety program or technology.'' With IBP, Excel
processes more than half the beef sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But health officials, especially those who have to deal with
outbreaks related to harmful bacteria like E coli 0157:H7, see
irradiation as the only solution to the increasing levels of
harmful bacteria in food. Dr. Michael Osterholm, the state
epidemiologist at the Minnesota Health Department, is a champion of
irradiation. ``I'm extremely pleased it's there,'' he said, ``but I
have not heard industry screaming for it. The next hurdle is having
it used.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Agriculture Department will make an announcement
about its approval on Friday, its proposed rules are to be
published in the Federal Register within 10 days and will be
followed by a 60-day comment period. The irradiation of beef could
begin as early as the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   But its lasting efficacy is being debated. Ms. Foreman, who says
there is a place for irradiated foods in nursing homes and
hospitals, warns that ``in the long run, years out, bacteria are
likely to develop resistance to irradiation,'' just as they have to
one antibiotic after another.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A U.N. human rights mission has charged that
regional peace-keepers in Sierra Leone summarily have executed
dozens of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous reports of rebel violence against civilians in Sierra
Leone have circulated, but in a report the mission describes
systematic rights violations by both insurgents and peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the secretary general, told the Security Council
Thursday that while the rebels had killed more than 3,000 people
and committed a variety of atrocities, witnesses also had accused
government forces and peacekeepers, mainly from Nigeria, of
summarily executing of suspected rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The report accuses the monitoring group established by the
Economic Community of West African States, or ECOMOG, of executing
people suspected of being rebels, among them children and some 20
patients at Connaught Hospital on Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that ECOMOG forces bombed civilian targets, shot
at ``human shields'' formed by the rebels and mistreated the staffs
of the Red Cross and similar groups.
</P>
<P>
   The report details violations witnessed by U.N. personnel and by
survivors who met with members of the mission, which traveled to
Freetown, the capital, in January and February.
</P>
<P>
   That was a time of intense fighting in the capital in which
thousands of people were reported killed in just two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually detailed report, a few copies of which circulated
here Thursday, accuses the rebel forces of wholesale rights
violations, including the killing of children and infants,
decapitations, amputations, the rape of children and the burning of
elderly and defenseless people. Other people were shot by the
rebels for refusing to sing or dance in the streets, the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Annan commended ECOMOG for having helped restore
security in most parts of Sierre Leone and asked for extra aid for
the special force. He reiterated the appeal Thursday, saying that
ECOMOG needed money ``to carry out its important mission for
regional peace and security.''
</P>
<P>
   The force restored a civilian government after a 1997 military
coup, but the rebels remain active outside the capital and in the
country's interior. The report was filed by human rights monitors
within the U. N. Observer Mission in Sierra Leone, a group created
last June by the Security Council to help restore peace and insure
human rights in the war-ravaged country. The monitors, who
interviewed some 100 people in Freetown on Jan. 25 and from Feb. 1
to 4, say the mission observed ``numerous incidents of ill
treatment'' of people whom ECOMOG soldiers detained at checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Punishment included ``whipping, beating, varying types of public
humiliation, and being bound extremely tightly,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses ``of the highest probity,'' it adds, said they had
seen ECOMOG execute three people at Ferry Junction and Connaught
Hospital, Sierra Leone's largest, after only ``a cursory
interrogation.'' An 8-year-old boy was executed after being caught
with a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   The mission members themselves witnessed an execution at
Connaught Hospital on Feb. 3, the report says. The perpetrators
``were in ECOMOG uniform and onlookers stated their view that the
victims were rebel collaborators.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission concludes that the government's forces also ``bear
responsibility for summary executions.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, the report says, ``senior U.N. staff observed and
photographed a newly severed human head displayed on a stick'' at a
government checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the monitors filed documentary and photographic
evidence of their charges in Conakry, Guinea, where they and other
U. N. groups relocated after the rebels overran Freetown in
January. The report says that at least 3,000 to 5,000 people had
been killed and 150,000 dislocated, but that the actual casualty
rate ``will never be known.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 15,000 ECOMOG soldiers in Sierra Leone. With
virtually no national army, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah relied on
the Nigerian-dominated force to regain power last March after his
democratically elected government was overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   ECOMOG widely is credited with having done a fairly reputable
job, so the accusations against the regional peacekeepers,
especially by U. N. human rights monitors, are bound to stir
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the report blames the rebels for most of the brutality
and civilian casualties, which it calls ``entirely arbitrary.''
Witnesses said that many atrocities were committed by children and
that many perpetrators were drunk or on ``cocaine and other
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Killing occasionally occurred in the context of games in which
people were lined up and the executioners teasingly chose who to
kill and who to spare,'' the report says. Some ``burned to death in
their homes had been locked in or first been disabled by gunshot.''
</P>
<P>
   The report called rape of females, including children, a
``standard practice'' of the rebels. One local commander, the
report says, asked that girls be checked ``to verify their status
as virgins.'' Those who passed the test, mostly aged 12 to 15,
``were ordered to report each night for sexual abuse by the
commander and his men.''
</P>
<P>
   One man described being ``ordered to choose between the
execution of his entire family and the surrender of his daughter to
a rebel fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   During their visits, the monitors observed ``body parts
remaining on beaches and other locations.''
</P>
<P>
   ECOMOG officials, who do not have a liaison office here, could
not be reached for comment. The Nigerian mission did not return a
telephone call seeking comment.

AMERICAN ASKS JUDGE TO CITE STRIKING PILOTS FOR CONTEMPT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN REED 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ American Airlines, angry that pilots
continued to call in sick Thursday despite a court order, asked a
federal judge to cite the union and its leaders for contempt.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth-based airline was forced to cancel 1,170 of its
2,250 scheduled flights Thursday, including 200 of the 525
scheduled at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said the number of pilots who have called in sick
since Saturday rose by more than 300 Thursday, to about 2,400.
</P>
<P>
   Since the sickout began Saturday, the airline has canceled more
than 3,800 flights because it lacked pilots, inconveniencing an
estimated 350,000 travelers.
</P>
<P>
   But Allied Pilots Association President Rich LaVoy insisted
Thursday that the union is doing everything it can to comply with
the back-to-work order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are complying with the order,'' he said. ``We are asking
our pilots to return to their scheduled work. I understand the
power of federal courts and the power that is vested in the judge
in these matters. We are not going to trifle with the court.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall, who issued a temporary
restraining order Wednesday requiring union leaders to tell those
staging a sickout to ``cease and desist,'' will hear American's new
complaint at 10 a.m. Friday in his Dallas courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   In its motion for contempt, American's management said that some
of the union's recorded telephone hot line messages and Internet
messages did not comply with Kendall's order.
</P>
<P>
   The company's management said that some of the union's formal
communications with members implied that Kendall's order applied
only to the union's leaders, and not to rank-and-file members.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said the judge's order applies to all healthy pilots
who have called in sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the fact that a majority of our pilots continue
to fly,'' the airline said in a release issued after filing the
contempt motion. ``But we are surprised and disappointed with the
APA's failure to clearly communicate to its members what the judge
ordered.''
</P>
<P>
   At D/FW Airport, passengers _ and other creatures _ continue to
be caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Brodrick, owner of Lobster Harvest in Grapevine, has
5,000 pounds of the crustaceans stranded in Atlanta, awaiting a
connecting flight to D/FW.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lobsters are living creatures, and we only have so much time
to get them to market,'' Brodrick said.
</P>
<P>
   He blames American, his longtime cargo provider, for the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think they know what it's doing to their
customers,'' Brodrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines officials said they accommodated 1,200 American
passengers whose flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Several pilots said Thursday that the union had not called to
tell them to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this started, we all got calls from the union,'' said one
D/FW-based captain who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They read
us the federal aviation regulation on not flying when you're sick.
We all knew what that meant. But I have yet to receive the opposite
call from the union. I've not gotten a `stand down' call yet.''
</P>
<P>
   LaVoy said Thursday that the union is trying to get the word out
about Kendall's order. In addition to posting messages on the
union's hot line, which LaVoy said is getting about 150,000 hits
daily, the union has sent e-mail messages to more than 6,200
pilots, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall's order has been posted on the union's Web site, and
printed copies will be distributed to all pilots Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done everything I can but go to all the guys' doors and
knock,'' LaVoy said.
</P>
<P>
   American's management contends that not all messages express the
extent of Kendall's order.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, for example, LaVoy read portions of Kendall's
order in a message played on the union's telephone hot line. But he
added that the order applied only to those named in the suit,
specifically the union's officers and board members.
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon, the recording had been changed to omit that
assertion.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's hearing, Kendall chastised the union for its
communications. He quoted Internet postings that listed the
definition of ``sick'' and urged pilots to consider whether they
fit the definition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who read that (e-mail) with an IQ of above 80 will
know what that means,'' Kendall told union attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Kendall's order, company officials had warned that
they expected to cancel several hundred flights Thursday because
crews and airplanes were out of position. The cancellations had
grown from 84 on Saturday to 1,004 systemwide Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There were indications that at least some pilots might defy the
back-to-work order. A number said Wednesday that the order is
unenforceable, at least in part because Federal Aviation
Administration regulations give pilots the right to determine
whether they are fit to fly.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots are protesting the airline's plans to take 12 to 18
months to consolidate Reno Air's 300 pilots into the 9,300-member
American pilot corps.
</P>
<P>
   American acquired control of Reno, a low-cost carrier, in
December. The pilots say that they want pay raises for Reno's
pilots, as well as for those who will be promoted at American
because of the acquisition, to be retroactive to December.

RENO ASSERTS SHE HAS NEVER TRIED TO HINDER STARR'S INVESTIGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the Justice Department's decision to open an
ethics inquiry into the practices of the independent counsel
Kenneth Starr, Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday that she
had never tried to hamper Starr's investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried my level best to do this the right way, to ensure
that there was no effort whatsoever to interfere with his
investigation,'' Reno said at her weekly news conference, referring
to her overall dealings with Starr. ``And I am convinced that
nothing has been done, but I will continue to work to ensure that
result.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's supporters in Congress have criticized the Justice
Department in recent days after news articles disclosed that the
inquiry had moved ahead with an exchange of letters between the
department and Starr's prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Independent Counsel has objected to the ethics
investigation on the ground that it will improperly intrude on the
prosecutor's autonomy from the department.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, said he was troubled by leaks to the press
about the internal inquiry by the Office of Professional
Responsibility, the department's in-house ethics unit. Hatch said
he would meet with Reno on Friday to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The articles appeared in the press while the Senate was
conducting final deliberations on the articles of impeachment
against President Clinton,'' the senator said. ``The timing of
these articles could not be more suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   At her news conference, Reno denied that there was hostility
between the department and the Office of Independent Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials have said that lawyers in the two
agencies had feuded over whether the department had the authority
to investigate Starr's operation and that Reno had once asked her
aides whether she could discipline Starr short of removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel any tension or animosity,'' she said. ``I just
see everyone trying to work together to figure out what the right
thing to do is.''
</P>
<P>
   She fended off specific questions about the inquiry by the
Office of Professional Responsibility, which investigates
complaints of prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry will focus on whether Starr's prosecutors misled the
Justice Department about possible conflicts of interest regarding
any contacts with the Paula Jones legal team in January 1998, when
they asked the department to expand the prosecutors' jurisdiction
to investigate the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have said all along, I try not to comment with respect to
the independent counsel's function,'' Reno said. ``I will, however,
continue to look to see how I may comment in a way that is fair to
all concerned, consistent with the law and consistent with ethical
considerations.''

WORD IS, HE'S ERIC THE GREAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Philadelphia general manager Bob Clarke had
tired of waiting for Eric Lindros' intangibles to catch up to his
towering talent. Or so the scuttlebutt went.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the Flyers succumb to Buffalo in the first round
of the 1998 NHL playoffs, Clarke tried to sign Lindros to a
long-term deal, the better to dangle him as bait in the whopper of
all trade derbies. Or so hearsay had it.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Kings were high on the list of potential suitors
for Lindros, who signed a one-year deal with a second-year option
in August expressly so it'd be more difficult to deal him. Or so
the rumor went.
</P>
<P>
   If only Scuttlebutt, Hearsay and Rumor were anchoring the
Flyers' offense this season instead of Lindros, LeClair and Jones,
the rest of the league would be skating a lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the Flyers' game against the Kings at the Forum on
Thursday night, Lindros and John LeClair were on pace to score more
than 50 goals apiece. And a revamped Flyers team was on track to
record its most victories in a season since notching 46 in 1987,
the year the Flyers succumbed in the Stanley Cup Finals to the
Wayne Gretzky-powered Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   If Clarke's poor-mouthing of Lindros after years of unequivocal
praise was intended to shift the 6-foot-4 center into a gear few in
the game have ever reached, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after Clarke declared that if Lindros wanted to be
the game's highest-paid player, it was time he started playing like
one, the 25-year-old is doing everything for the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros carried a 14-game point streak into the Forum and his 74
points at the night's start were second only to Pittsburgh's
Jaromir Jagr. He led the league in even-strength scoring with 53
points (five more than Jagr and four more than LeClair) and sat
fourth overall in assists with 43.
</P>
<P>
   A long summer (thanks to the early exit from the playoffs)
afforded Lindros ample time to get into the best shape of his life.
To be sure, he arrived for his seventh training camp a lot lighter,
having decided even before Clarke issued his challenge to shed the
weighty expectations he has been saddled with since before his NHL
debut in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Kings captain Rob Blake remembers the first time he saw Lindros,
at the 1991 Canada Cup when the juniors player stopped by the Team
Canada dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid walks in,'' Blake recalled before Thursday's game,
``and guys who had been in the NHL 10 years stared at him,
wide-eyed. No one really had seen him play but everybody knew who
he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody unaware of Lindros then got a load of him the following
year. Drafted against his wishes by the Quebec Nordiques at No. 1
overall in 1991, Lindros staunchly refused to play for them. A year
later the Nordiques capitulated and traded Lindros to Philadelphia
for eight players (among them, Kings defenseman Steve Duchesne) and
cash.
</P>
<P>
   The Nordiques left Quebec for Denver three years later and
promptly won the Stanley Cup. The Flyers were the Cup favorite in
1997. People swore they saw the torch passed from Gretzky to
Lindros during the Eastern Conference Finals after Lindros scored
the decisive, last-second goal in Game 4 and powered the Flyers to
a five-game series win over Gretzky's Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Lindros made like a Philadelphia phantom in the Stanley
Cup Finals and the Flyers were swept by the Red Wings in four
games. When Lindros wasn't dodging reporters, the Flyers captain
was pointing fingers at goaltender Ron Hextall and soon-to-be-fired
coach Terry Murray for the team's collapse, never mind that he had
only one goal in the series.
</P>
<P>
   With a captain like that at the helm, who needs rats?
</P>
<P>
   There was more reason to wonder about Lindros' relationship with
his teammates when he ignored an invitation to LeClair's wedding
that same summer. People who know Lindros say you must understand
this: He is a loner by nature and the expectations heaped on him
only served to further isolate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In past years Eric felt so much pressure, he went off on his
own and tried to handle it by himself,'' said Hextall, who was
shipped to Quebec in the Lindros mega-deal only to return two years
later via the New York Islanders. ``He's really grown as a person
and as an athlete in the five years I've been here with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing in the first, second, third and final rounds of the
playoffs in your first six seasons provides plenty of fertilizer.
So perhaps it's little wonder Lindros finally seems to be blooming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a pledge to myself even before (Clarke spoke up) to
just go out and have fun and quit worrying about what was going on
in the front office or wherever,'' Lindros said.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' largesse this season is the Kings' loss. Because if
Lindros had been dealt, he likely would have wound up in L.A., as
rumored.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been a huge benefit for us,'' Blake said
wistfully. ``We definitely wouldn't be in the position we are now,
(which is) fighting for a playoff spot. Eric is the kind of player,
you've got your eye on him whenever he's on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't see anybody trading a star like that in his
prime. Players like him don't come along very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do teams like the 1998-99 Flyers.

COURT RULES AGAINST IRS IN CHARITY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ill.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The IRS cannot revoke a charity's tax-exempt status simply for
hiring fund-raisers who end up with most of the money they take in
from donors, a federal appeals court unanimously ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, at least temporarily, has cost the government one
important weapon it had for combating unscrupulous fund-raisers who
trade on a charity's good name.
</P>
<P>
   The case that led to the decision involved a direct-mail firm,
Watson &AMP; Hughey of McLean, Va., that had been hired by the United
Cancer Council, a small Indiana charity that advocated cancer
prevention, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy. Between 1984
and 1989, when Watson &AMP; Hughey was the council's exclusive
fund-raiser, it sent 80 million letters that raised $28.8 million
in donations from the public, only $2.3 million of which went to
the charity, after expenses were deducted. The council is now
defunct.
</P>
<P>
   Watson &AMP; Hughey, now known as Direct Response Consulting, has
been criticized before by various regulatory bodies for running
expensive fund-raising campaigns that produced little for the
charities they represented. But from all appearances, its business
continues to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in
Chicago concluded that in the absence of a showing that insiders at
United Cancer had benefited personally from the donations, the IRS
could not strip the charity of its tax exemption simply for
entering into a foolish bargain with a professional fund-raiser.
Allowing the IRS that kind of leeway, as the Tax Court had done in
August, would make donors reluctant to give money to nonprofits
whose tax-exempt status might later fall into question and would
give small, poorly financed charities few options short of pulling
the plug, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard enough for new, small, weak, or marginal charities
to survive, because they are likely to have a high expense ratio,
and many potential donors will be put off by that,'' Chief Judge
Richard Posner wrote on behalf of the three-judge panel. ``The Tax
Court's decision, if sustained, would make the survival of such
charities even more dubious, by enveloping them in doubt about
their tax exemption.''
</P>
<P>
   While some involved in the nonprofit sector describe the
decision as a victory for free speech and unpopular causes, others
warned that public confidence in charities would wane if the
decision stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a highly unfortunate result in a situation that is
exceedingly abusive,'' said Thomas Troyer, a nonprofit law
specialist at Caplin &AMP; Drysdale in Washington. ``Private parties
shouldn't be able to gorge themselves on tax-deductible
contributions because they have overwhelming dominance over a weak
charity with an attractive name.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has so far argued that Watson &AMP; Hughey had so much
financial influence over the cancer charity that it effectively was
in charge, making it subject to existing rules that bar charity
officers, directors and other insiders from siphoning off
charitable funds.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court reasoned that so long as the contract with
Watson &AMP; Hughey was negotiated at arm's length, the percentage of
donations that went to the firm was irrelevant and the fund-raisers
could not be considered insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Posner also concluded that the charity did derive some benefit,
``meager, to be sure,'' from the modest educational messages
contained in mailings that mostly talked of sweepstakes prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing the argument that all the cancer council did was mail
brochures asking for money, Posner wrote that ``a charity whose
entire goal was to publish educational materials would spend all or
most of its revenues on publishing, but this would be in support,
rather than derogation, of its charitable purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wolf, the lawyer for Direct Response Consulting, said
that the decision was a victory for charities whose mission is
educating the public about unpopular causes.
</P>
<P>
   And Bill Olson, a lawyer for a coalition of charities that
supported the cancer council and Watson &AMP; Hughey, said that ``it is
refreshing to see that the Seventh Circuit saw through the IRS
effort to develop a new legal theory where it could exercise
unbridled discretion to attack disfavored nonprofits.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS declined comment. Nonetheless, the appeals court left
open a window for the IRS to pursue its case by sending the case
back to Tax Court for findings on whether Watson &AMP; Hughey gained a
``private benefit'' from the charitable funds, under another legal
standard that covers outsiders as well. Depending on what happens
in Tax Court, some lawyers said, the IRS might appeal to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Jack Shakely, president of the California
Community Foundation in Los Angeles, said that ``responsible
fund-raisers should be alarmed'' by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   If ``people come to believe that courts have upheld essentially
unlimited charitable fund-raising costs that go into the pockets of
commercial consultants, that's a problem that has the potential to
sweep across American philanthropy like a medieval epidemic,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer case is not the first time that Watson &AMP; Hughey's
methods have been criticized by law-enforcement officials and
various charity watchdogs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, New York and nine other states settled a case involving
sweepstakes that the firm ran for charities, extracting $2.2
million from Watson &AMP; Hughey, but no admission of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, the attorney general in 1996 accused the firm and
an obscure Tennessee charity known as the United Children's Fund of
filing false and misleading financial statements. Donors
contributed $2.5 million in response to mailed appeals to help
children fight cancer, but the charity spent no money on detecting
or preventing cancer in children. Without admitting wrongdoing,
Direct Response paid $110,000 to settle the Minnesota case last
August, and the charity paid $15,000.

DEMOCRATS WALK OUT OF HEARING IN PROTEST OVER CENSUS PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Fla.)   (af)  
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats Thursday walked out in protest at a House
panel hearing on the 2000 Census in a dispute over a Republican
proposal to require the Census Bureau to conduct recounts when
municipalities challenge the bureau's population figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats complained that a vote on the proposal was being
rushed through the House subcommittee on the Census without comment
from census officials and while the panel's ranking Democrat, Rep.
Carolyn Maloney of New York, was in the Netherlands as a delegate
to a United Nations conference on population.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., accused the
Democrats of playing political games and noted that Ms. Maloney had
returned from The Hague earlier this week to attend the Democrats'
retreat in Wintergreen, Va., but did not seem to be willing to
return for the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was passed by voice vote after the Democrats walked
out.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are pushing for the requirement as an alternative to
the use of statistical sampling in the next census. For their part,
the Democrats say the measure would force the bureau into an
expensive and futile effort that could keep it from completing its
counts on time.
</P>
<P>
   Miller also reacted to criticism from Kenneth Prewitt, the
director of the Census Bureau, who said lawmakers were trying to
``micro-manage'' preparations for the next decennial head count.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a bill sponsored by Miller mandating that the Census
Bureau permit local governments to challenge its population counts
in 2000, and requiring the bureau when challenged to send census
takers out to recanvass neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the bill would provide an ``audit,'' known as
the Post-Census Local Review, that could catch the bureau's
mistakes in its head count in 2000. Pushing the bill also provides
Republicans with the ability to say they are offering alternatives
to the use of statistical sampling, which the Census Bureau wants
to use to supplement the 2000 Census and Republicans are adamantly
against.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans fear and Democrats hope that statistical sampling
would increase the count of people living in some Democratic
congressional districts. That could give the Democrats an advantage
when boundaries for districts are redrawn in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau officials say that in 1990 they recanvassed 20 percent of
the nation's ``blocks'' _ roughly equivalent to city blocks _ after
local officials protested their population counts. The second count
cost more than $9 million and found only 124,000 more people out of
a total population of 248 million.

CELLUCCI SET TO PROPOSE CUT IN UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci will unveil a plan Friday to
slash the state's unemployment insurance rates, a move he claims
will save Massachusetts employers up to $200 million a year, or an
average of $85 per employee.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's proposal, slated to be announced at a State House
news conference, also will include language to change the method
for setting rates, administration sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are needed to reduce employers' costs and help make
the state more competitive, Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our unemployment insurance rates have gone down two years in a
row,'' Cellucci said Thursday in an address before the Greater
Boston Chamber of Commerce. ``But competitiveness is still an
extremely important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's plan won some support from House Speaker Thomas M.
Finneran, who said he generally favored reducing rates. But
Finneran stressed that he would reserve judgment until he read the
``fine print'' of Cellucci's bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain a high-cost state when it comes to unemployment
insurance so I am closely aligned with the governor's objectives,''
Finneran told the Globe. ``But I'd want to be sure that whatever
changes we make do not jeopardize the health of the trust fund and
that the members feel that workers are adequately protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Birmingham has held out for fewer rate reductions,
noting that although the unemployment insurance trust fund hit
about $1.2 billion in 1988, it was insolvent by 1992, when the
recession forced Massachusetts to borrow $400 million to support
workers who had lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses currently pay an average of $317 per employee in
unemployment insurance. The premium payments, made by employers,
are put in the unemployment trust fund, which funds benefits to
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
   Under Cellucci's plan, the average cost would drop to $217 per
worker, according to an administration source. If no action is
taken by the Legislature this year, the rates would automatically
go up in January. Thus, the proposal to lower, not just keep rates
as they are, would save businesses an estimated $85 per worker
based on the 2000 rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Industries of Massachusetts, representing
businesses, applauded the plan, while the Massachusetts AFL-CIO
cautioned against allowing the trust fund to dip to dangerous
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we have made progress in reducing the cost of
unemployment insurance, it's still among the highest in the
nation,'' said AIM's Brian Gilmore.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Nathan, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts AFL-CIO, said
the union looked forward to hearing more details, but sounded a
note of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only makes economic sense to fully fund the unemployment
trust fund in good economic times so that it may remain solvent in
bad times,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have continued to reduce rates as the unemployment
insurance trust fund grew from insolvency to its current $1.7
billion level. The administration argued that the fund currently
has enough money to provide for 29 months at today's unemployment
levels or 13 months during an economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   However, a commission appointed by Congress in 1993 advised
states to keep enough reserves on hand to pay up to 18 months of
benefits in a recession. Unions contend that if the state suffers
another recession, lawmakers will look not only to raise the tax on
employers but cut unemployment benefits to workers as well.
</P>
<P>
   The latest cut was enacted last year and went into effect this
year. The proposed cut would go into effect in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts charges companies among the highest unemployment
insurance rates in the country and offers workers some of the most
generous benefits, according to the governor's office.

TEACHING NEW HIRES TO FEEL AT HOME  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif.)  (af) 
 By PAUL SWEENEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Thomas D. White joined Foodmaker, the parent of the Jack in
the Box fast-food chain, as a vice president and regional manager,
he didn't do a lick of work at his new job for two months.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he went through a program, called ``on boarding,'' that
was intended to introduce him to the Foodmaker corporate culture
and operations. He flipped burgers and cooked fries. He was
assigned a mentor and met with a personal coach, who monitored his
progress.
</P>
<P>
   He observed the work of regional managers in Florida and
California. Only after completing the eight-week program did White,
a veteran of 15 years at Burger King, take the reins for the
Pacific Northwest region of the company, which is based in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the first time I've taken a new position and,
from Day 1, knew my duties and knew how to get things done in an
organization,'' White said. Without the on-boarding program, he
added, ``I would probably be six months to a year behind where I am
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate programs like Foodmaker's, a quantum leap from the
typical company's here's-your-desk, there's-the-rest-room
orientation, are still rare. But they are beginning to spread
because they can greatly reduce turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Foodmaker says that all but two of the 24 managers who completed
its on-boarding program in the last four years are still with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies invest heavily in management development. General
Electric reckons that it spends $1 billion a year on leadership
programs around the world. Companies as diverse as Wal-Mart Stores,
Boeing and Airtouch Communications have programs to foster
teamwork, communication and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Derek van Bever, chief research officer at the
Corporate Leadership Council, a Washington-based association of
human resources executives, the Foodmaker program ``is one of the
few instances where they make learning about the company your first
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Bever said the quick orientations at most companies did
little to help integrate talented newcomers, contributing to a
widespread and costly but little-publicized problem: a high washout
rate in the upper ranks of management.
</P>
<P>
   The council surveyed 25 large companies in 1997 and found that,
on average, half of the new hires in top echelons had quit or were
dismissed within three years; one company reported an 80 percent
washout rate.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, by Manchester Inc., a consulting firm in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa., 82 percent of human-resources executives said the
failure ``to build partnerships with peers and subordinates'' was
the most common reason for the premature departure of a newly
appointed manager.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate culture ``is incredibly important,'' said Marcia J.
Owen, director of human resources development at Foodmaker. ``It's
the framework in which you get your job done,'' she said. ``When
you introduce someone new into an organization, it's important that
the person understands the nuances of the group.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies squander a lot of money when new executive hires don't
stay. An executive search firm typically gets a fee of four months'
pay for the post being filled, and relocation expenses can run to
$100,000, said Gail Hamity Vergara, manager of the Chicago office
of Spencer Stuart, a search firm. Those costs must often be paid
again to hire a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   And it can take senior managers a long time to settle in. An
October 1998 survey, sponsored by Spencer Stuart, looked at 46
executives who had changed jobs in the previous 18 months.
One-third of the executives reported needing as long as a year to
adjust to the new company, while three-quarters said that adapting
to a new corporate culture was their highest hurdle, far ahead of
learning new business practices or mastering communications
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It often takes 18 months for people to get oriented, but many
organizations only give you 6 months,'' said Lewis R. Stern, a
senior vice president at Manchester Consulting. At many companies,
he added, ``there is no more honeymoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, total conformity may be the last thing a company
wants from new hires. Outsiders are often recruited specifically
for the new ideas and new experiences they can bring to a stale or
complacent company, said Regina Miller, director of organizational
development and training at Airtouch in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question becomes: How do you influence a culture that's
different, and how do you get people to accept new ideas?' '' she
said. ``That's why you were hired in the first place. But if you do
it by condemning the culture or being heavy-handed, you'll get
frozen out.''

SIMON FIREMAN SUES CAMPAIGN FINANCE DEFENSE TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Millionaire businessman Simon C. Fireman is suing the
lawyers who defended him in a 1996 federal campaign financing
scandal for malpractice, claiming they failed to make key arguments
that may have resulted in the charges against him being dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in Suffolk Superior Court, seeks more than $6
million in damages from Thomas E. Dwyer Jr. and his Boston firm,
Dwyer &AMP; Collora, in connection with Dwyer's representation of
Fireman and his company, Avon-based Aqua-Leisure Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations that Fireman had run an illegal campaign finance
scheme surfaced in the waning days of the 1996 presidential race.
Nearly $70,000 in donations to Republican candidate Bob Dole were
traced to Fireman, blunting Dole's criticisms that the Democratic
National Committee had accepted several hundred thousand dollars in
campaign contributions from a wealthy Indonesian family with ties
to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When a federal grand jury began investigating Fireman, he turned
to Dwyer, one of Boston's best-known criminal defense attorneys,
who specializes in getting charges dropped or negotiating plea
agreements before a case goes to trial. In recent years, Dwyer's
clients have included some of the state's most powerful political
personalities, including former House Speaker Charles Flaherty.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer helped negotiate a plea bargain on Fireman's behalf. But
in his lawsuit, Fireman alleges that Dwyer failed ``to raise
certain legal arguments'' that would have either resulted in a
dismissal of the charges or ``eliminated or reduced'' the $6
million in fines paid by Fireman and his company.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer, who was out of town Thursday, could not be reached for
comment. But William Kettlewell, Dwyer &AMP; Collora's managing
partner, said the suit is groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that Mr. Fireman could allege malpractice is
ridiculous given the outcome of the case and the gravity of it,''
Kettlewell said. He declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Fireman nor his attorney, Jonathan W. Lubell of New
York, could be reached for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The flamboyant Fireman, who has made millions from his water
sports equipment business, pleaded guilty to charges that he forced
employees to give a total of $120,000 to candidates on his behalf
between 1991 and 1995. Under the scheme, Fireman later reimbursed
the employees.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme was an attempt to circumvent the Federal Election
Campaign Act, which prohibits individual contributions of more than
$1,000 to a single candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Fireman claimed Dwyer should have argued that
the campaign finance law, by imposing the $1,000 limit, violated
Fireman's First Amendment rights of free expression and freedom of
association. The lawsuit also alleges that Dwyer ``repeatedly urged
and strongly encouraged'' him to plead guilty. Fireman also claims
that claimed that Dwyer assured him a guilty plea, according to
terms of an agreement with the US attorney's office, would result
in fines of only $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   After pleading guilty, Fireman received the stiffest penalty
ever imposed for an illegal campaign finance scheme, paying $1
million personally and another $5 million through his company. He
was also sentenced to six months of house arrest at his Marina Bay
home in Quincy.
</P>
<P>
   Fireman's lawsuit alleges that Dwyer should have asked the court
to reduce the fine the company paid by $850,000, under federal
guidelines that allow such reductions where both a firm and its
owner both are fined for the same offense. The lawsuit also alleges
that the $400,000 Dwyer's firm charged Fireman was not justified by
the actual time spent on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Dwyer and his firm, the lawsuit names Robert P.
Sherman, and his law firm, Hutchins Wheeler &AMP; Dittmar of Boston as
defendants. Sherman was a lawyer for Fireman's company and
represented the firm against the federal campaign charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that our client pleaded guilty to a felony and
the suit is completely without merit,'' said James Dittmar, a
partner in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is the latest twist in the campaign finance scandal
that engulfed Fireman, the uncle of Reebok founder and chairman
Paul Fireman.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, Simon Fireman's former assistant sued him for $1
million, claiming he had induced her to carry out the campaign
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant, Carol Nichols of Bridgewater, said at the time
that Fireman had talked her into pleading guilty to charges in the
scheme in exchange for a job for life.
</P>
<P>
   But in her lawsuit, she claimed that after serving four months
of house arrest, she was fired.

PRUNING PATRIOTS CUT COLLONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Patriots vice president Andy Wasynczuk was busy
throwing out the kitchen sink thursday in an effort to get the
team's salary cap number down to the $57.288 million allocated by
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Patriots terminated the contract of veteran
defensive end Ferric Collons, who was scheduled to earn a raise
from $535,000 to $2.1 million in 1999. But Collons's agent, Angelo
Wright, plans to file an injury grievance against the team,
claiming that Patriot doctors recently diagnosed a shoulder injury
as well as an existing finger injury. According to Wright, the
Patriots are in violation of the collective bargaining agreement
for cutting a player before he is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Collons was due a $725,000 lump sum payment on his contract
March 1, and Wright will argue that his shoulder and finger injury
will not be healed by that date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ferric is extremely disappointed,'' said Wright. ``He really
enjoyed playing in New England for the Patriots. I don't think this
is over, however.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Wasynczuk was reconfiguring deals for both
defensive end Willie McGinest and wide receiver Vincent Brisby and
expected them to be done by Friday, when teams can begin
negotiating with free agents from other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest, who signed a five-year, $25 million deal with an $8
million signing bonus last February, agreed to have money shifted
to make his contract more cap-friendly for the Patriots. Brisby,
scheduled to earn $1.8 million this season, was in the process of
having his contract renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots elected to hold off on renegotiating Drew Bledsoe's
pact, feeling that if they need to free up extra money down the
road, the quarterback and his agent, Leigh Steinberg, will be
willing to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's cap number for 1999 is $7.28 million, down a few
hundred thousand from last season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts to reduce payroll, the Patriots were risking
exposing all of their unrestricted free agents to the market. They
have designated center Dave Wohlabaugh and defensive tackle Henry
Thomas as their top priorities, but as of thursday night, while
negotiations were ongoing, agreements had not been reached with
either player.
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk said the Patriots decided not to place a franchise or
a transition tag on Wohlabaugh by Thursday's 4 p.m. deadline
because ``centers are classified as offensive linemen, and
offensive linemen are very expensive.'' Despite that sentiment, the
Patriots want to lock Wohlabaugh up on a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also want to retain linebacker Todd Collins, punter
Tom Tupa, and strong safety Larry Whigham, but the feeling was that
Wohlabaugh and Thomas came first. Tupa is likely earmarked for
Cleveland, his hometown, while the Cincinnati Bengals have
expressed great interest in Whigham.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also decided to tender offers to five restricted
free agents _ kicker Adam Vinatieri, linebacker Tedy Bruschi, tight
end Lovett Purnell, defensive end Chris Sullivan, and guard Heath
Irwin. The only restricted free agent not tendered was defensive
tackle Devin Wyman.
</P>
<P>
   The level of the tender offers is key. Last season the Patriots
tendered running back Curtis Martin at the highest level possible,
but the New York Jets sent him an offer sheet the Patriots didn't
match, so New England got first- and third-round draft picks as
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Bruschi may get the second-level tender of $1.246 million, which
would enable the team to retain right of first refusal and also
would require compensation of first- and third-round picks if
another team signed him and the Patriots didn't match.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had until midnight to decide on those levels.

FEDERAL JURY HOLDS GUN MAKERS LIABLE FOR SHOOTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to add 15 grafs at end)   (ATTN: N.Y., Fla., Ga., Va., N.C., Ohio, La.)  
(bl) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time, a jury has found that gun
manufacturers are liable for shootings with illegally obtained
handguns because of their negligent marketing and distribution
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, which
legal experts called a test case for a wave of suits that have
recently been filed against the gun industry by a number of large
cities, the jury found Thursday that 15 of 25 firearms makers named
in the suit had been negligent, and that as many as 9 of the 15
were liable for three shootings _ two of them fatal _ in the New
York City region in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that those nine manufacturers were collectively
liable for the shootings _ even though it was not proved what brand
of gun had been used in a particular shooting _ because their
marketing and distribution practices fostered illegal gun
trafficking from states with weak gun laws to those with strict
regulations, like New York.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors found liability where it had determined that the
companies' practices had been a ``proximate cause'' of the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury, in what appeared to be a compromise verdict,
awarded no damages to relatives of the two homicide victims in the
three shootings where it found liability. It found only that the
surviving victim was entitled to $3.95 million in damages _ though,
given the intricacies of the case, he would collect only about
$500,000 under the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also found that in four other homicide cases that were
part of the lawsuit, none of the 15 companies found to be negligent
overall were also shown to have had a ``proximate cause'' in the
killings and therefore none of those 15 were held liable in those
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was hailed as a victory by both sides. Lawyers for
the plaintiffs _ and the plaintiffs themselves _ said it was a
major win for the growing effort across the country to hold the gun
industry liable for bloodshed with illegally obtained firearms,
much as lawsuits have sought to hold the tobacco industry liable
for deaths and illnesses caused by smoking.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We held 15 of the 25 liable for negligence,'' the chief lawyer
for the plaintiffs in the suit, Elisa Barnes, said after the
verdict, which took a half hour to read and required a 42-page form
to deal with all the issues involved in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   And although the jury had found that the companies' negligent
distribution and marketing practices had not been a contributing
factor in four of the seven shootings in the case, she stressed the
three shootings in which the jury found that the negligence was a
contributing factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the hard work had been well worth it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the gun manufacturers held that the overall
verdict was a victory for the companies because there was no
finding of damages for six of the seven shootings that were
involved in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   As for the finding that the plaintiffs said was a major part of
their victory _ that 15 of the 25 companies involved in the verdict
had marketed and distributed their products negligently _ one of
the industry lawyers, James Dorr, said that that finding involved
``issues that are more appropriately submitted to legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer for the companies, John Renzulli, insisted that
``there's no rhyme or reason to this jury's verdict _ it makes no
sense,'' Other lawyers on the industry side held that the verdict
was the result of compromises by a jury that had clearly agonized
over the case during a week of deliberations that, their own notes
to the judge said, had been stormy at times and had led to several
threatened deadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 gun makers named in the suit included the giants of the
industry in the United States, like Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., Colt's
Manufacturing Co. and Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co. The plaintiffs were
relatives of six people killed with illegally obtained handguns in
New York City and Yonkers and a Queens teen-ager who survived a
seventh shooting with a bullet still lodged in his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Damages were awarded to Steven Fox, a Queens teen-ager who
survived an apparently accidental shooting with a bullet still
lodged in his brain.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the trial is expected to be assessed not only by
the firearms industry and gun control advocates but by lawyers for
Chicago and other cities that have recently filed, or plan to file,
suits making similar arguments against the gun industry, much as
states have sued cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   Still other suits, filed by cities like New Orleans and Miami,
are based on a different argument: that the gun makers have failed
to include sufficient safety devices in their products. All the
cities' suits are intended to recoup law-enforcement and hospital
costs stemming from gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   In only one of the shootings was a gun recovered. But the
plaintiffs' chief lawyer, Elisa Barnes, told the jury that this
``simply doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnes and her trial colleagues _ Denise Dunleavy, Michael
Feldberg and Marc Elovitz _ asserted that the gun makers made no
attempts to keep their products from falling into criminal hands,
like requiring wholesalers not to supply dealers suspected of
selling the weapons to questionable buyers. ``They don't care,''
Feldberg declared of the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   And the plaintiffs accused the gun makers of oversupplying
dealers in states with weak gun control laws or weakly enforced
laws, particularly in the South. Many of the excess guns, they
said, end up in the hands of illicit traffickers who resell them to
criminals and youths in states with strong gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   An expert for the plaintiffs, Lucy Allen of National Economic
Research Associates, based in New York, testified that 90 percent
of the handguns used in crimes in New York state in recent years
had come from other states _ nearly half from five states that the
plaintiffs' lawyers described as ``weak law'' or ``lax
enforcement'' states: Florida, Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina
and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen lawyers for the gun makers denied that their clients
oversupplied states that had lax laws.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sitting on two folding metal chairs in between the
candy counter and the magazine rack of a convenience store on 14th
Street in Manhattan, Kadiadou and Saikou Diallo sat Thursday and
listened to a community tell stories about their son.
</P>
<P>
   A cashier told them that their son had urged him every day to
stop drinking. The owner of the store showed them the videotapes
that the son, Amadou Diallo, had sold on a table out front, a job
in which he never missed a day. And an imam told them Diallo was a
good Muslim, presenting the parents with the silk rug that he used
to kneel upon to pray.
</P>
<P>
   As the people in the convenience store near Second Avenue spoke,
Mrs. Diallo listened, rocking and sobbing in the same cream-colored
chair that her son had used to sell his wares. Saikou Diallo sat
next to her, struggling to keep his deep voice steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good boy,'' Diallo said over and over. ``He was a
very good boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Amadou Diallo, a 22-year-old Guinean immigrant, died last week
in a storm of 41 bullets fired at him by four New York City police
officers as they followed him into his Bronx home. The shooting of
Diallo, who was unarmed, has prompted angry protests and calls for
a federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But his parents said they came to New York to learn about their
son's life in the city during the last two years as much as to
press for justice over his death.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving in the city this week, they have visited the
places most important to him _ the small, red-brick apartment
building in the Bronx where he lived and died, the convenience
store outside of which he worked and the homes of several relatives
in town.
</P>
<P>
   They said that they were proud to find that while their son
struggled to make ends meet with earnings of about $20 a day and
occasional help from home, his life was one of honesty and
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amadou was from Guinea,'' said Mrs. Diallo during an interview
Thursday night, ``but now, Amadou is from the whole world because
the whole world is sympathizing with us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Interviews with the Diallos and with people who knew their slain
son provide a complicated portrait of a generous man, full of the
curiosity and optimism of youth. Known by everyone as Ahmed, he
lived the life of a street peddler, selling tube socks and
videotapes. But his story is not like the oft-told tale of an
immigrant who comes to America to support a poverty-stricken family
back home.
</P>
<P>
   He came from a well-to-do family and left a home that some
describe as a mansion. His father works as an art merchant who
travels between Guinea and Vietnam. And Amadou studied English and
computer engineering in private schools in Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Sept. 2, 1976, Amadou Diallo was the oldest of four
children. His parents said he came to America to pursue his dreams
for a college education and for adventure. He loved to read
newspapers and planned to take classes to improve his English, get
his high school equivalency diploma and eventually enroll in
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amadou was the kind of boy who had ambition to go to school
and to be somebody,'' Saikou Diallo said.
</P>
<P>
   His son was a Muslim who prayed in a crowded storeroom five
times a day. In January, the last time Diallo spoke to his son,
they talked about Ramadan, and the son assured the father that he
was observing the ritual fasts.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Amadou Diallo often reached into his pocket to give
a dollar to the beggars who passed the store where he worked, or to
loan money to students at the high school across the street. One
student, Mohammed Ahmed, said Diallo had recently loaned him $43 to
help pay his income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But while Diallo was happy with his life in New York, friends
said he also missed his family, especially his mother. He
considered going to live with a brother in Angola, but he thought
that country, torn by civil strife, was too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was destiny,'' Mrs. Amadou reflected, when asked
why her son chose to come to the United States. ``God sent him here
for a mission and now he has completed that mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days, the Diallos have shunned offers for
police escorts as they have traveled around the city to visit with
the people who knew their son. The parents, bleary-eyed from sorrow
and exhaustion, spoke Thursday at the end of an afternoon with
their son's friends and family. They said they did not mind the
intense news coverage ignited by their visit here, and instead said
they felt strengthened by the thousands of people who had gathered
over the last week at demonstrations and meetings to protest their
son's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have given me the courage to stand here because all of you
have stood by us,'' Mrs. Diallo said at a community meeting in
Harlem. ``We are crying.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo arrived Tuesday from Conakry, the capital of Guinea,
and went immediately to the vestibule, about the size of a walk-in
closet, where her son was shot by officers who were searching the
Soundview neighborhood for a rapist. When Saikou arrived the next
day from Hanoi, he stopped for a shower and went there as well.
</P>
<P>
   Candles lighted the dark hallway that was filled with flowers,
posters and sympathy cards. The walls were pocked with bullet
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo collapsed in the entryway, wailing her son's name.
Saikou Diallo, often restrained and reserved, would say only that
he expects city officials to deal fairly with the officers in the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the parents, who have been divorced for several years,
went to the apartment to retrieve their son's belongings. Most of
what he owned, they said, were books on Christianity, Islam and
computer science.
</P>
<P>
   He loved watching basketball on television, friends and
neighbors said. A fan of the Chicago Bulls, Amadou Diallo lamented
for days after Michael Jordan resigned. And he had begun developing
an interest in American football. Friends said he went with them to
the All-Star Cafe to watch the Super Bowl, cheering for the
triumphant Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo said that in her last conversation with her son, by
telephone on the Sunday before his death, he asked whether his
younger brothers were doing well in school. If so, he promised, he
would send the siblings Michael Jordan sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Essome, the producer of a public access television program
called ``Africa News'' and a family acquaintance, said that Amadou
Diallo had few options for work in the United States because, while
he had a student visa that was scheduled to expire this spring, he
did not have the necessary work permit.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said that Amadou Diallo could not enroll immediately in
college because institutions here would not recognize his foreign
high-school diploma. Essome, an immigrant from Cameroon, said
Amadou Diallo first had to get a high-school equivalency diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo said he was not ashamed of the way his son made a living.
``He was doing everything right,'' Mr. Diallo said. ``He was
working hard, fulfilling his responsibilities and getting the money
to pay for his daily meals.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Diallos went to the C&AMP;B Convenience Store on 14th
Street, where their son spent most of his days. The owner of the
store, Shahin Chowdhury, 37, and his brothers had turned the store
into a shrine for Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   A tear rolled down his cheek, and he said, ``He was a jewel. I
will never forget him.''

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC TO CUT 2,000 JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Scientific Corp. said Thursday it would cut about 2,000
jobs as part of a restructuring following several acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs will leave the Natick, Mass. maker of medical
devices with about 12,000 employees worldwide by the end of 1999,
including 2,500 in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific also said it would spend about $62 million on
severance costs, reducing its fourth-quarter earnings by $26
million, or about 4 cents a share after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The charges had been expected by analysts, said company chief
financial officer Larry Best. They come as Boston Scientific
absorbs the operations of Schneider Worldwide, a medical-devices
company it purchased in September from Pfizer Inc. for $2.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition followed several other purchases that Boston
Scientific expects will increase revenue to about $3 billion this
year from $1.1 billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider Worldwide is best known as the maker of plastic
devices called ``stents'' used to clear arteries. The company had
employeed 2,200 people at facilities in Plymouth, Minn., Miami,
Puerto Rico, and in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 of the former Schneider jobs will be eliminated as
part of what Best called ``a rationalization of manufacturing.''
That will also include the shifting of balloon-catheter
manufacturing to an existing plant in Galway, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those operations are currently performed in its
Watertown, Mass. facility. As a result, Boston Scientific will also
cut about 250 jobs there over the next three months, leaving about
750 workers at the plant. In addition to that site, Boston
Scientific currently employees 1,500 others in the state at its
headquarters in Natick and at a large distribution facility in
Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the latter two facilities won't be affected by the
reorganization, Best said.
</P>
<P>
   Best said the company expected to add more jobs than it was
cutting locally because of growing sales of other products. By the
end of the year, Best said, the cuts will have been more than
offset by about 325 new jobs added in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Growing sales come from the company's purchases in recent years
including SciMed Life Systems Inc., Heart Technology Inc., and
Target Therapeutics Inc. But the expansion campaign has been marred
by several interruptions recently. In December Boston Scientific
said it faced a Justice Department inquiry in connection with a
stent system it had previously recalled. Also, in November the
company disclosed what it called ``irregular'' sales at its
Japanese unit totaling around $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   No civil or criminal charges have been filed in either matter,
and the company is cooperating with US authorities in the first
matter, Best said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Boston Scientific rose 5/8 to close at 26 in New York
Stock Exchange trading. The restructuring was announced after the
close of trading.

GOVERNMENT'S LAWYER RAISES MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT MICROSOFT
DEMONSTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the Microsoft trial Thursday, the government
attacked a key assertion in the company's defense: that bundling a
Web browser with Microsoft's Windows operating system is not
anti-competitive because consumers can quickly and easily download
a competing browser from the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   That was the central message of a videotape demonstration that
lawyers for Microsoft Corp. played Thursday morning. And, as has
become routine in this case, David Boies, the government's lead
trial lawyer, immediately attacked the video as misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, he said, had edited out the parts of the
demonstration that were difficult and time consuming, leaving the
false impression that downloading huge programs from the Internet
was a simple, quick and painless operation.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the day, Boies proposed playing a videotape
demonstration of his own. This one, government officials said,
would show the complex steps that an America Online subscriber must
take to download Netscape Communications &UR;  &LR; Corp.'s Navigator browser
and install it on a computer, mirroring one of Microsoft's edited
demonstrations. Navigator is the chief rival to Microsoft's
browser, Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lawyers, taken by surprise, asked to study the tape
during the weekend, just as the government has been able to study
Microsoft's tapes in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Chase, Microsoft's chief marketing officer, directed the
production of Microsoft's demonstration Thursday and took the stand
in the morning. And while he held up better under cross-examination
than some previous Microsoft witnesses, Boies accused him of making
misleading statements and assertions in his testimony _ in addition
to pointing out problems with his videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Boies noted that Microsoft had chosen to edit out the time it
had taken to complete the download. After the download began, the
videotape's narrator said only, ``This will take a few minutes and
could take longer depending on your connection,'' and the tape then
cut away.
</P>
<P>
   Chase acknowledged that his staff had been using a high-speed
corporate line that would be unavailable to most users. But even
with a low-speed line, Chase said, downloading a program would be
faster than driving to a store to buy the software.
</P>
<P>
   Boies then displayed a memo that Kumar Mehta, another Microsoft
employee, had written to Chase in March 1997, recounting the
results of a study conducted by the company. ``Almost 60 percent of
all surfers never download anything from the Web,'' Mehta wrote,
``and my sense is that these people are not likely to download
anything _ let alone a browser that takes two hours to download
from the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase said he disagreed with that characterization and added
that Mehta ``was probably being dramatic on purpose.'' In fact,
Chase volunteered, Netscape announced last fall that 12.4 million
people downloaded the company's browser in July and August. But in
that attempt to prove that the process was easy, he fell into a
trap.
</P>
<P>
   Boies pulled data from Chase's own written testimony showing
that by last summer, only 6.7 million people in the United States
had ever downloaded Netscape and used it as their primary browser.
</P>
<P>
   Chase then hypothesized that the 12.4 million new users were
mostly foreigners, or people who had taken the time to download
Netscape but did not use it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, he asserted, ``We have had 11 million successful
downloads'' of Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   But Boies pounced on that, asking Chase if he had documentary
evidence of this. No, Chase finally acknowledged, he did not know
where his staff had gotten the figure or on what it was based.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, Boies used a Microsoft videotape shown earlier
in the trial to demonstrate conflicts in Microsoft's defense.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Microsoft is trying to show that integrating a Web
browser with Windows is a great benefit to users because it saves
them the time and difficulty of acquiring a browser on their own. A
federal appeals court ruling last year said that bundling the
browser with Windows was justified if users benefited.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Microsoft is also trying to show that
downloading an alternative browser is fast and painless, to defang
the government's charge that bundling the browser is
anticompetitive.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier tape, a Microsoft employee, while extolling the
virtues of integration as a benefit to consumers, describes some of
the hassles of installing another browser and adds that these
difficulties do not ``take into account the set-up time, which for
a large number of users is cumbersome and not straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do agree it's easier if you get it on your system,'' Chase
acknowledged. &QL;

NEWS ANALYSIS: WHY UNION MEMBERS TURN TO THE SICKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (With AMR-PILOTS)  
(lh) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The thousands of American Airlines pilots who have called in
sick as part of a messy labor standoff have adopted a time-honored
union tactic _ a sort of strike without striking.
</P>
<P>
   For the angry workers, such a tactic has some advantages. For
one thing, it enables unions to shut down much of their employers'
operations when they would otherwise be barred from striking under
an existing contract, as is the case with the American pilots.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, there is another big advantage: While calling in sick,
the pilots, members of the Allied Pilots Association, continue to
get paid, something that would not happen if they went on strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works, it's great,'' said Julius Getman, a labor law
professor at the University of Texas. ``All unions are looking
around for ways to apply pressure that don't involve the dangers
and losses of strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   While the sickout seems to be working well so far for the
pilots' union, it has one major downside _ it greatly
inconveniences and angers passengers, who, of course, are the
lifeblood of any airline.
</P>
<P>
   Union sickouts occur perhaps as frequently as an influenza
outbreak. Every few years, New York City police, knowing they are
barred from striking, catch the ``blue flu.'' Last Christmas,
several hundred flight attendants at Trans World Airlines called in
sick. And several American Airlines pilots recall taking part in
much smaller sickouts during the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as old as the hills,'' said David Walkowitz, a labor
historian at New York University. ``It's a way of trying to get
around government or contract restrictions that would be imposed on
strikers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed up that hundreds of pilots have called in sick since
Saturday, American Airlines, a unit of AMR, persuaded Judge Joe
Kendall of U.S. District Court in Dallas to order the pilots on
Wednesday to return to work. But the airline and many passengers
were stunned Thursday when 2,400 pilots of the airline's 9,200
phoned in sick _ the most of any day since the job action began _
forcing the cancellation of about half of American's flights.
</P>
<P>
   This escalation pointed to another advantage of using sickouts.
It is often hard for courts to punish union leaders for fomenting
such job actions because sickouts often continue even when union
leaders officially ask that they be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor history demonstrates that sometimes when you violate a
judge's order, that helps to build solidarity,'' Getman said.
``Pilots are guys who are basically tough guys. If this injunction
builds the union's militancy, it's not at all in American Airlines'
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots have called in sick primarily because they are angry
about American's recent acquisition of Reno Air, a small Western
airline, and the time American plans to take to integrate Reno's
operations into its network. But the American pilots have
longstanding complaints that previously culminated in an attempted
strike two years ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Representatives of the pilots' union are expected to appear in
court Friday to explain why the union is not in contempt of
Kendall's order. Late Thursday, the union issued a strong plea
calling on the pilots to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots association is urging all of the pilots in
compliance with the temporary restraining order to return to work
if they're not sick,'' said Tom Kachmar, a union spokesman who is
also a Dallas-based 767 captain for American. ``As far as what each
individual pilot is doing, I can't speak to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some labor analysts and American Airlines managers have
suggested that the union leaders may be giving a stream of winks
and nods to encourage a continued sickout _ something the union
denies. Behind the scenes, some company officials are saying a
union vice president, Brian A. Mayhew, is responsible.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Boyd, chief executive of a Colorado-based consulting
firm that once advised the union, said: ``The union leadership
cannot control its rank and file. At this point, it's the grass
roots. The company's trying to say that it's Brian Mayhew, that
he's the Darth Vader. That's just an orchestrated attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Among labor experts, there is agreement that it would be
difficult for Kendall to find individual pilots in contempt of his
order. The reason: the airline might have to provide proof that
pilots who called in sick were actually healthy.
</P>
<P>
   If this tactic is so successful, why is it so rarely used? Most
unions have the right to strike and feel no need to resort to
sickouts. And the tactic often flops because not enough members are
willing to take part.
</P>
<P>
   Several labor experts said shrewd unions tried not to overuse
the sickout tactic because it did severe damage to customer
relations, thus hurting business and perhaps endangering union
members' job security.
</P>
<P>
   Since Saturday, tens of thousands of American passengers have
had their travel plans disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a downside,'' said Boyd, the aviation
consultant. ``Guess who gets the short end of the stick _ the
customer. You can imagine people saying, `We have summer vacation
coming up and we're going to fly United instead.' That's the
long-term hurt of this.''

THE OFFICIAL RECORD: WHAT THE SENATORS SAY THEY SAID 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID STOUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If all goes as expected, the Senate will vote
Friday to acquit President Clinton. Within hours, there will be a
record of what the senators said in their secret deliberations _ or
rather, what they said they said.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the Congressional Record containing statements by the
senators will be available Saturday morning, at least to those
relatively few people who can acquire them on a Saturday, when most
government buildings are closed. For the rest of the curious, they
will be available early next week from the Government Printing
Office.
</P>
<P>
   But if a reader does not want to wait for an old-fashioned paper
copy of the Congressional Record, and is reasonably friendly with a
computer, he or she can log on on Saturday morning to the
Superintendent of Documents home page:
</P>
<P>
   www.access.gpo.gov/sudocs
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the official record will be anti-climactic, since some
senators have been relatively free in publicly summarizing the
remarks they have been uttering in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate rules, the official transcripts of the secret
deliberations will not be available for 20 years. Since what a
senator puts in the Congressional Record can be amended or
sanitized, sticklers for detail will have to wait to compare what
senators said they said to what they really said.

   PILOTS FOR AMERICAN AIRLINES DEFY A BACK TO WORK ORDER
</P>
<P>
   Pilots for American Airlines defied a federal judge's order to
end their sickout. Instead 2,400 pilots called in sick, forcing the
carrier to cancel more than half its 2,250 flights.
</P>
<P>
   American filed a motion for contempt in U.S. District Court in
Texas, charging that the union that represents American's 9,200
pilots had not complied with the judge's order to end the sickout.
A hearing is scheduled for Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots have adopted a time-honored union tactic _ a sort of
strike without striking. While it seems to be working for them, it
is has angered passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist industry's high hopes that the back-to-work order
would end the disruptions were quickly dashed as the carrier was
forced to cancel 1,170 flights _ many to popular resorts in Florida
and the Caribbean for people celebrating Presidents Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   FEDERATED SET TO ACQUIRE FINGERHUT
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Fingerhut rose $5.5625, to $24.375, after Federated
Department Stores agreed to buy the catalog company with
direct-marketing and online sales expertise for $1.5 billion.
Federated, which is the parent of Bloomingdale's, Macy's and Bon
Marche, will also assume $205 million in debt. The purchase of
Fingerhut is an attempt by Federated to move aggressively into
electronic commerce.

   GM WILL NOT REACH MARKET GOAL
</P>
<P>
   The nation's prosperity and low gas prices have hurt General

pickup trucks. As a result, the automaker will not be regaining
market share this year.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT: DOWNLOADING IS EASY
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft contended that bundling a Web browser with the Windows
operating system is not anti-competitive because consumers can
quickly and easily download a competing browser from the Web. But
as the antitrust lawsuit against the software maker continued, the
government responded that such a move was difficult and time
consuming.

   MEXICAN BANK TO BE DELISTED

previously planned. The moves are expected to save the company
about $1.25 million over the next three years. It's unclear whether

PRE-EMPTIVE PLEA OF GUILTY IS REJECTED IN MURDER CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID W. CHEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Siding with prosecutors, a judge in Dutchess County, N.Y.,
Thursday rejected an attempt by the defendant in a serial murder
case to plead guilty and avoid the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Thomas J. Dolan, ruled that the attempt by Kendall L.
Francois to plead guilty before the prosecutor announced whether he
would seek the death penalty was a premature and unlawful action
that would undermine the judicial process.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also suggested that if the plea were allowed to go
through, he would be endorsing ``a race to the courthouse'' to
enter a guilty plea and ``a loss of any meaningful plea
bargaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois, an unemployed school aide, was arrested last September
and charged with murdering eight prostitutes and hiding their
decaying remains at his home in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He later
confessed to the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In December, he tried to plead guilty _ with a maximum sentence
of life without parole _ before prosecutors even announced whether
they would seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But William V. Grady, the Dutchess County district attorney,
asked the judge to reject the attempt to plead, saying that it was
contrary to the spirit of a fresh ruling by the state Court of
Appeals that voided most of the plea-bargaining provisions in the
state's death penalty law.
</P>
<P>
   Given the tendency of judges to defer to prosecutors in
procedural matters relating to criminal cases, the ruling by Dolan
did not shock anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Grady said that his office was pleased, and in
an interview, Randolph F. Treece, a lawyer for Francois, said that
he was disappointed but not surprised. He said he was considering
appealing the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the element of surprise, though, lawyers and legal
scholars had been talking for weeks about the issues raised by
Francois' attempted plea, saying that the case was not only a test
of the Court of Appeals' recent ruling but that it also exposed
weaknesses in the state's death penalty law.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the only state whose death penalty law carries a
different maximum punishment for a plea bargain and for a
conviction trial. Given that, the Court of Appeals, in considering
several unrelated cases, ruled on Dec. 22 that the death penalty
law unfairly encouraged defendants to plead guilty rather than risk
a death sentence by going to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Francois' lawyers tried to enter a guilty plea to
all 17 counts of murder and assault in the deaths of the 8 women.
</P>
<P>
   The plea, his lawyers said, was based on their reading of the
Court of Appeals ruling to mean that a defendant could plead guilty
to the maximum sentence, without prosecutorial consent, before the
120-day window in which prosecutors were given to decide whether to
pursue the death penalty had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers _ including the president of the New York State
District Attorneys Association _ hinted that they agreed with that
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   But Grady disagreed, and he announced on Dec. 24 that he would
seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's ruling, Dolan _ who, before his election in 1992
had worked for 20 years as an assistant district attorney in
Dutchess County _ dismissed the defendant's ``narrow, technical
interpretation'' as one that would render existing law ``totally
ineffective and meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the only time it would be possible for Francois to
plead guilty would be if _ and only if _ the district attorney
decides to seek the death penalty and then later withdraws that
notice, Dolan wrote _ a set of circumstances that is a remote
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the death penalty said that they were discouraged,
even baffled, by Dolan's decision, saying that it would be even
more difficult for murder defendants to receive a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge is turning legislative intent totally on its head,
and he is turning the logic of the Court of Appeals on its head,''
said Ronald J. Tabak, president of New York Lawyers Against the
Death Penalty, who added that the judge had misinterpreted the
Appeals Court's decision.

SENATE, CLINTON: HIGH NOON IS FRIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Entering the twilight of the impeachment ordeal,
President Clinton was on the verge Thursday night of gaining
majority support for his acquittal when the Senate casts historic
votes Friday on whether to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine emerged as the fourth
Republican to formally announce she will oppose convicting the
president on both of the impeachment counts, giving Clinton 49
votes in the 100-member Senate if all 45 Democrats stand by him, as
they are considered likely to do.
</P>
<P>
   Two senators said Snowe's GOP colleague from Maine, Senator
Susan M. Collins, also said during the third day of closed-door
deliberations in the impeachment trial that she will vote to acquit
Clinton. Collins's spokeswoman declined to comment Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   If Collins votes to clear Clinton when the Senate roll is
called, expected around noon Friday, history could record that the
House Republican impeachment managers failed to persuade even a
simple majority in the GOP-controlled Senate of the president's
guilt. The votes, on Abraham Lincoln's birthday, will follow the
final closed-door statements Friday morning by four senators,
including each party's Senate leader.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's accusers never were within range of mustering the
two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, needed to convict a president and
automatically remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   With the last measures of suspense dwindling, a bipartisan
effort to formally censure the president teetered on the brink of
extinction, as a leading conservative Republican, Senator Phil
Gramm of Texas, vowed to kill the initiative immediately after
Clinton is cleared.
</P>
<P>
   The development unfolded as senators, divided largely along
party lines, emerged from the closed-door deliberations and
disclosed their positions on the two articles of impeachment
charging Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Snowe said in a prepared statement, ``the only
way I could approach this case was to ask myself, if I were the
deciding vote, could I remove this president under these
circumstances? The answer, I have concluded, is no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart and in my mind, I believe to a moral certainty
that my verdict is just,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe is one of several GOP moderates from New England seen as
likely to oppose Clinton's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont said he expected Snowe and
Collins to join him and at least two other Republicans _ John H.
Chafee of Rhode Island and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania _ in
helping reach his ``goal'' of keeping the House managers from
achieving a majority on either article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that we don't sanctify the charges with
a majority vote that would set a new standard for impeachment by
legitimizing the Paula Jones case,'' Jeffords said, referring to
the underlying sexual harassment lawsuit that Paula Corbin Jones
filed against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords said earlier that he believed Clinton's actions were
``low and tawdry,'' not high crimes and misdemeanors. And he
expressed concern that lowering the impeachment threshold could put
future presidents at risk of being removed for the ``slightest
indiscretion.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican managers braced for the setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good,'' Representative Chris Cannon, a manager from
Utah, said of the apparent failure to gain a majority for either
charge.
</P>
<P>
   But Cannon blamed the Senate for limiting the scope and length
of the House team's presentation. ``I don't know how anything could
be more embarrassing than the process we've just gone through where
we didn't have a chance to even present our case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Schippers, the chief investigative counsel for the
Republican managers, was more blunt. ``The whole trial was a
sham,'' Schippers said. ``I felt that the managers were cut off at
the knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Another subplot emerged as Republicans blasted the White House
over a report in The New York Times that quoted Clinton advisers as
saying the president plans to wage a vigorous campaign to win back
the House and defeat some of the GOP lawmakers who led the
impeachment effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is deeply troubling that the president views closure of
this constitutional process as an opportunity for revenge,'' said
the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were the president, the only R word I would be worrying
about is rehabilitation,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The White House denied Clinton was targeting any House managers
over their impeachment effort, as did Senator Edward M. Kennedy,
whose son, Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, is
chairman of the House reelection committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to the president fairly frequently about it,''
Senator Kennedy said. ``I think he'll work hard for the Democrats,
but I never heard him mention individuals at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the tensions, the Senate chaplain, the Rev. Lloyd J.
Ogilvie, appeared to direct his morning prayer both at the White
House and the Senate. ``This is a time neither for gloating over
victory nor grimness over losing, but rather a period for grief for
all that has brought us to this day,'' Ogilvie said.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe was in a minority among Republicans who formally announced
their positions Thursday, as the rest said they will vote to
convict Clinton on at least one charge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public opposition and the strong economy, said Senator
Gordon Smith, an Oregon Republican, he will vote to convict Clinton
``because I refuse to say that high political polls and soaring
Wall Street indexes give license to those in high places to act in
low and illegal ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Republicans who announced they will vote for Clinton's
conviction were Senators Robert F. Bennett of Utah and Chuck Hagel
of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen Democrats made their announcements, describing
Clinton's conduct as ``disgraceful,'' ``dishonorable,''
``disreputable,'' ``diabolical,'' and ``reprehensible,'' but not
impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   The only Democrat who is seen as possibly remaining undecided is
Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who will be among the last
four speakers in the private session Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Several New England Democrats were among those formally
supporting Clinton's acquittal, including Senators Patrick J. Leahy
of Vermont, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, and Jack Reed of
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   The only New Englanders who have yet to state their positions
are Collins and the two New Hampshire senators, Bob Smith and Judd
Gregg. Aides to the three said they will not officially disclose
their views until they vote.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist will open Friday's final
scene by reading Article I of Senate Resolution 30. Article I is
the perjury charge, which alleges Clinton warrants removal because
he ``willfully corrupted'' his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator, how say you?'' Rehnquist will ask. ``Is the
president, William Jefferson Clinton, guilty or not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   The roll will then be called, with each senator responding
``guilty'' or ``not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   After a vote on Article II, the obstruction charge, the rules
require the secretary of the Senate to deliver the final judgment
to the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright. If she receives the
notice, Albright presumably will tell Clinton what he already will
know: that he has avoided becoming the first president forced from
office after an impeachment trial.

SPORTS COLUMN: HSHADOWS STILL LOOM OVER OLYMPIC GAMES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The Olympic scandal is not over. To be sure,
there will be Summer Games in Sydney in 2000 and Winter Games in
this insular little outpost in 2002, but the so-called Olympic
movement is still covered by a legal haze far more toxic than the
inversion that often hangs over Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   It is most decidedly not over. The devastating proof came
Thursday when James Easton, one of two American delegates to the
International Olympic Committee, admitted that he, like other
American business people, had hired the child of an IOC delegate to
work at his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hindsight is wonderful,'' Easton said, insisting he had done
nothing wrong, and adding that the college student had earned his
salary. If somebody had said, `He's not going to show up for work,'
I'd have said `Absolutely not.'''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father, David Sibandze of Swaziland, recently resigned
as an IOC delegate after being charged with receiving favors. There
is no record of Easton's hiring people from overseas whose parents
were not voting members of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Easton's tie to the Olympics? He represents archery. Easton's
private business? He manufactures archery equipment. Arrangements
like this have been considered perfectly normal in the Olympic
movement, at least until recently, when emissions from noxious
business ties began to blot out the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Juan Antonio Samaranch, age 78, who figuratively
dozed through the decade when the shakedowns occurred, seems
totally prepared to brazen out his last two years as IOC president.
</P>
<P>
   Now Salt Lake City tries to get back to the lucrative business
of presenting sporting events. The organizing committee held one of
its new-style open-door meetings Thursday to unveil its
squeaky-clean new chief executive, Mitt Romney, with his
oh-so-reassuring ties to big money and the inner elite of this town
dominated by his fellow Mormons. Romney conceded a few business
links with Olympic-friendly corporations, but said he would
dissolve them as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The world was assured that all is well now that committee
members who bent the rules _ all three of them _ have been purged.
Then three board members with blatant conflicts of interest did the
honorable thing and resigned.
</P>
<P>
   One outgoing board member is building the speed-skating site.
One owns resorts up near the Olympic sites. A third is the head of
the power company. The scary part is that nobody in power in this
lock-step community ever considered these interlocking ties to be a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olympic corruption did not start here,'' Gov. Mike Leavitt
insisted. ``But today it ends here.''
</P>
<P>
   Would that it were so easy. It is almost frightening how
instinctively the smug burghers of the region insinuated themselves
onto boards in the name of public service, knew how to bestow
lavish gifts on foreign delegates and their spouses and offer cushy
jobs to their offspring.
</P>
<P>
   It is virtually impossible to believe they were mere innocents
shaken down by cynical visitors from distant lands, from cultures
not nearly as honest as ours, hear-hear!
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting ended, Easton was questioned about his
history of hiring a delegate's child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm tainted by this brush of `IOC corruption,''' Easton
said, adding that he hoped the IOC delegates who have been charged
with taking payments will resign by the next meeting in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have faith we can pull it off,'' Easton said, oddly
suggesting he might consider resigning from the IOC. if the accused
members did not resign.
</P>
<P>
   It is not over. David D'Alessandro, the president of John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance, has pushed reform by saying he would
hold up sponsorship, and Thursday in New York other major sponsors
seemed to be listening to his alarms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think D'Alessandro is a terrific fellow,'' gushed Romney,
who sports a disconcertingly incessant grin. ``I'm an enormous
optimist. I believe you'll see John Hancock and others standing in
line.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The old-boy image of Salt Lake City will not be helped by the
very public sight of Robert Garff, the chairman of the committee,
making a surly response to a trustee, Lillian Taylor, who had
requested more complete documents.
</P>
<P>
   Garff blurted that it would be helpful if he had Taylor's new
telephone number and address, whereupon Taylor said the committee
knew where she was living, and that she resented his remark.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a management executive who recently moved back to Utah
to serve the committee, said she had been ``publicly humiliated''
by Garff, who denied any hostile intent. A colleague depicted Garff
as a kind leader, but the public perception of the Salt Lake City
Games may not yet have hit bottom.  &QL;

SALT LAKE COMMITTEE TRIES TO CHART A NEW BEGINNING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Two days after a scathing ethics report on this
city's successful bid to host the 2002 Winter Olympics, the Salt
Lake Organizing Committee's Board of Trustees Thursday approved a
wide-ranging overhaul plan that includes new ethical guidelines,
new members, new leadership and a promise of greater openness to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Committee officials, led by Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, said they
hoped the changes, which include stricter rules on conflict of
interest, would refocus attention on the Games after two months of
scandal and assure the public that past mistakes will not be
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   The members also ratified the appointment of a new chief
executive officer, W. Mitt Romney, an investor and politician from
Boston who has deep Utah roots, and accepted the resignation of
three board members, including two businessmen whose companies have
contracts with the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot change history,'' the governor said in opening the
meeting. ``Today we will move boldly and decisively for a new
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The board's meeting, conducted in front of cameras and reporters
from around the world in a downtown hotel ballroom, was full of
imagery about forward motion, higher ethical standards and greater
public accountability. But the committee officials at the same time
said that discussion of the Board of Ethics report released on
Tuesday was now essentially closed.
</P>
<P>
   They declined to answer any further questions about the report
and said that its panel of investigators had also agreed among
themselves not to have any further public comment about their work,
its conclusions, or its implications.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics panel, led by a former state Supreme Court justice,
concluded that two former leaders of the committee, Thomas K.
Welch, its president, and David R. Johnson, its vice president, had
acted unethically and improperly in channeling payments and
extravagant gifts to members of the International Olympic Committee
to win votes for Salt Lake City. The city won the 2002 Games in a
lopsided vote in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the report said that the Board of Trustees as well as the
smaller executive committee that worked most closely with Welch and
Johnson knew nothing at all about their improper activities.
Johnson resigned earlier this year. Welch resigned in 1997 after
pleading no contest to a charge of spousal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in this room has spent hours of soul-searching,
asking the question: what could I have done differently, what
should I have done that I didn't, how could I have been smarter?''
Leavitt said. ``This is an event worthy of that type of
reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the new rules approved Thursday _ a requirement that
board members attend at least 75 percent of the organizing
committee meetings _ appeared to be a tacit acknowledgment that
some board members should have been paying more attention to their
oversight duties.
</P>
<P>
   Tougher new conflict of interest rules also require any board
member whose financial dealings with the committee could result in
``substantial personal benefit'' to leave the committee.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted the immediate resignations of two members, Alan
Layton, whose construction company has received millions of dollars
in contracts for construction of Olympic venues, and Earl Holding,
the owner of Snowbasin ski resort, which is to be paid upward of
$13 million by the committee for being the venue of several Olympic
events.
</P>
<P>
   A third board member, Verl Topham, who was part of the small
circle of business leaders who worked on the bid committee
beginning in the late 1980s, and then on the organizing committee
after 1995, also resigned. He said that his decision was in his own
``personal interest, and probably in the interest of this
organization going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   G. Frank Joklik, the organizing committee's former president and
chief executive officer, who stepped down last month and who has
been identified in committee documents and correspondence as having
had a major role in courting IOC members' support, was reappointed
by the governor on Thursday morning to the Board of Trustees.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new chief executive, Romney, is, like Joklik, a businessman
_ but in keeping with the organizing committee's new posture of
openness, he is also a politician with an easy manner with the
public and news media.
</P>
<P>
   He ran for the U.S. Senate in 1994 against Edward M. Kennedy in
Massachusetts, where he and his wife, Ann, have lived for 28 years.
His father, George, ran for president in 1968. The family name
resonates deeply here, with roots that go back to Mormon pioneer
days. Four of Romney's five sons graduated from Brigham Young
University, the church-owned school in nearby Provo, and the fifth
son is to start there this fall.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's meeting, Romney, who is 51, was introduced with
florid praise and loud applause and ushered from an adjoining room
like a charismatic star being brought on stage to revive a
floundering play.
</P>
<P>
   He promised the board that his first priorities were to see that
the Games went forward with ``the highest level of ethical
conduct'' and that they did not lose money _ a major anxiety here
as corporate sponsors have expressed concern about linking their
name with the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Romney said he would take no salary until after the Games in
February 2002, and only then, he said, if it was clear the city had
at least broken even financially.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over Salt Lake City's financial position Thursday
prompted Marc Hodler, the finance chief of the IOC, to state that
he thought it possible the city could still lose the 2002 Games.
``I am convinced that Salt Lake City will host the Games,'' Hodler
said in Vienna. ``However, it has had a $350 million hole in its
budget for months.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Lillehammer, Norway, the 1994 host city, or
Nagano, Japan (1998) could be used as a replacement site. Other
Olympic officials have discounted concerns about Salt Lake City's
ultimate ability to stage the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heavily emphasized message about new beginnings,
several board members complained that the board had not changed its
ways _ that it is controlled by a few top people with decisions
mostly presented to the board for concurrence.
</P>
<P>
   The Executive Selection subcommittee, for example, which
presented Romney's name to the board, was formed only on Tuesday,
after Romney had already been to the state numerous time for
interviews with the governor and other top officials.
</P>
<P>
   Several board members also abstained from voting on the new
rules, saying that they too had been presented too recently to give
them proper consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past we have had problems with what I perceive of as
our fiduciary responsibility by moving too quickly, not being
informed,'' said Zianibeth Shattuck-Owen, a luger who represents
athletes' interests on the organizing committee and who abstained
from voting on the policy changes.

SPORTS COLUMN: KRAUSE'S RISK OF FAILURE TAKES GUTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CHICAGO _ What a strange trip, as that noted Deadhead, Phil
Jackson, might have said after a stroll through the Bulls' pregame
locker room. Over at one dressing stall, the prominent holdover,
Toni Kukoc. At the others, the Croatian national team,
metaphorically speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Carr. Keith Booth. Andrew Lang, notorious for helping
Patrick Ewing break his wrist. Kornel David, best known for not
being David Kornel. And the coach, Tim Floyd, infamous in Chicago
for being first on the speed-dial of the Bulls' general manager,
Jerry Krause.
</P>
<P>
   These post-championship Bulls, humble hosts to the Knicks
Thursday night, are the work-in-regress of Krause, who has been
widely ridiculed for thinking he can rebuild his team, from
subterranean level up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers were the fastest to get back to contention, and it
took them six years,'' Krause said cheerily. ``We hope _ I say hope
_ to do it faster.''
</P>
<P>
   I came to the United Center not to bury Krause, but to praise
his bold play, for not taking the easy way out. He could have
signed Scottie Pippen and the rest of Pippen's and Michael Jordan's
supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   He could have mollified the fans, the media and the few players
left behind. He could have even brought back Dennis Rodman, and
kept the Bulls playoff competitive, for this short, formless
season.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't want to settle for pretty good, for the second round.
If that's because he wants the credit for constructing anew after
so many years of Jordan envy, then at least he is willing to take
the risk of failure, which is what Krause's critics, perhaps one
named Jordan, are rooting for.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could have signed everyone to one-year contracts, we
would have,'' he said. ``But that would've been the road to
mediocrity.''
</P>
<P>
   He understands that plodding on without Jordan was a no-win
position. After six championships in eight years, pretty good would
eventually have been viewed as not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Jordan retired, in October 1993, the Bulls won 55
games, pushed the favored Knicks to the second-round brink. Krause
has called that season ``the most fun we ever had here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls didn't win, though Pippen was in his prime, as
were Horace Grant and B.J. Armstrong. The one flaw in an otherwise
brilliant player was exposed, as Pippen could not be the
fourth-quarter go-to scorer. So Krause made the right call in
choosing not to rebuild around the multitalented but aging forward
he lifted from Seattle in a draft-day trade for Olden Polynice that
was lopsided to the point of criminality.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of Pippen's bitterness toward Krause about money and
whatever, they were tethered in Jordan's shadow. However much
Jordan picked on Krause, made fun of his unathletic build, he
couldn't dispute that Pippen was Krause's find, his guy. By sending
Pippen to Houston, Krause was willing to surrender his security
blanket. Most people think that's crazy. I think, for this
business, that's courage.
</P>
<P>
   When the Knicks had the chance to move in a similar direction
without Patrick Ewing, they were terrified it might inhibit them
from raising ticket prices, so they cited the overstated tenet that
Knicks fans won't tolerate starting over.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Ernie Grunfeld, the Knicks' general manager, now has
a payroll that is the rough equivalent of the Yankees' with half as
many players, and a team that carries around a thousand-pound title
mandate that is mostly self-imposed.
</P>
<P>
   These Bulls have been compared to baseball's Florida Marlins,
who were sold off garage-sale style. The NBA has a minimum payroll
of about $25 million, so that doesn't hold up. This was a strategic
strike against the salary cap, to create free agent maneuverability
for Krause next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Just his luck. Due to the new collective bargaining rules, young
stars are re-signing long-term deals. The math is so elementary
that Ray Allen didn't bother with an agent when he got a new deal
in Milwaukee this week.
</P>
<P>
   Is this an early death knell for Krause's plan? Depends on one's
definition of is. ``Most of the players who've signed we thought
would,'' he said. ``There are a lot of others still out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury may still want to help reconfigure Jordan's
legacy. Penny Hardaway might be coaxed out of Orlando. The current
Bulls are bad enough to land Krause a top college pick. If it works
out, three months of losing may be a small price to pay. People
here may yet have to admit that Jerry Krause was right. What a
strange trip that will be, too.

<P>
   Defying a federal judge's order to end their protest and return
to work, more pilots called in sick on Thursday at American
Airlines, forcing the carrier to cancel more than half of its
flights and ensuring that its operations will be crippled during
the Presidents Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The disruption at American, which has now lasted six days,
continued to upset the plans of tens of thousands of travelers and
businesses around the world. The airline, the nation's second
largest, said on Thursday that it had already canceled 500 flights
scheduled for Friday and would probably have to eliminate more.
Passengers will have fewer alternatives on Friday than in previous
days because most airlines are expected to have full planes.
</P>
<P>
   American filed a motion on Thursday in U.S. District Court in
Texas, contending that the Allied Pilots Association, the union
that represents American's 9,200 pilots, should be found to be in
comtempt for not complying with Judge Joe Kendall's order on
Wednesday to end the sickout. A hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. on
Friday in Dallas, where AMR Corp., American's parent, has its
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that the judge will be satisfied that we are
doing what we have to do to comply with the order,'' said Rich
LaVoy, the union's president.
</P>
<P>
   Union representatives and the airline met on Thursday to try to
negotiate an end to the dispute. Brian A. Mayhew, an American
captain who is a vice president at the union, said that limited
progress was made on one issue but several core issues still needed
to be addressed. The two sides are scheduled to meet again on
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   American said that the number of pilots calling in sick rose to
2,400 Thursday from 2,077 on Wednesday. Normally, 400 pilots are
out sick. As a result of the absences, the airline grounded 1,170
flights, more than half of its 2,250 flights daily, compared with
1,000 flights canceled on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots, many of whom are embittered after years of poor
labor relations at the airline, are angry about the way American
plans to integrate Reno Air, a small airline in the West that it
bought in December for $124 million. American has said that it
intends to take a year to 18 months to merge the two carriers. The
pilots want the integration to go faster, and they want Reno Air's
pilots and their members paid as if the integration were already
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Some pilots began calling in sick last Saturday after
negotiations between the union and American Airlines broke down.
More joined in, causing more flights to be canceled each day.
</P>
<P>
   American went to court on Wednesday and Kendall issued a
back-to-work order.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the numbers it doesn't appear that those pilots who have
called in sick are complying with the judge's order,'' said John
Hotard, a spokesman for American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But the union said it was in full compliance. After giving the
judge's order an ambiguous endorsement in a telephone message to
members, the union issued a stronger statement on Thursday, saying
that it did not ``authorize, ratify or condone'' a sickout or a
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We further instruct all pilots to resume their normal working
schedule and to otherwise comply with Judge Kendall's order,'' it
added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even after the union used the stronger language, it was still
difficult to determine how many pilots would return to the cockpit.
``That is what the leadership has to say,'' said one pilot on the
sick list who insisted on anonymity, referring to the union's order
to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the protesting pilots argue that the court order applies
only to the union's leadership, not to pilots acting on their own.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Gangemi, a labor lawyer in the Chicago office of
Winston &AMP; Strawn who often represents management, said that that
simply was not true. ``It would be surprising if the court would
tolerate this continuing injury to the public under the fiction
that the union has no control over the situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations require pilots to take themselves out of the
cockpit if they are sick, suffering from stress or otherwise not
fit to fly. Many veteran pilots have accumulated dozens of sick
days that allow them to stay on the sick list and still get paid.
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's hearing, Kendall asked Sandy Denison, a
lawyer for the union, ``Are you actually standing here telling me
the pilots are sick?'' Denison responded, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the financial damage to AMR rose with Thursday's
canceled flights. Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst at Paine
Webber in New York, said the sickout would reduce AMR's revenues
for the quarter between $82 million and $110 million and cut its
earnings between 25 cents and 40 cents a share, if American's
operations begin returning to normal on Friday. He also said the
company might lose an additional $50 million in lost bookings from
customers who buy tickets on other airlines during the dispute. The
consensus estimate for AMR's earnings for the quarter was $1.17 a
share before the disruptions began.
</P>
<P>
   American officials estimate it will take two to three days to
return operations to normal. The sickout has left many planes out
of position for their normal routes, which is why the airline is
predicting further cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the pilots return to work on Friday, a settlement
between the union and the company will be needed to even begin to
break down the pilots' intense mistrust of management. Many pilots
trace their ill will to the reign of Robert L. Crandall, AMR's
former chairman and chief executive, who retired last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a tough person to deal with, he created his
counterpart in the union,'' said one pilot not on the sick list,
who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Carty, Crandall's successor, began his tenure pledging
to improve management-labor relations and make American a happier
place to work. He has tried to allay the pilots' fears that
acquiring Reno Air is a ploy to lower pilot pay rates at American,
pledging that he is committed to bringing Reno Air's pilots under
the union contract.
</P>
<P>
   But even pilots who have not called in sick say Carty has not
succeeded in improving pilots' feelings toward the company.

FEDERATED DEPARTMENT STORES TO BUY FINGERHUT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federated Department Stores Inc., the nation's largest operator
of traditional department stores, agreed Thursday to acquire
Fingerhut Cos., a catalog company with direct-marketing and online
sales expertise, for $1.5 billion, signaling a new and high-level
commitment to reaching customers through nontraditional means.
</P>
<P>
   Federated will pay $25 a share in cash, or $1.5 billion, to buy
50 million outstanding shares of Fingerhut and cash out 10 million
stock options. Federated will also assume $205 million in debt. The
transaction, which represents a 33 percent premium to Fingerhut's
stock price on Wednesday, has been approved by the boards of both
companies but is still subject to regulatory review.
</P>
<P>
   Federated said that it expected the deal to dilute earnings in
the next year or two. Its shares fell $2.8125, to $39.6875,
Thursday. Shares of Fingerhut rose $5.5625, to $24.375.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company of Bloomingdale's, Macy's and Bon Marche,
Federated had $16 billion in sales in 1998. But department stores
have been losing market share in recent years, and the purchase of
Fingerhut is clearly an attempt by Federated to move aggressively
into electronic commerce, where total sales are tiny but growth is
dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an acknowledgment that customers are evolving their
tastes and needs in other forms of buying,'' said Arnold Aronson,
managing director of Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Before the purchase of Fingerhut, Federated had a small but
expanding direct-market component to its business. Bloomingdale's
by Mail _ the only direct-market subsidiary for which Federated
reports figures _ had $150 million in sales last year. During the
holiday season, Macy's.com reported that it was getting up to 10
million hits a day.
</P>
<P>
   Fingerhut, with $2 billion in sales last year, can support an
expansion in this area. The company owns minority interests in four
Internet businesses, including PC Flowers and Gifts, and Roxy
Systems Inc., which markets entertainment services. Fingerhut also
handles the order fulfillment and merchandise distribution for the
Web sites of Kmart, Intuit and Quicken.
</P>
<P>
   How the companies will be integrated has not been outlined, but
Fingerhut, which will be run as an independent subsidiary, will
most likely take over the management of all Federated's
direct-to-consumer operations with the task of bolstering online
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with this deal we can credibly aspire to being the
dominant retailers on the Net,'' said Will Lansing, the president
of Fingerhut.
</P>
<P>
   The move was widely praised by retail industry analysts. ``This
is a very bold and savvy move by Federated,'' said Claire Gruppo,
president of Gruppo, Levey &AMP; Co., an investment banking firm in New
York that specializes in direct marketers. ``Smart retailers
realize they have to leap into this business by buying someone who
knows what they are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Wollan Fan, a partner in Andersen Consulting, cautioned,
however, that success would depend on Federated's willingness to
give Fingerhut a free hand.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of potential was not necessarily shared by Wall
Street. Brian James, portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co.,
Federated's eighth-largest shareholder, was less than ecstatic. ``I
believe they are overpaying for a company with low quality of
earning in three-quarters of their business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James also was concerned that Federated is committing itself to
an unproven form of sales. But Kate Delhagen, director of online
retail strategies for Forrester Research, argues that even paying a
steep price may be worth it. ``The cost of entry is only going to
continue to rise,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston and Jones, Day, Reavis &AMP; Pogue
advised Federated on the transaction. Fingerhut is being advised by
Salomon Smith Barney and Faegre &AMP; Benson.

MEXICAN BANK'S STOCK DELISTED IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAV JORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Grupo Financiero Serfin SA, one of Mexico's
largest banking companies, will be suspended from listing on the
New York Stock Exchange because its financial problems mean it no
longer meets the market's minimum listing requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange officials in New York announced late Wednesday that
Serfin's shares would no longer trade starting on Feb. 24, and that
the exchange would ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to
remove Serfin from its list.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse statement released here hours after the announcement,
Serfin officials said the company had not been forced off the New
York market, but had opted out voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The travails of Serfin, Mexico's third-largest banking
conglomerate, reflect what analysts call a chronic weak point in
the Mexican economy. While the economy has in some respects
rebounded from the peso crisis of 1994-95 and largely managed to
weather the turbulence from more recent financial crises in Brazil,
Russia and Asia, the banking system remains virtually immobilized
by high interest rates, bad loan portfolios and a shriveled flow of
foreign capital to permit borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Serfin executives declined to comment on the New York Stock
Exchange's decision. But the statement said that the company was
moving to over-the-counter trading, in which the costs of
maintaining shares were lower. It did not specify where such
dealings would take place.
</P>
<P>
   Serfin had been the only Mexican bank whose American depository
receipts were bought and sold on the New York market. The ADRs,
which have not traded above $1 since August, sank in New York
Thursday to a new low of 40.625 cents, down from 62.5 cents on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Serfin shares were down here, as well, though not as steeply.
The broad Mexican market was sharply higher, with the benchmark
Mexico City stock index gaining 4.22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the largest predominantly Mexican-owned banks, Serfin has
faced the most difficulty fighting back from the peso collapse and
the foreign-capital drought that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of money available for loans has become the main
weakness of the Mexican banks as they scramble to meet the
requirements of a new bank bailout law that took effect in January.
Under it, the banks must set aside cash reserves to cover up to 25
percent of bad loans absorbed by the government under a
four-year-old bailout program.
</P>
<P>
   Serfin handed off loans worth $5.8 billion to the government
under the program. The new bailout requirements put the bank's
balance sheets $690 million in the red by U.S. accounting
standards, analysts said, although not by Mexican standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes them technically bankrupt under U.S. accounting
principles,'' said Patrick Boucher, a Latin America banking analyst
with Santander Investments here. ``So their suspension is really
not surprising and perhaps long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip J. Guarco of Moody's Investors Service in New York said
that while the Mexican banking system is still coping with the
fallout from 1994-95, it must now confront new uncertainties
generated by other emerging economies, which have lessened the flow
of foreign capital into countries like Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the strongest banks have either no capital or very
little,'' Guarco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a system that's going to require additional capital if
it wants to grow,'' Boucher said. ``The problem in Mexico is that
the timing is just not ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Moody's reconfirmed its negative rating for the
Mexican banking system for the medium term because it remains
vulnerable to a sudden loss of confidence by international
investors.

LEVITT ASKS EXCHANGE CHIEFS TO WIDEN OPTIONS TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Pa., N.Y.)  (Eds.: Please note that the word STAR in parentheses has been used
in the final two grafs instead of the symbol, which is
non-transmittable to some newspaper systems.)

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, has sent a letter to the chief executives of the
nation's four option exchanges asking for their cooperation in
opening the options trading business to increased competition and
electronic market integration.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said, ``Technological advancements since the
fledgling years of the options markets now render obsolete past
claims that electronic market integration is not feasible.'' It was
sent on Wednesday to William J. Brodsky, chairman of the Chicago
Board Options Exchange; Richard F. Syron, chairman of the American
Stock Exchange; Meyer S. Frucher, chairman of the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, and Robert M. Greber, chairman of the Pacific Stock
Exchange. Levitt asked that they respond to his letter by March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt, who would not comment on the letter, appears to be
concerned that because the various options markets are not linked
there is no way to insure the best execution of options orders.
Options are contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the
obligation, to buy or sell a set amount of a particular security at
a specified price.
</P>
<P>
   Options trading is dominated by the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, which executes 42 percent of U.S. equity options volume
and around 97 percent of index options trades. The American Stock
Exchange, which is operated by the National Association of
Securities Dealers, trades 29 percent of equity options; the
Pacific Exchange executes 18 percent, and the Philadelphia
Exchange, 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investor interest in options has exploded in recent years. In
1998, 1.3 million option contracts traded on average each day. In
1990, an average 450,000 contracts changed hands a day. Options are
traded on approximately 2,700 stocks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before 1989, the trading of a particular option was allocated to
an exchange based on a lottery system. The SEC then adopted a rule
opening the trading to multiple exchanges. But most of the 600 or
so stocks that had had options traded on them before the rule
change continued to trade predominantly on a single exchange. These
include options on popular stocks like IBM, Intel, Microsoft and
Disney. Even after the rule change, however, volume in most equity
options has tended to migrate to one exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt's letter was sent a little more than a month after the
Chicago Board Options Exchange abandoned its planned merger with
the Pacific Stock Exchange. The merger had been announced last July
and would have linked the world's largest options exchange with a
technologically advanced regional stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Justice Department requested information on that
merger as well as the proposed combination of the American Stock
Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. A spokeswoman for the
Justice Department said it was continuing to examine antitrust
issues surrounding the American-Philadelphia merger. And on
Wednesday, five of the nation's stock and options exchanges were
sued by investors who contended that because some options trade on
only one exchange, this violates antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest force behind Levitt's request for an
improved options market was the International Securities Exchange's
application to create an electronic options exchange, which was
filed with the SEC on Feb. 2. The New York-based ISE hopes to
compete for trading volume next year.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Katz, senior vice president for marketing and business
development at the ISE said: ``The high cost of trading in the
options market was the impetus for ISE On E(STAR)Trade or
Ameritrade, you can buy 5,000 shares of stock for $14.99. But to
buy 10 contracts of options can run you over $40. Our four
competitors presented us with an opportunity to go in and be
cheaper and faster and provide better executions.''
</P>
<P>
   The ISE was founded in 1997 by William Porter, former chairman
of E(STAR)Trade, the electronic brokerage firm, and Marty Averbuch,
president of Adirondack Trading Partners, a consortium of
broker-dealers. Investors in the ISE include the discount brokerage
firms E(STAR)Trade, Ameritrade and Scottsdale Securities, and the
market-maker firms Knight Trimark Group Inc. and Herzog, Heine,
Geduld Inc. &QL;

FOURTH REPUBLICAN PLANS TO VOTE TO ACQUIT CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate lumbers toward acquitting President
Clinton Friday on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice,
the only suspense remaining in his impeachment trial is the margin
of the not-guilty votes.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of a third day of closed-door deliberations late
Thursday, another Republican senator announced that she will vote
to acquit the Democratic president, a decision raising the
possibility that neither of the charges against the president will
be supported by a simple majority of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky affair
``deplorable and indefensible,'' Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe said the
House prosecutors' case ``was all circumstantial; there was no
direct evidence'' of wrongdoing by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe was the fourth moderate Republican to break ranks and
announce that she is siding with the Senate's 45 Democrats, who so
far appear unified in opposing Clinton's conviction and removal
from office.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Republican Sens. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania,
John Chafee of Rhode Island and James Jeffords of Vermont announced
plans to vote for acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate trial recessed for the night, several senators
predicted that another moderate, Susan Collins of Maine, would be
the fifth Republican to jump ship. Collins' aides declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the 100-member Senate would have to vote guilty on
at least one article of impeachment to terminate Clinton's
presidency. The two articles were sent to the Senate in a
party-line vote by the Republican-controlled House.
</P>
<P>
   Senators convene at 9:30 a.m. EST Friday, and a vote is expected
about noon. Clinton is expected to make a short statement after
senators respond ``guilty'' or ``not guilty'' on each of the two
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Once senators dispose of the two charges, they will adjourn the
second presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history and begin a
10-day recess in conjunction with the President's Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Democratic senators had all but abandoned hope of
pushing through, before the recess, a resolution censuring Clinton
for his affair with Lewinsky, a former White House intern half his
age, and his effort to conceal the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   While Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., plans to seek a
procedural vote on censure, it was expected to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure's dead,'' said Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, a Republican who
threatened to use a series of of parliamentary maneuvers to block
any resolution seeking to rebuke Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think censure is dead. I don't think there's any chance that
it will make it,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat who was
never more than lukewarm about formally condemning the president's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   While it has been a foregone conclusion that the Senate would
not come close to mustering the 67 votes needed to convict Clinton,
a simple 51-vote majority is seen as partial vindication for the
House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that both articles would fall below that
threshold drew a fresh round of criticism from House prosecutors
and claims by Democrats that the GOP's impeachment effort was a
flawed partisan exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply saddened by what I perceive as the triumph of
politics over constitutional principles,'' said Rep. Chris Cannon,
R-Utah and one of the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how anything could be more embarrassing than the
process we've just gone through where we didn't have a chance to
even present our case,'' said Cannon, complaining about the
Senate's refusal to summon witnesses during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Another House prosecutor, Rep. Robert Barr of Georgia, said the
Senate ``deliberately denied us the opportunity to present a
case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically what they did was to ignore the Constitution,'' said
Barr, a former federal prosecutor who pushed for Clinton's
impeachment long before the public learned of the Lewinsky affair
almost 13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   If both charges fail to gain a simple majority it ``shows that
we never should have done this in the first place,'' said Sen.
Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat who formerly served on the
House Judiciary Committee that sent four articles of impeachment to
the full House.
</P>
<P>
   Failure of both articles to receive at least 51 votes would send
``a very loud message to the House of Representatives: Don't ever,
ever send to the Senate again articles of impeachment that are this
weak and partisan,'' said Sen. Tom Johnson, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Thursday's deliberations, Clinton had been roundly
denounced by Democratic and Republican senators, both during their
closed-door debate and in statements announcing their intentions
for the roll-call votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over and over and over again, from both sides of the aisle,''
senators denounced the president as a liar, said Sen. Bob Bennett,
R-Utah. ``No one defended him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett predicted that Clinton would go down in history as ``the
most accomplished, polished liar we've ever had in the White
House.'' Even the name ``Clinton'' will become part of the lexicon
as ``a synonym for an elegant, well-crafted lie,'' the senator
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans who are talking about their intentions said
they will vote to remove Clinton while Democrats said they would
oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Sens. Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, both Republicans,
have not announced how they plan to vote on the two articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats announcing plans to vote not guilty was
Feinstein, who said she wanted to be ``perfectly clear'' about her
displeasure over the ordeal Clinton put the country through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not condone the behavior of President Clinton. I do not
defend it, and I do not accept it,'' she said. ``The conduct at the
heart of the charges is deplorable. The president acted immorally,
he acted recklessly, he acted disgracefully.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In doing so, he has brought shame and dishonor upon the office
of the president and, especially, upon himself,'' Feinstein said.

PATAKI, MULLING NATIONAL RACE, TO ADDRESS N.H. REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki, who has begun speaking to
groups around the nation in an effort to gain more national
prominence, plans to give an address in New Hampshire in March, his
aides said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican organization in Manchester, N.H., has invited
Pataki to be the keynote speaker at its Lincoln Day dinner March
18. New Hampshire holds the first presidential primary in the
nation, so it is a popular destination for would-be presidential
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has declined to say whether he is interested in running
for president in 2000, but his aides have not sought to dampen
speculation about his intentions. It seems more likely, though,
that by trying to broaden his reputation, he is hoping to be
considered as a vice-presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the purpose of the New Hampshire visit, Pataki's
spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, said, ``This is just another stop on the
governor's tour to deliver the new Republican agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki delivered his first speech on that tour last week in
Chicago, where he said the Republican Party had veered off course.
He criticized the party for sounding mean-spirited at times and
called for a renewed focus on core initiatives like cutting taxes
and regulations.

MASTER OF BANDS OF EVERY SORT

   NEW YORK _ Having spent the 1980s with the World's Most
Dangerous Band on NBC, PAUL SHAFFER is going to end the '90s with
the World's Smallest Band.
</P>
<P>
   That will probably not be his new group's name, of course. But
Shaffer, DAVID LETTERMAN'S musical director for the last 17 years,
has signed a deal with the Nickelodeon cable network to organize
and appear with an all-children's band.
</P>
<P>
   And no, Shaffer is not giving up his night job on ``Late Show
with David Letterman'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The Nickelodeon band will be chosen after nationwide auditions.
``Teen-agers, pre-teens _ `tweens,' I guess is the buzzword,'' a
Nickleodeon spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 5{-year-old daughter is particularly excited at the
prospect of getting to meet Chuckie'' from ``Rugrats,'' Shaffer
said. ``My accountant was excited about receiving the advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinner and a Lease
</P>
<P>
   Now that ``Death of a Salesman'' has opened, CARMEN COOK wants
to make good on her offer to prepare dinner for ELIZABETH FRANZ.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Franz plays Willy Loman's wife, Linda, in the revival of
the Arthur Miller play at the Eugene O'Neill Theater. Ms. Cook, a
real-estate broker who trained as a chef, found the apartment Miss
Franz is renting.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year, with an option to renew,'' Ms. Cook said. ``The
actor's life. She has a home in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cook has credentials as a chef: She trained under ALBERT
KUMIN, who was the pastry chef at the White House in the 1970s. She
has also taught cooking in Manhattan, and sees food as a kind of
bridge to her real-estate career.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the closing, you're supposed to congratulate everyone and
you give your client a personal gift,'' Ms. Cook said. ``It
occurred to me, a tailor-made meal. But in her case, with her dog
Max, I'm going to make him some homemade dog biscuits with ground
up eggshells. It cleans their teeth. It's sort of a dog bagel.''
</P>
<P>
   She will prepare food for the two-legged guests too.
</P>
<P>
   Hailing Little Stars
</P>
<P>
   The violinist MAXIM VENGEROV became a critic after an appearance
at the Third Street Music School Settlement on Tuesday, and gave
the student orchestra he had performed with there a no-holds-barred
rave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound that they have and the technique are very
impressive,'' he said. ``We danced together. We did a little
parade. We jumped. In the end we were doing `Twinkle, Twinkle,
Little Star.'''
</P>
<P>
   Vengerov, who is 24 and is an honorary envoy for music for
UNICEF, which sponsored his two-hour appearance at the school,
offered some career advice afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he decided to become a violinist because his father
was an oboist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember sitting in the first row, trying to find him,'' he
said. ``I couldn't. All I could see was the first violin. I said,
`Why play oboe when no one can see me?'''
</P>
<P>
   A Writer of Honor
</P>
<P>
   A postscript on the 70th-birthday celebration for the
restaurateur ELAINE KAUFMAN: Also in the crowd of writers, editors
and television personalities was SALVATORE BONANNO, who is known as
Bill and is the son of Joseph Bonanno, the man the government says
used to mastermind murderous gangland mayhem for the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a literary figure as well as an underworld scion,'' the
writer GAY TALESE said of Salvatore Bonanno, noting that Bonanno
has written a book that will be published next month, ``Bound by
Honor: A Mafioso's Own Story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's writing books in this time of deviation
downward,'' Talese said. ``Corrupt lawyers have talk shows,
Watergate torpedoes like G. GORDON LIDDY have talk shows. So why
shouldn't a Mafia graduate cash in on America's endless interest in
the underworld by writing a book of his own.''

AMERICAN ON IOC IS LINKED TO SALT LAKE CITY BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ A member of the International Olympic Committee
from the United States said Thursday that in an effort to improve
Salt Lake City's chances of being awarded the 2002 Winter Games,
his sporting goods company hired the son of an Olympic delegate
from Swaziland six weeks before the decisive vote.
</P>
<P>
   The committee member, James Easton, who is chairman of Easton
Sports, said that on May 1, 1995 _ six weeks before the June 16
vote that awarded Salt Lake City the 2002 Winter Games _ officials
with Salt Lake City's bid committee asked his company to hire
Sibusiso ``Sibo'' Sibandze, the son of David Sibandze, a fellow IOC
member from Swaziland. Easton said the request came from David R.
Johnson, the head of international relations for the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Easton, who said he did not personally learn of the hire for
about three months, did not in the end object to it, and did not
consider it improper. Easton Sports, a $200 million a year company
based in Van Nuys, Calif., manufactures high-end sporting
equipment, including products used in Olympic sports such as
softball and baseball, hockey, archery and cycling. Easton is also
president of the international archery federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reputation is the most valuable thing I own,'' Easton said.
``I certainly didn't feel I was doing anything improper in
cooperating with the bid committee in getting the Games here.''
</P>
<P>
   When Easton's company was approached about the job, Sibo
Sibandze was attending the University of Utah on a scholarship paid
by the bid committee. Easton said that at that time he saw nothing
wrong with that arrangement either.
</P>
<P>
   David Sibandze resigned from the Olympic committee last month
after an IOC investigation concluded that the assistance given his
son, including the college scholarship and other financial aid,
violated guidelines concerning improper gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Easton's admission is the first time an American member of the
international committee has been directly linked to Salt Lake
City's aggressive campaign to influence votes in securing the
Olympics. Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles, the other American on the
international committee, has said she made a telephone call to the
University of Southern California recommending a spot on the tennis
team for the daughter of a fellow delegate from Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Easton's comments also appear to provide further evidence
supporting the contention of some Salt Lake City Olympic officials
that a significant part of the city's campaign to gain the Games
was carried out more or less openly, and that many people were
aware of at least some of the details.

 SALT LAKE CITY: the details.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Pound, the Montreal lawyer and Olympic committee member
who is investigating the Salt Lake City scandal, did not return a
phone call seeking comment on whether Sibandze's hiring by Easton
would be investigated. Twenty-four delegates _ a fifth of the
committee's total _ have been implicated in Salt Lake City's
vote-influencing campaign of providing cash, tuition aid, medical
benefits, lavish gifts and other extravagant favors totaling as
much as $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sibo Sibandze was hired in the Salt Lake City office of Easton
Sports, which manufactures arrow shafts and tent tubing. He was
paid $9 an hour, and his duties included research, running errands
and helping to install a new phone system. He earned from $8,000 to
$10,000 between May 1995 and Aug. 30, 1996, Easton said, calling
him ``an excellent employee.'' None of the money paid to Sibandze
was reimbursed to Easton by the bid committee, Easton said.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Easton said, he would not have hired Sibandze,
but, at the time, ``We and other companies in Salt Lake wanted to
help the bid committee any way we could to be successful,'' he
said. ``The bank hired people. The state did. The city did.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Hanna, dean of the college of humanities at the
University of Utah and a member of the Salt Lake City ethics panel
that this week issued a damning 300-page report on misconduct by
bid officials, said the report did not attempt to examine hiring
practices, except in cases where the companies were reimbursed by
the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose not to discuss hiring someone because that's an area
of personal judgment that falls into a gray area,'' Ms. Hanna said.
``People worldwide have different opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibo Sibandze, it has been previously reported, also worked at
City Hall during the bid process. He received two degrees from the
University of Utah, and received tuition aid and other payments
totaling $111,389.12 from the Salt Lake City bid committee between
Oct. 23, 1991, and October 1996, according to the report issued
Tuesday by an internal ethics panel. Neither Sibandze could be
reached by telephone for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Easton said he did not ask Sibandze whom was paying his tuition
but he assumed the financing came from the bid committee. In
general, Easton said, he believed the scholarship program was a
worthwhile humanitarian effort that allowed students from
developing nations to gain an education and become productive
citizens in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If handled properly, that can be good for the Olympic
movement,'' Easton said. Though the scholarship program was set up
openly, Easton said, it later became a ``slush fund.'' The ethics
panel report said that Johnson and Thomas K. Welch, president of
the bid committee, never submitted Sibandze's or other names for
approval for scholarships and paid funds directly to some
international committee relatives who never even attended school.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it was designed, it was proper; as it was used, it
wasn't,'' Easton said. ``It became a catchall for anything they
wanted to use for the solicitation of votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Easton, who became a member of the IOC in September 1994, also
said yesterday that in the years leading to his appointment, his
company had donated a pair of expensive mountain bikes to the Salt
Lake City bid committee intended for Juan Antonio Samaranch,
president of the IOC, and for Samaranch's personal secretary. The
bikes cost from $700 to $900, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ethics panel report, there were no guidelines
regarding a $150 limit on gifts received by international committee
members until 1994. Samaranch receives a large number of protocol
gifts as president of the IOC, and said that he placed them in
storage or in the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. He has
said that he is not subject to gift limits because he does not vote
on cities seeking the Games.
</P>
<P>
   An international committee spokesman said that Samaranch and his
secretary, Annie Inchauspe, were traveling to Barcelona, Spain, and
that they were unavailable for comment about the bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Although he visited Salt Lake City when other international
committee members were here during the bidding process, or spoke to
the delegates by telephone, Easton said he was unaware of the
dimensions of the inducements being provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was as shocked as anyone else to see the extent of what they
were doing,'' Easton said.

PARENTS OF VICTIM QUESTION INQUIRY'S PACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The parents of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West
African immigrant shot to death by police officers in the vestibule
of his Bronx apartment building last week, gave public thanks
Thursday for the sympathy they have received but expressed
ambivalence about the city's handling of the investigation into
their son's death.
</P>
<P>
   In her first interview since arriving from Guinea after the
killing, Kadiadou Diallo, the victim's mother, said she was upset
by the pace of the investigation into the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I condemn is these police officers are still on duty,''
she said, referring to the four officers who fired 41 shots at her
son, hitting him 19 times.
</P>
<P>
   Her statements, in an interview at the office of the Rev. Al
Sharpton and later at a news conference, capped a day of questions
and answers as politicians, police officials, advocates and
Diallo's family weighed in on the 22-year-old man's controversial
death and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani again moved to fend off criticism that
his response to the shooting has been insensitive. He reached out
both to the Diallo family and to a group of African immigrants, but
the Diallos' reaction was tepid, and people who attended the
meeting with the immigrants' group, the United African Congress,
came away with a largely unenthusiastic response.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout also extended to Police Commissioner Howard Safir,
who sat through an hourlong tongue-lashing from City Council
members over police training.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, the focus was on Mrs. Diallo, who was soft-spoken
and composed despite days at the center of intense news media
attention. She said she believed that the investigation into her
son's death would be fair. ``It is the land of justice, America,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she and her former husband, Saikou, who arrived in New York
City from his home in Vietnam on Wednesday night, appeared more
hesitant about the motivations of Giuliani, who said Thursday that
he wanted to offer his condolences to the family in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has something to say, he can say it,'' Mrs. Diallo said
with a shrug during the interview in the office of Sharpton, who
has stepped in as the family's spokesman, guide and political
adviser in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A face-to-face meeting between the mayor and the Diallos was
off, on and then off again Thursday, a casualty of the parents'
physical exhaustion and conflicting opinions of the people who have
surrounded them as advisers, fixers, guides and spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, who has organized two large protest rallies against
police brutality in the wake of the Diallo shooting, earlier said
the only mayor whom the family would meet was former Mayor David
Dinkins. They did, when Dinkins showed up for the news conference
at Sharpton's National Action Network in Harlem to offer his
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is scheduled to attend a memorial service for Diallo on
Friday after the Muslim noon prayers, at the Islamic Cultural
Center of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   As Diallo's parents crisscrossed the city in a melancholy tour
of the places their son worked, prayed and lived, City Hall
continued to weather the sometimes harsh reaction to the police
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Otunu, associate publisher of Black Star News, who attended
the meeting between the mayor and the United African Congress,
based in Brooklyn, said the Mayor and Safir, who also was present,
expressed sincere compassion for the Diallo family but stopped well
short of saying the police officers were wrong to shoot the unarmed
street vendor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's perhaps where people feel maybe he is not
entirely sincere,'' Otunu said. He added that ``the mayor's
demeanor is such that he does not come across as a very friendly
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir returned from a five-day trip to Los Angeles to a
withering barrage of criticism from City Council members, who said
they told him the killing was evidence of systemic problems in the
police force.

AT JFK, TRAVELERS ARE FRUSTRATED WITH AMERICAN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (With AMR-PILOTS)  
(bl) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They looked more like aimless refugees than airline
passengers on the verge of long-awaited Caribbean vacations.
Numbering in the thousands, weary American Airlines ticket-holders
crammed Kennedy International Airport Thursday, defiantly hoping
for a seat on a plane out of town as a pilots' sickout crippled the
airline.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a line 150 people deep, travelers to Puerto Rico,
Jamaica, Mexico and the Dominican Republic waited four, six and
eight hours to find a way around the pilots' failure to show up for
work, which resulted in hundreds of canceled flights nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just stand here and get in somebody's face, so that they
try to get you out of their face,'' said a fed-up Chuck McEvily of
Rockville Centre, holding his family's tickets for a canceled 7
a.m. flight to the Dominican Republic. ``We did such a good job,''
he added at noon, ``that they're sending us to Newark.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, McEvily and his wife, Stephanie, and 11-year-old
son, Nick, were hoping to squeeze onto a Continental Airlines
flight to Santo Domingo sometime Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody within shouting distance of the besieged American
ticket counter was counting on much Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As the line of 150 sagging bodies seemed to grow more calcified
as the morning wore on, many stranded travelers expressed confusion
over the strike, which they thought had been resolved with a
judge's back-to-work order, issued Wednesday. They also expressed
annoyance with what they said was American's mishandling of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling pretty deceived,'' said Kevin Isaacs, a music
professor from Brookfield, Conn., who was standing at a buzzing
ticket counter with his wife, Debbie, and three sons. When he
called Tuesday evening to check on the status of his family's
flight to Cozumel, Mexico, for a five-day vacation, an American
Airlines representative told him not to worry, he said. After a
six-hour wait in line Thursday, the Isaacses finally gave up hope
and began planning a return limousine ride home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think they'd have more people on counters or people to
pass out coffee or just talking or trying to keep spirits up,''
Isaacs said. Like many others in line behind him, he vowed never
again to fly American. ``I will go out of my way to fly with any
other carrier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, American canceled 44 flights from Kennedy on Thursday,
11 more than the airline did Tuesday, according to officials at the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the
airport. Thursday morning, for example, about 900 passengers jammed
into the cavernous American terminal seeking a small fraction of
the available seats.
</P>
<P>
   The delays may only get worse in the days ahead. American
Airlines has already canceled some flights scheduled to leave from
Newark International Airport on Saturday and Sunday, said Ileana
Czerw, an American Express business travel agent. ``We're
scrambling to get people on other airlines, through other cities,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   While the airline spent hours trying to uncross passengers'
serpentine travel routes, the airport's staff of courtesy workers
directed confused visitors to other terminals, or to buses that
would carry them back home.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Airport security manager Jerry Spampanato likened the
strike-related delays to those caused by a serious snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not bad,'' he said. ``There have been situations that
have been more critical than this. Tomorrow morning, it's hard to
say. It depends on how many pilots show up for work. We'll be ready
to help them as best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not good enough for passengers like Joe Delgado, a real
estate agent who had spent 16 hours trying to fly home to Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., from his father's funeral in San Juan, Puerto
Rico. Unable to fly the route directly on American, Delgado was
told instead to take a Tower Air flight all the way to New York and
then ask the Israeli airline, El Al, to fly him to south Florida.
But the El Al agents were of little help Thursday morning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said: `We can't take you. Go back to American,''' Delgado
said. So he returned to the American line at 6 a.m. to wait and
plead for a seat on a flight home. ``It's a no-win situation. I've
still got to get home. Everybody's a little tired and frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone waiting Thursday was short on patience, however.
For a few minutes, Diane Beaty was the very last person in the
American ticket line.
</P>
<P>
   If her flight was canceled, she said, she would calmly return to
East Meadow, N.Y., with her husband, Richard, and spend her
vacation week relaxing at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't go, I can't go,'' she said with a pleasant smile.
``I just will never fly American Airlines again, I can tell you
that.''

DOCTORS AND PATIENTS ADJUST AS HMOS START TO TAKE HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ It was the kind of experience Dr. William
Lindsey had dreaded.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, a general surgeon, sat on one side of a meeting
table protesting a decision by United Healthcare to pay him almost
$100 less for each colonoscopy he performs under that managed care
plan. The reduction, Lindsey said, would cost him $30,000 this
year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the table, Lindsey recalled, sat the
representative for the health maintenance organization, nodding,
assuring Lindsey that his services were valued, but refusing to pay
him a penny more for the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Like a poker player holding a pair of threes, Lindsey, 45, knew
he was beaten. The boom in health maintenance organizations that
swept most other American cities more than a decade ago has finally
come to Syracuse. United Healthcare and other plans like it are
enrolling more of Lindsey's patients, and he cannot just walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no real way to argue with them,'' Lindsey said this
month, still seething two weeks after the meeting. ``Basically,
they tell us to take it or leave it. Alone, I don't have any say.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Syracuse doctors did not have to pay managed
care much mind. While much of New York had belatedly joined the HMO
surge, Syracuse had largely avoided it because the local economy,
made up mostly of midsize companies, was not particularly appealing
to managed-care companies. Those companies often seek to have a
quick and substantial impact on a new market by signing up a few
large employers.
</P>
<P>
   But as the pressure increases on managed-care companies to find
new markets, the status quo in Syracuse has begun to change: over
the last three years, these companies have enrolled increasing
numbers of people here.
</P>
<P>
   For patients, this trend has meant adjusting to a new way of
getting care and paying for it. For doctors, feeling control of
their practices slipping from their grasp, it has meant using the
experience of colleagues in other cities as a guide to challenging
managed-care companies. Their solution has been to organize in
unionlike associations in numbers that exceed those in most other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need a middleman to manage health care,'' said Dr.
Paul Kardjian, a urologist in the eastern suburb of Oneida. ``We
are smart enough to do it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In the expanding movement by physicians to regain control of
their practices, doctors in Syracuse have decided that the way to
fight back is by joining together. Some 90 percent of doctors in
the city have formed independent practitioners' associations. Known
as IPAs, these groups are often likened to unions that allow
physicians to act as a collective unit to negotiate contracts with
health insurance companies, giving them more leverage at the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike doctors' unions, these associations do not limit
doctors to membership in only one association, and doctors who
disagree with the terms of a contract signed by their association
can disregard the agreement and make their own deals.
</P>
<P>
   There are four major independent practitioners' associations in
Syracuse, with memberships ranging from 350 to 850 members.
Administrators of national umbrella groups for such associations
estimate that there are more than 3,000 IPAs across the country. A
report by the Center for Studying Health System Change noted that
the associations in Syracuse had grown faster than those in most
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse, with a population of 164,000, is a quiet place
dominated by Syracuse University and surrounded by dairy farms. It
is a city where most people are proud to call themselves
conservative, even old-fashioned, and where concepts like managed
care seem new-fangled and are viewed with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Syracuse, Bill Nesfeder, a union
representative at the New Venture Gear plant, expressed a typical
view. He has been employed at the plant, which produces auto parts,
for 35 years, he said, and he has been enrolled in Blue Cross and
Blue Shield for about as long.
</P>
<P>
   The health plan has served him well, he said. He can go to any
doctor he wants, whenever he wants, and if he is sick, insurance
pays the full bill. Insurance does not cover routine visits,
however, including annual checkups.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he said, he has problems getting Blue Cross to cover
certain medical expenses. But the freedom of choice, he said, is
worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like we are moving into socialized medicine,'' said
Nesfeder, 62, the benefits representative for the United Automobile
Workers, Local 624. ``A lot of people are joining the HMOs because
they don't have to pay nothing. Well I'm not looking for a free
ride in life.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a stack of blue folders about as tall as his
coffee mug. They are complaints, he said, from employees about the
kind of care they get, and all the rules they have to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Views like that helped keep managed-care enrollment low in
Syracuse for years. In addition, the city has not had a glut of
hospitals or doctors, so there was little need for health-care
providers to court managed-care companies in the hopes of securing
more customers.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, only 14 percent of Syracuse residents with
health insurance were covered by health maintenance organizations.
That number has grown to 19 percent, according to a report by the
Center for Studying Health System Change, a research group. The
figure is still low compared with the national average of 32
percent, but heading upward.
</P>
<P>
   The shift toward managed care is clear at New Venture Gear. Over
the last five years, benefits administrators said, many employees
have switched from Blue Cross to Prepaid Health Plan, the HMO that
the company uses. Five years ago, company officials said, less than
1,000 of the 3,000 hourly employees were enrolled in Prepaid.
Today, more than 2,000 are in the plan, with most saying they have
switched because the costs are lower and more services are covered.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Wierzbicki, who has worked at New Venture Gear for 22 years,
said he switched to Prepaid four years ago, after the birth of his
first daughter, reasoning that a newborn would need numerous trips
to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, it was Wierzbicki, 47, who needed medical
attention. He began having trouble breathing through his nose and
developed intense headaches. His doctor recommended surgery to open
his nasal passages. But Prepaid, Wierzbicki said, would not pay for
the surgery, calling it an uncovered cosmetic procedure, nor would
it allow a second opinion from a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Wierzbicki said he took aspirin by the handfuls as he and his
wife, Karen, fought the managed-care company's decision. A year and
a half later, after state Health Department officials began
investigating, Wierzbicki said, Prepaid allowed him to get a second
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did was just awful,'' Mrs. Wierzbicki said. ``They
made us jump through all kind of hoops. Meanwhile, my husband was
suffering terribly. They cared more about money than about his
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The new doctor determined that the breathing problems were
caused by heavy goggles Wierzbicki wears for work, and ordered him
to get a lighter pair. The change has made all the difference in
his condition, Wierzbicki said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite his conflict with the HMO, Wierzbicki said that he
has decided to remain in Prepaid because it costs so much less than
Blue Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis Nave fumed when recalling the times he has prescribed
certain medications to patients, only to have a health maintenance
organization refuse to cover them and offer what he considers
inappropriate alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurance companies have gotten between the patients and
the doctors,'' he said. ``It has created a monster. It's time to
try things a new way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Corwin, a pediatrician and medical director at
Healthbest, an independent practitioners association with 850
doctors, said ``What we are looking for is to give physicians back
the ability to make sure that they are giving their patients the
kind of care they need. In our negotiations with HMOs, we remind
them that they are an insurance company, and that they are not
responsible for providing health care. Those decisions must be left
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the insurers, he said, ``walk away.'' Others, however,
stay and negotiate. And in some cases, the doctors have won
significant concessions.
</P>
<P>
   After almost eight months of negotiations last year, Healthbest
won a contract with the giant managed-care company Kaiser
Permanente that restored to doctors the power to make referrals for
their patients without getting the company's approval.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Kaiser Permanente's northeast division, Tim
Riley, said that for the doctors at Healthbest, the contract was a
``feather in their cap.'' After the Syracuse negotiations, he said,
Kaiser Permanente decided to give all its Northeast physicians the
same referral powers.
</P>
<P>
   Lured by the ease of signing one contact that covers a large
group of doctors rather than establishing their own community
networks one doctor at a time, officials at Kaiser and other HMOs
in the region said that they welcomed independent practitioners'
associations.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the negotiations with Healthbest, Kaiser now
allows doctors' representatives to sit on committees that decide
which drugs will be covered by the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Healthbest took its next step toward physician
independence by beginning to market its own health plan directly to
employers that have at least 200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians became a nonplayer at the table,'' said Dr. John
Wight, a primary care physician affiliated with Healthbest.
``Employers and insurance companies worked out their deals without
doctors. These IPAs are the best chance we have for getting our
place back at the table.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Linda Tripp, the woman whose secret tape recordings
made her the reviled symbol of a double-crossing friend, says now
that her deepest regret is the pain that she caused Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In her first lengthy interview since the scandal began 13 months
ago, Mrs. Tripp said she betrayed Ms. Lewinsky to save the young
woman from being abused by the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mom, especially with a daughter close in age to Monica, I
would hope some other mom would do for my daughter what I did for
Monica, despite the fact that it looks horrible, that it looks like
betrayal,'' Mrs. Tripp said as she broke down in tears toward the
end of a two-hour conversation here on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Her interview with The New York Times was the first in a series
of media appearances she has scheduled in an effort to rehabilitate
her image. She will appear on NBC's ``Today'' show on Friday
morning and on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   It might strain credulity that Mrs. Tripp now portrays herself
as Ms. Lewinsky's surrogate mother, a woman who had no choice but
to teach tough lessons to a wayward daughter, even if the methods
were unorthodox. Her tone in the interview contrasted sharply with
the Linda Tripp heard on her now-infamous audiotapes, where she
seemed manipulative, pushing Ms. Lewinsky to demand high-powered
help from the president's friend, Vernon Jordan, in finding a job,
and encouraging her to insist on getting one before signing her
false affidavit in the Paula Jones lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   It was her decision to turn over those tapes to Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel, that transformed a private Washington
affair into a public national scandal. But Mrs. Tripp contends it
was Lucianne Goldberg, a New York literary agent, who encouraged
her to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me to go to Ken Starr,'' Mrs. Tripp said.
``It wasn't on my radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also Ms. Goldberg, she said, who pushed her to reveal Ms.
Lewinsky's affair with the president to lawyers for Ms. Jones, who
was suing Clinton for sexual misconduct. It was Ms. Goldberg who
gave the Jones lawyers Mrs. Tripp's unlisted telephone number, she
said, adding that she spoke at length with one of those lawyers in
October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Told about Mrs. Tripp's remarks Thursday night, Ms. Goldberg
said simply, ``Whatever Linda says, Linda says.'' She declined to
comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mrs. Tripp describes herself as Ms. Lewinsky's protector,
perhaps her ``only friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always saw Monica as a kid, I always saw her as a lost
soul,'' Mrs. Tripp said. ``I believe she and the country will never
understand that I believed this was in her best interest, and that
makes me very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   When told about Mrs. Tripp's comments, Judy Smith, the
spokeswoman for Ms. Lewinsky, said, ``At the appropriate time,
Monica Lewinsky will respond to these and other erroneous
remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old Pentagon employee, who has changed her hairstyle
and lost about 40 pounds in the last year, appeared poised and
articulate. She said she is now convinced that Ms. Lewinsky was so
distraught about her affair with Clinton that Mrs. Tripp feared
that her young friend might do herself harm. ``I didn't believe
that Monica could put this behind her unless it was severed once
and for all,'' Mrs. Tripp said.
</P>
<P>
   She bristled at the notion that the president's relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky was sex between consenting adults, as many have
described it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the farthest thing from that,'' she said angrily. ``It
was horrifying, is what it actually was. This was a young girl who,
as an enthusiastic participant in this relationship, fell head over
heels in love with the president. He clearly did not share those
feelings and his callous abuse in discarding Monica Lewinsky made
it look as if he thought of her as a servicing contract, a woman
who could be easily discarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans view Mrs. Tripp as the villain in the Clinton sex
scandal, and see her as an archetype of a girlfriend betraying a
girlfriend. They were incensed at Mrs. Tripp's advice to Mrs.
Lewinsky not to dry-clean that stained navy blue dress from the
Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has shown I should have told her that,'' Mrs. Tripp
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Starr report, Mrs. Tripp had told Ms. Lewinsky
that she looked fat in it and she should not wear it to a
Thanksgiving dinner. Mrs. Tripp even plotted with Ms. Goldberg
about stealing it from Ms. Lewinsky's closet.

 WASHINGTON: Lewinsky's closet. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp was joined during the interview by her friend and
spokesman, Philip Coughter, and two lawyers, Joseph Murtha and
Anthony Zaccagnini. Although she was clearly nervous and
uncomfortable as the interview began, she quickly relaxed and
talked thoughtfully _ and, at times, emphatically _ about her
feelings about the president, Ms. Lewinsky and the momentous
consequences of her decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp said it was obvious that her self-imposed silence, in
deciding not to give interviews over the last year, had shaped
``the conventional wisdom right now as it defines Linda Tripp.''
And Mrs. Tripp acknowledged that the public's general opinion of
her would be difficult to change. ``It's so untrue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of her friends agreed this week that Mrs. Tripp's public
image was damaged by the self-serving public statement she
delivered last August on the courthouse steps after testifying to
the Starr grand jury. ``I'm you,'' she said then. ``I'm just like
you. I'm an average American who found herself in a situation not
of her own making.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Mrs. Tripp said, ``To the extent that I can
allow people to know me just a little bit, I hope that I can change
a small degree of public perception about me and, more importantly,
what drove me to make the decisions I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp still has problems. A single parent of two children,
a son, Ryan, 23, and a daughter, Allison, 19, Mrs. Tripp owes
nearly $500,000 in fees to her lawyers and spokesman. And a grand
jury is investigating her on potential criminal charges in the
secret recording of Ms. Lewinsky from her home telephone in
Maryland, where taping of conversations requires the consent of
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Although she fears that she might be dismissed from her Pentagon
job, Mrs. Tripp continues to work from home, and she recently
received a raise to $92,000 a year. While she did not rule out a
book deal in the future, she said she had no current plans to write
a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole country has suffered from having to hear the
indignities of the actions the president took, the choices he
made,'' she said. ``His family has suffered. All of us have, in one
way or another, paid a price for the choices he's made.'' She later
added, ``I don't know that we'll ever know, or at least not for a
long time, whether we've learned a national lesson through it all
or not.'' She did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking her head, Mrs. Tripp said softly that ``a year's worth
of national tragedy'' could have been easily avoided by ``some
honesty from the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her deep animosity toward Clinton, Mrs. Tripp said she
believed that removing him from office was too severe a punishment.
She said she hoped the Senate would pass a bipartisan censure
resolution in which the president would be required to acknowledge
that he had lied under oath and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally so far,'' she said, ``it appears that he will suffer
no dire consequences for his actions. The fear I have is that he
will take from this a sense of his own omnipotence, that he truly
can defy all odds and do something, virtually anything short of
murder, and Houdini his way out of something that most people would
find it very difficult to explain away.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times, Mrs. Tripp expressed her ``high esteem'' for
Starr and the professionalism of his prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the tragedies of this story is that a man held
in such high regard professionally as Judge Starr would be so
roundly denigrated to the point of shamefulness,'' she said. ``What
a price to pay to do his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp said her decisions to secretly record the confidences
of her young friend _ and then turn over those tapes to Starr _
were motivated by a combination of fear and outrage at the
president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear, certainly, and foremost,'' she said. ``And secondly, a
sense of building outrage. Monica Lewinsky was, in fact, what I
refer to privately as the straw that broke the camel's back.''
</P>
<P>
   Banished in 1994 from the White House, where she worked in the
counsel's office, to a basement cubicle in the Pentagon, Mrs. Tripp
had an almost Zelig-like quality of being front and center at
several Clinton administration scandals. In November 1993, Mrs.
Tripp was the first woman to talk with Kathleen Willey after the
White House volunteer claimed that the president forced himself
upon her sexually just outside the Oval Office. And Mrs. Tripp was
the last White House employee to speak with Vincent Foster, the
White House lawyer who committed suicide in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't create these scandals,'' Mrs. Tripp said. ``I was
given a ringside seat to witness them.''
</P>
<P>
   And although she planned in 1996 to write a tell-all book
chronicling what she believed were the secrets and lies of the
Clinton administration, Mrs. Tripp denied that a lucrative book
contract is what motivated her to seek the advice of Ms. Goldberg
in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Ms. Goldberg urged Mrs. Tripp to begin
tape-recording her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. ``You've got to
really rat and you've got to tape,'' Ms. Goldberg told Mrs. Tripp
at the time, according to a transcript of their phone conversation,
saying no one would believe her without them. Mrs. Tripp agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp said she spoke at length about Ms. Lewinsky with one
of the Jones lawyers, David Pike, in late October 1997. ``I never
called,'' she said. ``He called me at home. I have an unlisted
number. He got my number from Lucianne.'' She added that she does
not share Ms. Goldberg's political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp spoke publicly for the first time about the talking
points, the three-page document Ms. Lewinsky gave her on Jan. 14,
1998, that purportedly coached Mrs. Tripp on how to testify in a
deposition in the Jones lawsuit. Early on in Starr's inquiry, the
talking points were seen as the key to the obstruction of justice
investigation. But that expectation was deflated after Ms. Lewinsky
testified that she wrote the talking points memo herself _ a
statement that Mrs. Tripp dismissed with a roll of the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that Monica wrote those on her own is about as
likely as her coauthoring the Gettysburg Address with Lincoln,''
she said. She added that she believes they were ``dictated by a
senior White House official,'' but did not say who.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Starr's prosecutors and agents confronted Ms.
Lewinsky at the Pentagon City Mall in suburban Virginia, where she
had gone to meet Mrs. Tripp at the Ritz Carlton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp recalled that Ms. Lewinsky told her, ``Thanks a
lot,'' in a sarcastic way.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said it like a recalcitrant little child,'' Mrs. Tripp
said. ``Of all the things she could have said, I think that was
rather bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp recalled that she told Ms. Lewinsky, ``They did it to
me, too.'' But Mrs. Tripp acknowledged that the remark _ a
reference to her also being the target of Starr's sting operation _
was a lie. Mrs. Tripp said that brief exchange was the last time
she had spoken with Ms. Lewinsky, and she added that she deeply
regrets how their friendship ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so fond of Monica,'' Mrs. Tripp said. ``I remain as fond
of her today as I always have been. And I wish her nothing but the
best.''

FINANCIAL AUDIT QUESTIONED DURING SALT LAKE CITY'S BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The accounting firm hired to audit the financial books of the
Salt Lake City committee as it was trying to secure the 2002 Winter
Olympic Games discovered some of the questionable payments that
have resulted in an international scandal, but nonetheless gave the
committee a clean bill of financial health.
</P>
<P>
   That decision and others made by the firm, Ernst &AMP; Young, were
questioned by the Salt Lake ethics panel that investigated improper
payments and gift-giving during the bidding process. While the
panel placed most of the blame for the improprieties on several
former committee officials in a report it released Tuesday, it also
painted an unflattering portrait of the audit work done by Ernst &AMP;
Young, particularly in 1995. That year, committee executives spent
lavishly on gifts of cash, vacations and college tuition to
International Olympic Committee delegates who were voting on the
Salt Lake City bid. Salt Lake City was awarded the Games in a
landslide vote in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Not mentioned in the panel's report, however, are details of
some of the ties between Ernst &AMP; Young and the Salt Lake City
Olympic Committee that could raise questions about whether the
auditing firm had grown too close to its client.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1997, the committee hired a top Ernst &AMP; Young
partner, who had supervised the audit, to be its top financial
executive for about six months. That same partner traveled to
Budapest in 1995 to be with bid committee members as they made
their final presentation to the IOC. Auditors must be independent
from their clients because their job is to give an unbiased opinion
on whether the financial statements are fair and accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement yesterday, Ernst &AMP; Young said it had done
nothing wrong. It said the firm had followed proper auditing
standards when it brought the undocumented expenditures to the
attention of the committee's top management and to the trustees
sitting on the board's audit committee. ``Any suggestion that we
blindly accepted management explanations is simply incorrect,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Howarth, a firm spokesman, said ``there was absolutely no
problem'' with how the Salt Lake City committee had later hired
Jerry McClain, the former managing partner of the firm's Salt Lake
City office. And, he said that McClain had traveled to Budapest
just like many other Salt Lake City business executives had done in
order to support the committee's final efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, audit committee chairman James Beardall disputed Ernst
&AMP; Young's claims that he had been told by the auditors about the
undocumented expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Beardall's lawyer, Jefferson Gross, said in a written statement:
`` Beardall is disappointed by the mounting evidence of
shortcomings in the quality of Ernst &AMP; Young's audit services to
the Salt Lake Bid Committee.'' The statement said Ernst &AMP; Young had
given a written report to the audit committee that stated that
``Over all, we assessed the controls as effective.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the ethics panel's report, the auditors discovered
some questionable payments made in 1995 were not supported by
documentation and had not been properly authorized. But the
auditors relied on assurances from committee president Thomas Welch
and other officials that the payments were proper because they had
been authorized when the trustees approved the annual budget, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the trustees told the ethics panel they had never
approved of a practice where checks could be written without the
proper documentation and approvals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The auditors appear, however, to have accepted senior
management's explanations,'' the panel's report said, ``and, like
they did every year, presented the Bid Committee in Fiscal Year
1995 with an unqualified `clean' opinion, the highest form of
opinion extended by independent auditors.''

CITY COLUMN: A SHOOTING, AND SHOOTING FROM THE HIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remember ``it's Giuliani time''?
</P>
<P>
   That, we were told, is what police officers snarled while
allegedly torturing Abner Louima in a Brooklyn precinct house 18
months ago. The incendiary phrase shot across the city like a
rocket-propelled grenade. Only problem: Louima later acknowledged
that it was never said.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Jose (Kiko) Garcia?
</P>
<P>
   He was the Dominican immigrant shot to death by a police officer
in Washington Heights seven years ago. Two sisters told how he was
beaten, then shot while lying helpless on the floor. There were
nights of street unrest. Only problem: Garcia turned out to be an
armed drug suspect. A grand jury found the sisters' story to be
untrue, and said the officer had acted in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Kevin Cedeno?
</P>
<P>
   He was the Washington Heights teen-ager shot in the back by a
police officer in 1997. There was outrage then, too. The Bronx
borough president, Fernando Ferrer, called the shooting ``an
execution.'' Only problem: Cedeno was carrying a two-foot-long
machete that a grand jury decided could have been mistaken for a
shotgun about to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   In short, things are not always what they seem at first, a
truism that can be forgotten in times of passion. But it seems
worth bearing in mind in the stomach-wrenching death of Amadou
Diallo, the unarmed African immigrant gunned down in the Bronx by
four police officers who fired an almost inconceivable 41 bullets
at him.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that Diallo did anything to warrant such a
response, and it is obvious that something went terribly wrong. But
charged words like ``murderers,'' ``massacre'' and ``execution''
have been casually tossed around in street protests, which seem
likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
   While the anger is understandable, it is unclear how anyone can
reach such damning conclusions based on the available evidence. Who
knows at this point if the four officers had malice in their hearts
or if they panicked in the face of an illusory threat they thought
to be real? It does make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   As horrified as everyone is by those 41 shots, a more enduring
question for New Yorkers may be why Bullet No. 1 was fired. Until a
grand jury weighs in, something that takes time and a smidgen of
public patience, answers may remain out of reach, no matter how
many protests are held.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't target practice,'' said James Savage, acting
president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Savage is well aware that skeptics will not take him at face
value, especially in black and Hispanic neighborhoods. The same can
be said of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir, who are now paying the price for mechanistic responses to
questionable police shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Odd as the comparison may seem, it is hard not to think back a
few years to the intifada, the Palestinians' anti-Israel uprising.
</P>
<P>
   When Palestinians raged against military occupation, Israeli
officials responded with sheaves of figures showing how life was
better under their rule. Education levels were up, infant mortality
was down and so on. The statistics were accurate. But they took no
account of the humiliations, large and small, that Palestinians
felt every day at the hands of the Israeli Army.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani offers statistics in much the same way, to show that
his police do not generally have an itchy trigger finger and that a
plunging murder rate has kept thousands of black and Hispanic New
Yorkers alive. But his numbers, however accurate, cannot reflect
the anger felt by people stopped and frisked by the police each day
only because they are W.W.B. _ Walking While Black.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliation is hard to quantify. So is the mayor's resistance to
apologizing when things go wrong _ unless perhaps for something
that happened on his predecessor's watch, like the Crown Heights
disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has saved more blacks and Hispanics from violence than
Mayor Giuliani, and yet he is painted as a racist,'' said Michael
Julian, a former senior official in the Police Department. That, he
said, is because the mayor has done little to break the
wagons-in-a-circle mentality of most officers. He may have even
made it worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cops are intolerant of critics, and now they have an
administration like that,'' Julian said. ``It has an effect on how
minorities react.'' If the mayor and the police had only shown more
empathy over the years, he said, ``they might have had more support
now that they really need it.''

EVEN WITH A COURT ORDER, AMERICAN AIRLINES STILL MUST CANCEL 1,100
FLIGHTS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tourist industry's high hopes that accompanied the court
order issued Wednesday requiring pilots of American Airlines to
return to work were dashed Thursday, as the airline was still
forced to cancel 1,100 flights _ many to popular holiday and
vacation resorts in Florida and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport resounded with the
sounds of happy travelers bound for ski resorts in Colorado and
other Western states, but American flights to the warm-weather
destinations were canceled left and right because many pilots
continued to call in sick.
</P>
<P>
   At John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, hundreds
of American ticket holders waited in line, some as much as eight
hours, in fading hopes of getting away for the holiday or on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no customer service,'' said Sandra Lowe,
who arrived at Kennedy with her husband and two daughters at 6 a.m.
to catch a plane to Barbados for a family reunion. Five hours
later, Ms. Lowe was still waiting in a virtually immobile line,
fatigued and annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Would she fly American again? ``I would avoid it at all costs,''
Ms. Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hotard, a spokesman at American's parent, the AMR Corp.,
said that 1,100 flights had been canceled, but declined to specify
which routes had been affected.
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ``I can tell you there have been many cancellations
of international flights, including flights to the Caribbean, from
New York and Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines said that they would continue to honor American
tickets to the best of their ability, but that their own flights
were rapidly filling with normal holiday passengers and American
customers looking for alternative flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are almost no seats left to South Florida,'' said Todd
Clay, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines, ``but if people are flexible
and determined, they still might be able to get where they want to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines added two flights on Tuesday and Wednesday
between New York and Santo Domingo and Puerto Plata in the
Dominican Republic, accommodating 400 American passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they have empty seats, rival airlines said they would
accommodate only those American passengers holding tickets that had
not been acquired using frequent-flier miles. American customers
who are assigned seats on other airlines will be eligible to
receive frequent-flier miles only from the host airline.
</P>
<P>
   Still, frequent-flier miles were probably not foremost on the
minds of travelers milling around many major airports, expecting to
take American flights. At Miami International Airport, for example
_ where ``canceled'' appeared on the information boards for
American flights to Puerto Rico, Grenada, Jamaica, Mexico City, the
Grand Caymans and many Central and South American nations _ the
line of passengers hoping to fly to Mexico and the Caribbean was so
long that it collided with the lines for domestic check-in, around
the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Bernice Wynter, a nurse from Lauderdale Lakes, Fla., was in that
line hoping to arrive in Barbados for a wedding. ``I got to Fort
Lauderdale airport and the flight was canceled, so they sent me
here,'' she said. Like many other American passengers, Ms. Wynter
appeared more resigned and frustrated than angry.
</P>
<P>
   Some of American's five daily nonstops from Dallas to New
Orleans were also canceled, just as the city's two-week Mardi Gras
celebration was building to its Fat Tuesday peak, now four days
off. Hotels there reported few cancellations, according to Beverly
Gianna, a spokeswoman for the city's tourist bureau, largely
because many of the estimated 350,000 visitors to the city during
the carnival drive there. Moreover, the dominant carriers in New
Orleans are Southwest Airlines and Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   While American flights to San Juan were canceled, the carrier's
regional airline, American Eagle, has continued to operate from San
Juan throughout the Caribbean. Its pilots belong to a different
union.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Michael Youngman, the executive director of the Caribbean
Tourism Organization, called Thursday's cancellations ``really bad
news.'' Almost all the 33 member governments in the group, which
include Mexico as well as the tiny island of Saba, rely heavily on
tourism from the United States. Most are also heavily dependent on
American and American Eagle, which account for almost 70 percent of
the region's air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the sickout's economic impact on the Caribbean,
Youngman replied, ``By next week I should be able to tell you, but
with everything changing by the hour, it's impossible to know
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Holder, the secretary general of the organization, was
scheduled to take an American flight on Wednesday from Barbados to
New York for a series of meetings, but managed to switch to BWIA
International at the start of the sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Finding it necessary to return to Barbados Saturday _ when most
scheduled flights are sold out or canceled _ he was able to find a
seat on a British Airways Concorde, only the second Concorde flight
ever from the United States to Barbados.

PATRICIA DUFF PREPARES FOR LIFE AFTER BILLIONAIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ask Patricia Duff what her life has been like since
arriving in New York in 1994, and she has a fast answer.
``Aaaaaah!'' she said Thursday morning, then put her hands on her
head as if running for cover.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed an appropriate response. In the last four and a half
years, Ms. Duff walked out on her marriage to a Hollywood studio
executive, married Ronald O. Perelman, the Revlon billionaire, gave
birth to their daughter the next day, helped raise tens of millions
of dollars for her friend, President Clinton, then divorced
Perelman after the couple had a much-dissected blow-up at the 1996
Democratic Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Duff is in a very public custody and child support
battle over Caleigh, her 4-year-old daughter with Perelman.
Nonetheless, she said that when the custody trial was over she
would stay in New York and raise money for the presidential
campaign of Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   For now, she is in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea,'' said Ms. Duff, still referring to her life in
New York. She stopped, looking for words. ``You know, I've always
loved New York. It's funny to me, because people always think that
Hollywood was so shark-infested. But I think Washington and New
York can be a little tougher towns.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duff spoke over breakfast at the Peacock Alley restaurant of
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, where she has lived with
her daughter in the adjoining Waldorf Towers since her divorce from
Perelman in September. (She also has a house on 21 acres in
Southport, Conn.)
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the few times she had agreed to an interview in
New York. Her timing was curious, given the custody battle, but her
motive seemed to be to focus attention on her Democratic
fund-raising work and her plans post-trial. She did not criticize
Perelman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of hard to move forward,'' she said. ``I'm
hoping I can get this behind me, and move on with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Very briefly, each side wants full custody of Caleigh.
Perelman's representatives say he has given Ms. Duff $30 million in
cash, real estate and jewelry, plus $1.2 million in alimony; Ms.
Duff's representatives say it is closer to $12 million. Perelman is
also giving Ms. Duff temporary child support of $12,000 a month; in
addition, Ms. Duff wants him to provide a Manhattan apartment or
house for her and Caleigh that will accommodate the 24-hour live-in
security he insists on.
</P>
<P>
   The battle, stalled at the moment, is occurring in state Supreme
Court in Manhattan. Last month, Ms. Duff's lawyers, Ken and Rita
Warner, were disqualified by the court over a conflict of interest
because they had once represented Claudia Cohen, the gossip
reporter, another of Perelman's former wives. Ms. Duff, who has had
five teams of lawyers, is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duff looked remarkably serene over breakfast, considering.
She is 44 and thin, with pale blond hair and delicate skin _ a
woman who has always been talked about in terms of her beauty. She
appeared simultaneously fragile, careful and savvy, and seemed to
agree with friends who say that her looks have complicated her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are all kinds of expectations about who and what
you are, based on how you look,'' she said. ``And I'm always
bumping up against those expectations. It's far different than I
feel internally about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving money aside, many of those same friends still wonder why
she married Perelman, whom she met almost immediately on the
rebound after her marriage to Mike Medavoy, then the chairman of
Tristar Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald and I had a whirlwind romance,'' Ms. Duff said. ``As a
result of which, I have a wonderful, beautiful child.'' She said
her goal then was to have a family for her daughter and ``to try
and make the relationship work.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, she wanted to be a diplomat. She lived until she was
10 in Woodland Hills, Calif., in those days outlying horse country
and farmland about an hour from downtown Los Angeles. ``I remember
tumbleweed,'' Ms. Duff said.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, who worked for Hughes Aircraft, moved the family to
Europe and Ms. Duff graduated from the International School of
Brussels at 17. She went to Barnard College until her parents'
divorce forced her to drop out for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to criticize my dad,'' she said. ``But it was
very hard. I had high hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duff ended up at Georgetown University on a partial
scholarship, graduated in 1976, worked on Capitol Hill, went to
work for the Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell, became a vice
president in the firm of the Democratic political consultant Bob
Squier, then left Washington to organize Hollywood for the 1984
Presidential campaign of Gary Hart.
</P>
<P>
   While there, she met and married Medavoy, who was the national
finance chairman of Hart's campaign. He was her third husband; Ms.
Duff had been married briefly to a high school boyfriend from
Brussels and then a Washington lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles she founded a forum for candidates called Show
Coalition, which introduced Bill Clinton, then the governor of
Arkansas, to the Hollywood establishment.
</P>
<P>
   These days she is dating Sen. Robert G. Torricelli of New
Jersey, whom she describes as ``smart'' and ``well versed in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not sure she will marry for a fifth time. ``I certainly
think I'm going to be more cautious,'' she said.

SANDY BEACHES ARE LEAST SENSITIVE TO SPILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   COOS BAY _ The growing oil spill here threatens priceless
natural resources, but this may be one of the best places on the
Oregon Coast to clean it up and limit the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to burn-off the fuel aboard the beached freighter New
Carissa were inspired by fear of a nightmarish alternative: beaches
and inlets smeared with up to 400,000 gallons of oil products.
</P>
<P>
   At risk are rocky tidepools, oyster-choked mudflats and pristine
estuaries, those prime wildlife nurseries where salt and fresh
water merge. Also in danger of contamination are seal and sea lion
haul-out areas, Oregon's best nesting area for the threatened
Western snowy plover and a host of other seabirds and shorebirds.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the New Carissa wrecked at the southern
end of Oregon's longest stretch of sandy beaches. Though sand looks
messy with oil on it, it is the least ecologically sensitive and
easiest coastal surface to clean.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, rocky tidepools and mudflats can be so hard to
clean that treatment may be worse than the oil, said Sharon
Christopherson, a scientist from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's Hazmat Team.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents here have already gained experience on beach
cleanup. For the past week, as strings and tar globs of oil washed
up on beaches, cleanup crews have pushed the black goo into piles
and shoveled it into bags. All-terrain-vehicles lugged the filled
bags to staging areas.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of oil released so far has been relatively small, by
the official consensus here, and little has been reported beyond
two miles from the ship. As of late Thursday, only three birds have
been treated here by the International Bird Rescue Research Center,
according to its director, Jay Holcomb. Five birds have been
reported dead. One seal was found dead, though officials said they
had not concluded whether oil caused its death.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the spill is growing more hazardous with each day.
Migrations of birds will build in the coming weeks, and plover
nesting season will start about March 15.
</P>
<P>
   While ready to accelerate beach cleanup, officials say they have
prepared to protect other, more sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hoffmeister, of the Bureau of Land Management's Coos Bay
District, said his greatest fear was that an oil slick would drift
a few miles south of the wreck and get sucked with the tide into
Coos Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The mouth of Coos Bay harbor is only a few hundred yards wide,
but it is so turbulent, with waves meeting tidal flows, that
oil-recovery booms cannot work there. Christopherson said hydraulic
pressure would push oil under or over the boom.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, red and yellow floating booms _ designed to prevent
oil from passing _ were strung across the mouth of Coos Bay's South
Slough, a near-pristine estuary that flows into the bay from
marshes and muddy tideflats further south. It holds commercial
oyster beds, and is untainted enough to be one of only 23 National
Estuarine Reserves where teams of biologists conduct research.
</P>
<P>
   Some oil boom has been stored inside Coos Bay. Oyster farmers in
North Coos Bay have begged officials to deploy them across the
harbor to protect their shellfish. But despite some oil sightings
in the bay, no boom has yet been deployed beyond the mouth of South
Slough.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern of biologists is that oil might drift south of
the bay's mouth to the rocky Cape Arago area. It is used by
hundreds of seals and sea lions that are vulnerable to oil
contamination. It also holds tidepools that host a rich variety of
anemones, crabs, starfish, chitons and other marine wildlife.
Christopherson said if they are oiled, treatment with hot water,
steam, or manual scrubbing may be considered. But in the most
biologically rich areas, treatment may be light to avoid doing more
harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Thursday they had also deployed an oil boom
across Ten Mile Creek, the first watercourse entering the Pacific
north of the wrecked freighter, to protect its tidal wetlands. They
have built stockpiles of boom as far north up the coast as the
Umpqua River, which has a sensitive estuary.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, a wind from the south was carrying the oil
northward, offshore somewhat. Scientists said it may weather
somewhat at sea, then wash ashore. And they expressed the hope that
flames will consume most of the oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burning the oil is not what we would prefer to do,'' said
Christopherson. ``But it's less of a threat than what might
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts with leading environmental organizations expressed
regret that crews in Oregon were left with a choice of air
pollution from burning oil or water pollution from spilled oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of questions here,'' said Peter Lehner, a
senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ``What
are the human health impacts?
</P>
<P>
   ``The air plume is going to get pretty widely dispersed. Is this
the correct tradeoff? I don't know,'' Lehner said.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Fujita, a marine ecologist with the Environmental Defense
Fund, called the decision to blow the freighter's tanks, then
ignite them ``triage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what I know, I would rather see the stuff burn off. It
will dissipate in time,'' Fujita said. ``But if the oil gets into
sediments (of estuaries), it could be problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst fear, Fujita said, is that oil seeps into wetlands,
creating environmental problems that could last for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coos Bay is one of these enclosed estuaries with wetlands, and
it is very sensitive,'' he said.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    While the world seems content to wait out the Asian meltdown,
some Chilean exporters are tasting sweet success in that region's
supposedly battered consumer markets. Wine exports to Japan, for
one, grew a whopping 446 percent between September 1997 and
September 1998, when they reached US$75 million.
 &HT;    It appears Asia's rough ride of late gave price-conscious
imbibers good reason to consider alternatives. ``A Chilean wine,
moderately priced, is better than a French wine at the same
price,'' says Rodrigo Alvarado, director of Wines of Chile, the
industry's marketing association. ``Even if the French won't admit
this, the Japanese have found out it's true.'' A marketing fluke?
Perhaps not. Chile's key exports _ salmon, fruit, wine and copper _
have been riding high around the globe, thanks in recent years to
big-league product campaigns targeting high growth-potential
markets. Keeping up that momentum as Asia digs out is the aim of
the country's top marketing directors.
 &HT;    Past advertising efforts are just beginning to pay off, says
Chilean Salmon Farmers Association Director Rodrigo Infante. The
agency in 1997 ended a three-year, $4 million awareness campaign in
the United States, where consumption is about one pound per person
each year. A typical Japanese consumer, in comparison, eats around
17 pounds of the pink-fleshed fish a year. After buying radio time
and distributing salmon recipes at seafood counters in six cities,
sales rose 10 percent against U.S. markets with no campaign _ in
marketing terms, a very good return on investment. Through
September 1998, exports to the United States spiked upward another
29 percent, while Japan's consumption fell 22 percent, putting
total exports off 2 percent through the period.
 &HT;    For fruit growers, the Asian impact has been felt at the docks,
not the checkout stand. Many Asian countries simply choked off
imports to shore up ailing currencies. Season to season, fruit
exports to Korea are down 89 percent, to Malaysia off 41 percent
and to Singapore depressed by 68 percent. Sounds like a disaster,
but Asia represents only 6.5 percent of total Chilean fruit
exports, explains Luis Schmidt, president of Fedefruta, the Chilean
fruit growers group. Along with export agency Asexma, Fedefruta
spends $6 million a year to make sure buyers and consumers continue
to think Chile when they think fruit, half of that figure in the
United States alone. ``We've always done massive campaigns, but
it's expensive,'' says Schmidt. ``You have to spend $2 million in
Japan for a tiny result, because you have to buy TV and radio.''
 &HT;    Like the wine sellers, Chile's fruit companies got a break in
Asia: U.S. imports are suddenly no bargain, so consumers are
turning to Chile more than before. Where imports were not shut down
because of currency jitters, things got better. Hong Kong
consumption rose 30 percent, while Japan bought 19 percent more
Chilean fruit, generally table grapes, kiwis and apples.
 &HT;    Schmidt sees marketing spending steady for 1999, and he is
hopeful that regional recovery means countries like Korea will
lower short-term import barriers soon. Chile pced 161.1 million
crates of fruit in the 1997-98 season, sending 63.4 million crates
to the United States and just over 10 million crates to Asia.
 &HT;    Asia may yet blunt Chile's surge into world consciousness,
however. Budget cuts have forced ProChile, the government-run
marketing agency responsible for building Chile's image abroad, to
make do with the $2.5 million it got in 1997 and 1996. Originally
it had planned on getting a 15 percent increase in 1998.
 &HT;    What will hurt most, however, is the expected shortfall in
corporate cooperation, says Silvana Gattini, chief of ProChile's
North and Central America marketing unit.
 &HT;    ``What happens when there are crises is the private sector cuts
marketing budgets,'' says Gattini. ``Of course, that affects us.
Instead of doing the fairs with companies, we'll end up doing them
just with institutions, and probably in smaller venues.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile copper _ Chile's top export _ may not even feel the
impact of the world slowdown. That's because the final stop for
most copper is wiring and pipes for buildings and in cars,
refrigerators and electronics being pumped out by factories
worldwide. Chile produces 30 percent of the world's copper, far
ahead of any other nation. Prices are off about 17 percent, but
consumption has been essentially unaffected.
 &HT;    ``Any construction under way before July 1998 is continuing,''
says Hernan Sierralta, executive director of ProCobre, the Chilean
arm of the International Copper Association. The motor factories
haven't stopped making motors, and the refrigerator makers haven't
stopped putting out refrigerators.''
 &HT;    In fact, ProCobre is pumping up its Latin American marketing
effort for 1999, to $3.5 million from $2.8 million. ``Now more than
ever, we have to promote,'' says Sierralta. ``When there's a
crisis, that's when you have to market.''

CAN DE LA HOYA-QUARTEY FIGHT LIVE UP TO HYPE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hype and boxing go together like a fist in a
glove. Promoters make sure there is no shortage of hype for even
the lightest of lightweight bouts.
</P>
<P>
   But every once in a while, a fight comes along that lives up to
its hype. If Saturday night's Oscar De La Hoya-Ike Quartey bout in
Las Vegas does so, it will be remembered as the best welterweight
title fight since Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns tangled in
September of 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The Leonard-Hearns bout is considered one of the greatest
welterweight title fights ever. De La Hoya and Quartey will have to
go some to match the excitement that one provided.
</P>
<P>
   Top Rank's Bob Arum is promoting Saturday's fight. He also
promoted the Leonard-Hearns bout and still recalls Leonard's
victory by technical knockout in the 14th round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the uncertainty, the tension as to who would win the
fight,'' said Arum when asked his most vivid memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also remember the heat because it was September and it was
outdoors at Caesars Palace.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearns and Leonard traded heavy punches through the first six
rounds, with Leonard developing swelling under one eye. Hearns
began to work on the eye, which was beginning to close by the end
of the 12th round.
</P>
<P>
   But Leonard connected with a right to Hearns' head and then
unleashed a barrage of punches in the 13th round. Although Hearns
went through the ropes, it was ruled a push, not a knockdown.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard closed out the fight the next round. The bout was
stopped with Leonard pummeling Hearns in the middle of the ring, a
weary Hearns unable to fire back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that I had everything under control,'' Hearns said. ``I
was in control, winning the fight. But I just got careless and when
I got careless, that's when the fight started to cost me. And (the
stoppage) happened at a time when I was tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I just couldn't come back. I couldn't get everything
going. And the referee thought I couldn't make it so he stopped the
fight. I was just tired, not hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's bull,'' said Arum, who was Leonard's promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, tough, it was extremely tough,'' said Leonard. ``In fact,
Tommy and I did an interview (on television recently) and we talked
about the intensity of the fight, just the aura, the hype,
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult fight. Also back then, it was 15
rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   There are parallels to the De La Hoya-Quartey fight. Some of the
elements that fueled the anticipation for the Leonard-Hearns bout
are even greater for Saturday's fight, Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty of who might win, he said, is magnified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' Arum said, ``because both guys Saturday have
good chins, and Tommy, at that point, didn't have the best chin in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other comparisons. De La Hoya (29-0, 24 KOs) is
undefeated. A draw is the only blemish on Quartey's record (34-0-1,
29 KOs). Leonard had one loss at the time -- to Roberto Duran --
and had avenged it. Hearns was undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``And people had been talking about who was the better fighter
for some time,'' Arum said of Leonard-Hearns. ``This fight maybe
more so because neither has lost. These are the two best
welterweights in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things are different, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between mine and Thomas Hearns' (bout) was that
we were both personalities,'' Leonard said. ``We had a captive
audience back then because I was fighting on free TV, the networks.
And now that the network TV is gone, it's tough to create
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar's a personality because of the Olympics, exposure in the
market and management. Ike Quartey is a great fighter, but a
champion who is not really known, especially here in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Quartey said he watched a little boxing in the 1980s as
a youngster, he doesn't recall specific fighters. De La Hoya,
however, is a student of the game, and knows all about
Leonard-Hearns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great honor, those past champions in the
welterweight division coming back and having interest for this
fight,'' De La Hoya said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a wonderful idea to bring them in, because it's
their magnitude that is going to bring out all the interest for
people to want to watch this fight.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who will win Saturday? Neither Leonard nor Hearns would pick
a winner, but they did offer insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this fight with Oscar and Ike as the same type of
fight with Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns,'' Hearns said. ``You're
going to have the same thing going because both guys are, like our
fight, trying to prove something.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gotta prove to the world how good they really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard provided more of a handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if Oscar comes out of the gate fast, if Quartey
is not able to contend with that, Oscar wins, almost easily,''
Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think if Quartey can defend himself against Oscar's
onslaught, it could be a very interesting fight as the rounds go
by. Because Ike has a good, strong powerful left jab. It's going to
be a matter of who initiates and who dictates the tempo of the
fight.''

MARION JONES WANTS TO BE `THE GREATEST EVER' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RON DICKER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Florence Griffith Joyner's widower looking on,
the sprinter Marion Jones declared Thursday that she hoped to win
four gold medals at the world track and field championships this
summer and eventually be ``considered the greatest ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Earning that distinction would most likely involve toppling
Griffith Joyner's world record of 10.49 seconds in the 100 meters,
set in 1988. The 23-year-old Jones ran a personal-best 10.65
seconds last September and was unbeaten in the 100 and 200 last
year. The world championships will be run in Seville, Spain, in
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before my career is over, I hope to have the chance, if it's a
perfect day and everything is just right,'' Jones said at the
Waldorf-Astoria, hours before she was to receive the Jesse Owens
International Award as the world's top Olympic-sport athlete for
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was ranked first in the world in the 100, 200 and long
jump, the first American woman to achieve that distinction. She won
36 of 37 events (finishing second in her final long jump of the
season) and became the first woman to capture her three specialties
at the U.S. national championships since Stella Walsh in 1948.
Jones finished under the 11-second barrier 20 straight times,
including in wind-aided races, and leaped 23 feet 11 3/4 inches in
the long jump, an event she is still mastering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the feeling yet of having a great jump,'' she
said, of a track career that shared early greatness with her
successful basketball pursuits as a 5-foot-10-inch guard at the
University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Al Joyner, who flew here 10 years ago with his wife, Florence,
when she received the Owens award, said that ``the person who
believes she will break the record will break the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner said that if Jones did not break his late wife's mark in
the 100, Jones still could pull a whole new generation into the
sport, especially with the Sydney Olympics next year. Jones could
haul in three individual gold medals, plus a fourth in the
400-meter relay and a fifth if she were to run in the 1,600-meter
relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be entirely up to the coaches,'' Jones has said of
whether she might run a 400 in the relay after such a demanding
Olympic schedule. ``But I'll be there if they want me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has changed one aspect of her life since last summer by
marrying C.J. Hunter, a shot-putter, last October. She will begin
her outdoor campaign on March 26 in South Africa, and she will take
nothing for granted despite her obvious gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People put aside the fact that I'm a hard worker,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' mother, Marion Toler, sees other priorities for her
daughter besides the fame that could lift her daughter into a class
with such Olympic greats as Wilma Rudolph, Wyomia Tyus, Jackie
Joyner-Kersee and Griffith Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like my daughter to complete her athletic life by
giving back'' once her career is over, her mother said.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    SANTIAGO de CHILE _ Mientras el mundo parece sentarse a esperar
a que pasen los estragos de la debacle asiatica, algunos
exportadores chilenos comienzan a probar el dulce sabor de la
victoria en los mercados de consumo de esa region. Las
exportaciones de vino a Japon, por ejemplo, crecieron un asombroso
446 por ciento entre septiembre de 1997 y septiembre de 1998, para
llegar a US$75 millones.
 &HT;    Parece que los asiaticos amantes del buen libar tienen buenas
razones para considerar alternativas. ``Un vino chileno, de precio
moderado, es mejor que un vino frances del mismo precio,'' afirma
Rodrigo Alvarado, director de Wines of Chile, la asociacion de
mercadeo del sector. ``Aunque los franceses no lo admitan, los
japoneses han descubierto que es cierto.''
 &HT;    Un golpe de suerte? Quiza no. Los principales rubros de
exportacion de Chile (el salmon, las frutas, el vino y el cobre)
han gozado de gran demanda en anos recientes. Y mantener ese
impulso en medio de los problemas de Asia es la meta de los
principales ejecutivos de mercadeo chilenos.
 &HT;    Las campanas de publicidad de anos anteriores recien comienzan a
dar frutos, afirma Rodrigo Infante, director de la Asociacion de
Productores de Salmon y Trucha, entidad que en 1997 concluyo una
campana de concientizacion en Estados Unidos (valorada en US$4
millones), donde el consumo de salmon es de aproximadamente medio
kilo por persona al ano. En comparacion, el consumidor japones
promedio despacha casi 8 kilos. Tras una serie de avisos en la
radio y los supermercados de seis ciudades estadounidenses, las
ventas aumentaron un 10 por ciento en comparacion con los mercados
donde no hubo campana alguna.
 &HT;    Hasta septiembre de 1998, las exportaciones de salmon chileno a
EU aumentaron otro 29 por ciento, mientras que el consumo en Japon
bajo un 22 por ciento, para un desequilibrio del 2 por ciento en el
total de exportaciones durante el periodo.
 &HT;    En comparacion con el mismo periodo del ano pasado, las
exportaciones de frutas a Corea han bajado un 89 por ciento, a
Malasia un 41 por ciento y a Singapur un 68 por ciento. Parece un
desastre, pero Asia solo representa el 6,5 por ciento de las
exportaciones chilenas de frutas, explica Luis Schmidt, presidente
de Fedefruta, la asociacion de cosecheros de frutas de Chile.
Conjuntamente con la entidad exportadora Asexma, Fedefruta dedica
US$6 millones al ano a asegurar que a la hora de comprar fruta,
Chile este en la mente de todos. La mitad de esa cifra se gasta en
EU. ``Siempre hemos tenido campanas masivas, pero es costoso,''
afirma Schmidt. ``En Japon hay que invertir US$2 millones para
conseguir un beneficio minimo, porque hay que comprar publicidad en
la radio.''
 &HT;    Al igual que los productores de vino, los cosecheros chilenos de
frutas gozan de un buen momento en Asia: las importaciones desde EU
ahora cuestan mas. En los paises donde no se restringieron las
exportaciones, la situacion mejoro. En Hong Kong el consumo de
frutas chilenas aumento un 30 por ciento y en Japon un 19 por
ciento. Schmidt pronostica que la inversion en mercadeo se
mantendra para 1999 y espera que una recuperacion regional
signifique que paises como Corea pronto reduzcan sus aranceles a
corto plazo. Chile produjo 161.1 millones de cajas de frutas en la
temporada 1997-98, de las cuales exporto 63.4 millones a Estados
Unidos y solo 10 millones a Asia.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, es posible que la situacion asiatica afecte la
presencia de Chile en la conciencia del consumidor internacional.
Por ejemplo, las reducciones de presupuesto han obligado a
ProChile, la entidad de mercadotecnia del gobierno encargada de
crear y mantener la imagen del pais en el exterior, a realizar su
labor con los US$2,5 millones que recibio en 1996 y 1997. ProChile
habia esperado conseguir un aumento de presupuesto del 15 por
ciento.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, lo que mas afectara sera la reduccion en la
cooperacion del empresariado, afirma Silvana Gattini, directora de
la division de mercadeo de ProChile encargada de Norte y
Centroamerica.
 &HT;    ``Lo que sucede es que cuando hay crisis el sector privado
reduce su presupuesto de mercadeo,'' explica Gattini. ``Como es
natural, eso nos afecta. En vez de realizar las ferias con
companias, terminamos realizandolas con instituciones, y en
instalaciones menores.''
 &HT;    Mientras tanto, el cobre -el principal producto de exportacion
de Chile- quiza ni sienta el impacto de la situacion mundial porque
se usa fundamentalmente en cables y tuberias para edificios y
autos, asi como refrigeradores y equipos electronicos que se
producen en muchas partes del mundo. Chile produce el 30 por ciento
del cobre mundial, y aunque los precios han bajado un 17 por
ciento, el consumo se ha mantenido esencialmente estable.
 &HT;    De hecho, ProCobre, la filial chilena de la Asociacion
Internacional del Cobre, ha decidido fortalecer su campana de
mercadeo en America Latina para 1999, de US$2,8 millones a US$3,5
millones. ``Ahora mas que nunca tenemos que hacer promocion,'' dice
Hernan Sierralta, director ejecutivo de ProCobre. ``Cuando hay una
crisis, entonces es cuando hay que mercadear.''

OLOWOKANDI TO START FOR CLIPPERS SATURDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To finesse the politics of playing time, a coach
will emphasize the benefits of an individual finishing - as opposed
to starting - a game.
</P>
<P>
   But when his team is finished almost before it starts, a coach
may be forced to make alterations.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why Los Angeles Clippers coach Chris Ford will
start rookie center Michael Olowokandi in Saturday's game at
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't get off to a good start,'' Ford said, ``you've
got to consider changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: In the Clippers first three games (all losses),
they have been outscored by an average of 31.3 to 21.3 in the
opening quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is hoping Olowokandi, who came off the pine to produce
career highs in points (17) and rebounds (9) in Wednesday's loss at
Vancouver, can make a difference in his first NBA start. The
ex-Pacific star has yet to experience NBA life with his team in the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the change is the corresponding matchup
bonus; the Suns start 7-foot-2 Luc Longley at center, then send him
to the sidelines in favor of 6-10 forward Danny Manning.
</P>
<P>
   With Olowokandi coming off the bench in the first half of last
Friday's Suns' victory at the Sports Arena, this chronological
matchup with Manning was a difficult one for the 7-foot Clipper.
But Olowokandi did have some success with the slower Longley when
the two hooked up in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the matchup with Longley is better for Michael,''
Ford said, of Olowokandi, who managed three of his five made
field-goal attempts last Friday when Longley was on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   In three games, Olowokandi has averaged 14.3 points and 7
rebounds per game while making 15 of 30 field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Rod-knee recovery: Forward Rodney Rogers, whose right knee
sprain kept him out of the Chicago and Vancover games, practiced
Thursday and is expected to play in Phoenix. Rogers had 11 points
and 11 rebounds in the season-opener with the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Taylor, who has started in Rogers' absence, is expected
to do the same Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Brian Skinner said his injured left knee is responding to
treatment, and the power forward from Baylor should return within a
week to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only been eight days, guys,'' Skinner said before
providing a convoluted analogy. ``God created the world in seven.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's D-minus: In the opening-loss to Phoenix, his
``bigs'' lost the defensive-transition footrace with the Suns'
frontcourt. In the Chicago game, his team was pitiful on the
defensive boards.
</P>
<P>
   So, what did Ford's Clippers not do on defense in Vancouver?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with the way we gave up middle penetration,''
Ford said. ``After breaking down the film, we counted 17 times that
we gave up the middle; they (Grizzlies) scored 14 times.''
</P>
<P>
   A long way from 16: If you're wondering, Ford isn't even close
to matching his predecessor's record for Clipper coaching futility.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Bill Fitch began his L.A. run by coaching 16
consecutive defeats.

DOUBLE TROUBLE THESE DAYS IN NHL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Maybe that Noah guy would have made a good
NHL coach.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey success these days seems to be coming in twos. Six of the
NHL's nine leading scorers are linemates on three separate teams, a
trend that Stars coach Ken Hitchcock says is helping clubs keep
their heads above water in an ever-expanding league.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have two good players who can connect, who have the
chemistry, then you have something,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said. ``It's difficult to get three players together and keep a
line going, but it's not as tough to find pairs. That's what the
league is coming to now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight when the Stars play the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in a
9:30 p.m. game at the Arrowhead Pond, two of the NHL's top pairs
will face off against one another.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks are led by the fastest combined duo on the ice, a sort
of Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote on skates. Teemu Selanne and Paul
Kariya rank fourth and fifth in the NHL in scoring, log as much ice
time as any NHL pair (26 minutes per game) and take more shots (a
combined nine per game) than Starsky and Hutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so good at turning the puck over and making you pay
for it,'' Hitchcock said. ``If you're one step behind them, you're
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's own pair is really a pair of pairs, with pivot Mike
Modano the swing man that makes pairs both work. Modano and left
winger Jere Lehtinen have played together for the past three
seasons and form one of the toughest defensive pairs in the NHL.
Modano and Brett Hull are the offensive pair, creating scoring
opportunities and scaring defensive players who have to choose to
defend one or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to look at it as two different pairs,'' Hitchcock said.
``I see that line as a checking line, so I see Modano and Lehtinen
as the key pair. You see that line as a scoring line, so you see
Hull and Modano.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the combos seem to be working. Hull and Modano have
combined for 22 points in their past 10 games and are getting
better the more they play together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to play well with Mike,'' Hull said. ``I believe
he's one of the three best players in the league right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who joined the Stars as a free agent in July, knows the
importance of good chemistry. His best seasons in the past were
when he was teamed with centers Craig Janney or Adam Oates. In
fact, Hull's three seasons of 70-plus goals came with Oates as his
centerman and spawned a pop culture industry producing ``Hull and
Oates'' posters. ``It makes a big difference for any player when he
can play with a skilled center,'' Hull said. ``It's a team game,
and you have to be able to build that chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, though, the NHL's new pairs don't rely strictly on a
center-winger pairing. Selanne plays right wing and Kariya left.
Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg of the Colorado Avalanche are centers,
but they became a successful duo this season when rookie coach Bob
Hartley moved Forsberg to left wing. Forsberg still plays like a
center, but he and Sakic have a combined 117 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that we thought a long time about and
something we decided we needed to do, and it's worked out,''
Hartley said. ``Both players can handle the transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he wouldn't have combined the two Avalanche
centers, much the same way he resisted the temptation to move Mike
Modano to left wing with Joe Nieuwendyk at center. Hitchcock said
he believes that teams are best-served by having two strong centers
lead two strong lines. But Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman has often
combined centers Steve Yzerman and Sergei Fedorov in a super duo.
It's just that Bowman never leaves any line together for an entire
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different people look at if differently, but I think you have
to allow players to work together,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The most veteran _ and probably the most productive _ of the
combined pairs is Eric Lindros and John LeClair of the Philadelphia
Flyers. Since LeClair's 1995 trade from the Montreal Canadiens for
Mark Recchi, he has played beside Lindros and has averaged 51.8
goals per season. Lindros, meanwhile, is one of the NHL's leading
candidates for MVP this season.
</P>
<P>
   Playing together, they rank second and third in NHL scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the pair I would have to say is the best, out and
out,'' Hitchcock said. ``They can hurt you with their size and
skill, they cycle the puck as well as anyone in the league, and
they really work you over down low. It's like if you don't get the
puck out on your one chance against them, you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros (6-foot-4, 240) and LeClair (6-3, 226) might be the two
best power forwards in the NHL, and combining them makes it doubly
difficult to find a solution. Still, size and talent can only take
you so far.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins have broken up Martin Straka and Jaromir Jagr
because they lost their chemistry. The Phoenix Coyotes haven't been
able to decide whether they can play Keith Tkachuk and Jeremy
Roenick together.
</P>
<P>
   No, this pairing off is a little bit tougher than it looks. You
don't know if you're going to end up with Martin and Lewis or
Dharma and Greg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you have to have is two players with the same
vision, vision of the ice and vision of the game,'' Hitchcock said.
``And I honestly believe you can see if they have that the first
two or three times they skate together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players were meant to skate together, and some weren't.''

   Yahoo Inc. Thursday began offering certain businesses the option
of paying $199 to be considered for inclusion in its popular
Internet search directory ahead of the thousands of other
submissions the company receives each day.
</P>

   The company said the program represented an effort to address
the needs of small businesses that aim to use the Internet for
electronic commerce. Only World Wide Web sites that allow consumers
to purchase items on line are eligible to pay the fee and receive
what Yahoo called ``express consideration.''

   The initiative comes at a time when financial factors
influencing the information Internet businesses provide to users
are under growing scrutiny. Earlier this week, the Internet
bookseller Amazon.com said it would label paid promotions after
reports that it solicits payments for book recommendations drew
complaints from customers.

   But Yahoo officials emphasized that their program guaranteed
only that a site would be considered within seven business days,
not that it would be placed in the directory. Analysts said the
move was simply an indication of the power wielded by a rapidly
consolidating group of Web sites known as portals, which serve as
informational gateways to other sites.

   ``Yahoo has the reach, and they're leveraging it,'' said Drew
Ianni, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, a research firm in New
York. ``They find themselves in a very strong position and they
believe they can command these fees, and they probably will be able
to. It just seems a bit disingenuous because these are the same
kinds of sites that helped to build Yahoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo was the Web's first widely used gateway that compiled a
comprehensive index of other Web sites. It has encouraged free
submissions since it was founded by two Stanford University
students in 1994. But the creation of an ``express'' category also
reflects the vast number of sites lining up to get on Yahoo's list.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other major portals, which use automated computer
programs to scour the World Wide Web for sites that match a given
request, Yahoo lists only sites that have been vetted and
categorized by its own employees. Some sites are reviewed within
hours of submission; others are never reviewed at all.

<P>
   ``If you're conducting business online, then you have special
circumstances that make it imperative for you to get a response,''
said Srinija Srinivasan, Yahoo's editor in chief. ``This is for the
narrow segment of submitters for whom their day-to-day livelihood
is dependent on knowing whether they will have this venue for
potential users to find out about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Srinivasan said that Yahoo would devote additional resources
to handling those who paid the fee, so that the waiting time for
other submissions would not be affected.
