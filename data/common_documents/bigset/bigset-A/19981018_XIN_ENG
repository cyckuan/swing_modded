<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The disputed Kuril Islands was
among the top items discussed here Saturday by Russian and
Japanese foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
"The territorial question was obviously discussed as an
integral part of a peace treaty," Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov told reporters after his talks with his Japanese
counterpart, Masahiko Komura.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the issue "should be settled without damaging
Russia's sovereignty and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
Komura arrived here Friday night on a trip designated to make
preparations for Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's upcoming
state visit to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The visit, scheduled for November 10-13, will be the first
official state visit to Russia by a Japanese Prime Minister in 25
years.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi's predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto made informal visits to
Russia earlier. Hashimoto last visited Moscow in mid-September as
advisor to Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
The two sides on Saturday formulated "general points of a
Moscow declaration" to be signed at the November summit, Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Saturday meeting, the first between the new Russian
and Japanese Foreign Ministers after the change of cabinets in
both countries, was marked by "good will, trust and openness."
</P>
<P>
The two sides decided that the Japanese and Russian deputy
foreign ministers would hold the next session of the peace treaty
sub-commission in Tokyo on October 29-30, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed that the Russian Chief of Staff would visit
Japan in November, and that the Russian and Japanese interior
officials would meet in Moscow in December.
</P>
<P>
Besides bilateral relations, the two sides also discussed a
wide range of international issues, such as Kosovo, Afghanistan
and situation on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Later Saturday, Komura met with Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Maslyukov as co-chairmen of the Russian-Japanese
Commission on Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Komura told reporters that he was "very satisfied" with the
talks, which touched on investments, technological cooperation and
technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
"This was a very good meeting devoted to bilateral economic
cooperation. It was a meeting where we understood each other,"
Tass quoted Komura as saying.
</P>
<P>
Komura is scheduled to leave here for Tokyo later Saturday.

NEW DELHI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-eight million
putrefied eggs (about 175 tons) were buried Saturday in Salem
District of India's southern state of Tamil Nadu, the Press trust
of India (PTI) reported.
</P>

These rotten eggs were buried in huge pits and the whole
operation lasted nearly four hours, PTI quoted a local official as

</P>
<P>
The decision to destroye the eggs, which had been kept in cold
storages, was taken by the district collector following reports

</P>
<P>
Hundreds of students were hospitalized recently in Salem and
nearby districts following consumption of the eggs which were
found contaminated on analysis.
</P>
<P>
A village chosen earlier for the "burial" was given up after

<HEADLINE> U.S.-China Relationship Important to New Century: George Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President George
Bush said here today that the world has entered a new geopolitical
era, in which U.S.-China relationship will play an increasingly
significant role in shaping and defining the power structures for
the first half of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an audience at Nanjing University, Bush said
U.S.-China relationship possesses great importance, and that "we
can see the vast potential China has to bring this relationship
more into balance in the coming years."
</P>
<P>
Bush is here visiting Nanjing University, which had set up the
Nanjing-Hopkins Center for Chinese and American Studies in 1980s
together with Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of U.S.-China summit this summer, acknowledging
that the people of both countries saw their leaders engage in a
fascinating exchange which demonstrated that it not only is
possible to address important issues, but also "disagree about
some of them without throwing bilateral relations into a tail
spin."
</P>
<P>
"That in itself is an important measure of how the relationship
is progressing," said the former U.S. president, who has now been
bestowed honorary chairman of the center's advisory council,
adding that "it also is basis on which to build, to be able to
have frank and candid exchanges about important issues,
identifying areas in which the two sides can cooperate, and
understanding not only where there is a difference of views but
also why."
</P>
<P>
"These are the characteristics of a healthy relationship
between two great powers", and "it is a trend which should be
nurtured," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bush said, more and more people are coming to
appreciate the fundamental impact that the bilateral relationship
will have on peace and security into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing University today held a ceremony of conferring Former
President George Bush with a honorary doctoral degree.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Annual Sedan Chair Race, Weekend's Hot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Zhou Zongxin
</P>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- "It's really an excellent
and exciting race! I feel great as I jogged and finished the
race with my teammates, " said Maggie Renolds.
</P>
<P>
"It does not matter whether we could win. It's for charity
and a lot of fun as well," the 45-year-old member of the Hong
Kong Ladies Hash House Harriers team said at the finish line of
the 24th Matilda Bazaar &AMP; Sedan Chair Race here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jogging twice a week with other club members, she said the
race was not tough at all for her. She was participating for the
fourth time this year in the race supported by the Matilda
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Her team had joined three others in the 2.1-kilometer-long
ladies' race, which was eventually won by a team from the Hong
Kong Ladies Road Runners Club. "They (Road Runners) are real
athletes," claimed a member of a losing team.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 teams competed this year in the charity race,
which race has been held annually since 1975, when a
reconstruction project was completed for the hospital. To
promote the image of the hospital, a sedan chair race was held at
the time, in commemoration of the old-fashioned tool, which was
generally used to transport patients to the hospital when it
began public services in 1907.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Police won the 3.2-kilometer men's Course A title
while Athletic Veterans of Hong Kong (AVOHK) took the Course B
race of 2.1 kilometers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The annual event raised 2.2 million HK dollars (0.28 million
U.S. dollars) last year for local charities. This year's
fund-raising target is ambitious 3 million HK dollars (0.38
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Under the rules, teams of eight transport a sedan chair around
the course containing, in case of the men, a passenger "over 16
years of age, alive and human." The ladies, however, are allowed
to carry a dummy weighing no less than 25 pounds.
</P>
<P>
Many of the participating teams in Course B put considerable
efforts into decorating their sedan chairs and dressing the team
members in outlandish fancy dress costumes, to entertain
themselves and the crowd.
</P>
<P>
At the Bazaar, there were stalls selling a variety of
merchandise including clothing, wine, toys, plants, Christmas
cards, home-made cakes, and other delicious produce. A stall
with fancy face-painting services available came out the most
attractive for kids while the live performance by girl pipers
from a middle school and by traditional lion dance drew large
crowds and photographers.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be here again next year," six-year-old Tom said while
waiting for his term at the face-painting stall. Holding toys
bought at another stall, his mother smiled by his side.

<HEADLINE> France Offers Aid to Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- France will provide Lesotho
with emergency food aid worth 300,000 Francs (about 56,000 U.S.
Dollars), French ambassador to South Africa Tristan D'albis said in
Pretoria Saturday.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted D'albis as reporting that
the food aid would be channeled through the United Nations' World Food
Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
"This French contribution targets the WFP food assistance program
for the primary schools in Maseru from October to December 1998,"
the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho, a tiny mountain kingdom in southern Africa, appealed
to the international community for assistance in rehabilitating
the capital of Maseru and other towns which fell victim to
looting and arson during political riots in September.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho crisis was resulted from allegations from opposition
parties that the May 23 general election was rigged in favor of the
ruling Leostho Congress for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
Following the military intervention by South Africa and Botswana in
the name of the Southern African Development Community in late
September, the situation in the mountain kingdom has become stable.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Attend Mideast Summit in Maryland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
is flying Saturday to the Wye Plantation, Maryland, to push the
negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis which made
little progress after two days.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will go by the helicopter Marine One to the venue,
which is 110 km away from Washington, to meet Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The summit is meant to break a 19-month stalemate in the peace
process by nailing down a new transfer of land to the Palestinians
in the West Bank in return for cast-iron Palestinian guarantees
they will crack down on militants.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said some working groups were meeting for a
third day and that Clinton's participation means a new sense of
urgency.
</P>
<P>
The first two days had essentially been a review of positions,
many of which are still far apart, and they were waiting for U.S.
proposals to breathe life into the talks, which Washington wants
to end by Monday at the latest.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Clinton would have
informal discussions with both Netanyahu and Arafat on Saturday,
but there were no plans at this stage for a three-way meeting.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Clinton pledged to make "intense efforts" over the
weekend. "I'm convinced they're both really trying to bridge the
gaps between them," he said.

The Lijiang is so clean, with plants along the riverbank,
providing the best evidence of Guilin's success in environmental
protection, according to Pete Hodgson, acting president of the
APPCED Executive Committee and a member of New Zealand House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
As the boat approached a famous scenic spot, "Nine Horses
Painting on the Mountain," they could see a cliff a hundred meters
wide decorated with different stones and plants, that seemed a
picture of magic horses.
</P>
<P>
Svetlana Goryacheva, vice-chairperson of the Russian Duma, said
that Guilin deserves applause for its excellent preservation of
this healthy environment in spite of its population density and
booming industry.
</P>
<P>
Edward N. Natapei, speaker of Vanuatu's parliament, praised
China's endeavor and success in environmental protection and cited
them as examples for other countries to follow.
</P>
<P>
President of the National Assembly of Thailand Wan Muhammad Nor
Matha said that the 7th general assembly will be held next year in
Chiangmai, Thailand, and that Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress, has promised that
China will offer its support. He said he hopes that the Chiangmai
Assembly will be a success and help promote environmental
protection legislation of APPCED's members so as to preserve the
living environment of the mankind.
</P>
<P>
The 64-km cruise lasted four and half hours. Qu Geping, the
best-known Chinese environmental protection specialist and
president of this year's assembly, said, "The expression
that 'Guilin's landscape is the best under the heaven' is
absolutely true both historically and in reality. Guilin is an
epitome of improved environmental protection in China and shows
our determination to leave a better world for the next
generation."

GUILIN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The mountains and rivers of the
city of Guilin have an appeal for foreign representatives who are
here for the 6th General Assembly of the Asia-Pacific
Parliamentarians' Conference on Environment and Development
(APPCED).
</P>
<P>
Leaning against the railing of the boat "Panorama" that took
President Bill Clinton on a cruise on Guilin's Lijiang River, Jack
Fritz, speaker of Micronesia's parliament, said today that he
appreciated the crystal-clear water and green mountains.
</P>
<P>
For most representatives, this is their first visit to China,
and they say that it is well worthwhile to discuss environmental
protection and see the mountains and rivers of Guilin.
</P>
<P>
Fritz says that what he experienced this time was totally
different from some news reports he had came across before, and
that Guilin has green trees and grass everywhere, and the Lijiang
is as clear as river in Micronesia, and the people are friendly.
</P>
<P>
This morning, nearly 100 APPCED participants arrived at the
Zhujiang dock and began their cruise on the Lijiang River on what
is called "a painted corridor of mountains and rivers."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Fund Anti-Poverty Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is to
allocate 203 million Rand (36.25 million U.S. Dollars) for
anti-poverty projects this year, Welfare and Population
Development Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi said Saturday,
International Day for Poverty Eradication.
</P>
<P>
The allocation of the funding will go hand in hand with the
initiative to establish a social development fund,
Fraser-Moleketi told reporters after visiting several
anti-poverty projects in Welkom, about 250 km southwest of
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a credit and savings facility for the poorest
section of our society that are not being reached by other
anti-poverty measures," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said it was also imperative that anti-poverty programs
recognized that poor rural communities, with little or no
resources or infrastructure, would be the hardest hit by the HIV
and Aids.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged all South Africans to join hands in the
fight against poverty.
</P>
<P>
South Africa Tuesday launched an 85 million Rand (about 12
million U.S. Dollars) rural anti-poverty project, expecting to
create more than 14,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Public Works Minister Jeff Radebe said that the money would
also be used to improve among others roads, agriculture, school,
and other facilities in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Farmers Urge Better Fertilizer Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia National Farmers
Union (ZNFU) proposed here Saturday to set up a fertilizer
management system.
</P>
<P>
ZNFU President Ajay Vashee made the proposal in a speech read
on his behalf by ZNFU acting Executive Director Songowayo Zyambo
at a farmers' crusade here.
</P>
<P>
The steering committee should be comprised of government,
private fertilizer companies, farmers and other relevant
institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
It should distribute fertilizer when there is shortfall in
fertilizer, to ensure a sustainable development of the sector.
</P>
<P>
For 1994-1995 and 1995-1996 seasons, a lot of fertilizer was
issued on credit but a large portion of this remained uncollected
because of poor repayment by both farmers and traders, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vashee attributed the loss to lack of a system to punish
defaulting farmers and traders, a system he said will strengthen
and make the whole fertilizer exercise meaningful.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Returns to Mideast Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday joined Israeli and Palestinian leaders to try to mediate
differences over countering terrorism as the summit talks enter a
third day.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived at the Wye Plantation, Maryland, by helicopter
from Washington for meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's talks were described as "informal" since it is the
Jewish Sabbath and work is proscribed.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has agreed to relinquish a further 13 percent of the
West Bank, with 3 percent designated as a nature preserve, but has
declared there will be no agreement unless Arafat takes concrete
steps to curb terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The summit is meant to break a 19-month stalemate in the peace
process by nailing down a new transfer of land to the Palestinians
in the West Bank in return for cast-iron Palestinian guarantees
they will crack down on militants.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said some working groups were meeting for a
third day and that Clinton's participation means a new sense of
urgency.
</P>
<P>
The first two days had essentially been a review of positions,
many of which are still far apart, and they were waiting for U.S.
proposals to breathe life into the talks, which Washington wants
to end by Monday at the latest.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Clinton would have
informal discussions with both Netanyahu and Arafat on Saturday,
but there were no plans at this stage for a three-way meeting.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Clinton pledged to make "intense efforts" over the
weekend. "I'm convinced they're both really trying to bridge the
gaps between them," he said.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Give "Regular Payments" on Loan to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan will make "regular
payments" of a 1.5 billion U.S. dollar loan for Russia, a ranking
Japanese official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Masaki Okada, spokesman for visiting Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura, told reporters after Komura's meeting with
Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov that Tokyo
pledged 600 million dollars as the first tranche of the loan
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
About 400 million dollars has already been transferred to
Russia, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Komura, who arrived here Friday night, is on a 24-hour visit
preparing for Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's upcoming
state visit to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with Maslyukov as co-chairman of the
Russian-Japanese Commission for Trade and Economic Cooperation,
Komura also talked with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
Okada said that Ivanov, during his talks with Komura, agreed to
visit Tokyo after Obuchi's Russia visit next month.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi is scheduled to spend November 11 and 12 in Moscow and
November 13 in St. Petersburg, the Interfax news agency quoted
Okada as saying.
</P>
<P>
The program of the visit and the documents being prepared for
the summit, including a so-called "Moscow Declaration", will be
discussed by the two countries' deputy foreign ministers in Tokyo
on October 29-30, Okada said.

<HEADLINE> Sea Piracy Escalating Along Nigeria's Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian territorial water
is witnessing unprecedented cases of sea piracy which are
threatening the fishing industry in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Unless something is done quite fast, the fishing industry in
the country would be paralyzed, an official of fishing industry
here said.
</P>
<P>
N.K. Bhardwai, Managing Director of Ocean Fisheries Limited,
told local newspaper The Guardian that "we all have been gripped
by fear each time our crews venture into the sea" because the
crews have been inundated with stories of piracies.
</P>
<P>
The latest case of piracy experienced by the Dolphine
Fisheries Limited, a joint venture by Nigeria and China, is still
unsettled with the vessel Dolphine IV and its crews being kept as
hostages.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the crew of Dolphine IV sent SOS signals
for help in the evening of October 5 when they saw armed men in
two powerful speed boats approaching them.
</P>
<P>
When another vessel of the company Dolphine IX which was in
the area responded to their distress call and sped towards them,
the vessel was intercepted by the attackers who started shooting.
</P>
<P>
The armed men engaged Dolphine IX in shooting for half an hour
and the vessel had to speed away while Dolphine IV was
overpowered and "escorted" to Ekini town in Bayelsa State along
the Nigerian coast.
</P>
<P>
According to managers who were sent on October 7 from Lagos to
Ekini town for negotiations, the community who has kept the
vessel as hostage demanded a ransom of 20 million Naira (about
230,000 U.S. Dollars) before the vessel could be freed.
</P>
<P>
Sources of fishing industry noted that this is just a tip of
the iceberg, quoting the President of the Nigerian Trawler Owners
Association, Olubunmi Elliot, as saying that the problem
escalated within the past two months.
</P>
<P>
According to him, on August 19, a vessel was attacked by the
pirates who demanded for a sum of 490,000 Naira (about 5,500
Dollars) in cash.
</P>
<P>
On August 31, another vessel was attacked by Forupa villagers
in Bayelsa State who had kept the vessel for two weeks. The
community demanded for a sum of 300,000 Naira (about 3,500
Dollars) for their elders and the same amount for youths and
other things.
</P>
<P>
On the situation of sea piracy, Martins Anetekhai, Professor
of Fisheries, was quoted as saying that "once they signal your
vessel to stop and it does not stop, they open fire on it. And
if you stop and they take over, your vessel is piloted to the
creek."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the situation could lead to the stoppage of
sea fishing in Nigeria and about 50,000 tons of fish for local
consumption annually would drop drastically.
</P>
<P>
The export of sea foods such as shrimps, prawn and crabs which
earn the country more than 20 million Dollars annually would be
severely affected.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Group Urges Lift of Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A visiting U.S. humanitarian
group Saturday condemned the sustained U.N. sanctions against Iraq
and called for an end to them.
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based group, called Voices in the Wildness, said at
a press conference that the sanctions violate human rights and
international norms, and are tantamount to crimes of genocide.
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions on Iraq is a new Hiroshima and should be put to
an end as soon as possible," said the group, whose members have
visited Iraq many times.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on two
Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagazaki, killing tens of
thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
Michael Gabreal, member of the organization, said she visited
hospitals in Baghdad and two southern cities of Basra and Missan,
seeing that they are in severe shortage of medicine and medical
equipment and many child patients are obviously suffering from
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions have also caused a lack of stationery for pupils,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Kelley Guerefiel, another member of the group, criticized the
support of the U.S. mass media for Washington's anti-Iraq foreign
policy, saying because of the media's power in misleading, "it is
very difficult for them (group members) to explain the real
situation in which Iraqi people are living to the American people."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq in 1990 following its
invasion of Kuwait, which include a ban on air travel and limits
on sales of oil, the country's main revenue earner.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Deepen Poverty in Developing Countries: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- HIV-related illness and death
deepen existing poverty and increase indebtedness in the
developing countries, the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) has
warned.
</P>
<P>
Coping with the associated health, social and economic impacts
of the epidemic absorbs already scarce resources of the
developing countries, said the UNDP in a report released here
Saturday at a public rally to mark the International Day for the
Eradication of Poverty which fell on October 17.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency called on the international community to fully
understand the complex relationship between HIV/AIDS and poverty.
</P>
<P>
Currently around 30 million people worldwide are infected with
HIV/AIDS, including over one million children under the age of
15, most of them are living in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
The report entitled UNDP Poverty Report 1998 further pointed
out that more than 90 percent of the 30 million people are in
developing countries -- particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, which
with only 10 percent of world population, accounts for two thirds
of all HIV infections.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP took Namibia as an example, saying in that country,
AIDS has now overtaken TB and malaria as the number one killer
disease and by the year 2001, the direct medical costs are
expected to consume 13 percent of the Namibian government's
health budget.
</P>
<P>
It, however, praised Uganda and Thailand for their dealing
directly with these issues, and with some success, saying that
the infection levels in the African country has dropped by about
one fifth and that there is continuing evidence of a fall in new
infections in Thailand.

<HEADLINE> 26 Iranians Released by Taliban Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of 26 Iranians released
by the Afghan Taliban militia arrived here Saturday evening, the
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
These Iranians, mainly truck drivers, were set free by the
Taliban following the mediation of Lakhdar Brahimi, special envoy
of the U.N. secretary general on Afghan affairs.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi has visited Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan in an effort
to defuse the tension between Iran and the Taliban, triggered by
the killing of nine Iranian diplomats and reporter by the Taliban
forces in August.
</P>
<P>
Iran massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern border with
Afghanistan to put pressure to bear on the Taliban, the student
militia now controlling 90 percent of the country.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Kandahar, the Taliban's headquarters in
southern Afghanistan, Brahimi received a promise from the Taliban
leaders to release all Iranian citizens captured in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban earlier accused the Iranians of sending arms to
the opposition, the Northern Alliance led by the ousted President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Iran denied the charges, claimed that the Iranians were
arrested while send commercial goods to Afghan people in need.
</P>
<P>
So far a total of 51 Iranians have been released in five groups
by the Taliban, following the mediation of Pakistan and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that Brahimi would return to Iran
for further talks with Iranian officials as the Taliban announced
readiness to hold talks with Iran.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian Foreign Ministry official said earlier that Tehran
would not hold talks with the Taliban unless the Afghan militia
release all Iranians captured in Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Army team scored a
crucial victory of 1-0 against Qingdao Hainiu to keep alive their
hope of staying in the top flight of Chinese soccer next season.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Army eleven had collected 26 points from 24 matc
hes before their clash against Qingdao Hainiu. They could have
been dropped to the second division if they failed to win the
match on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the young and high-spirited team never gave up their hopes
and played aggressively from the very beginning of the match.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts paid off finally as Pan Yi connected a pass in
the penalty area and beat the Qingdao goal-keeper with a fierce
shot at the 60th minute.
</P>
<P>
After conceding the goal, the Qingdao team suddenly woke up
and began to launch some attacks. But they could not find the
way to tear up the defence of the Chinese Army team.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen Ping'an, which is also on the verge of relegation
zone, had their morale boosted after beating Sichuan Quanxin 4-2
at home. Shenyang Haishi downed Shandong Luneng 1-0 and Wuhan
Hongjinlong defeated Guangzhou Apollo 4-0.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the five-year-old Chinese professional
league, there are still seven to eight teams on the verge of
relegation with only one round of matches left.
</P>
<P>
Vanguards Huandao, which needed a win on Sunday to secure
their place in the first division, lost to Guangzhou Songri 1-0
and joined Shenyang Haishi, Chinese Army, Shenzhen Ping'an,
Yanbian Aodong and Wuhan Hongjinlong in a desperate fight to keep
their place in the league.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Wanda, which had already won the title, were forced to
a goalless draw by Beijing Guo'an on Sunday. Beijing Guo'an now

<P>
CAIRO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa is to pay a two-day visit to Amman Friday to discuss the
recent developments in the region with senior Jordanian officials,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Jordanian talks are to focus on bilateral ties in
different fields, the latest developments of Mideast peace process
as well as the current conditions in the region.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will give a lecture at the joint meeting of the
Amman-based International Political Society and the Arab
Intellectual Forum.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Crown Prince and Regent Hassan is expected to have
talks with Moussa during his visit. Jordan's King Hussein is
receiving treatment for cancer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh paid a short visit to
Egypt last week handing over a message to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak from Hassan dealing with the developments of the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hosted both Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last
week before they headed to the U.S. for a secluded three-way
summit, meant to break a 19-month stalemate in the peace process
by nailing down an agreement on further transfer of land to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries that have
signed peace treaties with Israel and played important mediating
roles in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
With the participation of U.S. President Bill Clinton, Arafat
and Netanyahu have held talks since Thursday in the Wye Plantation
near Washington, trying to seal a land-for-security deal which
would oblige Israel to hand over more West Bank land to the
Palestinians in exchange for their iron-cast promise to crack down
on militants.

<HEADLINE> Rehabilitation Program to Benefit More Disabled Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- About three million disabled
people across China will benefit from a large-scale rehabilitation
program in the next two years, according to the China Disabled
Persons Federation (CDPF) today.
</P>
<P>
The total number of people who recover from disabilities to one
extent or another will reach six to seven million by then.
</P>
<P>
The three million people will include 1.2 million cataract
patients, 350,000 crippled people, 60,000 deaf-mute children,
60,000 mentally retarded children, and 1.2 million people with
serious mental disorders.
</P>
<P>
The CDPF is making efforts to expand a national network
providing rehabilitation training courses and services. This
network is based on families of the disabled and rehabilitation
centers in residential communities, said Sun Jinzhong, deputy
director of the CDPF's rehabilitation department.
</P>
<P>
All cataract surgeries will be accomplished by "Sight First China
Action," a project launched by the Ministry of Health,
the CDPF and Lions Clubs International last year, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to complete 1.75 million surgeries within five
years. By the year 2001, China's ophthalmologists will be able to
perform 450,000 such surgical procedures annually, and curb the
climbing incidence of cataracts, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CDPF plans to develop and supply 2.4 million special
pieces of equipment and devices for the purpose of rehabilitation and
to aid people with disabilities in their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
Sun also stressed the CDPF's plan to help people with serious
mental disorders to live normal lives as ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to relieve them through medical and psychological
therapies, and help them become accepted gradually by the rest of
society," he said.

BELGRADE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo ethnic Albanian
armed men attacked several Serbian police checkpoints in the
crisis-hit province Saturday, killing three Serb policemen, the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The three policemen were shot dead at the Orlate village near
the Pristina-Malisevo road. Two other policemen were seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
Another armed group, on the same day, sprayed bullets at a
police car in the Magur district, injuring two policemen.
</P>
<P>
A Serbian police checkpoint at Komorane, about 20 kilometers
away from the provincial capital of Pristina, was also under fire
several time on Saturday night. But no casualty was reported.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian police and the Yugoslav army said that they were
pulling out of western Kosovo's battlefields under an agreement
struck by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kosovo ethnic Albanian armed groups, who fought
for the independence of the province, have constantly attacked the
Serbian police since the signing of the agreement.

ANKARA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem has said that Turkish and Syrian high-ranking officials plan
to hold security talks in the coming days in a bid to ease
tensions between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cem told the semi-official Anatolia News Agency late Saturday
night that the Turkish-Syrian talks would take place, but gave no
fixed place and time.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey would explain what to be discussed during the
would-be talks.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that "during the talks (between Turkey and Syria), our
representatives will assess how well Turkey's demands over the
settlement to separatist terrorism are being met."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of backing Turkey's outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), but Damascus has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said recently that Turkey
would take decisive measures if Syria continues to support the
PKK which has been fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey
since 1984.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry
rejected an offer from Syria for wide-range talks with
Turkey, saying what concerns Ankara now is only the issue of
Kurdish rebels.

<HEADLINE> China's Conference on Disabled Draws Global Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Third National
Congress of the China Disabled Persons Federation in Beijing
has drawn extensive attention from the international community.
</P>
<P>
The General Secretary of the United Nations Kofi Annan, the
Executive Secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific (ESCAP) Adrianus Mooy and heads of several
international organizations for disabled people have sent letters
of congratulations to the congress.
</P>
<P>
"This important meeting addresses a key issue that affects more
than 500 million men, women and children around the world," said
Kofi Annan in a note of congratulations. He offered his best wishes
for "a successful meeting that helps the Chinese people to build a
society in which every citizen can participate fully and actively."
</P>
<P>
The UN General Assembly has adopted the World Program of Action
Concerning Disabled Persons and the UN Standard Rules on
Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities, which
represent "political and moral commitments by Member States to
enhance disability prevention, to improve rehabilitation and other
services, and to fight against prejudice," said Annan, adding that
China has joined the drafting of the two documents and has been
actively involved in their implementation.
</P>
<P>
The China Disabled Persons Federation (CDPF), the largest of
its kind in the world, has gained special consultative status with
the UN Economic and Social Council for its outstanding work in
promoting the cause of the disabled in the Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
China has made tremendous efforts in raising public
awareness of the overall situation and the basic human
rights of the 60 million Chinese people with disabilities, said
Kerstin Leitner, UN resident coordinator in China.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of deliberate interventions by the Chinese
government, the CDPF, and the society at large, many disabled
people are actively participating in and benefiting from programs
promoting equal rights for them in the areas of education,
employment, poverty alleviation, rehabilitation and other social
and cultural activities," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply impressed by your outstanding work in helping the
disabled, especially the blind and people with sight defects, to
achieve economic independence, individual development and freedom,
said Euclid Herrie, president of the World Blind Union during a visit
to China in June.
</P>
<P>
According to the CDPF, the president of Inclusion
International, which helps mentally retarded people to join the
society and enjoy a normal life, and the president of
Rehabilitation International, have also sent letters of
congratulations to the congress.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Fully Develop Ties With China: Senate Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Romania and China should make
joint efforts in further developing the traditional friendly
relations between the two countries, Romanian Senate Chairman
Petre Roman said this weekend.
</P>
<P>
When answering written questions from Xinhua, Roman noted that
through his visit to China last month, he has had a deeper
understanding of the real long-term strategic partnership between
Romania and China.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should fully strengthen their cooperation in
all fields, especially in the area of economic and trade, Roman
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are broad prospects for economic and trade
cooperation between Romania and China, adding that the current
cooperation is far from enough. It is possible for the two nations
to boost their annual trade to 1 billion U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Roman also urged the two countries to expand mutually
beneficial cooperation in the areas of industries and
investment. Romanian design institutes and experts can participate
in investment programs in China, while China can invest in
Romania's construction programs in Constansta Harbor.
</P>
<P>
Roman expressed his belief that the forthcoming meeting of the
Romanian-Chinese Economic and Trade Cooperation Committee in
Beijing will speed up the implementation of those programs still
on the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
He said he has instructed Industry and Trade Minister Radu
Berceanu, who will lead a Romanian delegation to the meeting, to
make full preparations for the discussion with China on seeking
ways to improve bilateral economic and trade cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students Stage Rally Against Guardians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A group of Iranian university
students from the left-wing factions staged a rally here Sunday
afternoon against the policy of the conservative Guardians Council.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA said the students announced their
opposition to the policy of the Guardians Council to screen
qualifications of candidates for elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Heshmatollah Tabarzadi, secretary general of the Islamic Union
of the Students and Graduates, criticized the council at the
rally for rejecting a number of nominees for the Experts Assembly
election on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report did not give the number of students attending the
rally, but said that the protest rally was authorized by the
Interior Ministry and was guarded by anti-riot police.
</P>
<P>
During the rally, about 100 students from opposition groups
chanted slogans against the organizers of the rally, IRNA said,
but no clash was reported.
</P>
<P>
The rally was organized after at least three famous candidates
of the left and moderate factions withdrew from the election
campaigns for the Experts Assembly in a protest to the Guardians
Council's screening policy.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-dominated council was accused by the factions
supporting President Mohammad Khatami of taking side while
reviewing the qualifications of applicants for the Experts
Assembly, which determines the country's supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
The council has approved 168 candidates out of 396 to run
for the 86-seat Experts Assembly, which is also empowered to
dismiss the leader according to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservative factions rejected the charges against
the Guardians Council, but accused the leftists and moderates of
trying to undermine the election.
</P>
<P>
The Experts Assembly was formed in 1983 under the order of late
Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini to elect his
successor. It serves in each term of eight years.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Syria to Hold Talks to Ease Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said here Sunday that Turkish and Syrian high-ranking
officials plan to hold security talks in the coming days in a bid
to ease tensions between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted Cem as saying
that Turkey would explain what to be discussed during the
would-be talks.
</P>
<P>
He said earlier that the Turkish-Syrian talks would take place,
but gave no fixed place and time.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that "during the talks (between Turkey and Syria), our
representatives will assess how well Turkey's demands over the
settlement to separatist terrorism are being met."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of backing Turkey's outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), but Damascus has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said recently that Turkey
would take decisive measures if Syria continues to support the
PKK which has been fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey
since 1984.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry
rejected an offer from Syria for wide-range talks with
Turkey, saying what concerns Ankara now is only the issue of
Kurdish rebels.

<P>
SHANGHAI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The XNBA team, coached by
legend Oscar Robertson, trounced Chinese men's national
basketball team 86-73 here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The NBA veterans, including six-time NBA champion winner
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, raced to a 14-7 lead five minutes into
action and increased the lead to 33-17 eight minutes before the
interval.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese national team, which won the first match of the
four-game series 98-96 on Friday, fought back strongly with three
three-pointers from Zhang Jinsong and Li Nan, narrowing the
margin to 38-34 with 40 seconds remaining in the first half.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese never came closer than that and was
overwhelmed after the break, having no way to score before the
solid defence of the former NBA greats.
</P>
<P>
"The players felt embarrassed after the defeat in the first
match," said Robertson. "We have expected the results."
</P>
<P>
Wang Fei, head coach of the Chinese side, said the defeat was
even more beneficial than the victory in the first match.
</P>
<P>
"They are the former NBA players, they are more experienced,
so we learned a lot from them," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will travel to Hefei, An'hui province, to play
their third match on Tuesday.

Ramadan asked Batalli to convey an oral message to Turkish
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on bilateral relations and the
importance of developing the ties in the interests of the two

Batalli said that his visit shows Turkey's keenness on finding
new means of developing economic and trade cooperation between the
two countries.

<HEADLINE> Atmosphere for Cross-Straits Relations Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
met Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF), this afternoon, bringing the SEF delegation's visit to the
mainland to a climax.
</P>
<P>
Jiang affirmed Koo's efforts in developing relations across the
Taiwan Straits and expressed his appreciation for the four-point
consensus reached between Wang Daohan, president of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), and
Koo Chen-fu.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and overseas media all speak highly of Koo's mainland
tour, and have called the past few days "a week of improving
atmosphere in cross-straits relations."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the four-point consensus, the Taiwan delegation
saw the achievement made on the mainland by the reform and
opening-up drive of the past two decades. Koo had a free exchange
of views with his mainland counterpart during the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the CPC
Central Committee, noted that the specific fruits of the ARATS-SEF
talks will be significant for their contacts and dialogue, and the
improvement of relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The mainland side has always adopted a positive attitude toward
improving cross-strait relations, and made appropriate
arrangements for Koo's visit.
</P>
<P>
As cross-straits relations is approaching an important historical
moment, the media say that stable and healthy cross-straits
relations for the 21st century will be determined by whether both
sides can hold political negotiations under the one-China
principle as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC
Central Committee, said in a meeting with Koo that any matter can
be discussed under the one-China principle, including issues of
concern to the Taiwan side.
</P>
<P>
The mainland side has shown its sincerity, say observers,
noting that a new prospect in the development of cross-strait
relations can be expected only if the Taiwan authorities take some
practical steps in realizing peaceful reunification.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Welcomes Egypt's Mediation Between Syria, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Sunday welcomed
Egypt's effort to defuse the tension between Syria and Turkey,
saying it hopes the effort will help normalize the Damascus-Ankara
relations.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed during the cabinet's weekly session chaired
by Prime Minister Crown Prince Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem
Al-Sabah, the Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the ministers were briefed by First Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber
Al-Sabah on the letter he received from Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa on the mediation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
according to Kuna.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is employing efforts to defuse the tension through
contacts with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Syrian
President Hafez Al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Tensions were mounting recently between Damascus and Ankara
after they traded accusations against each other, and Turkey
reportedly massed up troops along its border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors have long been at odds over issues including
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), river water
sharing and the Turkish-Israeli military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of harboring the PKK, which has
been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria has lashed out at Turkey, a predominantly Muslim
country, for forming a military alliance with Israel, which it
says is targeted against the Arab world, especially itself, and
undermines its bargaining position in negotiations with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Syria has disputes with Israel over the future of the Golan
Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Damascus
insisted on its return as a condition for peace with the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> Few Child Labor Used in Carpet Industry in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturers attending the
first carpet fair of Nepal here said Sunday that they are now
using good chemical dyes and very few child labor.
</P>
<P>
The use of harmful dyes and that of child labor are partly
blamed for the declining export of completely hand-woven carpets,
Nepal's number one export product, in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-eight percent of chemical dyes and two percent of
vegetable dyes are now used in the carpet industry," said Madhu
Sudan Shrestha from the Brighter Carpet Industries (P) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
He said that the azo-dyes which are harmful to health are now
no longer used, and in his factory, child labor is not used at
all.
</P>
<P>
Rajendra B. Shrestha from the Secretariat of the Nepal Carpet
Mart 1998 which opened here Friday also said that very few child
labor is now used in the industry and only good chemical dyes are
used.
</P>
<P>
He said that to combat the problems of adverse publicity
regarding carpet children, the National Society for Protection of
Environment and Children was established in 1994 and till August
this year, it has rehabilitated 751 carpet children.
</P>
<P>
He said that children aged under 14 are sent back to their
homes for family reunion while the orphaned ones are rehabilitated
at various centers.
</P>
<P>
The society has its own child rehabilitation center where
non-formal education, counseling services and health checkups are
provided.
</P>
<P>
Carpet industry is the biggest sector in the land-locked
country in terms of employment, turnover and foreign exchange
earnings.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 300,000 people are directly and
indirectly employed by the industry.
</P>
<P>
In 1993/94 fiscal year, carpet export amounted to 3.3 million
square meters. But since then, it has declined slowly to 2.8
million square meters.
</P>
<P>
In 1992/93 fiscal year, carpet export earned 164 million U.S.
dollars for Nepal, but by 1997/98, the figure had come down to 125
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In this context, Nepal Carpet Mart 1998 was organized to help
diversify the country's carpet export to new markets and
strengthen its export to traditional markets, which drew 80
percent of the country's exporting strength and some 70
international buyers.
</P>
<P>
The exporters are now targeting the United States, Japan,
Canada, Australia and other European countries except Germany,
where more than 80 percent of the total export goes.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers described the fair as good and successful, saying
that they had good business contacts and interactions at the
three-day event.

<HEADLINE> Rosskopf Wins Table Tennis World Cup By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, China, October 18 (Xinhua) -- World No. 14 Jorg
Rosskopf outlived a five-set marathon to snatch his first men's
World Cup table tennis title here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Rosskopf, who brought down China's world No. 2
Kong Linghui and Croatia's defending World Cup champion and world
No. 3 Zoran Primorac in the knockout stages, outlasted South
Korean Kim Taek Soo 21-17, 21-17, 10-21, 21-23, 21-11.
</P>
<P>
Rosskopf booked Sunday's flight to Germany after Wednesday's d
raw, which pitted him against former world No. 1 Jean-Michel
Saive of Belgium, China's Olympic champion Liu Guoliang and
Canada's Johnny Huang in the "Group of Death".
</P>
<P>
He rescheduled his flight after the quarter-final win over
1995 world champion Kong, which he said boosted his ailing morale.
</P>
<P>
After taking the first two sets, Rosskopf appeared slack and
conceded the third set to Kim, hailed as the best penhold topspin
player in the world.
</P>
<P>
There were less swings in the fourth set which went virtually
point for point until Rosskopf missed a backhand hit to face the
deciding set.
</P>
<P>
Rosskopf had a 5-0 run and pulled further away to wrap up the
victory.
</P>
<P>
Rosskopf pocketed the champion's cash award of 38,000
U.S,dollars while Kim got 20,000.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to go so far," said Rosskopf. "I'm not the
best player in the world although I took this title."
</P>
<P>
Kim, who upset Sweden's reigning world champion Jan-Ove
Waldner in the quarter-finals and routed Liu in the semi-finals,
said he was happy with second place.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't expect more," he said. "I played badly in my group
matches and it was mere luck that sent me into the last eight."
</P>
<P>
Chinese have now regarded Kim as the biggest barrier in their
way to the men's singles title in the Asian Games in December.
</P>
<P>
"I was better than Kim before, but now he holds an upper
hand,"said Liu Guoliang, who has recorded nine wins in his 13
career encounters with the South Korean but lost to him twice in
just over one month.
</P>
<P>
Kim said he would have a shot at the men's singles top honor
in the Bangkok Asian Games. "The gold medal is my goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Primorac crushed Liu 21-19, 21-19, 18-21, 21-7 to win
third place and 15,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rosskopf was the first German to win the World Cup title. In
its previous 18 versions, China has won 10 times, Sweden three,
Croatia twice, Hungary, Poland and France once.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Both sides of the Sino-
Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) agreed Monday to continue
their consultations on issues concerning the smooth return of
Macao to China.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after winding up its 33rd plenary
session here, the JLG said a special working group will be
established in charge of the handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
During the session held October 13-14, the two sides reviewed
the development of the localization of civil service, the
localization and translation of laws and the use of Chinese as the
official language. They agreed to make further efforts in this
regard, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed such topics as after-retirement social
welfare and the transfer of the Macao government's assets, which
are of importance to the smooth handover and future development of
Macao.
</P>
<P>
After further discussions, they agreed to enhance consultations
on the transfer of archives, the nationality issue, franchises
which will expire after 1999, and the structure and transition of
Macao's legal system.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also expressed satisfaction with the consensus
reached between them on more than 80 international conventions
that will remain applicable to Macao after 1999.
</P>
<P>
Consensus was also reached that the trade and cooperation
accord between Macao and the European Communities will remain
effective after December 19, 1999, and on the air service accord
reached between Macao and Laos.
</P>
<P>
Both sides of the JLG described the two-day meeting as being
"friendly and cooperative."
</P>
<P>
The next plenary session is scheduled to start on January 19,
1999 in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Blair Seeks Solution to N. Irish Arms Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair would hold urgent talks on Monday with Northern Ireland's
political leaders in an attempt to break the arms decommissioning
deadlock, a government spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Blair will meet David Trimble, first minister of the Northern
Ireland Assembly, and Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness separately in
London to discuss measures that will push the peace agreement to
its next stage before the deadline, October 31.
</P>
<P>
Under the Good Friday Agreement weapons are due to be handed in
within two years, but no start date has been specified.
</P>
<P>
However, David Trimble, who is also leader of the Ulster
Unionist party, has refused to implement the agreement further
until the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and other terror groups make
a firm commitment to begin handing over their arsenals.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein cannot be
part of a power-sharing executive until the IRA begins getting rid
of its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has said it is not within its power to force the IRA
to give up its weapons at this stage.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman said the government believes the Nobel Peace
Prize, which was awarded jointly to Trimble and John Hume, leader
of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP),
may act as a spur to make more progress on the problem.
</P>
<P>
"The Prime Minister will be pressing the issue and seeking to
crack it," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Blair is also due to have discussions with Deputy First
Minister Seamus Mallon of the SDLP later next week.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Emir Jaber
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah received Sunday from Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel a message dealing with the current Turkish-Syrian crisis.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Emiri Palace said that the message was about
the latest development between Syria and Turkey and matters on
enhancing bilateral relations between the two neighboring
countries, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The message of Turkish president came almost two weeks after
Kuwaiti Emir made phone calls to Turkish and Syrian presidents on
the dispute between Ankara and Damascus, urging them to seek
solutions through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
During the call, Emir Jaber asserted to President Demirel that
"dialogue was the best way to resolve tension between the two
Muslim countries, and spare the region a new crisis," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis between Turkey and Syria has been eased after
mediation efforts by Arab leaders, especially Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak who made shuttle visits earlier this month to the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Tensions mounted recently between Damascus and Ankara after
they traded accusations against each other, and Turkey reportedly
massed troops along its border with Syria.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Pak-Indian Talks End Without Concrete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad and his Indian counterpart K. Ragunath Saturday
ended their three-day peace talks without any concrete progress
but agreed to keep on the dialogue process to find a peaceful
settlement to all the outstanding issues between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement, whose formulation took hours to hammer out
and delayed the departure of the Indian delegation for New Delhi,
merely said the two foreign secretaries would continue their
discussions on issues of peace and security and the Jammu and
Kashmir dispute respectively in the first week of February 1999 in
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the joint news conference held at the end of the
talks, both Shamshad and Ragunath made it clear that there were no
quick-fix solutions to the long-standing issues including Kashmir
between the two antagonistic neighbors, and the two sides had not
gone into their dialogue with any false or inflated hopes.
</P>
<P>
However, neither side termed the talks, the first of its kind
in more than one year between the two sides, a failure.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be realistic in evaluating the outcome for its
absence. We knew we were just beginning a process and if both
sides show flexibility and comprehension of the present day
situation we could perhaps achieve some progress," Shamshad said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that these talks "perhaps represented the first
substantial effort in a long time" between the two countries to
address all the bilateral outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
"What is encouraging is that both sides agreed that our
discussions should be guided by a sense of realism and
pragmatism," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indian Foreign Secretary Ragunath endorsed Shamshad's remarks,
saying that "there is no question of the talks having failed, for
the process (of the dialogue) has just started."
</P>
<P>
"There is something that needs to be discussed. The basic
requirement is that we proceed in a realistic and pragmatic
fashion," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, there continued to be fundamental differences in the
way the two sides were approaching the Kashmir issue, which has
bedeviled the bilateral relations between the two countries in the
past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
There are no signs of any change to both sides' known positions
on the Kashmir issue. Pakistan insists that the core issue of
Kashmir should be resolved before any other agreements can be
reached while India favors first taking up commercial and trade
issues, saying the status of Kashmir is not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
"All over the world the trend in such bilateral disputes is for
easier issues to be tackled first rather than the difficult ones,"
Ragunath said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that New Delhi rejects any outside interference
into the bilateral negotiations with Islamabad, saying that "there
is no room for any third party mediation."
</P>
<P>
Apparently the Pakistani foreign secretary did not agree to
such arguments.
</P>
<P>
"The question of third party mediation is not a matter of
principle, it is a matter of necessity whenever it arises," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateralism, he said, is not a principle, "it is a concept
which is developed selectively to suit certain situations."
</P>
<P>
"What happens in South Asia has direct repercussions for other
parts of the world who are naturally interested in this part of
the world," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This is a reality which nobody can deny - let us not convert
this reality into dogmatic or narrow concept of principles," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he assured, will address all issues with equal
sincerity and constructive attitude.
</P>
<P>
But, he underlined, given the climate of "mistrust and lack of
confidence" it would be somewhat unrealistic to expect that
substantive progress leading to complete normalization of
relations in all areas can be achieved if the core issue of
Kashmir remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the two countries can begin their journey "by
taking suitable steps in the form of confidence building measures
which will signify our commitment to the reduction of tensions,
non-use of force and peaceful settlement of disputes."
</P>
<P>
The two senior diplomats spent considerable time enunciating
the kind of proposals discussed on the peace and security issues,
especially the confidence building measures in the nuclear and
ballistic fields. Most of these ideas would be worked upon by the
two sides in the talks to be held in New Delhi from November 5 to
13, during which they will take up the remaining bilateral issues
listed on an eight-point agenda agreed upon by them here last
June.
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded talks followed an understanding reached
between Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian
counterpart Atal Behari Vajpayee in their recent meeting in New
York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly session. Both
leaders underscored the necessity for an environment for durable
peace and peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.

GUANGZHOU, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A reservoir with a storage
capacity of 330 million cubic meters on the Moyangjiang River in
South China's Guangdong Province began retaining water today, and
is expected to begin generating electricity by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Located in the city of Yangjiang, the Dahe reservoir is
expected to help prevent the lower reaches of the river from
major flooding.
</P>
<P>
Since 1950, large floods have occurred every four to five years on
the Moyangjiang River, causing nearly 100 million yuan in economic
losses each time.
</P>
<P>
Costing more than 600 million yuan, the multi-functional
reservoir controls a drainage area of 438 square kilometers and
has an installed capacity of 30,000 kw.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
congratulated Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev on his
re-election, the presidential press service reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The congratulatory message was handed to Aliyev by Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who arrived in Baku on Sunday to
attend the inauguration ceremony, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed confidence that Russia and Azerbaijan will
jointly provide a fresh impetus for comprehensive bilateral
cooperation in the interests of peace and stability in the region
and in the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said that Aliyev and Ivanov had agreed not to discuss
any serious issues.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, Ivanov met with Azerbaijani Foreign Minister
Tofig Zulfugarov and discussed bilateral relations and the future
of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which groups 12
of the 15 republics of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has given itself the task of turning the CIS, on the
basis of joint efforts of the member states, into an organization

<HEADLINE> E. African Leaders Call for End to Congo (K) War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania called Sunday for the orderly withdrawal of all
foreign troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to speed
up a resolution to the civil war there.
</P>
<P>
The east African leaders, Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda and Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, held a one-day
summit in the Kenyan capital here over the Congo war which, they
said, is "threatening to engulf the whole region" of the east and
central Africa.
</P>
<P>
They suggested immediate negotiations involving all parties
over a truce pact and a troop standstill, as well as the
emplacement of a neutral international peace-keeping force under
the auspices of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they reaffirmed the unity and territorial integrity
of Congo (K), expressing "grave concern" about the impact of the
Congo war on the security of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial-level meeting is expected to be held soon by the
three countries as a follow-up to the summit.
</P>
<P>
The Congo war precipitated "an influx of refugees into
neighboring countries, the displacement of populations, threats
of genocide and decline in trade and investments," they said in a
joint communique issued at the end of the close-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
Congolese rebels scored what appeared to be a major victory
this week in their efforts to topple President Laurent Kabila
when they captured the eastern town of Kindu and its strategic
air base, which government forces had been using to launch
attacks on rebel strongholds in the east.
</P>
<P>
Several countries have been reportedly drawn into the fighting
in Congo (K) since it broke out on August 2. Zimbabwe, Angola,
Namibia and Chad have all acknowledged sending troops to fight on
the side of Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda, although they do not openly admit support
for the rebels, are allegedly providing military and logistical
backing "to defend their legitimate security interests".
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian president and his Zambian counterpart Frederick
Chiluba were appointed last month by the South African
Development Community (SADC) to meet with all parties to the
Congo conflict in an effort to broker peace in Africa's third
largest country.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Protect Environment, Cultural Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- China vowed today that it will
strengthen cooperation with other countries, shoulder the
responsibility of protecting the region's environment and cultural
heritage, and make its due contribution to turning the
Asia-Pacific region into a more beautiful, cleaner and more
vigorous region.
</P>
<P>
Qu Geping, head of the Chinese delegation to the 6th General
Assembly of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians Conference on
Environment and Development (APPCED) held here in Guilin, made these
remarks today in announcing a state report concerning tourism and
environmental protection in China.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from other countries also presented their state
reports during the congress this morning.
</P>
<P>
Qu noted that the Chinese government is actively attending to
the coordinated development of tourism and environmental
protection, and has taken measures to protect the tourism
environment and resources, which in turn has brought sound
development to the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Qu said that in the next century, trans-regional and
trans-border tourism will boom and environmental protection will
witness further development. In this regard, Qu noted, it is high
time and necessary that cooperative relations in tourism
and environmental protection be established in the Asian-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
With varied natural landscapes and historic and cultural
traditions, China's tourism resources are among the most abundant
in the world, Qu said, pointing out that tourism environment
will determine the survival and development of tourism.
</P>
<P>
That's why China has paid great attention to protecting the
tourism environment and has worked to balance economic returns
with social and environmental effects, Qu stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said China is taking the following major steps: formulating
a series of laws and regulations on environmental protection and
protection of the tourism environment and resources according to
law; carrying on with cross-century green project plans to improve
the environment; designating tourism resources as under state
protection and taking specific measures to ensure that protection;
selecting pilot cities and citing them as Model
Environmentally Friendly Cities and National Hygienic Cities with
a view to improving the environment of tourism cities.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Urged to Speed Up Water, Soil Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province has been urged
to improve its ecological environment and guarantee flood-control
safety on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and
the long-term safety of the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
A law-enforcement inspection team, led by Buhe, vice-chairman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
made the request to the government of Sichuan here today when the
team completed its inspection of water and soil conservation in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Team members recognized the efforts Sichuan has made towards
water and soil conservation, and also pointed out that the
cultivation of hillside land was the main cause of soil erosion on
the upper reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Sichuan Province, watered by the upper
reaches of Yangtze, is one of the most important agricultural
provinces in China.
</P>
<P>
Jing Zhengshu, deputy governor of Sichuan, pledged that the
province will find solutions to the problems raised by the
inspection team.
</P>
<P>
Jing said Sichuan will increase investment in controlling soil
erosion over a wider area, and suggested that a compensation fund
be set up for eco-construction on the upper reaches of the Yangtze
to accelerate water and soil conservation in the region with
support from the entire country.

<HEADLINE> Howard Promotes Young Talent Into New Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard
moved to restructure his government for the new millennium Sunday
by reshaping key economic portfolios, dumping three ministers and
promoting some of his party's brightest young talent to the front
bench.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle also resulted in a major promotion for South
Australian Senator Nick Minchin who moves from the junior ministry
into Cabinet as minister for Industry, Science and Resources.
</P>
<P>
Former ministers for the Status of Women Judi Moylan, Regional
Development Alex Somlyay and Tourism Andrew Thomson have been
dropped from the front bench.
</P>
<P>
Another three vacancies were created by the retirement from
politics of Defense Minister Ian McLachlan, the decision by
Resources Minister Warwick Parer to stand down from the ministry
and the election defeat of Family Services Minister Warwick Smith.
</P>
<P>
Filling the vacancies are young Sydney MPs Joe Hockey, Tony
Abbott and Jackie Kelly; former Liberal shadow ministers Senator
Ian MaCdonald from Queensland and Wilson Tuckey from Western
Australia; and Peter McGauran, the National Party minister forced
to quit the front bench last year over the travel rorts affair.
</P>
<P>
Most senior ministers keep their jobs. Deputy Prime Minister
Tim Fischer retains Trade, Peter Costello remains Treasurer,
Alexander Downer remains his job in the Foreign Affairs Ministry
and John Fahey successfully resisted attempts to move him from the
Finance portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The biggest shake-up came in Primary Industries, which has been
broken up with the loss of Resources and Energy to the Industry
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
National Party Deputy Leader John Anderson also ends a troubled
period in the job by shifting to Transport and Regional Services,
the new super ministry for the bush.
</P>
<P>
But the Nationals retain the remnants of the old portfolio with
Mark Vaile taking over the new Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries
and Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Peter Reith has added Employment to his responsibilities for
Workplace Relations and Small Business at the expense of David
Kemp, who keeps Education and a spot in Cabinet, but pays the
price for the troubled privatization of the Commonwealth
Employment Service.
</P>
<P>
As expected, John Moore moves into Defense, handing his
Industry portfolio over to Nick Minchin, one of two new faces in
Cabinet, and with the added responsibilities of Science and
Resources.

<P>
BANGKOK, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Representatives attending a
regional meeting here conceded Sunday that economic recession was
impeding the political and economic reforms in ASEAN member
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats Conference
highlighted the note that the financial crisis and economic
downturn have affected the process that ushers member countries of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) towards
transparency in each individual society and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said that because of
the prolonged economic crisis, the aspiration to achieve "ASEAN
Vision 2000" which features open societies and the rule of law
might not be realized as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
For countries such as Thailand and Indonesia, the crisis posed
positive results in speeding up political reforms, resulting in
the adoption of a democratic constitution, but in certain
countries the crisis has slowed down the process, he said without
elaboration.

<HEADLINE> India's Caste System Change Hindus' Genetic Makeup: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A latest study shows that the
3,000-year-old caste system in India has left its indelible mark
on even the genetic make-up of Hindus, the Indian Express daily
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lower castes have become genetically different from upper
classes and this difference is wider when the caste disparity is
larger, said the study, jointly conducted by Indian and American
researchers.
</P>
<P>
However, experts said one has to be very careful in drawing
conclusions. The study does not in any way conclude or even
remotely suggest that some castes are "superior" or more
"intelligent" than others because of this inherent genetic
variation that has been created due to social norms.
</P>
<P>
They said that researchers have for long tried to use genes and
blood groups to track differences among Hindu castes but this
study, using unique genetic markers, is one of the first to show
the deep and long-term impact of societal rules on the human
genome.
</P>
<P>
The research team, comprising researchers from Andhra
University in Vishakapatnam, 1,880 kilometers southeast of here,
and the University of Utah in the United States, collected blood
samples from 250 unrelated men from 12 Telugu-speaking people
spanning all castes in northeastern Andhra Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the blood with the latest molecular tests at Andhra
University, they found that in the genetic make-up of Hindus,
there is "great divergence" between the upper and lower castes
than between upper and middle or middle and lower castes.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the "genetic distance" between upper and lower castes
is one and a half times greater than between upper and middle or
middle and lower castes, shows the result of the study, which was
published in the current issue of the British journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
Using unique genetic markers, the study shows that men tend to
"stagnate" within the same castes while women have more "mobility"
between the castes which is probably true reflection of what
happens in the Indian society even today.
</P>
<P>
The research found that men of higher castes do regularly marry
lower caste women but the reverse is still rather rare, reflecting
a common norm of women often marrying into castes higher than
theirs and ascending the social ladder into which they were born.
</P>
<P>
Men of closely ranked castes had higher similarities in the
maternal components but in contrast there were few similarities
between the maternal components of men in the higher caste, the
researchers said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to market
expectations of a rally, equities continued their downward march
on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) during the week due to
sustained sales by foreign funds and operators' disinterest in
making fresh transactions.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index dropped to 2,832.03 points in the first
two sessions but almost recovered its losses when it closed at
2,890.72 at midweek. However, it fell back to close the week at
2,848.11 as against last weekend close of 2,916.66, netting a loss
of 68.55 points.
</P>
<P>
The national index also dipped by 31.52 points to end the week
at 1,269.53 from last weekend close of 1,301.05.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 and the U.S. dollar index were sharply down at the
weekend to 295.66 and 116.40 points compared with last weekend
close of 304.24 and 119.58 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market was badly in need of some
market-friendly measures like an economic package or at least
early announcement on buy-back shares.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Opening of Unions' Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, the mouthpiece
of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), Monday issues an
editorial to hail the opening of the Thirteenth National Congress
of All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
The editorial terms the congress an important event for the
political life of workers of all nationalities in the country as
it is held shortly after the closing of the Third Plenary Session
of the Fifteenth CPC Central Committee and the two-decade old
reform has entered into a crucial stage.
</P>
<P>
It stresses the working class have made eternal contributions
to the reform, opening and modernization drive with their lofty
sense of responsibility as the master of the country and the
spirit of working hard to start an undertaking.
</P>
<P>
The history of nearly one century indicates that the Chinese
working class is indeed the representative of the advanced
productivity, the leading class of the country and the back-bone
force to push forward the social progress, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The paper speaks highly of what trade unions of all levels have
achieved since the 12th national congress of trade unions, calling
the unions a bridge between the party and the massive workers, an
important social pillar of the State regime, and the
representative of the interests of trade union members and all
kinds of employees in the country.
</P>
<P>
The editorial urges the working class to unite and work hard to
carry out the current state enterprise reform, fulfil all tasks
proposed by CPC and the government, and to compete with each other
to make greater contribution to the development of national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The trade unions must accept the leadership of the Party
conscientiously and work independently in line with the law and
the constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the
paper says, noting that the unions have to keep in mind the
general situation of the Party and national work as well as the
interests of the Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Advanced Team Arrives in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- An advance team from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) arrived
in Kosovo on Sunday to prepare for the coming of 2,000 monitors.
</P>
<P>
The 20-member group was transported in five vehicles to
Pristina, capital of Kosovo province, from Belgrade where they
stayed overnight.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to do the preparatory work for the OSCE
verification mission, and we are set to start our efforts
immediately," John Sandrock, head of the advanced team, told
reporters upon their arrival.
</P>
<P>
He said the OSCE mission will bring in the monitors "as quickly
as possible," but he couldn't give the deadline of the deployment.
</P>
<P>
The monitors will be responsible for checking whether both
sides in the conflict comply with an agreement struck five days
ago between Yugoslav President Milosevic and the U.S. envoy,
Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia is given 10 more days to comply with U.N. demands
and pull out troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The unarmed observers will be supplied by the 54 member states
of the OSCE, but the main force is expected to take some weeks to
assemble, another OSCE official said in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
American diplomat William Graham Walker was appointed on
Saturday as head of the new OSCE mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, NATO U-2 surveillance aircraft began flights
over Kosovo on Saturday to check if Yugoslavia is complying with
UN demands to withdraw its forces.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia formally agreed to the NATO flights Thursday as part
of the peace accord signed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Serb Media Center in Pristina
claimed on Sunday that Kosovo Liberation Army "extremists" had
staged numerous attacks on Serb forces and police stations since
Friday, killing four Serb policemen and wounding several
others. It was the most serious incident this month.

<HEADLINE> Museveni's Brother Threatens Exile If Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni's brother Salim Saleh, a major general in the army and a
senior presidential advisor, has threatened to go in exile if
critics questioning his wealth do not get off his back.
</P>
<P>
The angry general made the remarks when on the popular Capital
Gang radio talk Saturday, Sunday Vision reported.
</P>
<P>
Saleh's outburst followed a question as to whether he would
recommend a replacement in the army and instead step out and join
other businessmen.
</P>
<P>
He would go to exile and ask for American citizenship unless
the questioning critics of him get off his back, he warned.
</P>
<P>
He said he had decided to sell all his business and create a
Rural Development Fund, adding that people are misconcepting his
business, his attitude and his interest. He said he was fed up of
this unfair and unprincipled criticism.
</P>
<P>
It is hurting that when the rot in the army is addressed,
everyone is talking about him, Saleh added.
</P>
<P>
"I am interested in making money and in most cases not for
myself. Many Karims, many Sudhirs have made money but no one is
pointing at them," the former defense ministry overseer was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He denied using political influence and his blood relationship
to the president to buy companies from the Privatization Unit.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he has some business interests in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), Saleh admitted that he once had business
deals with DRC President Laurent Kabila but it was all lost now.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda-owned New Times weekly, in its latest edition,
accused Saleh of using a clique of Ugandan army officers to grab
gold from the DRC, fostering more rumors about his wealth.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Turns Dumping Ground for Second Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has become a major
dumping ground of second hand wears in the west African
sub-region and local textile firms are advocating 200 percent
tariff on second hand clothes.
</P>
<P>
An investigation conducted by the Sunday Times revealed that
Gatan-Kowa Market which is situated off the Lagos-Abeokuta
express is the hub of these second hand wears in the country.
</P>
<P>
Traders come from across the country to buy these wears
including children's clothes, men and women's wears of different
kinds, undies and foot wears in large quantities for resale in
various markets all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Gatan-Kowa market is a beehive of activities on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays with sea of heads milling all over the
place making brisk business, according to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Before the economic down-turn in the country, only the low
income earners patronized the second hand wears and at present
the second hand clothes are used by nearly every body, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The investigation further revealed that the second hand wears
come mainly from Poland, England, Holland and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Textile Manufacturing Association (NTMA) said
recently that its members had to retrench 114,000 workers this
year as a result of the influx of second hand wears into the
country.
</P>
<P>
NTMA Chairman Victor Eburajolo warned that many more may lose
their jobs unless the Nigerian government increased tariff on
second hand clothes to 200 percent to protect local industry.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of GDM Textiles Manufacturing Company Chief
Adebayo Raji said the large scale smuggling of textile products
has further worsened the problem of the textile industry in
Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Defense Minister: It's Time We Come to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- "Forty-eight years is too long
a time, it's high time we come to China for it is such an
important country," said Adolf Ogi, the first Swiss defense
minister to visit China since the two countries established
diplomatic ties in 1950.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting between the two defense ministers upon Ogi's
arrival, his Chinese counterpart General Chi Haotian extended a
warm welcome, saying, "We've been waiting for you for a long time."
</P>
<P>
Ogi, also a member of the Swiss Federal Council, said in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua today that his trip has won
unanimous approval from the council and is receiving close
attention from the media at home.
</P>
<P>
He said that Switzerland, in a "rapidly changing world hopes
to pursue its interest in a rising, as well as the largest
developing country, in the world."
</P>
<P>
Despite differences between the two countries -- Switzerland
retains a neutral stance while China sticks to its principles in
handling international affairs -- Ogi pointed out that there are
similarities, taking China's non-alignment policy as an
example. "Thus we hope to increase mutual understanding through
the visit, and to seek exchanges and cooperation with China in
economic, cultural and military areas," said Ogi.
</P>
<P>
Ogi said he was delighted that the trip has given him a rough
picture of economic development in China, as well as China's
attitude toward international and regional issues. "We notice at
the same time that China shows tremendous attention to the
situation in Switzerland and the whole European continent," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his trip to a military base and China's University
of National Defense, Ogi said he was deeply impressed by the
outstanding individual capabilities, and the strong physique of
the Chinese servicemen. "They are well-trained and
well-disciplined," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
What Ogi most admires, however, is the role the Chinese army
played in the fight against the floods this summer. "Armies in
all countries around the globe are faced with the same task, and
may refer to the Chinese army for their experience."
</P>
<P>
Ogi hailed his meeting with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and his
talk with Chi Haotian as "tacit, with no need for warming-up."
"The extremely friendly atmosphere shows that Swiss-Chinese
relations are on the right track and are most likely to have
smoother development."
</P>
<P>
"I feel extremely proud, not only for being the first Swiss
defense minister to visit China in half a century, but also for
kicking off the development of another round of Sino-Swiss
relations," he said.

<HEADLINE> Shamshad: Pakistan Proposes Restraint Regime  to Avert Nuclear Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad Sunday said Pakistan has proposed a restraint and
stabilization regime to India to avert the risk of a nuclear
conflict as well as prevent nuclear race in the region.
</P>
<P>
He made this revelation while addressing a press conference at
the conclusion of three-day talks with his Indian counterpart K.
Ragunath on issues of peace and security and the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
The talks ended without any concrete progress, yet the two
sides agreed to continue their discussions on peace and security
and the Jammu and Kashmir dispute respectively in the next round
of talks to be held in New Delhi in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We have proposed a solid regime for mutual restraint and
stabilization in the nuclear and ballistic fields - a regime that
can enable both India and Pakistan to avert the risk of a nuclear
conflict and to prevent an expensive nuclear and missile race,"
Shamshad said.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan has proposed a "substantive framework" for
bilateral dialogue on all the aspects with "specific measures to
be adopted on mutual basis."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, believes that both countries should work
together to promote a strategic restraint and stabilization regime
covering nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles and conventional
arms.
</P>
<P>
"The acquisition by India and then by Pakistan of the nuclear
weapons capability poses a very heavy responsibility on both sides
to ensure that these devastating weapons should never be used," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani foreign secretary said the international
community has expressed concern over the nuclear development in
the region which is filled with tensions.
</P>
<P>
"The world expects us to show restraint and avoid conflict
which could have incalculable consequences," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides responding to the world concern, both Islamabad and New
Delhi have the supreme responsibility for their own peoples to act
with restraint, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, after its successful nuclear tests,
signified its desire to eschew arms race with India by declaring a
unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to take further steps, in tandem with India,
for nuclear stabilization and confidence building," he said.

<HEADLINE> UAE Cuts Interest Rates to Stimulate Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The central bank of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) has decided to cut interest rates on
inter-bank lending, deposits and loans as of October 18.
</P>
<P>
The UAE daily Al-Ithad Sunday quoted informed sources as saying
that the move came after the U.S. Federal Reserve Board further
lowered interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the UAE central bank decision, interest rates for
one-month, three-month and six months deposits are all cut by
one-quarter percentage point while one-year interest rate was
lowered from 4.8125 percent to 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lower cost in borrowing money stemming from the interest
cuts will encourage the enterprises to apply for more loans and
expand investment, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
And reduced interest rates on deposits will dampen the
enthusiasm of personal saving and boost consumption to some
extent, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the national economy will be stimulated, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the interest cut decision has received
wide welcome among banks, which believe that the step will boost
investment and consumption.
</P>
<P>
The sources speculated that the U.S. Federal Reserve will
further cut interest rates by the end of this year in an effort to
keep the U.S. economy afloat at a time of global economic
turmoil.

<HEADLINE> CPC Attaches Great Importance to Agriculture, Rural Work (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The 15th Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) passed a decision on
agriculture and rural work at its third plenary session held in
Beijing last week.
</P>
<P>
The full text of the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee
on Several Major Issues in Agriculture and Rural Work" was
released today.
</P>
<P>
The decision says that the CPC Central Committee's concern for
agriculture and rural work is based on the following:
</P>
<P>
First, China must achieve a sustained development of
agriculture and rural economy if it realizes the goals for
trans-century development put forward at the 15th National
Congress of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The decision says, of China's 1.2 billion population, some 900
million live in the countryside, and therefore the issues of
agriculture, rural areas and farmers have an important bearing on
China's reforms, opening up and modernization.
</P>
<P>
Without stability in rural areas, there will be no stability
in the country. Without prosperity for farmers, there will be no
prosperity for all of the Chinese. And, without a modernized
agriculture, there will be no modernization in China's economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
Second, China has obtained great achievements in its reform and
opening up which started in rural areas and spread across the
country. So, summing up the experience in the past two decades is
of important significance for the Party to persist in the policies
adopted since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC National
Congress and to expand China's reforms and development.
</P>
<P>
Third, with the current Asian financial crisis and challenges
from economic globablization, agricultural growth, prosperity of
rural areas and the increase of farmers' purchasing power will
help expand domestic demands, keep the momentum for growth of the
nation's economy, and sharpen China's edge in international
competition.
</P>
<P>
China's basic stance is to make an effort to expand the
domestic market, especially the rural market, while making good
use of overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, in the process from getting enough to eat and wear,
then becoming comparatively better-off, and to modernization,
there are many problems in the economic construction, cultural and
ethical progress, legislation, and grass-roots organizations in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In some places, the Party's rural policies have not been
implemented in a good way, leading to slow increases in farmers'
incomes and adversely affecting their enthusiasm in farming.
</P>
<P>
Poor agricultural infrastructure and a limited ability to deal
with natural disasters have been blamed for the greater pressure
on the people, resources and the environment.
</P>
<P>
And, it is only when these problems are solved that full
economic development and social progress in rural China can be
achieved and a new socialist, wealthy, democratic and
civilized countryside built.

"identification of the basic causes and methods" to tackle this
problem.
</P>
<P>
"This is something that needs to be discussed. The basic
requirement is that we proceed in a realistic and pragmatic
fashion," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Let's have a proper assessment of the situation that should be
done in a friendly manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian delegation has given some proposals on
Kashmir issue to their Pakistani counterparts. But, he did not
elaborate on that.
</P>
<P>
"We should identify the steps needed to move into a meaningful
discussion which will lead to a mutually acceptable solution," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the discussion on peace and security, the Indian
official said this "requires maintaining of peaceful and security
environment which in turn requires improving trust and
confidence."
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian side had put forward a broad package of
proposals on confidence building measures ranging from avoiding of
nuclear conflict to measures for developing secure and dedicated
communication links between political, civilian and military
authorities of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Indian delegation, he said, also proposed the measures
relating to exchange of data, information which could contribute
to greater confidence.
</P>
<P>
The broad subjects which formed the basis for the Indian
proposals, he said, were exchange of views on security concept and
nuclear doctrine, nuclear and conventional confidence building
measures, increase of information exchange leading to greater
transparency and predictability.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Urges Early Cross-Straits Political Talks (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the Taiwan side has any misgivings about political talks and
procedural talks, SEF and ARATS may increase contacts and
exchanges and have dialogues first, exchanging views on various
issues of common concern or each other's concern with regard to
the cross-strait relations, including political issues, Qian
stressed, adding that they may exchange views on all issues that
are conducive to peaceful reunification and the development of the
cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
He said "one China" principle is the basis for maintaining
stability and developing cross-strait relations and is also
recognized by various countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in favor of all statements and actions about 'two
Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan'. Nor will we tolerate Taiwan to
be ceded," Qian stressed.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the Taiwan side often complains its room of
international existence has been constrained. In fact, it is the
inevitable outcome of the development of the objective situation.
</P>
<P>
Now 126 counties has so far established diplomatic ties with
the People's Republic of China, while only over 20 countries have
maintained relations with Taiwan, and this trend is still
developing, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Taiwan authorities can objectively view the mainland of
the motherland, courageously face the international situation,
take the country and national interests into real account and take
substantial steps to promote the development of the cross-strait
relations and realize the peaceful reunification at an early
date," said Qian.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 head of cattle
have been killed recently by a lion in Siavonga, 200 kilometers
</P>
<P>
Two honorary game scouts based at Gwabi near the affected area
have reportedly abandoned their mission of hunting down the lion
after seeing its big paw prints, fearing it could be
extraordinary and more dangerous, according to the Sunday Times
of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The two have since called for reinforcement from a trained
game scout, who has been operating in another area of Siavonga,
where wild elephants are terrorizing villagers.
</P>
<P>
Chief Sikongo of Siavonga is worried that human life will be
lost if no immediate action is taken.
</P>
<P>
He said poverty among villagers will increase following the
loss of their cattle.
</P>
<P>
People in the two areas terrorized by the lion and elephants
have abandoned field preparations for the forthcoming planting
season beginning next month and children also abandoned school
for fear of the beast.
</P>
<P>
The chief called on the office of the country's vice-president
to send food to the areas where food supplies have run out.
</P>
<P>
He said most families are going without meals prompting him to
make the appeal for relief food, some of which could be sold at a
subsidized price to make it affordable to the villagers.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Public Policies for Agricultural, Rural Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, October 18 (Xinhua) -- China today made public ten
policies for agricultural and rural developments from now to the
year 2010.
</P>
<P>
These polices, contained in the "Decision of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on Several Major
Issues in Agriculture and Rural Work" which was released
today, are as follows:
</P>
<P>
First, China should always give first priority in the
development of national economy. Agriculture is the foundation of
national economy, and its vigorous development will meet the
demand of the lives of the people and guarantee the development
of industry and the service trade.
</P>
<P>
China should adjust national income distribution and increase
input in agriculture. Agricultural legislation and enforcement of
the laws related should be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Second, China should, in a long period of time, stabilize its
basic policies for rural areas. It should adhere to the basic
economic system in which the major form of public ownership and
other forms of ownership develop simultaneously, to the management
system which combines unified and seperate operations based on the
household contract responsibility, and to the distribution system
which combines incomes from one's work mainly and those from the
essential factors of production.
</P>
<P>
Rural reforms should continue in accordance with the demands
of a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Third, China should grasp firm grain production and develop
actively a diversifed economy. While continuing to boost grain
production, the country should adjust the industrial structure in
its rural areas by simultaneously developing agriculture,
forestry, animal husbandry, sideline products and fisheries to
ensure an ample supply of farm produce and a steady increase in
farmers' incomes.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, China should develop agriculture through science and
education. The way out for agriculture lies in science, technology
and education. Agricutrural and rural developments should be
obtained by combining agro-science and education, widely applying
the achievements in agro-scientific research, and training
qualified farmers.

<TEXT>
<P>
Fifth, China should achieve a sustained development in
agriculture. It should facilitate construction of water
conservancy projects, speed up afforestation, protect farmland,
forests and water resources, and control soil erosion,
desertification and environmental pollution so as to improve
production conditions.
</P>
<P>
Sixth, township-run enterprises should be further developed to
absorb surplus rural laborers. Production should be widened and
deepened by developing industries and a service economy and more
small towns and cities built.
</P>
<P>
Seventh, practical measures should be taken to reduce farmers'
burdens. This is of great significance in protecting productive
forces in rural areas and stabilizing the countryside. More should
be given and less taken from farmers.
</P>
<P>
Eighth, China should implement the basic State policy of family
planning. In this respect, both the stress and problem are in the
countryside. Birth control should be advocated in rural areas to
make the rural population adapt to economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Ninth, development of democratic politics at the grass-roots of
rural areas should be advanced. China should adhere to and improve
the leadership of Party organizations at the grassroots,
strengthen the governments at town and township levels and the
self-government organizations in villages, and safeguard
villagers' right to make decisions by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Tenth, equal attention should be paid to material civilization
and cultural and ethical progress in rurual areas.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Urges Early Cross-Straits Political Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Qian Qichen, member of the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee Chinese Communist Party,
today urged early political talks between the Chinese mainland and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Koo Chen-fu and his delegation from the
Straits Exchange Foundation in Taiwan this morning, Qian said
cross-strait political talks are only a matter of time should the
reunification be achieved through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"Holding such talks is better than not (holding the talks) and
better to hold it at earlier date," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
He extended warm welcome to Koo as head of the delegation to visit
the mainland and to exchange views with the Association of Relations
for Across the Strait.
</P>
<P>
Qian said SEF's visit is of positive significance to improving
the cross-strait relations. The direct meeting between the two
sides not only may remove misunderstandings but also increase
understanding and help reduce differences or bring the two sides
closer at the least.
</P>
<P>
Ending hostility and realising cross-straits direct postal,
commercial and transport links have a direct bearing on the
interests of Taiwan compatriots, Qian said, adding that proper
settlement of these issues not only is the immediate need of the
cross-strait relations, but also entirely comply with the
aspirations of the Taiwan compatriots for peace, stability and for
maintaining the status quo, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan now practises capitalist system and after the
reunification, Taiwan may retain the capitalist system while the
mainland of the motherland practises socialist system," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"By reunification, we mean to safeguard the state territorial
integrity and sovereignty, not to argue over systems," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"It is obviously not realistic for some people in Taiwan to
preach that "Taiwan-style democracy" should be the decisive factor
of the reunification," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
He further pointed out under "one China" principle, the
political talks can cover wide-ranging issues, including all the
issues concerned by the Taiwan side. The talks are a long process
during which many problems may be resolved gradually.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: What Prompts Devaluation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi taka, the country's
currency, was depreciated by 2.97 percent against the U.S. dollar
on Sunday following an announcement of the central Bangladesh Bank
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new buying and selling rates between the Bangladesh Bank
and the authorized banks were 48.356 taka and 48.65 taka
respectively, and the buying-selling middle rate rose to 48.50
taka from the previous 47.10 taka.
</P>
<P>
This is the second devaluation of the taka since the current
1998-99 fiscal year began on July 1, and the 14th since the ruling
Awami League came to power in June, 1996, raising the price of a
dollar by 6.75 taka from 41.75 taka to 48.50 taka. It is also the
highest one so far in the 1990s in a single go.
</P>
<P>
The taka continued to remain "one of the most stable currencies
in the region" and the adjustment was necessary to "spur growth of
exports while retaining its competitive edge," considering the
recent domestic and external influences on the external sector
position of Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Bank said, referring to the
over-two-month-long flood and the financial crisis originating
last year in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Hossain Zilllur Rahman, an economist at Bangladesh Institute of
Development Studies, said the depreciation would make imports
expensive while easing the exports to some extent.
</P>
<P>
"But it was not clear why the government went for the
devaluation, as there had been no compelling grounds or reasons
for such massive adjustment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts here also doubted the rationale the bank
cited for the devaluation when the Real Effective Exchange Rate
(REER) and the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate stood at their
comfortable levels below 100, and the country's exports showed
upward trend in earnings during the first two months of the
current fiscal year while imports kept declining.
</P>
<P>
They said the latest devaluation indicated that the government,
ignoring the REER signal, had taken such a step under pressure.
</P>
<P>
The REER is an index prepared everyday by the Bangladesh Bank
reflecting the changes in the exchange rate of taka and inflation
rates vis-a-vis the currencies of Bangladesh's major trading
partners under a trade-weighted basket.
</P>
<P>
The taka comes pressure if the REER Index crosses the
100-level. The government has pursued a policy of mini-adjustment
in the exchange rate of taka in the past few years, based on
changes in the REER.
</P>
<P>
A report in Sunday's edition of The Financial Express said the
decision of devaluation was made immediately after the meeting of
Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington earlier this month. Some high
officials of the central bank also felt surprised at having such
big devaluation, it added.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference last Monday, Kibria said the government
would get 130 million dollars from the IMF for balance of payment
support to meet its import needs, and relevant agreements would be
signed within this month or next month.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh would not be able to get the money free, but under
some conditionalities, according to the analysts. One of the
conditions was the devaluation of the taka, they said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has long been pressing Bangladesh to make further
devaluation of the taka against the dollar, arguing that the
country's southeastern Asian competitors have all devalued their
currencies between 50 and 80 percent in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The analysts noted that the depreciation itself could not
improve much the external competitiveness of the economy if not
synchronized by actions particularly in areas of fiscal and
monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as the country depends heavily on imports of light
industrial products and raw materials for its flourishing
export-oriented garment industry, the devaluation would surely
raise the import cost, they said.
</P>
<P>
A devaluation made on pressure, instead of aimed at maintaining

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Ruling Coalition Parties Directed to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 18 (Xinhua) -- All component parties of
Malaysia's the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front)
coalition have been directed to immediately activate their
respective election machinery to guarantee no erosion to the
coalition's massive majority in the next general election.
</P>
<P>
The directive was issued by BN Secretary-General Mohamed
Rahmat, who is the information minister, in Johor Baharu Saturday
night, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed called upon all BN component parties, the backbone
United Malays National Organization (UMNO) in particular, to
intensify efforts to endear themselves to the masses and keep the
people enlightened on the current political problems. The
political problems were clearly referred to the sacking of Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and the events occurred thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed hoped all 14 BN components were now in a high level of
preparedness and would have by now taken care of internal problems
besides avoiding quarrels over seat allocation and candidates.
</P>
<P>
He said after its landslide victory in the 1995 general
election, a reduced majority could not be ruled out for the BN in
the next polls "but the decline would not be to extent of the BN
government being defeated". He expressed confidence that the
present government will be re-elected and continue to enjoy
support."
</P>
<P>
"UMNO is still solid and strong and so are the BN components,"
he said, adding BN components have repeatedly expressed support
for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's actions as BN chairman.
</P>
<P>
The opposition in the country publicly stated its objective of
eroding away the BN's two-thirds majority in the next polls, which
Mohamed described as "a dream".
</P>
<P>
The next general election is due to be held in April 2000, but
an early general election was recently much talked about.

<HEADLINE> China Lists Tasks for Agricultural, Rural Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- China has listed the major
tasks for agriculture and rural work between now and 2010 to
ensure the sustained development of agriculture and other rural
undertakings, according to a decision of the ruling Communist
Party of China (CPC) released here today.
</P>
<P>
The "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several Major
Issues in Agriculture and Rural Work" was adopted at the Third
Plenum of the 15th CPC Central Committee on October 14, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The tasks are as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Stabilize the system of combining unified and separated
operations, with the household contract responsibility system as
the basis.
</P>
<P>
This conforms with both the traditional farming which mainly
relies on manual labor and the modern farming which uses advanced
science and technology and production methods.
</P>
<P>
The key to this is the land contract system. This is the
cornerstone of the Party's rural policies and should never change.
</P>
<P>
China's policy is to renew the land contract system for another
30 years, draft laws and decrees to ensure the long-term stability
of land contract relations and grant long-term land-use rights to
farmers.
</P>
<P>
-- The reforms of the farm produce distribution system should
be continued and the management of the farm produce market system
should be improved.
</P>
<P>
Grain has a strategic importance in the national economy and in
people's life. The reforms of the distribution system have the
purpose of self-sufficiency in grain on the domestic market,
protecting farmers' enthusiasm, and a steady increase in grain
production.

<P>
Grain purchasing market needs to be well managed to make sure
that the state controls the source of grain; retail grain markets
remain open and multi-channel operations and a competitive
mechanism formed so as to meet the diversified demands of the
market.
</P>
<P>
The state will build a grain risk fund, grain reserve, and
system of purchasing grain at a protective price to regulate the
grain market and protect the interests of both farmers and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
-- Accelerate agricultural capital projects construction
centered on water conservation and improve the farming environment.
</P>
<P>
The most urgent task at the moment is increasing input in water
conservation efforts and harnessing the major rivers and lakes
like the Yangtze and Yellow rivers to increase their ability to
control floods.
</P>
<P>
An effort will be made to complete construction of high quality
embankments along major rivers and lakes, and reinforce
reservoirs; and clear away silt to restore the flood-control
ability.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on the Three Gorges and Xiaolangdi projects
should be accelerated to increase the ability to regulate
floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
-- Optimizing agriculture and the rural economic structure
through science and technology.
</P>
<P>
A revolution in agricultural science and technology requires
the application of bio-engineering and information and other high
and new technologies and the use of farm machinery, chemical
fertilizers, and plastic film for a fundamental change in
agricultural science, technology and productive forces.

<HEADLINE> China Lists Tasks for Agricultural, Rural Development (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- Intensify the effort to ensure an affluent life for the
farmers and speed up the pace of helping the needy in rural China.
</P>
<P>
An affluent life means that farmers have adequate food and
clothing and means of subsistence, improved living environment,
good health, and better education. This means increasing incomes
and reducing burdens of the farmers, a basic requisite to this
end, and it is also important to developing the rural market and
increasing domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Aid-the-needy spending from various channels will be increased
by a big margin and efforts should be made to help resettle the
small number of people who live in areas with extremely difficult
conditions.
</P>
<P>
-- Build democratic legal system at the grass-roots
level. Efforts should be made to Promote democratic elections,
decisionmaking, management, and supervision at the village level.
</P>
<P>
The building of democracy at the township level is an important
part of grass-roots democracy. The direct election of deputies to
the People's Congress at the township level will be adhered and
improved. Expanding democracy at the grass-roots level should be
under the Party's leadership and should proceed in an orderly
manner. The leading role of Party organizations at the village and
township levels should be brought into full play.
</P>
<P>
-- Promote socialist cultural and ethic progress in rural
China. There must be education on patriotism, collectivism,
socialism, the Party's basic line, policies and principles for
farmers, and also education on public and occupational morality
and family virtue. Rural education is the key to developing
agriculture through science, technology and education as a whole
and to improving the quality of rural population.
</P>
<P>
-- Intensify the building of grass-roots Party organization
and train a contingent of officials in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The key to building a new socialist countryside with Chinese
characteristics lies in strengthening and improving Party
leadership, bringing into full play the leading role of
grass-roots Party organizations, and training qualified
grass-roots leading officials.

<HEADLINE> 7-Party Alliance Calls for Hartal in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The 7-party alliance, led by the
main opposition, the Nationalist Party of Bangladesh (BNP), has
called a dawn-to-dusk hartal in Dhaka Sunday in protest against
what it said the government's "failures and misrule" in its
administration.
</P>
<P>
This is the first hartal in Dhaka after the ten-week-long
recent catastrophic floods, which hit 52 out of the country's 64
districts, affecting about half of the its 127 million people and
causing an estimated loss of about 4.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The day-long hartal is being organized in support of the
demands for interest-free loans for farmers, creation of
employment opportunities, opening of gruel kitchens in the
calamity zones, freeing of political prisoners and withdrawal of
fabricated cases filed against the opposition leaders and
activists, BNP sources claimed.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles used by hospitals, newspapers, law enforcing agencies,
water and power supply authorities, medicine shops and kitchen
markets would be exempted from the hartal, according to a BNP
press release issued Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The government has deployed more than 4,000 police and
Bangladesh Rifles personnel in the city to maintain peace during
the hartal, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
To drum up support for today's hartal, the BNP brought out
torch processions at different places in the city Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Police used batons and lobbed teargas shell after BNP activists
blasted crackers and ransacked vehicles in the city when they were
campaigning for hartal. In the police-BNP clashes occurred at some
places, some opposition workers were injured, and a policeman was
also hurt, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The hartal is going on, most of all the shops are closed and
very few pedestrians are seen in the streets.
</P>
<P>
Till now, there are no reports about clashes and arrests which
have occurred between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Formed last year, the 7-party alliance groups the BNP, the main
opposition in the country, the Jamaat-e-Islam Party, the
Bangladesh Jatiya Party, the Democratic League, the Jatiya
Gonatantrik Party, the National Democratic Alliance and the
Progressive Nationalist Party.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Starts Crackdown on Illegal Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti security forces
arrested about 300 illegal resident Saturday on the first day of a
crackdown following a one-month amnesty, Interior Ministry sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The sources, quoted by the local English daily Arab Times,
said the crackdown focused on the main expatriate concentrations
in the capital city of Kuwait, the industrial Shuwaikh area,
Kheitan, Juleeb, Al-Shuyoukh and Fahaheel.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown will continue in the coming days, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry had granted illegal residents a one-month
amnesty to leave the country without paying fine or legalize their
stay.
</P>
<P>
The grace period expired last Wednesday although some illegals
were allowed to leave on Thursday. Thursday and Friday are public
holidays here according to local custom.
</P>
<P>
The ministry estimated that over 11,000 illegal residents were
in Kuwait before the start of amnesty. It is not known exactly how
many of them have left, but unconfirmed reports put the figure at
3,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many of the overstayers have legalized their stays
after the amnesty was issued, said a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
The ministry sources said that all those arrested will be
deported and banned from return, while those who left during the
amnesty are free to come back after obtaining a new work visa.
</P>
<P>
The small Gulf country is very much in need of all kinds of
foreign labor. Of a population of about 2.2 million in Kuwait,
two-thirds are expatriates.

NEW DELHI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Over 1000 students are
suspected to have secured admission to various colleges of Delhi
University this year with forged documents, the Times of India
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Delhi Police Crime Branch said they had arrested three persons,
believed to have been involved in preparing and selling the fake
documents, and the racket may have been operating in the garb of
coaching institutes.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi University registrar had been requested to get the
documents of all students admitted this year verified within one
week from either the Central Bureau of Secondary Education or the
crime branch.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the crime branch said Saturday that a large number
of students and their parents, who obtained admission on the basis
of such documents were likely to be arrested in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
During their investigation, the police scrutinized 1,100
admission forms of students admitted to Shivaji College of the
Delhi University and found that 82 students, 10 of them girls, had
been admitted on the basis of forged documents.
</P>
<P>
In a trap laid by the police, said the Times of India, a decoy
customer met with one of the suspects in the case named
Jaiprakash, who run a private coaching center in Delhi, and agreed
to pay him 10,000 rupees (some 250 U.S. dollars) for three
documents including marksheet, character certificate and
school-leaving certificate.
</P>
<P>
A police team raided the Alpha Public School run by the suspect
and caught him red-handed with the three documents ordered by the

<HEADLINE> China's Three Goals for Agricultural, Rural Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- China puts forward three major
goals for building new socialist rural areas with Chinese
characteristics between now and 2010, according to a decision of
the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) released here today.
</P>
<P>
The "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several Major
Issues in the Development of Agriculture and Rural Work" was
adopted at the Third Plenum of the 15th CPC Central Committee on
October 14, 1998 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The decision says: the country should adhere to the domination
by public ownership while developing diverse forms of ownership
and emancipating and developing productive forces in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
An effort needs to be made to build a rural economic system
based on the household contract responsibility system, supported
by a socialized service network, a market system for farm produce,
based on the importance placed by the central government on
agriculture so as to adapt to developing a socialist market
economy, the decision says.
</P>
<P>
China should make progress in improving agricultural science
and technology, equipment, and productive forces. Farm produce
supplies should meet the needs of national economic development,
population growth and improved living standards, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The rural industrial structure needs to be further optimized,
and big progress is made in urbanization, with increases in
farmers' incomes to give them an affluent life, it says.
</P>
<P>
Politically, the decision points out, the leadership of the
Communist Party of China should be upheld, socialist democratic
politics strengthened, democracy at grass-roots units expanded,
and the rights of Chinese farmers' to exercise democracy in
accordance with the law guaranteed.

<P>
Township governments need to be kept small in size but are
highly efficient, the decision says, adding that village
organizations with Party branches as the core should be
strengthened, relationships between officials and the villagers be
closer, the pace of a rule by law increased, and good social order
security environment maintained in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Culturally, it cont9inues, the nation should promote socialist
culture and ethics in rural areas, train a new type of farmers
with lofty ideals, moral integrity, good education and a strong
sense of discipline.
</P>
<P>
Ideological and moral education should be intensified, healthy
social conduct advocateded, education developed, nine-year
compulsary education system obligatory, illiteracy wiped out, and
scientific and technical know-how spread, it says.
</P>
<P>
Rural public healthy and sports should be given priority,
farmers made aware of elementary hygiene, more cultural facilities
built, and rural cultural life enriched, it added.
</P>
<P>
China's primary stage of socialism is a underdeveloped stage,
especially in rural areas, it points out. This means that the
country should take economic development and improving
agricultural productive forces should be the central task of the
rural economy. All policies should help boosting the economic
vitality in rural areas. The farmers should be relied on to
transform the backwardness. The standards of farmers' material and
cultural life should be improved.
</P>
<P>
The basic guiding principles for development in the primary
stage of socialism and the tasks for the first decade of the next
century laid down at the 15th Party Congress pointed the way out
to the modernization of China's agriculture and rural areas.

NAIROBI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Kenyan newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), which has been fighting
the Ugandan government from bases in Sudan for more than 12
years, has reportedly split into two over the issue of how to
treat civilians in northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation:
</P>
<P>
-- The presidents of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania will hold a
one-day summit in Nairobi Sunday to discuss regional security
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
-- The army of Democratic Republic of Congolese President
Laurent Kabila has been pounding rebel-based Kindu in the east
with heavy artillery fire for 48 hours, sources in Kinshasa said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
East African Standard:
</P>
<P>
-- Delegations attending Burundi peace talks in the northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha have called for the immediate
establishment of a transitional government to end a civil war
that has claimed more than 200,000 lives in five years.

<HEADLINE> China Maps Out Plan for Agricultural, Rural Development (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision also lists the main tasks for agricultural and
rural developments.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be continued over a long period of time to
stabilize the system of combining unified and seperate operations
based on the household contract responsibility. The key
to this dual operation system is to stabilize and improve the land
contract. This is the cornerstone of the Party's rural policies
and the Party will never waver on this point. An effort must be
made to carry out the policy of extending the term of land
contracts for another 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to deepen the reform of the circulation
system for farm produce and to improve the farm produce
markets. Grain is a strategic material and vitally important to
the growth of national economy and the improvement of people's
lives. So, the starting point for the reform of the grain
circulation system should be to guarantee a basic grain supply at
home, safeguard farmers' enthusiasm in grain production and
increase grain output.
</P>
<P>
Capital construction for agriculture should be accelerated and
the agro-ecosystem improved. Priority is to invest more in
harnessing large rivers and lakes including the Yangtze and Yellow
rivers to increase flood-control capacity.
</P>
<P>
Scientific and technological achievements must be used to
improve agricultural and rural economic structures. Revolution in
agro-science and technology must be promoted by applying the
achievements in bio-engineering and information industries on the
basis of the wide application of farm machinery, chemical
fertilizers, plastic sheeting and other industrial achivements.

<P>
Greater effort needs to be made to get a relatively
comfortable living standard in rural areas and to wipe out
poverty. Poverty relief spendings should be increased by a large
margin and should come from different sources. People living
in extremely adverse natural conditions should be resettled.
</P>
<P>
Grass-roots democracy and the legal system in rural areas
should be strngthened to promote democratic elections,
decision-making, management and supervision at the village level.
</P>
<P>
Socialist ethical and cultural progress should be strengthened
in rural areas, and farmers should be educated in patriotism,
collectivism, socialism, and the Party's basic line, guiding
principles and policies, as well as in public morality,
professional ethics and family virtues.
</P>
<P>
Grass-roots Party organizations and cadre groups in rural areas
should be improved. The key to building a new socialist
countryside with Chinese characteristics lies in strengthening and
improving the Party leadership, fully playing the part of
grass-roots Party organizations as the core of leadership, and in
building a high-quality contingent of grass-roots cadres.
</P>
<P>
The Third Plenum called on the entire Party and people of all
ethnic groups to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory in creating a new situation in agriculture and rural work and
bringing into the 21st century the cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics under the CPC leadership with Jiang Zemin
at the core.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Undertake Environmental Rehabilitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Ministry of
Forest and Environment has proposed a post-flood environment
rehabilitation program with a cost of over 1.1 billion taka (about
2.27 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This proposal is made on the basis of a study report on the
assessment of environmental impacts of flood, 1998, prepared by
the Department of Environment with the aid of the UNDP (United
Nations Development program), a daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The study report would assess the damage inflicted to the
lives, property and environment by the century's worst flood, The
Independent quoted Minister of Forest and Environment Sajeda
Chowdhury as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is for the first time that a comprehensive study has been
undertaken to identify the areas of damage to the environment
after the devastating flood, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The study report was prepared by a group of experts, and it
would be of an immense help in the planning of pre- and post flood
preparedness and rehabilitation program after flood, she observed.
</P>
<P>
It would also help lessen the damage of the flood in future and
specific suggestion would be provided in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The recent severe flood has caused an irreparable damage to the
forest resources of the country, she said, adding that the total
loss has been estimated at above 1.1 billion taka (about 2.27
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction of roads and other works of infrastructural
development are going on in full swing, and every effort has been
made to restore the normal pace of development activities in
environmental sector, she noted.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Civil protection personnel
are rushing ahead of hurricane Lester to evacuate thousands of
residents in the southern Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero,
reports said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In Oaxaca, authorities have started to alert the population
through radio and television messages, aiming to reduce potential
damage to be resulted from the hurricane.

<P>
A hurricane in early September hit the southeastern state of
Chiapas, killing 200 people and affecting 400,000 others.
</P>
<P>
Civil protection organizations are in a state of alert in
Oaxaca because Lester has changed course again and could lash the
coast of Puerto Angel and Pinotepa Nacional in the state.
</P>
<P>
At least 650 families have been evacuated from areas believed
to bear high risks.
</P>
<P>
Guerrero state authorities have prepared 114 refuges for 10,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
At 13:30 local time (18:30 GMT), Lester was 120 kilometers (75
miles) south of Huatulco, Oaxaca, and was moving west-northwest at
11 kilometers (6.8 miles) per hour.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane develops winds of more than 160 kilometers (100
miles) per hour, with gusts of up to 190 kilometers (120 miles)
per hour.

<HEADLINE> Chileans Must Be Judged by Chilean Courts: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Chileans should be tried by
Chilean courts, Chilean President Eduardo Frei said on Saturday
following the arrest of the country's former military chief
Augusto Pinochet in London.
</P>
<P>
Frei told Chilean reporters in Oporto, Portugal, that the
detention violated the diplomatic immunity Pinochet enjoys as
senator-for-life, and broke international law.
</P>
<P>
The 82-year-old former commander-in-chief of the Chilean army
was detained earlier Saturday at a London clinic where he had
received a minor surgery.
</P>
<P>
Frei said his country has lodged a formal protest to Britain
over the detention.
</P>
<P>
"We think that you have to respect Chilean laws. This condition
of diplomatic immunity protects all Chilean lawmakers ... People
in Chile must be judged by Chilean courts," said the president,
who is in Oporto for an Ibero-American summit.
</P>
<P>
British authorities said they were acting on a request from
Spanish courts probing Pinochet's role in alleged organized
killing of Spaniards in Chile during his rule of the country
between 1973 and 1990.

<HEADLINE> Chile Says Pinochet's Arrest Violates Diplomatic Immunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Chile said on Saturday the
detention of its former military leader Augusto Pinochet in London
was in violation of diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique from the Chilean Foreign Affairs
Ministry, Pinochet was traveling with a diplomatic passport in his
capacity as a senator-for-life.
</P>
<P>
The former commander-in-chief of the Chilean army, convalescing
in a London clinic after minor surgery, was detained earlier
Saturday on the request of Spanish courts probing alleged
organized killing of Spanish citizens in Chile between 1973 and
1990 when Pinochet ran the country.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza expressed regret
at Pinochet's detention at a press conference in the Portuguese
city of Oporto, where he was accompanying President Eduardo Frei
at an Ibero-American Summit.
</P>
<P>
Insulza said the matter "is particularly deplorable" as it
"impinges on our political process and our relations with other
states."
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe that this could be anybody's plot or out of
political motivation on the part of the British or Spanish
governments," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chilean government would seek an early settlement
of the issue through political and judicial ways. "Our only
possible road is to have immunity validated," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that his country is against
extra-territorial laws and that Chileans could only be tried by
Chilean courts.

<HEADLINE> 44th CPA Conference opens in Wellington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The 44th Conference of the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) opened in Wellington
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Governor-General Sir Michael Hardie Boys, Prime
Minister Jenny Shipley, Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief Emeka
Anyaoku, and about 500 senior parliamentarians and parliamentary
officials from more than 50 countries attended the opening
session, which was presided over by CPA president Doug Kidd.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference is scheduled to discuss issues on
globalization and its impact on Commonwealth governments and
parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Shipley delivered a low-keynote speech at the
opening session, saying the conference's theme is "both complex
and potentially controversial".
</P>
<P>
"The onset of globalization, where markets, information and
ideas flow seamlessly across national borders, is already having a
direct impact on governments and parliaments. Realistically the
trend will intensify in the future," Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
"People will know more but feel less secure. Electorates the
world over will embrace the new icons of international culture but
will worry about how to retain local and indigenous traditions and
values. The international financial institutions, set up after
World War II, are and will struggle to keep pace with the impact
of global capital flows. Many millions of people, including those
around the Asia Pacific Basin, who have experienced such economic
and social improvement in the last 15 years, have in the last 15
months seen their expectations of rising incomes and economic
security replaced by the fear and anxiety concerning poverty and
unemployment," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced there is no single policy prescription that
will ensure growth, development and equity in every Commonwealth
country. We can learn from each other. We each have to find what
suits and works for us given our own circumstances," Mrs Shipley
said.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said her Government is committed to pursuing
"an open and internationally competitive economy" and her country
needs "sustainable non-inflationary economic and employment
growth" to finance its social spending and infrastructural
investment.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, she conveyed to the attendants the New Zealand
Government's decision to endorse its Minister of Foreign Affairs
and Trade Don McKinnon as a candidate to succeed Chief Anyaoku as
the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
McKinnon is leading the New Zealand delegation to the
conference.

JAKARTA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie had decided to attend the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation Forum (APEC) summit in Malaysia next month, a
government official said.
</P>
<P>
The president made this decision because he was encouraged by
Malaysian authorities' better treatment of former Malaysian deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
"The better treatment given to Anwar and a possible house
arrest status for him have eradicated major barriers for the
visit," Presidential Spokeswoman Dewi Fortuna Anwar told the
Jakarta Post on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Anwar has transferred from the Bukit Aman
federal police headquarters in Kuala Lumpur to the modern Sungai
Buloh prison.
</P>
<P>
The summit was also strategically very important for the
region, she added.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post Saturday quoted a reliable source as saying
that Habibie had assured Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
during a recent telephone conversation that he would attend the
APEC summit in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
"Habibie told Mahathir that he did not intend to interfere in
Malaysia's internal affairs, he was just worried about the
condition of his close friend Anwar," a palace official who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The official said Habibie telephoned Mahathir shortly before
his meeting with Philippine President Joseph Estrada in Batam near
Singapore on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Habibie told the prime minister he had to drop his planned
visit to Kuala Lumpur on October 9 due to his mounting domestic
duties.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Claims Preventing Heroin from Reaching U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar claimed that it has
prevented 45 billion U.S. dollars worth of heroin from reaching
streets of the United States since 1988 up to date despite cut in
assistance by the U.S. since then.
</P>
<P>
In a latest report on the political situation of Myanmar,
issued by the Office of Strategic Studies of the Defense Ministry,
the government blamed the U.S. and the Western World for not only
refusing to recognize and encourage Myanmar's efforts in the fight
against narcotic drugs, but also putting obstacles in the move by
imposing an arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
The drug armies use sophisticated weapons to fight against the
government, while the government troops use weapons of inferior
quality, inflicting heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that the Myanmar government had managed
to break the notorious drug army of khun Sa in the Golden Triangle
area and had him surrender unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
The for/2De5rug warlord Khun Sa and his 15,000-strong Mong Tai
Army laid down their arms in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the 14-year period between 1974 and 1988, Myanmar has
cooperated with the U.S. in anti-narcotic operations, obtaining
an aid of 68 million dollars from the U.S. side. The aid was
provided mainly for training Myanmar officials and for the use of
spare parts and equipment in drug eradication operations, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Romania Launches Poverty Alleviation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu called Saturday for addressing the very roots of
poverty through the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Social security system alone is not enough to tackle the
problem, Constantinescu said in announcing the beginning of
Romania's first national poverty alleviation program.
</P>
<P>
While the social security system carries the mandate to reduce
the various adverse effects of poverty, he said, the government
should take the role in wiping out the roots of poverty.
</P>
<P>
It's no easy job for the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
In achieving poverty alleviation goals through economic
development, Romania has to take a short cut in frog-leap into the
post-industrial and information age.
</P>
<P>
Romania is to launch a "Poverty Alleviation Week" jointly with
the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) in the coming week, so as to
kick off the national poverty alleviation program.

that it was time for the Party to make decisions on some major
issues in agriculture and rural work.
</P>

conditions in rural areas, and improving the level of material and
cultural life of farmers.

leadership, promote the development of socialist democratic
politics in rural areas, further expand grass-roots democracy, and
make certain that farmers directly exercise their democratic
rights in accordance with the law; and

<P>
Third: culturally, China should continue to promote socialist

with lofty ideals, moral integrity, good education and good
discipline.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Japan to Take More Steps for World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) - U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday urged Japan to take more steps to help improve world
economic growth by opening and deregulating its economy.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio address, Clinton said Japan, the world's
second-largest economy behind the United States, must open and
deregulate its economy to strengthen its financial system.
</P>
<P>
"Now it's critical to avoid further delay by moving quickly and
using that money most effectively ... Now the health of Asia's
economy -- and indeed the world -- depends upon Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the substantial assistance in Japan's legislation to
repair its troubled banking system."
</P>
<P>
He said America's prosperity is inextricably tied to markets
overseas, and "we stand ready to help countries that develop
policies to keep their economy strong."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it was critical for Asia and Europe to promote
growth to prevent new global financial turmoil and protect
American prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He also heralded the newly approved U.S. contribution of 17.9
billion U.S. dollars to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as
"an insurance policy for our own economy."
</P>
<P>
"Now the IMF is stronger and ready to act. We must make
certain that when it acts, it acts to promote global growth and to
limit the reach of financial crisis. In turn, this will foster a
stronger economy here at home and help our own workers, farmers
and ranchers," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's remarks came two days after the U.S. Federal Reserve,
in a surprise move, cut key lending rates by a quarter percentage
point for the second time within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The White House and Congress agreed earlier this week to free
up the emergency fund for the IMF as part of the federal budget
deal.

<HEADLINE> Southgate: England Persecuted by Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- England manager Glenn Hoddle
has condemned reports of a dressing room mutiny following
England's midweek match in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the story, carried in The Sun newspaper, as a
"vicious lie" and defender Gareth Southgate said the team felt
persecuted by the media.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle said he was beginning to believe what he had been told
that there were "people out there" trying to undermine his job.
</P>
<P>
A front page story in Saturday's Sun newspaper said an angry
confrontation came after Hoddle had demanded an explanation of
the team's poor performance in Wednesday's 3-0 European
championship qualifier win over Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle, under fire for the side's miserable form since the
World Cup finals, was quoted as saying: "No-one leaves this
dressing room until you tell me why you are producing
performances like this."
</P>
<P>
Shearer was reported to have snapped back: "Have you ever
thought it might be down to you."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle said the suggestion that he and his captain had had a
row was "just mischievous, pure garbage".
</P>
<P>
But he admitted he had "a pop" at the team during halftime in
Luxembourg and that there had been a frank exchange of views
after the match.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed over these vicious lies," said Hoddle.
"I have spoken to Alan Shearer and he can't believe it.
</P>
<P>
"People are going out of their way to invent stories...some of
the garbage is laughable."
</P>
<P>
He said the flak he had been receiving would serve only to
make him more determined to ensure that England "do well and
qualify for the European championship finals".
</P>
<P>
Southgate, who scored England's third goal on Wednesday night,
said he was "amused and bemused" by what was written.
</P>
<P>
"I thought I must have been in a different dressing room quite
frankly," he told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I am aware there was nothing out of the ordinary on
Wednesday night," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the players were convinced that some people were
out to "get" the coach, he said:
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I think we are convinced that people are out to get
everybody, quite honestly."
</P>
<P>
British Sports Minister Tony Banks said it was time the fans
and media got behind Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thinks they know how to pick a winning team,"Banks
told BBC radio. "The trouble is the people with these opinions
are usually propping up bars or writing newspaper columns.
</P>
<P>
"It is all about results. If he (Hoddle) gets results then
obviously everyone thinks he is going to walk on water and does
walk on water. If he doesn't they will want to drown him in it.It
is an impossible job."

TEHRAN -- A group of 26 Iranians released by the Afghan Taliban
militia arrived here Saturday evening, the official news agency
IRNA reported.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Enters Vienna Final to Meet Kucera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- World number one American Pete
Sampras beat fellow countryman Todd Martin 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) here on
Saturday to meet Slovak Karol Kucera at the CA-Trophy tennis
tournament final.
</P>
<P>
Kucera, ranked seventh in the world, upset Briton Greg
Rusedski 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 in the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who is on his way to ending the year with his world
number one ranking for a record sixth consecutive year, appeared
exhausted in the second set after easily taking the first set
with a break in the fifth game.
</P>
<P>
Neither player had a break in the second set, which eventually
went into a tie-break won 7-4 by Sampras.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, 27, will probably have a hard time when he faces
Kucera on Sunday, battling for his fourth title this year.
</P>
<P>
Sampras has won three titles so far in 1998, including
Philadelphia, Atlanta and Wimbledon but was sent packing by
Kucera in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open this year.

ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A 95 million dollars
telecommunications contract was signed here Saturday between
Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) and China Wanbo

<HEADLINE> Germany's SPD, Greens to Seal Coalition Deal Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Social Democratic Party
(SPD) and the Greens said Saturday that they have successfully
wound up 10 days of negotiations on a common policy platform and
will sign the deal to form a coalition government next week.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a final round of policy negotiations, the SPD and
Greens said that they would spend the next few days to finalize
the distribution of cabinet posts before formally signing a
coalition contract next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The center-left SPD, which has been in opposition for 16 years,
defeated Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative alliance in general
elections on September 27. It needs to form a coalition government
with the ecologist Greens in order to muster a stable majority in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the two parties reached a deal to raise the
country's energy tax.
</P>
<P>
Petrol prices would be increased by 0.06 German marks (0.04
U.S. dollars) per Liter from January next year. Meanwhile prices
for heating oil, natural gas and electricity would also be raised.
</P>
<P>
The extra revenues would be used to finance a 0.8 percent cut
in non-wage labor costs which include mandatory payments for
health and unemployment insurance, officials of two parties said.
</P>
<P>
The SPD and Greens on Saturday also reached a compromise on the
transportation policy with the Greens dropping its demand for a
general speed limit on the country's highways.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Rudolf Scharping, the SPD's current parliamentary
leader who would become Germany's defense minister, confirmed
Saturday that the German armed forces would remain at its current
strength of 340,000 soldiers and would not face further cuts in
defense budget soon as demanded by the Greens.
</P>
<P>
During the past weeks, the SPD and Greens already reache d
agreement on a wide range of policy issues, including foreign
policy and a tax reform.
</P>
<P>
With the coalition package now complete, both the SPD and
Greens will hold a party convention at the end of next week to
approve the deal. The new government is due to be sworn in at the
end of this month.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Mild acne to Depression, Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A new study shows that even
mild acne can be associated with such emotional problems as
significant clinical depression and even suicide, the American
Counseling Association (ACA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by Madhulika Gupta, a professor at the
University of Western Ontario, Canada, who presented her findings
at a recent meeting in San Francisco. Gupta said that "the
cosmetic impact of even mild acne can cause a profound emotional
burden for some young people."
</P>
<P>
According to ACA, the world's private organization for
professional counselors, acne is often a source of embarrassment
and anxiety to teenagers, and this new study confirms the
importance of seeking treatment of teenage skin conditions sooner
rather than later.
</P>
<P>
Gupta and her colleagues found that the prevalence of
depression and suicidal thinking among patients with mild to
moderate acine was similar to that among patients suffering from
moderately severe psoriasis, a far more chronic and cosmetically
disfiguring condition.
</P>
<P>
According to Gupta, a psychiatrist who studies the
psychological effects of skin problems, the effects of acne may be
expressed in a number of ways, including low-esteem and social
withdrawal and lifestyle limitations. She urged parents to seek
medical treatment for their teenagers who have acne.
</P>
<P>
Acne is a disease that affects about 17 million people in the
United States, and nearly 80 percent of the population will
develop some form of acne during their lifetime time, ACA said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Mediates Palestine-Israel Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday met Israeli and Palestinian leaders to try to mediate
differences over security issues which are blocking the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived at the Wye Plantation, Maryland, by helicopter
from Washington for meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
After two days of negotiations, diplomatic sources said that
key security issues remained unsettled while Netanyahu and Arafat
exchanged allegations Friday that suggest mistrust between the two
leaders persists.
</P>
<P>
At the Wye Plantation, Clinton met and had lunch with senior
U.S. officials and then had a 90-minute meeting with Arafat. Then
the president telephoned a report to President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Later Clinton had a meeting with Netanyahu at River House, a
luxurious estate overlooking the Wye River. Six aides, including
George Tenet of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), from
the U.S. and Israel participated in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was trying to clear the way for an agreement by Sunday,
the end of four days of talks, but signs of discord were evident.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the venue, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart gave a terse account that made no reference to the
disputed topics.
</P>
<P>
"We think the environment out here has provided the ability for
informal discussions and has provided an atmosphere that is
constructive," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton enjoyed a "strong reservoir of trust" with the
two leaders, and if he can play "a constructive role," the
president will return Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's talks were being described as "informal" since it is
the Jewish Sabbath and work is proscribed.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has agreed to relinquish a further 13 percent of the
West Bank, with 3 percent designated as a nature preserve, but has
declared there will be no agreement unless Arafat takes concrete
steps to curb terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The summit is meant to break a 19-month stalemate in the peace
process by nailing down a new transfer of land to the Palestinians
in the West Bank in return for cast-iron Palestinian guarantees
they will crack down on militants.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said some working groups were meeting for a
third day and that Clinton's participation means a new sense of
urgency.
</P>
<P>
The first two days had essentially been a review of positions,
many of which are still far apart, and they were waiting for U.S.
proposals to breathe life into the talks, which Washington wants
to end by Monday at the latest.
