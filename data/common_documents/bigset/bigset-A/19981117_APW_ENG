Report: Chinese cities keen to build subways
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI (AP) _ Around 20 city governments in China are seeking
approval to build subways and light railways in order to relieve
growing traffic congestion, the state-run newspaper Shanghai
Securities News reported Tuesday.
	   Such projects are being considered to help build a more
efficient transport network in China's largest cities, the report
said.
	   It noted that China has about 35 cities with populations of over
1 million, and another 43 cities with populations of 500,000 to 1
million people. Traffic congestion in those cities is expected to
worsen.
	   The report forecast that by 2000, four cities that already have
subways or are starting construction _ Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou
and Shenzhen _ will need to buy about 1,000 train cars, worth 10
billion yuan (dlrs 1.21 billion) to complete subways and light
railway lines. The figure is expected to reach 3,000 train cars,
worth 30 billion yuan (dlrs 3.63 billion), by 2010.
	   Including spare parts and related equipment, the report said
those four cities alone could spend up to 60 billion yuan (dlrs
7.26 billion) in the next decade.

North Korea calls Japanese satellite plan `military action'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korean officials on Tuesday accused Japan of
developing spy satellites as a first step towards launching a
military conquest of Asia, the North's state-run news agency
reported.
	   Japan earlier this month approved a plan to put four spy
satellites into orbit by 2002, citing security concerns over North
Korea's recent launching of a rocket over Japan.
	   ``This is one more dangerous military action intended to
legalize the policy of turning Japan into a military power and
perfect preparations for overseas aggression,'' said a statement by
the North Korean Foreign Ministry released by the KCNA news agency.
The report was monitored in Tokyo.
	   North Korea fired a rocket over Japan into the Pacific on Aug.
31, showing that the communist country could strike anywhere in
Japan and making many Japanese nervous about their country's
defense capabilities.
	   Japan, which had no missile-detection system of its own, only
found out about the rocket from the U.S. military. North Korea
claims the launch sent a satellite into orbit, but Japan has
questioned that.
	   The North Korean Foreign Ministry vowed to take action.
	   ``We will not remain a passive onlooker to its military
challenge, but take a powerful self-defensive measure,'' the
statement said without specifying any actions.

U.N. aid workers return, arms inspectors to test Iraq's pledges

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with arms inspectors leaving Bahrain &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors made their way back
to Baghdad on Tuesday and said they want to get back to work as
soon possible to test Iraq's pledge to cooperate in the search for
its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``The Iraqi authorities have promised cooperation. Obviously the
next few days are going to very important,'' said Caroline Cross,
spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission in charge of arms
inspections.
	   She spoke as 86 inspectors from UNSCOM and the International
Atomic Energy Agency left their hotel in the Gulf state of Bahrain,
where they were evacuated last week, for the flight back to
Baghdad.
	   With the threat of American and British air strikes on Iraq over
for now, about 150 U.N. relief workers also returned to Baghdad
from the Jordanian capital of Amman, where they were sent at the
height of the crisis.
	   Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to
Baghdad, said in an interview Monday that Iraq was being watched
closely to measure its resolve in cooperating in the search for
forbidden weapons.
	   ``Many members of the Security Council want the question of
Iraq's cooperation with the inspectors to be tested and proved on
the ground,'' Shah said.
	   He added: ``If Iraq cooperates fully and unreservedly with the
inspections due to begin in the next few days, the comprehensive
review to be conducted by the council offers a hopeful sign for the
future.''
	   Shah was leaving Tuesday for New York to brief Annan and council
members on the situation.
	   Ms. Cross said as she readied to leave Bahrain that the
inspectors were anxious to get back on the job.
	   ``We will be back straight to work today,'' she said. ``The
first thing we will be doing is getting the office up and running,
reassembling some of the equipment and computers that we dismantled
or brought down.
	   ``We will be out on inspections _ within a few hours maybe,
later today or maybe tomorrow,'' she said. ``We will be out and
about doing our work as soon as possible.''
	   Among the inspectors returning were 80 from UNSCOM, which is
searching for Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles, and six from the separate U.N. agency examining the
country's nuclear weapons programs.
	   Of the about 150 U.N. relief workers pulled out last week, the
first 31 returned on a special U.N. flight from Jordan, where they
were evacuated, to Habaniya military air base west of Baghdad.
	   The other 120 traveled overnight on a bus convoy through the
desert of Jordan and Iraq.
	   The threat of military action was averted Sunday when U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced that the United States had
accepted the Iraqi government's pledge a day earlier to lift its
three-month ban on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Once inspectors report they are able to work effectively, the
Security Council will conduct a review of Iraq's efforts to
eliminate its dangerous weapons. The Iraqi government wants the
review to lead quickly to the lifting of U.N. sanctions _ a move
both the United States and Britain have resisted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated
Iraq's economy.
	   The council has said they will not be lifted until the U.N.
Special Commission and the Vienna-headquartered International
Atomic Energy Agency certify that Iraq has eliminated its lethal
weaponry.

Report: Japanese Cabinet approves international space station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Cabinet on Tuesday gave its final approval
to a U.S.-led plan to build a permanent international space station
to be launched in 2004, a news report said.
	   The project was signed by 15 countries in Washington in January,
and was a new version of an earlier agreement reworked to include
Russia. It is the largest international civil science and
technology project ever undertaken.
	   The pact, approved by the Japanese Parliament in April, will go
into force when the governments of the United States and Russia
approve it, Kyodo News agency quoted government officials as
saying.
	   Japanese space officials had no immediate comment on the report.
	   Countries taking part in the project are Canada, Japan, Russia,
the United States, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United
Kingdom.

Habibie to commute to Asian summit to avoid spending night
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Indonesian military leader saying
that he will stay in Malaysia during the APEC summit. No violence
reported in Jakarta on Tuesday. Incorporates BC-Indonesia. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a sign of concern over
Indonesia's social unrest, its president, B.J. Habibie, decided to
commute back and forth to Malaysia during its two-day economic
summit of Pacific Rim leaders.
	   Habibie arrived in the Malaysian capital Tuesday to meet with
the other leaders attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
meetings. But he planned to go back home and spend the night there,
before returning to Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday.
	   It was Habibie's first trip abroad since unrest dislodged his
predecessor, Suharto, in May.
	   At least 16 people, including eight students, were killed last
week in a wave of protests and rioting in Jakarta. The violence was
the worst there since May, when hundreds of people died.
	   Police questioned 11 prominent Indonesian opposition figures on
Monday over the deadly student protests after Habibie accused
opponents of trying to overthrow his 6-month-old government.
	   Jakarta's streets were quiet on Tuesday, a Muslim holy day and
national holiday. But there was widespread outrage over the recent
killings by the military, both against Habibie and Gen. Wiranto,
Indonesia's minister of defense and armed forces chief.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, Wiranto said on Tuesday that he would remain in
Malaysia for both days of the APEC summit.
	   Asked about the role the Indonesian military had recently played
in Jakarta, Wiranto said: ``We will remain professional, and we
will safeguard the constitution. No politicking.''
	   Habibie has indicated he will stick by his military commander.
	   Habibie told reporters in Kuala Lumpur that the situation at
home was ``good'' but declined to elaborate. He made the comment
after a meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam.

Flooding kills 17 in central Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Another bout of serious flooding in
central Vietnam has killed 17 people and caused an estimated 104
billion dong (dlrs 7.4 million) in damage, officials said Tuesday.
	   Provincial floods and storm control committees said eight people
died in Khanh Hoa province, three in Ninh Thuan and two each in
Binh Thuan, Phu Yen and Binh Dinh.
	   Tropical storm Chip, which dumped 200 to 400 millimeters (eight
to 16 inches) of rain on the area Friday through Sunday, submerged
large swaths of land, destroyed several hundred houses, sank 20
fishing boats and damaged some rice fields and roads.
	   The damage figure is a huge amount for one of Vietnam's poorest
regions.
	   Last month, floods killed 52 people and caused 191 billion dong
(dlrs 13.7 million) in damage to the region, which until mid-August
was suffering from its worst drought in at least half a century.

Police investigate Marine over alleged drunk-driving accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police in southwestern Japan said Tuesday they are
investigating a U.S. Marine on suspicion that he ran over a
Japanese woman while driving under the influence of alcohol.
	   Under investigation is Cpl. Gregg A. Johnson, 20, stationed at
U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, said a spokesman for the
Yamaguchi prefectural, or state, police, on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The spokesman said that police did not arrest Johnson as there
was no fear he would try to run away. Johnson's hometown was not
immediately available, the spokesman said.
	   According to an initial investigation, Johnson allegedly ran
over a 59-year-old Japanese woman who was walking in front of his
passenger car on a street in Iwakuni early Saturday morning.
Johnson was found for a drunk at the time of the accident, the
spokesman said.
	   The woman, whose name was withheld by police, suffered a broken
left leg in the accident and will need one month to recover, the
spokesman said.
	   Iwakuni, in Yamaguchi prefecture, is 722 kilometers (448 miles),
southwest of Tokyo.
	   Earlier this month, a U.S. Marine corporal was fined 150,000 yen
(dlrs 1,250) for a hit-and-run accident last month on Okinawa that
left a Japanese man with minor injuries.
	   In a separate accident on Okinawa in October in which an
18-year-old Japanese woman was killed, U.S. Marine Cpl. Randall M.
Eskridge, 23, of LaPorte, Ind., has been charged with hit-and-run
and drunken driving.
	   There are currently 47,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in
Japan under mutual security arrangements with the United States.

Report: Suharto owns plantation land in eastern province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Former Indonesian President Suharto
and his family control thousands of hectares (acres) of land in the
western province of Irian Jaya, the provincial prosecutor's office
said Monday.
	   Investigations by the office have established that the Suharto
family owns the land through at least five companies operating in
the province in the plantation, fisheries and industrial sectors,
said T.H. Sidabutar, head of Irian Jaya's High Public Prosecutors'
Office.
	   The five companies had their regional offices in a number of
places in Irian Jaya, Indonesia's easternmost province, the
official Antara news agency reported.
	   Suharto was forced to quit in May amid riots and protests, and
his successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised investigations
of the business dealings of associates of the former leader.
	   The attorney general's office is already investigating the
wealth of Suharto, who has denied corruption or stashing cash
overseas. His denials have been greeted with disbelief by many
Indonesians struggling with the nation's worst economic crisis in
three decades.
	   Sidabutar said investigations in Irian Jaya so far had focused
on the Suharto family, but would be expanded to include Suharto
associates.
	   Associates of the former president are believed to have money
invested in contracting companies serving PT Freeport Indonesia,
one of the world's largest gold and copper mining companies, Antara
reported.
	   A Suharto supporter, Bob Hasan, holds a virtual monopoly on the
supply of food and other essentials for employees at the mine, the
agency reported.
	   Supplies to PT Freeport Indonesia employees were previously
handled by Irian Jayans or were imported from Australia, Sidabutar
said.

Dollar lower against yen, Tokyo stock prices mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and currency
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen Tuesday
as investors and traders awaited the outcome of a Federal Reserve
policy-making meeting later in the day. Japanese stocks closed
mixed.
	   The dollar bought 121.28 yen at mid-afternoon, down 0.86 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
120.07 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 15.27 points,
or 0.11 percent, to finish at 14,413.00. On Monday, the average
closed up 160.06 points, or 1.12 percent.
	   On the currency market, the dollar moved lower on growing
expectations the U.S. central bank will cut interest rates for a
third time.
	   Japan's announcement on Monday of 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196
billion) in new public spending and tax cuts also helped boost the
yen.
	   But the Japanese currency gave up some of its gains later in
Tokyo trading after credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service
downgraded Japanese government securities.
	   In lowering Tokyo's rating a notch from the highest Aaa, the
U.S.-based agency cited Japan's ballooning government debt and a
reluctance to reform its economy.
	   ``The rating actions were taken because of the uncertainties and
heightened risks over the long term arising from economic and
policy weaknesses that have led to significant deterioration in the
government's fiscal position and in the financial system,'' Moody's
said in a statement.
	   On the stock market, share prices opened higher but soon turned
into negative territory as the Moody's announcement seemed to
confirm already growing pessimism about Monday's economic stimulus
package.
	   Traders said that Tokyo has now spent 100 trillion yen (dlrs 820
billion) to kick-start Japan's economy since 1992 _ without
bringing an end to the country's slump.
	   ``Investors are thinking, the government has now poured over 100
trillion into economic stimulus efforts without much effect,'' said
Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo
Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section ended up 2.15 points, or 0.19 percent, to 1,107.65.
The TOPIX closed up 11.98 points, or 1.09 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.860 percent from Monday's finish of 0.850 percent,
driving its price down to 108.32 yen from 108.41 yen.

Police arrest students in bus rape case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police said Tuesday they had arrested
four technical college students who allegedly abducted two girls at
knife point from a crowded bus, then took them to a house and raped
them.
	   The bus passengers and driver said they were too frightened to
intervene in the abduction Saturday. Their non-interference has
drawn public criticism. The bus was reportedly holding about 100
people.
	   The victims, ages 14 and 18, told police that they were
threatened with death. Police said it was unclear if one of the
girls was actually raped on the bus, but both were sexually
assaulted later at a house on the Bangkok outskirts.
	   Police said that officers were alerted by a girl who is a friend
of one of victims. She escaped the attack by jumping out of the bus
when it halted at a stop.
	   The attack was quickly reported on a traffic radio program
asking Bangkok commuters to watch for the bus. But by the time the
vehicle was stopped, the suspects had already taken off with their
victims.
	   A fifth suspect is still being sought.

Hillary Clinton, Jacques Chirac visit storm-damaged nations

 &UR; By MICHELLE RAY ORTIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Promising that the United
States would help Central America not only survive Hurricane Mitch
but prosper, Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived with pledges of more
helicopters, more American troops, more food aid and more emergency
building supplies.
	   ``We are here to rebuild lives, rebuild communities, rebuild
this region,'' Mrs. Clinton said Monday evening after landing at
the Joint Task Force Eagle military base near El Salvador's
international airport.
	   Mrs. Clinton's arrival in El Salvador followed brief tours of
Honduras and Nicaragua _ the two countries worst-hit by Hurricane
Mitch. Central American officials say the storm in late October and
early November killed 10,000 people and left hundreds of thousands
homeless.
	   In Honduras, Mrs. Clinton announced the United States would
offer more than dlrs 250 million in aid _ double what it had
previously offered.
	   In El Salvador, she announced that the JTF Eagle base would
become the distribution hub for U.S. aid and that more than 560
servicemen would be based there.
	   ``We will not only be here for the short term to help you get
over the emergency, but we will be here as your friends and
partners as you rebuild and make it possible for this country to
have an even brighter future,'' she said.
	   Among her pledges:
	   _The United States will cancel two years of debt payments from
Honduras and Nicaragua _ about dlrs 54 million worth.
	   _It will add 16 helicopters to the 39 U.S. helicopters already
in the region and boost U.S. troop strength to 5,600 from 1,300.
	   _The United States will send dlrs 55 million in additional
military-based aid such as road building, medical detachments and
water purification, and dlrs 51 million more in food aid.
	   Mrs. Clinton praised the ``the great spirit'' of the Honduran
people ``who are willing to literally pull up their sleeves and dig
themselves out.''
	   The United States will convene an international conference Dec.
9 to lay out priorities for long-term rebuilding, said Brian
Atwood, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development.
	   Atwood said the conference will be followed later by a meeting
in which industrialized nations will be asked to pledge cash
assistance for rebuilding.
	   Central Americans also received pledges of support Monday from
French President Jacques Chirac, who visited Guatemala as well as
Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.
	   Chirac said France would forgive the debts of Guatemala and El
Salvador in addition to those of Nicaragua and Honduras, to help
those countries recover from Mitch. The total for the four
countries was dlrs 134 million.
	   Chirac also suggested creating a Central American reconstruction
fund, to be overseen by the World Bank, and said he would support
Nicaraguan efforts to get debt relief from international agencies.
	   Spain's Crown Prince Felipe de Borbon, meanwhile, flew to
Guatemala from El Salvador. He said his country had pledged dlrs
113 million in credit or donations to the affected nations.
	   The prince visited the site of a toppled bridge on the Lempa
River, 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of San Salvador, and visited a
school sheltering 211 refugees Monday.

<TEXT>
	   ANAHEIM, California (AP) _ Travis Green scored the second
shorthanded goal of his career, and rookie Johan Davidsson had his
first NHL goal Monday night as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks beat the
Los Angeles Kings 3-1.
	   Paul Kariya added an empty-net goal with 22 seconds remaining.
	   Olli Jokinen spoiled Anaheim goalie Guy Hebert's bid for a
second consecutive shutout when he scored on a power play with 3:46
left in the game.
	   Hebert, who had 24 saves in a 1-0 victory at Calgary on
Saturday, had gone 120 minutes without giving up a goal before
Jokinen beat him on a deflection for just the third Kings' power
play in their last 65 chances.
	   Hebert stopped 38 shots.
 &UR; Flames 5, Red Wings 3
	   In Calgary, Alberta, Derek Morris and Valeri Bure each scored
twice to lift the Calgary Flames over the struggling Detroit Red
Wings.
	   Calgary took a 4-1 lead early in the second period behind Bure
and Morris before the Red Wings made it close. Steve Dubinsky added
an empty-net goal to seal the win.
	   Steve Yzerman, Uwe Krupp and Sergei Fedorov scored for the Red
Wings, who have lost six of their last eight games.
	   The improving Flames, who finished a six-game homestand with a
3-3 record, thoroughly outplayed the two-time defending Stanley Cup
champions.

	   LUXOR, Egypt (AP) _ Fending off a scorching sun with dark
glasses and a straw hat, the Egyptian guide Sabri Bekheit recites
myriad events in the 3,400-year history of the Temple of
Hatshepsut.
	   It was dedicated to the queen herself, her father Pharaoh
Tutmosis I and the god Amun. The temple once used as a Coptic
Christian monastery and was first studied, in modern times, by
experts sent by Emperor Napoleon.
	   But Bekheit failed to mention one detail to his audience of
foreign tourists: Last November, a band of Muslim militants charged
into the temple and killed 58 foreigners, a massacre that kept the
site nearly empty for almost a year.
	   ``It was a disgrace. It wasn't part of the temple's history,''
Bekheit said during a break in the shadow of the temple portico's
giant columns.
	   No wonder Bekheit and others in Luxor would like to forget last
Nov. 17. Only now are the southern city and Egypt's all-important
tourist industry recovering from the massacre.
	   Hotel occupancy is creeping up in Egypt. Security forces are far
more in evidence at Luxor's ancient temples and at Cairo's Pyramids
and the city's storehouse of the past, the Egyptian Museum. And the
Islamic militants who pulled off the attack are, at least for now,
in disarray.
	   It has been a struggle to regain tourism. Government officials
and tourist executives estimate the Luxor attack cost Egyptian
tourism _ which once earned dlrs 3.7 billion annually _ about 50
percent of its revenues.
	   ``By any account, it was a catastrophe. I myself lost something
like 85 percent of my business,'' said Ilhamy el-Zayyat, head of
Egypt's Chamber of Tourism and owner of a major travel agency.
	   Egypt fought against its image as a dangerous place with a
campaign of publicity that stressed the country's ancient splendor,
modern hotels _ and safety. As a reminder of the Pyramids, it has
staged an opera, a concert and a tennis tournament there in recent
months.
	   The effort has paid off. In Luxor, hotels are at least half full
and flights to the city by national carrier EgyptAir are fully
booked.
	   Mohammed el-Deiry, director of archaeology in Luxor, said that
about 3,000 tourists now visit the city's ancient sites every day,
about 75 percent of the figure before the massacre. It's up from 18
percent just after the attack.
	   ``That's something nobody here expected to happen so soon,'' he
told The Associated Press. ``It must have something to do with the
glory of the place.''
	   Indeed, many tourists say Egypt's magnificent past is what
brought them to Luxor.
	   ``I love it. It is wonderful. ... Nowhere else have I felt
history like here,'' said Diane Coulter, of Fort Collins, Colorado.
	   ``Yes, at first I thought it is crazy to go to Egypt because
something might happen,'' said her companion Patrice Sullivan.
``But then I said I am taking my chance ... because life is like
that.''
	   As she spoke, police and plainclothes detectives with
sub-machine guns watched over the Hatshepsut Temple and mixed with
the crowd of tourists.
	   Egyptian authorities say their campaign against Islamic
militants _ raids, arrests and extradition of suspects abroad _ has
succeeded in stopping random attacks against government officials,
police and tourists.
	   Some leaders of Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic group,
which was behind the Luxor attack and much of the violence in a
six-year extremist war on the government, have declared a
unilateral cease-fire.
	   Others even signaled a more drastic change, abandoning violence
completely in favor of a political campaign to turn secular Egypt
into a strict Islamic state.
	   Still, more determined elements of al-Gamaa oppose a cease-fire.
And experts question whether the militants' timeout is not just a
chance to regroup. After all, the battle between secularism and
Islamic extremism has gone on for decades in Egypt.
	   And the reasons behind the militant campaign remain: zealotry
for an Islamic state and the poverty and lack of democracy that
give force to the militants' arguments.
	   Muntassar el-Zayyat, a lawyer who has defended radical Muslims
in court, says the battle could be renewed. ``I think police would
be overconfident if they believe the problem is over,'' he said.

Popov looks forward to forgetting Atlanta
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Russian swimming great Alexander Popov
made his distaste of rival Gary Hall Jnr. obvious at the Atlanta
Olympics when the American stood poolside, shadow boxing to the USA
chants.
	   What wasn't so obvious was Popov's hatred of America's hosting
of the games, with Hall Jnr. just another flaw in the whole
blighted experience.
	   Popov left Atlanta with gold medals in the 50- and 100-meter
double, to repeat his feat from the Barcelona Olympics. In Sydney
2000 he wants to enjoy himself as well.
	   ``It was like a U.S. Open championships with some foreigners,''
Popov said of Atlanta on Tuesday. ``The way the games was set up
wasn't very nice and we felt that straight from the airport.''
	   Popov said he was in Europe after the event and met Canadian
100-meter sprint world record holder Donovan Bailey. ``We agreed it
was tough for everyone,'' said Popov.
	   He was one of the many athletes, spectators and reporters who
experienced the poor organization first hand.
	   ``When we arrived we were made to sit in the sun for 4-1/2
hours. It was amazing,'' Popov said.
	   Popov has since been voted onto the International Olympic
Committee's athletes' commission and will ``stick my nose in every
corner'' in his minor role.
	   He lives and trains in Australia, although proudly maintaining
his Russian citizenship, and believes competing in Sydney will be
vast improvement on Atlanta, regardless of his input.
	   ``In America they would hear my accent and they wouldn't even
listen to me,'' Popov said. ``Australians will listen, it's totally
different.'' The 2000 games will be ``as good as a Sydney New Year
celebration, only for two weeks.''
	   Popov is more forthcoming about Atlanta's flaws than his own
chances of winning the sprint double for the third successive
Olympics.
	   He has famously recovered from being stabbed by a Moscow
watermelon vendor just after the Atlanta Games and has shown he can
still mix it with the best, winning the Goodwill Games title this
year.
	   Fully recovered, the stabbing is no longer something that Popov
will use to excuse poor performance.
	   ``My soul wasn't damaged, my brain wasn't damaged, only my body
was damaged _ they stitch you up and on you go,'' Popov said.
	   Popov plays down the rivalry with Hall Jnr, who has served a
suspension for testing positive to marijuana this year and who,
according to world governing body FINA, was caught but not punished
for a similar offense at Atlanta.
	   He blames the media for tension between them but maybe it's like
he says, and his accent stops people from getting his point.
	   ``Gary probably is a very unfortunate athlete. He's been trying
to get a gold medal so many times and I'm probably the asshole that
stopped him,'' Popov said.
	   On the drug charges Popov ``was surprised he wasn't caught
before.''
	   ``I didn't see him doing that but I heard a couple of stories
that he was smoking marijuana,'' he added.
	   Maybe his accent just gives him the protection to say what he
wants.

Environmental agency orders mercury testing of power plant
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By H. JOSEF HEBERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ It won't be long before people around the
United States learn how much mercury is coming out of the
smokestacks of their local power plant.
	   The Environmental Protection Agency has directed utilities to
test how much mercury goes into the air through their plants'
smokestacks. Mercury is a toxic substance that can cause brain
damage.
	   The EPA said Monday that the information from more than 1,400
coal-burning power plants around the country will be gathered by
the agency and made available to the public, beginning in 2000. The
testing must begin in January.
	   Coal-burning power plants account for a third of the 865 pounds
of mercury released into the environment each year in the United
States. No mercury is emitted by other power plants such as nuclear
or those using natural gas.
	   ``For too long, electric power plants not only have polluted the
air with mercury, but they have kept their polluting actions a
secret from the public,'' said David G. Hawkins, an attorney for
the Natural Resources Defense Council.
	   The NRDC filed a lawsuit demanding that the EPA regulate mercury
from power plants. Congress earlier this year directed the EPA to
hold off on regulating utilities for mercury missions until further
studies can be completed on how to reduce mercury releases.
	   A naturally occurring metal, mercury is a persistent pollutant
that accumulates in fish and becomes more concentrated as it moves
up the food chain. In humans, the neurotoxin slows fetal and child
development and causes irreversible brain damage.
	   Mercury is released into the air from coal-burning power plants
as well as from waste incinerators that burn products containing
mercury. It then travels through the air, eventually falling into
lakes and streams to contaminate fish. Forty states currently have
fish advisories in some of their waters because of mercury
contamination.
	   Separately, the EPA on Monday unveiled a long-term plan to deal
with mercury contamination from all sources. The plan calls for
emission standards for municipal, hospital and industrial waste
incinerators as well as programs designed to reduce the amount of
mercury in the waste stream, so less is burned.

Police investigate Marine over alleged drunk-driving accident

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police in southwestern Japan said Tuesday they are
investigating a U.S. Marine on suspicion that he ran over a
Japanese woman while driving under the influence of alcohol.
	   Under investigation is Cpl. Gregg A. Johnson, 20, stationed at
U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, said a spokesman for the
Yamaguchi prefectural, or state, police, on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The spokesman said that police did not arrest Johnson as there
was no fear he would try to run away. Johnson's hometown was not
immediately available, the spokesman said.
	   According to an initial investigation, Johnson allegedly ran
over a 59-year-old Japanese woman who was walking in front of his
passenger car on a street in Iwakuni early Saturday morning.
Johnson was found to have been driving while under the influence of
alcohol at the time of the accident, the spokesman said.
	   The woman, whose name was withheld by police, suffered a broken
left leg in the accident and will need one month to recover, the
spokesman said.
	   Iwakuni, in Yamaguchi prefecture, is 722 kilometers (448 miles),
southwest of Tokyo.
	   Earlier this month, a U.S. Marine corporal was fined 150,000 yen
(dlrs 1,250) for a hit-and-run accident last month on Okinawa that
left a Japanese man with minor injuries.
	   In a separate accident on Okinawa in October in which an
18-year-old Japanese woman was killed, U.S. Marine Cpl. Randall M.
Eskridge, 23, of LaPorte, Ind., has been charged with hit-and-run
and drunken driving.
	   There are currently 47,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in
Japan under mutual security arrangements with the United States.

	   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's top
corruption fighter collapsed and was in stable condition in a
hospital Tuesday.
	   Judge Willem Heath, who heads the Special Investigation Unit
into government corruption, suffered internal bleeding Monday,
South African Press Association reported. The nature of his ailment
was not immediately disclosed.
	   The unit has launched a series of probes into the country's
near-endemic corruption.
	   On Tuesday, he was due to meet top officials of the finance and
health ministries over his latest high-profile probe. His office
launched a civil case against the health minister, Dr. Nkosazana
Zuma, and other officials over a costly musical, Sarafina II, to
raise awareness about AIDS.
	   Investigators say there were irregularities in bidding for the
musical, and critics allege millions of rand were squandered on the
show.
	   Heath was in a hospital in this Indian Ocean port.

Sharif wants Afghan Taliban-like justice system in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
has said he wants his country's justice system to be like that of
the hard-line Taliban Islamic militia in neighboring Afghanistan, a
Pakistani newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   ``Today in Afghanistan, crime has virtually stopped,'' Sharif
said in remarks reported by the leading English language daily The
News.
	   ``I have heard that one can safely drive a vehicle full of gold
at midnight without fear. I want this kind of system in Pakistan,''
Sharif said in Urdu at a meeting in Mohmand Agency, a remote tribal
area 45 kilometers (28 miles) from Peshawar _ the capital of North
West Frontier Province.
	   Under Taliban rules women may not study or work outside their
houses, and all kinds of light entertainment including music are
banned. Men must grow beards of a certain length and criminals are
subjected to amputations and public executions.
	   Sharif said public punishments of criminals are necessary to end
crime.
	   Sharif introduced a controversial constitutional amendment in
August to scrap any remaining British laws in Pakistan and replace
them with laws based on the Muslim holy book, the Koran. Pakistani
laws are currently a mixture of Islamic law and British law.
	   Opposition parties, human rights groups and non-Muslim
minorities bitterly oppose the amendment, saying it will undermine
the constitution and damage institutions.
	   The amendment would give the government sweeping powers
including that of obliging people to pray five times a day and
``prescribe what is right and to forbid what is wrong.''
	   Muslims and non Muslims would have to give tithings to the
government which would be distributed amont the poor. The amounts,
while not decided, are often around 2.5 percent per year of savings
and jewelry. Sharif has not yet explained how much, if anything,
non-Muslims would have to pay.
	   The National Assembly (lower house), where Sharif enjoys
absolute majority, passed the amendment in September. Now the
amendment waits for an approval from the Senate (upper house)
before it can become law.
	   But Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League does not enjoy a two-third
majority in the Senate, so it is uncertain if the amendment will
pass, despite Sharif's lobbying of religious leaders and militant
Muslim organization to built pressure on senators.
	   Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in a statement Tuesday said
Sharif is ``exploiting the sacred name of Islam to subvert the
constitution'' and the ideals of the country's founders who wanted
a pluralistic, liberal and democratic society.
	   ``(Sharif) regime is bent upon turning Pakistan into an
authoritarian, theocratic and unitary rouge state poised against
the people,'' said Ms. Bhutto.
	   But Sharif says the enforcement of Islamic laws will provide
speedy justice to the people and end exploitation.

Rock carving theft dismays Aborigines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Thieves have stolen an Aboriginal
rock carving believed to be 3000 year olds from a remote site on
the coast of Tasmania.
	   The 45-centimeter (17-inch) artwork, chiseled out of a rock
face, disappeared from a secret place last week.
	   Legal manager of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Center, Michael
Mansell, said local Aborigines were ``absolutely dismayed'' by the
desecration.
	   ``The carving is our most direct link to the souls of our
ancestors,'' Mansell said Tuesday. ``It represents the whole soul
of the people who created it. We cannot reproduce that now. It has
gone.''
	   The theft was identified by a Parks and Wildlife Department
ranger last week.
	   Director of the department, Max Kitchell, said it seemed the
thieves knew what they were doing and had taken some care to remove
the rock intact.
	   ``It was quite a feat which would have taken quite some time to
do,'' Kitchell said Tuesday.
	   He said location of the carving was not widely known and
Kitchell said it was unlikely the thieves had just happened upon
it.
	   ``It is one of the most important Aboriginal features in
Tasmania and indeed Australia,'' Kitchell said.
	   The carving, comprising concentric circles, was once part of a
series of artworks that covered many kilometers (miles) of the
northwest coast, Mansell said.
	   This art comprised the totems of the area's inhabitants, the
boundaries of their land, their ceremonial and camping grounds and
the walking tracks between them.
	   Southern Aborigines visiting the area to collect mutton bird
eggs would read the art to understand who owned the land and their
own obligations in return for traveling across it.
	   ``It was not just nice art,'' Mansell said. ``This is the only
cultural form which tells us about the heart and soul of our
ancestors.''
	   Mansell said it appeared to be an organized theft rather than
vandalism.
	   Art dealers, meanwhile, said the thieves would have trouble
selling the rare piece.
	   ``It is illegal to sell it in Australia, illegal to export it
out of Australia,'' said Tim Klingender, director of Aboriginal art
for Sotheby's Australia.

Kurdish protesters set themselves on fire outside parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Kurdish protesters set themselves on fire
outside the Russian parliament building Tuesday after protests in
support of a Kurdish rebel leader who was arrested last week in
Rome, police said.
	   The two men splashed themselves with a flammable liquid and then
set it ablaze outside the Duma building in the heart of Moscow.
Police managed to extinguish the flames and the two men were
hospitalized with burns, officials said.
	   The protest came as about 100 Kurdish residents of Moscow
continued a hunger strike for a fourth day to protest what they
claim is an international conspiracy against Abdullah Ocalan, who
leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.
	   The PKK has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey, where
it has been outlawed. Some 37,000 people have been killed in the
14-year-old conflict.
	   Ocalan was arrested Thursday in Rome on a Turkish warrant after
stepping off a plane from Moscow, where he had fled after being
forced out of Syria. Russia denied him asylum; Italy has still not
decided whether to grant him refuge.
	   Ocalan is on trial in absentia in Turkey on charges of leading a
terrorist organization, threatening the country's territorial
integrity and ordering killings. The charges can bring the death
penalty.

Workers protest over unpaid wages in central Chinese city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ More than 200 workers protested and blocked
traffic in the central Chinese city of Changsha, saying they had
not been paid for more than six months, a local police official
said Tuesday.
	   The workers, from the Laite'er Co., held up placards reading,
``We don't demand fish or meat, just some rice porridge'' and ``Not
a cent in six months; we want rice to eat.'' They demonstrated for
more than two hours Monday demanding government help, the
policewoman confirmed, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   She said that she had been sent, along with dozens of other
police, with orders to help keep traffic moving and observe the
protest, but not to intervene.
	   The protesters disbanded after the city government told them it
would consider their appeal and respond within two days, she said.
There were no injuries and no arrests.
	   A report by the New York-based group Human Rights in China said
Laite'er Co. is affiliated with the police department. At least 70
percent of its work force had been left with nothing to do after
the company reorganized and sold off most of its workshops. The
report did not give the company's main line of business.
	   Worker protests have become common in China in recent years as
bankrupt state-owned enterprises struggle to pay their work forces.
Despite government suppression of dissent, police have generally
sought to defuse such demonstrations peacefully by arbitrating
between workers and their employers.
	   Meanwhile, a dissident in the eastern province of Shandong said
he was seeking permission to stage a protest near Beijing's
Tiananmen Square, site of 1989 pro-democracy protests, to appeal
for help against harassment by local authorities.
	   Xie Wanjun was detained in September and held for 15 days for
attempting to file an application with the authorities to set up an
opposition group, the China Democracy Party.
	   After his release, Xie said he was ordered to leave his home by
Nov. 1, his wife was fired from her job and his electricity and
telephone were cut off.
	   A Beijing-based dissident announced Tuesday that he planned to
stage ``campaign activities'' on Nov. 23 outside the chemical
equipment factory where he worked, defying the authorities' refusal
to allow him to run for a seat in the city legislature.
	   Wang Zhixin is one of three dissidents who announced in
September their candidacies for the legislature and were told by
police they would not be allowed to run.

APEC summit begins in Malaysia amid deep discord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with APEC meetings beginning, Gore and
Mahathir avoiding each other, Malaysian government again condemning
Gore's speech sympathizing with the reform movement.
 &UR; AP Photos APEC101-119

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim leaders tried on
Tuesday to set aside a diplomatic furor set off by the United
States and to concentrate on Asia's economic crisis during their
annual free-trade summit.
	   But U.S. Vice President Al Gore's decision to sympathize with
the anti-government reform movement in Malaysia, the host country,
in a speech the night before the summit began appeared to leave
deep divisions among some of the 21 leaders.
	   In fact, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, the third
Malaysian official to condemn Gore since the speech, said it could
put the very heart of the Asian country's democracy at risk.
	   ``The action by the U.S. patently is not to advance the cause of
democracy and the rule of law, but to serve its own narrow
political agenda,'' Abdullah said.
	   Before the first meeting of the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit began, Gore and Mathahir briefly shook hands as
the prime minister greeted leaders in the Grand Salon of the lavish
Palace of the Golden Horses hotel.
	   But Gore and Mahathir quickly separated to talk with the other
presidents and prime ministers, as they gathered at the foot of a
massive revolving statue of rearing horses.
	   When the 21 leaders stood together for a photograph in the lush
garden with palm trees outside the hotel, Canada's prime minister,
Jean Chretien, stood on one side of Mahathir, and Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley of New Zealand on the other.
	   Gore stood at the far right end of the group in the pre-arranged
lineup.
	   The leaders then walked around a beautiful manmade lagoon built
on an abandoned tin mine, with Gore a few steps behind Mahathir.
Gore and Philippine President Joseph Estrada strolled together,
laughing and chatting.
	   Estrada was the only Pacific Rim leader on Tuesday to defend
Gore's comments on Malaysia's political reform movement.
	   None of the leaders appeared to talk about Gore's speech, or
Malaysia's anger over the fact that other top APEC officials had
gone out of their way to meet and sympathize with the de facto
leader of the country's protest movement, Azizah Ismail.
	   Earlier in the day, other Asian countries joined Mahathir in
criticizing Gore for making this the first of the six APEC summits
to ever focus on the internal affairs of a member country, or
subjects such as human rights.
	   But Gore defended his speech Monday night to Asian leaders and
businessmen in Kuala Lumpur, saying that nations fighting off
economic crises must work as hard to promote democracy.
	   ``My point is very simple: these economies have some very
difficult choices to make for reform to move forward,'' Gore told
reporters just as he began a bilateral meeting with Russian Prime
Minister Yergency Primakov. ``Democracy and freedom are the
essential prerequisites for making those kinds of decisions and
getting that kind of support.''
	   Gore's speech on the eve of the summit was mostly devoted to the
Asian economic crisis, which began 17 months ago. It has decimated
Asian economies, spread to Russia and Brazil and led to turbulence
on the U.S. and European stock markets.
	   Gore announced a new dlrs 10 billion support package for the
stalled economies of the hard-hit Asian region. Half the money will
come from the United States and the other half from Japan, the
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   In a slap at the United States, New Zealand's prime minister,
Jenny Shipley, said Tuesday: ``It's not New Zealand's style to do a
megaphone diplomacy. ... It's critical that bilateral issues do not
get confused with APEC.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton had planned to attend the APEC
summit, but he sent Gore in his place while holding emergency
meetings in Washington about the U.S.-Iraqi standoff.
	   In the end, Clinton canceled an expected military attack on Iraq
for expelling U.N. weapons inspectors. Clinton still plans to
complete the last part of the planned Asian trip, including stops
later this week in Japan and South Korea.
	   Mahathir, who has been in power 17 years, is now Asia's longest
serving ruler after violent protests in neighboring Indonesia ended
President Suharto's 32-year rule in May.
	   Malaysia's protest movement exploded two months ago after
Mahathir fired and then jailed his former protege and now political
rival, former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Anwar was charged with corruption and sexual misconduct _
allegations he says are false and politically motivated.
	   Anwar's trial has been suspended during the APEC summit, but
officials from the United States, Canada, Australia and the
Philippines have met with Azizah, Anwar's wife, over the last few
days to voice their support.
	   They also have expressed concern over reports that Anwar was
beaten in prison and over whether his trial would be fair. This has
delighted Azizah and infuriated the Malaysian government.
	   Two protests, one involving thousands of pro-Anwar supporters,
have occurred since the APEC meetings began last week, one turning
violent. But no big protests have occurred this week.
	   On Tuesday, Malaysia's education minister, Najib Tun Razak, said
he was outraged by the American vice president.
	   ``We reject Al Gore's speech,'' he told reporters. ``This is
clearly meddling in our internal affairs, which we find an
absolutely intolerable state of behavior and unbecoming of a leader
of the United States.''
	   Several other APEC officials also seemed unhappy.
	   ``In APEC, we should concentrate on APEC matters. We should
leave the domestic matters alone,'' said Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's
prime minister.
	   Thailand's foreign minister, Surin Pitsuwan, said: ``You have to
be very, very careful toward each other's feelings. We are here to
solve the (economic) problem and compare notes.''

South Korean women's gymnastics team withdrawn from Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's women's artistic
gymnastics team was withdrawn Tuesday from next month's Asian Games
in Thailand after four of its six members failed doping tests.
	   An official of the Korea Gymnastics Association said three of
the team's coaches also were fired for failing to properly
supervise the athletes.
	   ``We feel that we need to show our strong will against athletes
using banned drugs,'' the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   He said six male artistic gymnasts and four female rhythmic
gymnasts will compete in the games as planned.
	   Earlier this month, a female swimmer was banned from the games.
She and the four gymnasts tested positive for furosemide, a banned
diuretic that promotes weight loss.
	   All five will be suspended for two years, officials said.

Schroeder: No additional German aid for Moscow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schroeder's meeting with parliament speaker in
new grafs 9-10. &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS RIETIG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called the
Russian government's economic rescue plan a ``good start,'' but
indicated Germany would provide little more than moral support in
Russia's latest economic struggle.
	   Schroeder, on his first visit to Russia as German leader, meets
Tuesday with President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin. Several
executives from key German banks and other companies involved in
Russia accompanied Schroeder.
	   Schroeder's predecessor, Helmut Kohl, had close ties with
Yeltsin, which helped secure significant German investment and aid
but also drew criticism from those who blame Yeltsin for many of
Russia's problems.
	   Schroeder insisted Monday that the relationship between Germany
and Russia must not rely too much on personal ties.
	   After meeting with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Monday,
Schroeder said Germany will not give Russia any emergency financial
aid outside the money it's providing through international lenders.
	   ``The possibilities are exhausted'' for additional German aid,
Schroeder said _ though he did bring 1.5 tons (1.65 short tons) of
medical aid with him, German officials said.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government desperately needs foreign
aid to pay off its huge debts, but the IMF and other international
lenders have stopped releasing loans, saying they want Moscow to
start implementing a sound economic plan first.
	   Schroeder called Russia's economic rescue plan, presented this
weekend, a ``good start'' toward convincing international lenders
to resume aid. He stopped short of saying Germany would recommend
that the IMF release the money.
	   Speaking after a meeting early Tuesday with Gennady Seleznyov,
the speaker of the Russian parliament's lower house, Schroeder
again said the government's blueprint was a ``good basis'' for
talks on more aid, but added that Russia must make it more concrete
to meet the IMF demands.
	   The IMF has criticized the latest government plan as too vague
and overloaded with state controls of the economy. Schroeder urged
the Russian Cabinet and the parliament to ``find answers to the IMF
questions.''
	   Germany is a key member of the IMF, the World Bank and the
European Union, all of which have provided aid to Russia.
	   Schroeder and Primakov pledged that Russian-German relations
would continue to flourish.
	   ``We realize Germany's standing in Europe and the world and
retrospectively view the path it has traveled since the end of
World War II to its current prosperity,'' Primakov said.
``Naturally, we would like to learn more about your experience.''
	   Primakov also said Russia was eager to attract foreign capital
and would guarantee investor security.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who met with Schroeder on
Monday, shrugged off the influx of German money that has made
Germany Russia's most important trading partner outside the former
Soviet Union.
	   ``The relations between former Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin were a mere camaraderie. Now I am
counting on good business contacts and mutual understanding,''
Zyuganov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

Indonesian economy could be hurt if riots continue: IMF official
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Continued political unrest in
Indonesia could harm the country's shaky economy, the International
Monetary Fund's top Asia Pacific official said Tuesday.
	   But there is still ``significant scope'' for the currency, the
rupiah, to strengthen despite the unrest, said Hubert Neiss.
	   ``We have to see if the (political) uncertainty continues for a
while,'' Neiss told Dow Jones Newswires. In that case, ``it will
affect expectations and may have an unfavorable impact (on economic
recovery).''
	   Neiss, who was to leave Jakarta Tuesday after conducting the
latest monthly review of the IMF-led bailout program for Indonesia,
was speaking days after deadly riots and protests shook the
Indonesian capital.
	   At least 16 people, including eight students, were killed last
week in violence in Jakarta that recalled the tumult six months ago
that led to the ouster of authoritarian leader Suharto after three
decades in power.
	   ``To me personally, the main damage of the last few days has
been the loss of life and the reduction of confidence,'' Neiss
said.
	   The impact on the rupiah will depend on how long investors see
the unrest continuing.
	   ``If they think it's the beginning of a prolonged period of
instability, then it would affect the exchange rate and capital
would flow out,'' Neiss said.
	   If the unrest proves temporary, Indonesia's improved economic
performance should help the currency, he said.
	   ``On the economic side, all things point to further
strengthening (of the rupiah),'' Neiss said.
	   He noted that inflation has been falling rapidly, the current
account surplus is substantial, official aid is flowing in and the
budgetary situation has improved markedly.
	   He praised the country's compliance with its IMF program.
	   ``Indonesia's economic performance has been exemplary,'' Neiss
said. ``By now, it has sunk in that economic policy is firmly on
track.''
	   After the latest review, the IMF executive board is due to
release the next tranche _ worth around U.S. dlrs 1 billion _ of
its aid to Indonesia on Dec. 2.
	   The fund is providing U.S. dlrs 11.3 billion of a total bailout
package worth U.S. dlrs 43 billion assembled last year for
Indonesia.
	   The IMF was repeatedly frustrated by Suharto's refusal to stick
to reforms agreed with the fund. Indonesia began to implement the
IMF program properly only after Suharto protege B.J. Habibie took
power and negotiated a revised program with the IMF in June, Neiss
said.
	   He said there were indications that ``some time next year,'' the
country would see economic growth, although he stressed that this
wouldn't likely be reflected in the gross domestic product figure,
given the massive contraction in growth this year. Neiss said 1999
gross domestic product ``could be slightly negative.''
	   The IMF expects the Indonesian economy to contract by up to 15
percent this year, while annual inflation is expected to reach 80
percent.

Optus shares take off on first day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Shares in Australia's Cable and
Wireless Optus Ltd. began trading on the Australian Stock Exchange
Tuesday with a healthy return to institutional and retail
investors.
	   The shares closed at 2.65 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.69),
representing more than a 20 percent premium to the 2.15 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.37) that institutions paid in a global
offering of the stock.
	   Optus opened at 2.61 Australian dollars (dlrs 1.67) and peaked
at 2.74 Australian dollars (dlrs 1.75).
	   After the official close, some post-market trades took the total
volume for the day to 305.6 million shares. That was more than
Telstra, Optus' major competitor, traded on its first day on the
stock exchange last November.
	   C and W Optus chief executive Chris Anderson said he knew the
company would overcome the doubters and make a healthy debut in its
long-awaited float.
	   ``I knew we'd pull it off and get it to this stage,'' Anderson
said.
	   Retail investors and Mayne Nickless Ltd. shareholders who
participated in that company's entitlement offer of a 25 percent
stake in C and W Optus are sitting on even larger gains after
paying 1.85 Australian dollars (dlrs 1.18) for their shares.
	   Based on the initial listing price, C and W Optus is capitalized
at more than 9 billion Australian dollars (dlrs 5.8 billion),
comfortably ranking it among the 15 largest domestic companies
traded on the Australian Stock Exchange.
	   C and W Optus, Australia's second-largest telecommunications
company, is owned 52.8 percent by Cable and Wireless PLC of
Britain.

Report: Suharto owns plantation land in eastern province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with details of further land assets &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Officials investigating the wealth of
Indonesia's former President Suharto and his family have discovered
land and other assets worth about 122.4 billion rupiah (dlrs 16
million) on the island of Sumatra, the government said Tuesday.
	   Lands Minister Hasan Basri Durin said the National Lands Board
found the assets in the form of shares, land, banking and other
industries as well as a television receiving station in the
province of Jambi, 500 miles (800 kilometers) northwest of Jakarta,
the official Antara news agency reported.
	   Local officials said earlier Monday they had found that
thousands of hectares (acres) of land in the eastern province of
Irian Jaya were also in the hands of the Suharto family.
	   Many Indonesians believe that during his 32-year rule, Suharto
and his children amassed riches through government contracts and
siphoned off wealth from projects and state-owned corporations.
	   Suharto was forced to quit in May amid riots and protests, and
his successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised investigations
of the business dealings of associates of the former leader.
	   The attorney general's office is investigating the wealth of
Suharto, who has denied corruption or stashing cash overseas. His
denials have been greeted with disbelief by many Indonesians
struggling with the nation's worst economic crisis in three
decades.
	   Durin said Monday that the government would move to seize the
assets in Sumatra.
	   ``We will confiscate the lands for the state and (will be)
trying to cancel the status title of the lands,'' Durin was quoted
by Antara as saying.
	   In Irian Jaya, the head of the public prosecutors' office said
the Suharto family owned land through at least five companies
operating in the province in the plantation, fisheries and
industrial sectors.
	   Further investigations in the province would include examination
of Suharto associates, Antara quoted T.H. Sidabutar as saying.
	   Associates of the former president are believed to have money
invested in contracting companies serving PT Freeport Indonesia,
one of the world's largest gold and copper mining companies, Antara
reported.
	   A Suharto supporter, Bob Hasan, holds a virtual monopoly on the
supply of food and other essentials for employees at the mine, the
agency said.
	   Supplies to PT Freeport Indonesia employees were previously
handled by Irian Jayans or were imported from Australia, Sidabutar
said.

Tiny Maldives dreams of ``even one victory'' at Bangkok
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Two ships brought in tons of sand. Two
more ferried turf.
	   ``Our dream came true. We had a perfect soccer field'' thanks to
the shipments from neighboring India a year ago, said Ahmed Shahir,
manager of the Maldives soccer team taking part in the Bangkok
Asian Games.
	   For years, players waited for low tide so they could have some
place on the beach to play soccer in this Indian Ocean republic, a
chain of hundreds of coral islands, some no bigger than a soccer
field.
	   ``Now that we have a good stadium and we are working hard we
hope for a modest success at the Asian Games,'' Shahir said in an
interview in Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka, a short hop from the
Maldivian capital, Male (pronounced MA-lay). In Sri Lanka, the team
was warming up for the December Asian Games with a tournament in
which India and Malaysia were also taking part.
	   The team scored 0-17 against even lowly placed Iran in the World
Cup qualifier earlier this year. Stung by the defeat, the
government began a 12-year training program involving boys under 12
years of age.
	   Former Uzbekistan player, Solokho Vyacheslay, signed up as coach
of the national team.
	   Vyacheslay says one of his main problems is getting players to
eat more protein and less starchy carbohydrates. Rice is a staple
here.
	   ``I look at their plates and there is the heap of rice,'' he
said.
	   Maldives is grouped with Qatar, Brunei and Tadzhikistan during
the December Asian Games.
	   ``As a coach I would like to see us reaching the final. But to
be honest, even one victory is fine with me.''

Three foreigners arrested in job recruitment for fictitious
</HEADLINE>
country &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Malaysian, a Briton and an
Australian have been arrested after they were discovered recruiting
other foreigners for jobs in a non-existent nation, Philippine
authorities reported Tuesday.
	   The three men allegedly are leaders of a syndicate that has
victimized hundreds of Bangladeshis and Chinese whom they charged
dlrs 3,500 in ``processing fees'' for ``high-paying'' jobs in the
Dominion of Melchizedek, a fictitious country said to be in the
South Pacific.
	   Immigration agents arrested Chew Chin Yee, a Malaysian said to
be the ``dominion's'' public works minister; ``chief justice''
Stuart Ronald Mason-Parker, a Briton; and Dennis Oakley, an
Australian and minister of the navy and coast guard.
	   Immigration agents said documents taken from the three men
included application forms for dominion passports and citizenship.
	   Ramond Salting, a spokesman for the Bureau of Immigration, said
Chew was arrested in a hotel in Olongapo City, west of Manila, and
the two others in a house in the same city last Thursday.
	   Chew was detained along with three Bangladeshis who came to the
Philippines as tourists applying for work in the fictitious
country, Salting said.
	   The dominion allegedly was founded by David Korem, an American,
and its current president allegedly is John Patrick Gillespe, an
Australian.
	   Salting said the Chew, Parker, Oakley and the three Bangladeshis
will be deported.
	   He said the arrests were not made public immediately so that
Korem and Gillespe would not be warned, but the two men apparently
escaped.
	   Salting did not give details on how immigration agents
discovered the group.
	   In the Old Testament, Melchizedek was a model priest to whom
Abraham and others had paid tithes.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors arrived in Iraq on
Tuesday and said they want to get back to work as soon as possible
to test Iraq's pledge to cooperate in the search for its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Their plane landed at the Iraqi military air base at Habaniya
outside Baghdad just a little after 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT).
	   ``The Iraqi authorities have promised cooperation. Obviously the
next few days are going to be very important,'' said Caroline
Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
arms inspections.
	   She spoke as 86 inspectors from UNSCOM and the International
Atomic Energy Agency left their hotel in the Gulf state of Bahrain,
where they were evacuated last week, for the flight back to
Baghdad.

Army officer and escort killed in Hutu rebel ambush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ In an uncommon attack on a military
target, Hutu rebels ambushed and killed a Rwandan army officer and
his escort in northwestern Rwanda, officials and relief sources
said Tuesday.
	   Details were sketchy, but Rwandan officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said rebels fired a rocket-propelled
grenade at an army pick-up truck Friday near Gatonde, 60 kilometers
(35 miles) northwest of Kigali.
	   A captain and his escort were killed, officials said. They said
the officer was buried Saturday at the Kanombe military cemetery
outside Kigali.
	   Rebel attacks on army convoys and other targets are rare. The
rebels, former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible for the
1994 slaughter of more than 500,000 people, most of them minority
Tutsis, have been targeting schools, hospitals and commerical road
traffic and killing Hutu and Tutsi civilians alike.
	   Most of the attacks take place in mountainous northwestern
Rwanda where the rebels have been crossing back and forth from
neighboring Congo.
	   In a major blow to the insurgents _ who rely on family and
friends inside Rwanda for food, shelter and money _ since August
some 400,000 people, most of them Hutus, have left their hillside
homes and sought protection from the army, joining others already
displaced by attacks and fighting.
	   They say they grew tired of rebel extortion, killing and
intimidation.
	   Authorities say 650,000 people are now living in makeshift camps
near the regional capital, Ruhengeri, until security is restored.
	   The Rwandan Patriotic Army, that grew out of the Tutsi-led
Rwandan Patriotic Front, was originally comprised mostly of Tutsi
exiles from neighboring countries who took power in July 1994 and
stopped the genocide.
	   Since then, the 35,000-strong force has incorporated at least
10,000 soldiers and officers from the former Hutu-dominated Rwandan
Armed Forces.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors arrived in Iraq on
Tuesday and said they want to get back to work as soon as possible
to test Iraq's pledge to cooperate in the search for its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Their plane landed at the Iraqi military air base at Habaniya
outside Baghdad just a little after 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT).
	   ``The Iraqi authorities have promised cooperation. Obviously the
next few days are going to be very important,'' said Caroline
Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
arms inspections.
	   She spoke as 86 inspectors from UNSCOM and the International
Atomic Energy Agency left their hotel in the Gulf state of Bahrain,
where they were evacuated last week, for the flight back to
Baghdad.

U.N. team offered full support in prosecuting Khmer Rouge

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen has
promised a team of U.N. legal experts full cooperation in any
effort to apprehend Khmer Rouge leaders and bring them before an
international tribunal, the U.N. team said Tuesday.
	   Sir Ninian Stephen, a member of the team that arrived over the
weekend to begin assessing evidence against the Khmer Rouge, said
that Hun Sen expressed no desire to limit the scope of legal
action.
	   Perhaps significantly, Hun Sen did not suggest protection for
Ieng Sary, a deputy prime minister in the genocidal regime blamed
for the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians between 1975 and
1979.
	   Ieng Sary received a royal pardon in 1996 in exchange for
leading thousands of Khmer Rouge guerrillas out of festering civil
war, breaking the movement.
	   Ieng Sary acknowledges government authority but presides over a
gem-rich area on the Thai-Cambodian border like a feudal lord.
Several other Khmer Rouge officials have been integrated into the
Phnom Penh establishment.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk, who lost several family members under the
Khmer Rouge regime and particularly loathes Ieng Sary, has said the
pardon does not cover efforts to bring him before an international
tribunal.
	   Stephen, a former governor-general of Australia, said Hun Sen
pledged his ``full cooperation'' but ``was very hesitant to say
anything specific.''
	   Hun Sen has just had his leadership strengthened after reaching
a deal with his chief political rivals that he would head a new
coalition government as sole prime minister.
	   Part of the three-member legal team's mission includes assessing
how surviving rebel leaders could be apprehended.
	   The longtime supreme leader of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, died of
an apparent heart attack in April. He had been deposed as head of
the group last year.
	   A trio of important leaders _ Ta Mok, Nuon Chea and Khieu
Samphan _ are still at large with a dwindling number of armed
supporters in the rugged mountains of the Thai-Cambodian border.
	   The rebels long enjoyed a close relationship with Thai military
units. Stephen said his team would visit Bangkok after leaving
Cambodia to discuss a tribunal for the Khmer Rouge with the Thai
government.
	   ``Certainly an important aspect of the discussion we will have
is to the extent that Thailand is a haven, and to the extent that
Thailand can cease being a haven,'' Stephen said.
	   The team also has made contact with Chinese diplomats at the
United Nations. China was long a chief supporter of the Khmer
Rouge, and there are concerns China would use its Security Council
veto to stop a U.N. tribunal from forming.
	   The U.N. team has met with researchers of the Khmer Rouge period
and been given documents said to implicate several leaders in the
creation of a torture center in a Phnom Penh high school.
	   Team member Steven Ratner, who co-authored a U.S. State
Department report on Khmer Rouge crimes, said that a ``preliminary
review'' of the evidence indicated that crimes punishable by
international law were committed.
	   The team expects to present its conclusions by early next year.

Offer of fresh elections fails to relieve political pressure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina's offer to hold elections a year early, in 2000, has failed
to impress opponents who want her to step down immediately.
	   The Jamaat-e-Islami Party submitted a memorandum to the speaker
of parliament Monday repeating demands for new elections to be held
immediately.
	   Former prime minister and main opposition leader Khaleda Zia of
the Bangladesh Nationalist Party also has been demanding the
government's resignation for some time, and Monday rejected
overtures Hasina had made over the weekend.
	   Hasina, who took office in 1996 for a five-year term,
volunteered to call fresh polls in 2000 during a speech to
newspaper editors on Saturday. She also announced a unilateral
moratorium on political strikes, apparently hoping the opposition
would reciprocate.
	   But Zia on Monday threatened ``continuous strikes'' if the
government continued what she called its repressive policies
towards its opponents, then led a march to parliament.
	   During Zia's 1991-1996 term as prime minister, then-opposition
leader Hasina led 172 nationwide general strikes. Business leaders
say such tactics, which often lead to violent clashes, are
crippling the economy in one of the poorest countries in the world.
	   A 60-hour nationwide strike Zia led last week cost 3 billion
taka (dlrs 68 million) per day in lost revenue, according to
industry estimates.

BAGHDAD: to Baghdad.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   With the threat of American and British air strikes on Iraq over
for now, about 150 U.N. relief workers also returned to Baghdad
from the Jordanian capital of Amman, where they were sent at the
height of the crisis.
	   Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to
Baghdad, said in an interview Monday that Iraq was being watched
closely to measure its resolve in cooperating in the search for
forbidden weapons.
	   ``Many members of the Security Council want the question of
Iraq's cooperation with the inspectors to be tested and proved on
the ground,'' Shah said.
	   He added: ``If Iraq cooperates fully and unreservedly with the
inspections due to begin in the next few days, the comprehensive
review to be conducted by the council offers a hopeful sign for the
future.''
	   Shah was leaving Tuesday for New York to brief Annan and council
members on the situation.
	   Ms. Cross said as she readied to leave Bahrain that the
inspectors were anxious to get back on the job.
	   ``We will be back straight to work today,'' she said. ``The
first thing we will be doing is getting the office up and running,
reassembling some of the equipment and computers that we dismantled
or brought down.
	   ``We will be out on inspections _ within a few hours maybe,
later today or maybe tomorrow,'' she said. ``We will be out and
about doing our work as soon as possible.''
	   Among the inspectors returning were 80 from UNSCOM, which is
searching for Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles, and six from the separate U.N. agency examining the
country's nuclear weapons programs.
	   Of the about 150 U.N. relief workers pulled out last week, the
first 31 returned on a special U.N. flight from Jordan, where they
were evacuated, to Habaniya military air base west of Baghdad.
	   The other 120 traveled overnight on a bus convoy through the
desert of Jordan and Iraq.
	   The threat of military action was averted Sunday when U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced that the United States had
accepted the Iraqi government's pledge a day earlier to lift its
three-month ban on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Once inspectors report they are able to work effectively, the
Security Council will conduct a review of Iraq's efforts to
eliminate its dangerous weapons. The Iraqi government wants the
review to lead quickly to the lifting of U.N. sanctions _ a move
both the United States and Britain have resisted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated
Iraq's economy.
	   The council has said they will not be lifted until the U.N.
Special Commission and the Vienna-headquartered International
Atomic Energy Agency certify that Iraq has eliminated its lethal
weaponry.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Tiny bits of space junk zipping along at an
astonishing 155,000 mph (250,000 kph) threatened to knock out cell
phones, foul-up satellite TV broadcasts, and even disrupt military
spying.
	   As the Earth passes through the tail of Comet Tempel-Tuttle
Tuesday, it was expected to encounter an especially dense area of
debris, sparking a spectacular meteor storm.
	   While amateur skywatchers around the world gazed upward to see
the best cosmic light show to approach Earth in three decades, NASA
and private satellite companies rotated their high-tech machinery
away, lest a minuscule speck cripple communications.
	   The debris particles, most no bigger than a grain of sand, can
bore holes in solar panels, damage lenses, blast away mirror
coatings or cause harmful electrical charges.
	   The particles move at 43 miles (69 kilometers) per second. Even
a small grain can have the destructive force of a .22-caliber
bullet shot at one of the world's 600-plus satellites, experts say.
Still, the likelihood of a direct hit was small.
	   ``The chances of any one satellite getting smacked by a particle
is probably less than one in one thousand, but on the other hand,
some of these satellites are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,
so you do take whatever precautions you can,'' said Don Yeomans, a
senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif.
	   The Associated Press advised its customers that it did not
expect disruptions in service. As a precaution, however, the AP
took steps to deliver news and data through the World Wide Web if
the meteor shower affects its satellite operations.
	   Government agencies took similar measures. The Hubble telescope
was turned away from the storm to protect lens surfaces. And the
crew of the Russia's Mir space station planned to wait out the
worst of the storm in their emergency escape vehicle.
	   Most military satellites are built to withstand attack and so
have better protection from the tiny meteors. NASA planned to
reposition six of its 22 satellites to present a smaller target.
Others were to be powered down for the worst part of the storm.

Eight Tamil rebels killed in minor clashes as lull continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Fighting between government troops and
Tamil Tiger guerrillas in northeastern Sri Lanka on Monday left
eight rebels dead, the military said.
	   Fighting has died down since the rebels overran the northern
government-held town of Kilinochchi on Sept. 27, killing nearly
1,000 soldiers.
	   Four rebels were killed in an army ambush in the jungles near
Kilinochchi, said Major Kumar Dewage, a military spokesman. The
area is 270 kilometers (165 miles) north of the capital, Colombo.
	   Two more guerrillas were killed in the nearby Mannar district,
while another was killed near the government-held town of Mankulam.
	   One guerrilla was killed in the eastern Batticaloa district in
an army ambush.
	   There were no casualties on the government side.
	   The guerrillas are fighting for a homeland for minority Tamils,
who say they are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese,
who dominate the government and military. More than 56,000 have
been killed since fighting began in 1983.

Rock carving theft dismays Aborigines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Thieves have stolen an Aboriginal
rock carving believed to be 3,000 years old from a remote site on
the coast of Tasmania.
	   The 45-centimeter (17-inch) artwork, chiseled out of a rock
face, disappeared from a secret place last week.
	   Michael Mansell, legal manager of the Tasmanian Aboriginal
Center, said local Aborigines were ``absolutely dismayed'' by the
desecration.
	   ``The carving is our most direct link to the souls of our
ancestors,'' Mansell said Tuesday. ``It represents the whole soul
of the people who created it. We cannot reproduce that now. It has
gone.''
	   The theft was discovered by a Parks and Wildlife Department
ranger last week.
	   Max Kitchell, director of the department, said it seemed the
thieves knew what they were doing and had taken some care to remove
the rock intact.
	   ``It was quite a feat which would have taken quite some time to
do,'' Kitchell said Tuesday.
	   He said the location of the carving was not widely known and it
was unlikely the thieves had just happened upon it.
	   ``It is one of the most important Aboriginal features in
Tasmania and indeed Australia,'' Kitchell said.
	   The carving, comprising concentric circles, was once part of a
series of art works that covered many kilometers (miles) of the
northwest coast, Mansell said.
	   This art comprised the totems of the area's inhabitants, the
boundaries of their land, their ceremonial and camping grounds and
the walking tracks between them.
	   Southern Aborigines visiting the area to collect mutton bird
eggs would read the art to understand who owned the land and their
own obligations in return for traveling across it.
	   ``It was not just nice art,'' Mansell said. ``This is the only
cultural form which tells us about the heart and soul of our
ancestors.''
	   Mansell said it appeared to be an organized theft rather than
vandalism.
	   Art dealers, meanwhile, said the thieves would have trouble
selling the rare piece.
	   ``It is illegal to sell it in Australia, illegal to export it
out of Australia,'' said Tim Klingender, director of Aboriginal art
for Sotheby's Australia.

China, Philippines try to reduce tensions in Spratlys conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Chinese foreign ministry &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The leaders of China and the
Philippines gave their support on Tuesday to a plan designed to
reduce tensions between nations claiming the Spratly Islands.
	   Philippines President Joseph Estrada met China's President Jiang
Zemin here on the first day of a meeting of Asian leaders attending
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The two leaders endorsed a proposal to form a group of experts
who would work on finding ways to build confidence between the
nations involved in the territorial dispute, said Philippines
Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon.
	   The Spratlys, which straddle vital sea lanes in the South China
Sea, are claimed in whole by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and in part
by Malaysia and the Philippines. Brunei claims one reef.
	   Estrada, who took office in June, said earlier he would urge
nations claiming the Spratly Islands to come together to resolve
the dispute.
	   The Philippines leader was attending his first APEC summit.
During the meeting with Jiang, Estrada read from cue cards.
	   Earlier this month, Manila lodged a diplomatic protest with
Beijing for the construction of large barracks on Mischief Reef,
which the Philippines believes could be easily put to military use.
	   ``If experts look at the problem we are confident the problem at
Mischief Reef can be solved diplomatically,'' said Philippines
presidential spokesman Jerry Barican.
	   China says the structures are shelters for Chinese fishermen and
the construction photographed by Philippine reconnaissance planes
was just repair work.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said he
appreciated the efforts made by Estrada ``to resolve the matter
diplomatically.''
	   ``The Chinese side has repeatedly stated our position on this
question,'' Tang said at a briefing in Beijing. ``We are always
committed to peace and stability in the South China Sea and the
Chinese government sincerely hopes the Philippine side will fully
understand China's sincere position and handle relevant matters
calmly and appropriately.''

Mir's crew takes precautions for ``meteor shower''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The crew of the Russian Mir space station was
preparing for an encounter with a cloud of micro-meteorite
particles on Tuesday that may puncture the craft's hull, space
officials said.
	   Russian space officials have said the shower is unlikely to pose
a serious danger to the station because it consists of very small
particles that are remnants of a comet.
	   However, the ground controllers ordered cosmonauts Gennady
Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev to go to the Soyuz escape capsule when
the shower is expected to peak.
	   In addition, the Mir's position will be adjusted so that the
meteor cloud hits a smaller part of its outer surface. Solar
panels, the most vulnerable part of the station, will also be
turned, Deputy Mission Control chief Viktor Blagov said, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``It is better to be on the safe side,'' he said.
	   During a spacewalk last week, Padalka and Avdeyev installed a
French-made ``meteorite trap'' on the Mir's outer surface. The
device, intended to catch particles for study, will stay attached
to the Mir until 1999, when it will be taken back to earth by a
French astronaut who will fly to the station early next year.
	   The meteorites are the debris of the Comet Tempel-Tuttle which
approached the Earth last January. They look like clouds of glowing
gases with small solid particles.

Schroeder: No additional German aid for Moscow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schroeder meeting with Yeltsin in new grafs 2-3. &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS RIETIG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called the
Russian government's economic rescue plan a ``good start,'' but
indicated Germany would provide little more than moral support in
Russia's latest economic struggle.
	   Schroeder, on his first visit to Russia as German leader, met
Tuesday with President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin. Yeltsin
expressed hope that Russia and Germany ``will enter the next
century with their relations developing at the same pace as now.''
	   ``I'm sure they will,'' Schroeder responded, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Schroeder's predecessor, Helmut Kohl, had close ties with
Yeltsin, which helped secure significant German investment and aid
but also drew criticism from those who blame Yeltsin for many of
Russia's problems.
	   Schroeder insisted Monday that the relationship between Germany
and Russia must not rely too much on personal ties.
	   After meeting with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Monday,
Schroeder said Germany will not give Russia any emergency financial
aid outside the money it's providing through international lenders.
	   ``The possibilities are exhausted'' for additional German aid,
Schroeder said _ though he did bring 1.5 tons (1.65 short tons) of
medical aid with him, German officials said.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government desperately needs foreign
aid to pay off its huge debts, but the IMF and other international
lenders have stopped releasing loans, saying they want Moscow to
start implementing a sound economic plan first.
	   Schroeder called Russia's economic rescue plan, presented this
weekend, a ``good start'' toward convincing international lenders
to resume aid. He stopped short of saying Germany would recommend
that the IMF release the money.
	   Speaking after a meeting early Tuesday with Gennady Seleznyov,
the speaker of the Russian parliament's lower house, Schroeder
again said the government's blueprint was a ``good basis'' for
talks on more aid, but added that Russia must make it more concrete
to meet the IMF demands.
	   The IMF has criticized the latest government plan as too vague
and overloaded with state controls of the economy. Schroeder urged
the Russian Cabinet and the parliament to ``find answers to the IMF
questions.''
	   Germany is a key member of the IMF, the World Bank and the
European Union, all of which have provided aid to Russia.
	   Schroeder and Primakov pledged that Russian-German relations
would continue to flourish.
	   ``We realize Germany's standing in Europe and the world and
retrospectively view the path it has traveled since the end of
World War II to its current prosperity,'' Primakov said.
``Naturally, we would like to learn more about your experience.''
	   Primakov also said Russia was eager to attract foreign capital
and would guarantee investor security.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who met with Schroeder on
Monday, shrugged off the influx of German money that has made
Germany Russia's most important trading partner outside the former
Soviet Union.
	   ``The relations between former Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin were a mere camaraderie. Now I am
counting on good business contacts and mutual understanding,''
Zyuganov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

 &UR; BAGHDAD: to Baghdad.

<TEXT>
	   With the threat of American and British air strikes on Iraq over
for now, about 150 U.N. relief workers also returned to Baghdad
from the Jordanian capital of Amman, where they were sent at the
height of the crisis.
	   Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to
Baghdad, said in an interview Monday that Iraq was being watched
closely to measure its resolve in cooperating in the search for
forbidden weapons.
	   ``Many members of the Security Council want the question of
Iraq's cooperation with the inspectors to be tested and proved on
the ground,'' Shah said.
	   He added: ``If Iraq cooperates fully and unreservedly with the
inspections due to begin in the next few days, the comprehensive
review to be conducted by the council offers a hopeful sign for the
future.''
	   Shah was leaving Tuesday for New York to brief Annan and council
members on the situation.
	   Ms. Cross said as she readied to leave Bahrain that the
inspectors were anxious to get back on the job.
	   ``We will be back straight to work today,'' she said. ``The
first thing we will be doing is getting the office up and running,
reassembling some of the equipment and computers that we dismantled
or brought down.
	   ``We will be out on inspections _ within a few hours maybe,
later today or maybe tomorrow,'' she said. ``We will be out and
about doing our work as soon as possible.''
	   Among the inspectors returning were 80 from UNSCOM, which is
searching for Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles, and six from the separate U.N. agency examining the
country's nuclear weapons programs.
	   Of the about 150 U.N. relief workers pulled out last week, the
first 31 returned on a special U.N. flight from Jordan, where they
were evacuated, to Habaniya military air base west of Baghdad.
	   The other 120 traveled overnight on a bus convoy through the
desert of Jordan and Iraq.
	   The threat of military action was averted Sunday when U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced that the United States had
accepted the Iraqi government's pledge a day earlier to lift its
three-month ban on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Once inspectors report they are able to work effectively, the
Security Council will conduct a review of Iraq's efforts to
eliminate its dangerous weapons. The Iraqi government wants the
review to lead quickly to the lifting of U.N. sanctions _ a move
both the United States and Britain have resisted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated
Iraq's economy.
	   The council has said they will not be lifted until the U.N.
Special Commission and the Vienna-headquartered International
Atomic Energy Agency certify that Iraq has eliminated its lethal
weaponry.

Dollar lower against yen, Tokyo stock prices mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing bond, late afternoon currency
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks closed mixed Tuesday as investors
found little to get excited about in Tokyo's newly unveiled
economic stimulus package. The U.S. dollar dropped on speculation
of an interest-rate cut.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 15.27
points, or 0.11 percent, closing at 14,413.00. On Monday, the
average had climbed 160.06 points, or 1.12 percent.
	   The dollar bought 120.62 yen in late afternoon, down 1.52 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
120.07 yen overnight.
	   Traders expressed disappointment with Monday's stimulus package
_ the largest in Japanese history at 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196
billion) _ because it once again avoided the painful structural
reforms that they said Japan needs to put its economy back on
track.
	   That is why, despite 100 trillion yen (dlrs 820 billion) worth
of such spending over the last six years, the economy remains as
weak as ever, they said.
	   ``Investors are thinking: the government has now poured more
than 100 trillion into economic stimulus efforts without much
effect,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock
division at Tokyo Securities Co.
	   Another blow came from across the Pacific, where Moody's
Investors Service announced during trading that it had cut its
rating of Japanese government securities because of Tokyo's
inability to fix its economy or balance its budgets.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section edged up 2.15 points, or 0.19 percent, to 1,107.65.
It had gained 11.98 points, or 1.09 percent, the previous day.
	   An estimated 385 million shares changed hands on the first
section, down from 443 million Monday. Advances outnumbered
declines 559 to 541.
	   On the currency market, the dollar was lower against the yen as
investors and traders awaited the outcome of a Federal Reserve
policy-making meeting later in the day.
	   Traders cited growing expectations that the U.S. central bank
would cut interest rates for the third time in less than two
months.
	   The Moody's announcement had sent the dollar as high as 122.35
yen during Tokyo trading, but concern about the Fed's next move
brought the U.S. currency back down near its day's low of 120.18
yen.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.855 percent from Monday's finish of 0.850 percent,
driving its price down to 108.36 yen from 108.41 yen.

Defiant Le Pen faces ban for alleged attack on politician
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen,
facing a two-year political ban, said his career was far from over,
despite a campaign by opponents ``seeking my political death.''
	   An appeals court in Versailles later Tuesday was to deliver its
verdict in a case in which Le Pen, 70, has been convicted for
attacking Socialist politician Annette Peulvast-Bergeal at a May
1997 election rally in the town of Mantes-La-Jolie, west of Paris.
	   ``Whatever happens, I am and will remain head of the National
Front,'' Le Pen was quoted as saying in an interview published
Tuesday by the newspaper Le Parisien.
	   Le Pen ended up in a scuffle with a handful of people protesting
his presence, including Peulvast-Bergeal who was running against
his daughter for parliament. Television footage showed Le Pen
shoving her in the chest. But he denies the attack.
	   A lower court in April stripped Le Pen of his civil rights for
two years, effectively banning him from holding office, running for
office, or voting in that time. He was fined 20,000 francs (dlrs
3,333).
	   If upheld, the conviction would make Le Pen ineligible to run in
June 1999 European Parliament elections. He has said that in that
case his wife, Jany, would run in his place.
	   ``Is somebody seeking my political death?'' Le Parisien quoted
Le Pen as saying, claiming that a two-year ban would mean five
years out of politics since there would be no immediate elections
to contend.
	   ``I have no regrets, except for having fallen into an ambush,''
he added, calling on his supporters to protest if his conviction is
upheld.
	   The National Front has won about 15 percent of the vote in
recent elections. It blames immigrants, particularly from North
Africa, for high unemployment and urban violence. It has been
accused of anti-Semitism.
	   Le Pen holds a seat in the European Parliament and is a regional
counselor in the Provence-Alpes-Cotes d'Azur region of southern
France.
	   Last month, the European Parliament voted to lift Le Pen's
parliamentary immunity so German prosecutors can investigate
whether he broke laws that make trivializing the Holocaust a crime.

Mine flooding kills 35 in southwest China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Coal mines suddenly flooded, killing 35 people
and leaving one other missing and presumed dead in southwestern
China's Guangxi region, according to a report seen Tuesday in
Beijing.
	   The flood occurred Oct. 25 at two adjoining mines near the
Guangxi city of Heshan, the official newspaper Yangcheng Evening
News reported.
	   It said the mine, which had stopped production since March 11
due to the rainy season, resumed operations without official
approval on Oct. 13. On Oct. 23, the local government ordered the
mine to close until it could be inspected, but the order was
ignored.
	   The owners of the mines fled after the accident, the report
said.
	   Lax safety standards are one cause behind frequent fatal
accidents in Chinese mines.

Swiss UBS reports third-quarter loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's UBS AG on Tuesday
reported a net third-quarter loss of 911 million Swiss francs (dlrs
660 million).
	   The bank's announcement confirmed its own forecast in September
of a loss of up to 1 billion francs (dlrs 725 million) after tax,
largely due to its exposure to troubled private U.S. investment
fund Long Term Capital Management.
	   The third-quarter loss shaved UBS' net profit for the first nine
months of the year to 2.6 billion francs (dlrs 1.88 billion) from
the 3.51 billion francs (dlrs 2.54 billion) it posted for the first
half.
	   The loss led to the resignation last month of UBS chairman
Mathis Cabiallavetta and the departure of three other top
executives.
	   An internal inquiry uncovered lapses by managers in controls and
decisions before and after the merger, UBS said. It found no signs
of gross negligence, the bank added.
	   UBS said transactions like LTCM won't recur.
	   Beyond LTCM, the company blamed the red ink on equity
derivatives and provisions for its part of the settlement in which
UBS and rival Credit Suisse agreed to pay Holocaust survivors dlrs
1.25 billion in compensation for wartime losses.
	   UBS said it expects an improvement in fourth-quarter income,
citing stable financial markets and the international loan package
for Brazil, announced last weeks.
	   But more Holocaust provisions will leave the bank with a
full-year net profit below the figure for the year's first six
months, UBS said.
	   UBS, Europe's biggest bank, was formed earlier this year from
the merger of Swiss Bank Corp. and Union Bank of Switzerland.
	   Also Tuesday, the Swiss Competition Commission said the bank
cannot merge any more branches from a lot it has to sell to comply
with the regulator's conditional approval of the merger.
	   Swiss regulators said the new bank has to sell 25 retail
branches to one single buyer. The branches were to be selected from
a shortlist of 35 branches.
	   ``The prospects that the bought branches could be closed before
they were transferred from UBS has influenced the decision from
various interested parties to pull back their offer,'' the
Competition Commission said.

U.N. weapons inspectors arrive in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors arrived in Iraq on
Tuesday and said they want to get back to work as soon as possible
to test Iraq's pledge to cooperate in the search for its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   ``We are back, we are ready to work immediately,'' senior
weapons inspector Yaakko Ylitalo told reporters shortly after his
C-130 transport plane landed at the Iraqi military air base at
Habaniya outside Baghdad just a little after 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT).
	   He declined to give details on his inspection work Tuesday.
	   Ylitalo was among the 86 inspectors from UNSCOM and the
International Atomic Energy Agency who flew in from the Gulf state
of Bahrain.
	   At the air base, Ylitalo asked an Iraqi official if the Iraqis
had prepared for the resumption of their work.
	   ``Everything will be sorted out as soon as possible,'' the
unidentified official told Ylitalo.
	   Asked by reporters if Iraqi officials were helpful, Ylitalo
said: ``We have no problems.''
	   Three Iraqi buses transported the inspectors to their
headquarters in Baghdad, 70 kilometers (44 miles) away.
	   Earlier in Bahrain, the inspectors said they were going to test
Iraq's promise to cooperate.
	   ``The Iraqi authorities have promised cooperation. Obviously the
next few days are going to be very important,'' said Caroline
Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
arms inspections.
	   She spoke as the 80 UNSCOM and six IAEA inspectors left their
hotel in Bahrain, where they were evacuated last week, for the
flight back to Baghdad.
	   With the threat of American and British air strikes on Iraq over
for now, about 150 U.N. relief workers also returned to Baghdad
from the Jordanian capital of Amman, where they were sent at the
height of the crisis.
	   Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to
Baghdad, said in an interview Monday that Iraq was being watched
closely to measure its resolve in cooperating in the search for
forbidden weapons.
	   ``Many members of the Security Council want the question of
Iraq's cooperation with the inspectors to be tested and proved on
the ground,'' Shah said.
	   He added: ``If Iraq cooperates fully and unreservedly with the
inspections due to begin in the next few days, the comprehensive
review to be conducted by the council offers a hopeful sign for the
future.''
	   Shah was leaving Tuesday for New York to brief Annan and council
members on the situation.
	   Ms. Cross said as she readied to leave Bahrain that the
inspectors were anxious to get back on the job.
	   ``We will be back straight to work today,'' she said. ``The
first thing we will be doing is getting the office up and running,
reassembling some of the equipment and computers that we dismantled
or brought down.
	   ``We will be out on inspections _ within a few hours maybe,
later today or maybe tomorrow,'' she said. ``We will be out and
about doing our work as soon as possible.''
	   Among the inspectors returning were 80 from UNSCOM, which is
searching for Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles, and six from the separate U.N. agency examining the
country's nuclear weapons programs.
	   Of the about 150 U.N. relief workers pulled out last week, the
first 31 returned on a special U.N. flight from Jordan, where they
were evacuated, to Habaniya military air base west of Baghdad.
	   The other 120 traveled overnight on a bus convoy through the
desert of Jordan and Iraq and arrived in Baghdad early Tuesday
morning.
	   The threat of military action was averted Sunday when U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced that the United States had
accepted the Iraqi government's pledge a day earlier to lift its
three-month ban on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Once inspectors report they are able to work effectively, the
Security Council will conduct a review of Iraq's efforts to
eliminate its dangerous weapons. The Iraqi government wants the
review to lead quickly to the lifting of U.N. sanctions _ a move
both the United States and Britain have resisted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated
Iraq's economy.
	   The council has said they will not be lifted until the U.N.
Special Commission and the Vienna-headquartered International
Atomic Energy Agency certify that Iraq has eliminated its lethal
weaponry.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singaporean who flew to Paris and back three
times using tampered airline tickets has been sentenced to 10
months in jail for cheating, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Adbul Aziz, a 39-year-old businessman, altered legitimate
tickets for Singapore Airlines from their original Malaysian
destinations to the French capital, The Straits Times said.
	   He flew to Paris three times in late 1992, returning to
Singapore immediately on each occasion. The news report did not say
why he stayed so briefly in France.
	   After the airline discovered that the tickets had been altered
and Abdul was arrested, he paid the airline 27,366 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 16,789) for the cost of his fraudulent air travel.
	   Adbul faced up to seven years in prison and a fine for each of
the three cheating charges.

Morgan Stanley CEO says confidence in Hong Kong returning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Confidence in Hong Kong is coming back, despite
the government's controversial intervention in the stock and
futures markets, a top Wall Street executive said Tuesday.
	   Philip Purcell, chairman of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Co.,
said that although foreign investors were shaken by the
government's foray into the markets, he was ``surprisingly
positive'' that Hong Kong's markets would remain free.
	   ``Everybody understands that the government was in a difficult
position,'' Purcell told a luncheon audience.
	   Purcell said Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang's recent
assurances to European and U.S. investors that the government was
committed to a free and open market were ``very convincing.''
Purcell said effective regulations and a liberal market were ``not
in conflict.''
	   In August, the Hong Kong government spent U.S. dlrs 4.4 billion
to scoop up shares and futures contracts in an effort to drive
stock prices up to levels at which speculators _ who bet the market
would fall _ would be stuck with huge losses.
	   Hong Kong officials said they were not concerned about people
betting on lower stock prices. But they said they had to draw the
line at speculators who were selling the Hong Kong dollar at the
same time, forcing Hong Kong to raise interest rates, and thereby
pushing stocks lower.

Reports: Primakov discussed more aid with Gore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told U.S.
Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday that more loans are vital to help
Moscow deal with the country's economic crisis, according to
Russian news reports.
	   Primakov said Russia wants the International Monetary Fund to
release the next installment of a frozen dlrs 22 billion aid
package to enable Moscow to refinance existing debts to the IMF and
the World Bank.
	   Primakov said after the meeting that Gore had agreed Russia's
economic plan to tackle the crisis was realistic. The Russian
leader said he was happy with the talks in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
where both men were attending the annual Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit.
	   ``I think everything is moving forward well,'' he was quoted as
saying.
	   But Gore said the United States had already provided substantial
aid to Russia, only to see the money diverted to foreign bank
accounts, the reports said. The two men agreed on further contacts
to help deal with the Russian crisis, but there was no sign that
Washington would back further international aid, they said.
	   Primakov said the West should not wait for further Russian
government programs to handle the crisis because Moscow must have
additional loans now. He said delays in further loans could make
the problems worse.
	   The Russian leader suggested the United States work to release
the IMF aid package while the Russian government considers more
measures to tackle the crisis.
	   Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants said the U.S. officials
had a ``positive'' assessment of the Russian Cabinet's estimates
for next year's budget. He said the government had tried to ``show
that its action will not be aimed at uncontrolled money printing
that would trigger inflation.''
	   Shapovalyants said the two sides agreed that U.S. Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers will travel to Russia later
this month to make sure that Russia's budget plan meets the IMF
requirements.
	   He also claimed that the IMF is now only waiting for the Russian
parliament to approve next year's budget to release more funds, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   There was no immediate comment from the U.S. officials.
	   Russia was forced to suspend payment on its debts and devalue
its currency, the ruble, after it was hit in August by the global
crisis in developing markets.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government desperately needs foreign
aid to pay off its huge debts, but the IMF and other international
lenders have halted loans, saying they want Moscow to implement a
sound economic plan first.
	   The Russian government presented an economic rescue plan during
the weekend after weeks of discussion and delay. The IMF has
criticized the plan as too vague and overloaded with state controls
of the economy.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called the
Russian government's economic rescue plan a ``good start,'' but
indicated Germany would provide little more than moral support in
Russia's latest economic struggle.
	   Schroeder, on his first visit to Russia as German leader, met
Tuesday with President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin. Yeltsin
expressed hope that Russia and Germany ``will enter the next
century with their relations developing at the same pace as now.''
	   ``I'm sure they will,'' Schroeder responded.
	   Yeltsin looked fit and spoke distinctly at the start of the
meeting after weeks of renewed speculation about the state of his
health. He curtailed meetings last week with the visiting Japanese
prime minister, prompting new speculation that he was seriously
ill.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ From the general public in Kuala
Lumpur to Asian leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit, U.S. Vice President Al Gore's comments about Malaysia's
protest movement generated strong reactions from many people. Here
are some examples.
	    &UR; ---- &QC; 
	   _``Of course I am happy, and I think it is appropriate for Mr.
Gore to have come out with this,'' said Azizah Ismail, wife of
jailed Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim. ``What he spoke about is
in the spirit of APEC: democracy, transparency, accountability and
good governance.''
	    &UR; ---- &QC; 
	   A middle-aged Malaysian man on the streets of Kuala Lumpur: ``I
think he is quite rude. It's our internal affair. Most Malaysians
are very sensitive to this kind of issue.''
	    &UR; ---- &QC; 
	   ``The vice president is entitled to his own opinion. I believe
that as the president of a democratic country, I go along with his
opinion,'' said Philippine President Joseph Estrada.
	    &UR; ---- &QC; 
	   Gore's ``preaching about democratic principles rings hollow and
must be seen for what it really is,'' said Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. ``The system of government here has
evolved out of Malaysia's historical experiences and expressed
through constitutional and democratic means.''
	    &UR; ---- &QC; 
	   Lim Kit Siang, opposition leader in Parliament, said the
government could have avoided the humiliation if it were more
responsive to demands for democracy: ``There is a feeling of
national embarrassment that a foreign leader should be talking
about the need for democratic change in Malaysia on our own soil.''
	    &UR; ---- &QC; 
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard: ``You don't necessarily
achieve desirable outcomes by constantly hectoring other nations in
order to change the way they run their lives.''

Swiss UBS reports third-quarter loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's UBS AG on Tuesday
reported a net third-quarter loss of 911 million Swiss francs (dlrs
660 million).
	   The bank's announcement confirmed its own forecast in September
of a loss of up to 1 billion francs (dlrs 725 million) after tax,
largely due to its exposure to troubled private U.S. investment
fund Long Term Capital Management.
	   The third-quarter loss shaved UBS' net profit for the first nine
months of the year to 2.6 billion francs (dlrs 1.88 billion) from
the 3.51 billion francs (dlrs 2.54 billion) it posted for the first
half.
	   The loss led to the resignation last month of UBS chairman
Mathis Cabiallavetta and the departure of three other top
executives.
	   UBS, Europe's biggest bank, was formed earlier this year from
the merger of Swiss Bank Corp. and Union Bank of Switzerland.
	   An internal inquiry uncovered lapses by managers in controls and
decisions before and after the merger, UBS said. It found no signs
of gross negligence, the bank added.
	   UBS said transactions like LTCM won't recur.
	   Beyond LTCM, the company blamed the red ink on equity
derivatives and provisions for its part of the settlement in which
UBS and rival Credit Suisse agreed to pay Holocaust survivors dlrs
1.25 billion in compensation for wartime losses.
	   UBS said it expects an improvement in fourth-quarter income,
citing stable financial markets and the international loan package
for Brazil, announced last week.
	   Also Tuesday, the Swiss Competition Commission said the bank
cannot merge any more branches from those it has to sell to comply
with the regulator's conditional approval of the merger.
	   Swiss regulators said the new bank has to sell 25 retail
branches to one single buyer. The branches were to be selected from
a shortlist of 35 branches.
	   ``The prospects that the bought branches could be closed before
they were transferred from UBS has influenced the decision from
various interested parties to pull back their offer,'' the
Competition Commission said.

Swiss UBS reports third-quarter loss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RAISES to 4th graf reference to merger. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's UBS AG on Tuesday
reported a net third-quarter loss of 911 million Swiss francs (dlrs
660 million).
	   The bank's announcement confirmed its own forecast in September
of a loss of up to 1 billion francs (dlrs 725 million) after tax,
largely due to its exposure to troubled private U.S. investment
fund Long Term Capital Management.
	   The third-quarter loss shaved UBS' net profit for the first nine
months of the year to 2.6 billion francs (dlrs 1.88 billion) from
the 3.51 billion francs (dlrs 2.54 billion) it posted for the first
half.
	   UBS, Europe's biggest bank, was formed earlier this year from
the merger of Swiss Bank Corp. and Union Bank of Switzerland.
	   The loss led to the resignation last month of UBS chairman
Mathis Cabiallavetta and the departure of three other top
executives.
	   An internal inquiry uncovered lapses by managers in controls and
decisions before and after the merger, UBS said. It found no signs
of gross negligence, the bank added.
	   UBS said transactions like LTCM won't recur.
	   Beyond LTCM, the company blamed the red ink on equity
derivatives and provisions for its part of the settlement in which
UBS and rival Credit Suisse agreed to pay Holocaust survivors dlrs
1.25 billion in compensation for wartime losses.
	   UBS said it expects an improvement in fourth-quarter income,
citing stable financial markets and the international loan package
for Brazil, announced last weeks.
	   But more Holocaust provisions will leave the bank with a
full-year net profit below the figure for the year's first six
months, UBS said.
	   Also Tuesday, the Swiss Competition Commission said the bank
cannot merge any more branches from a lot it has to sell to comply
with the regulator's conditional approval of the merger.
	   Swiss regulators said the new bank has to sell 25 retail
branches to one single buyer. The branches were to be selected from
a shortlist of 35 branches.
	   ``The prospects that the bought branches could be closed before

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Some 20 city governments in China are
seeking approval to build subways and light railways to relieve
growing traffic congestion, the state-run newspaper Shanghai
Securities News reported Tuesday.
	   Such projects are being considered to help build a more
efficient transport network in China's largest cities, the report
said.
	   It noted that China has about 35 cities with populations of more
than 1 million, and another 43 cities with populations of 500,000
to 1 million people. Traffic congestion in those cities is expected
to worsen.
	   The report forecast that by 2000, four cities that already have
subways or are starting construction _ Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou
and Shenzhen _ will need to buy about 1,000 train cars, worth 10
billion yuan (dlrs 1.21 billion), to complete subways and light
railway lines. The figure is expected to reach 3,000 train cars,
worth 30 billion yuan (dlrs 3.63 billion), by 2010.
	   Including spare parts and related equipment, the report said
those four cities alone could spend up to 60 billion yuan (dlrs
7.26 billion) in the next decade.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Cabinet on Tuesday gave its final approval
to a U.S.-led plan to build a permanent international space station
to be launched in 2004, a news report said.
	   The project was signed by 15 countries in Washington in January,
and was a new version of an earlier agreement reworked to include
Russia. It is the largest international civil science and
technology project ever undertaken.
	   The pact, approved by the Japanese Parliament in April, will go
into force when the governments of the United States and Russia
approve it, Kyodo News agency quoted government officials as
saying.
	   Japanese space officials had no immediate comment on the report.
	   Countries taking part in the project are Canada, Japan, Russia,
the United States, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Britain.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.,
the world's largest memory chip maker, said Tuesday it is seeking
to sell part of its non-memory chip operations to a foreign company
as part of its restructuring effort.
	   Samsung said details of the sale have not been finalized.
	   But a Samsung Electronics spokesman said the company will sell
its Puchon plant, which consists of production lines for such
non-memory parts as transistors, power devices and linear
integrated circuits. Non-memory chip operations make up 30 percent
of its semiconductor business.
	   Samsung Electronics is also seeking to sell other non-viable
operations at home and abroad, the spokesman said.
	   Samsung Electronics, the flagship unit of South Korea's second
largest conglomerate, the Samsung Group, produces semiconductors,
telecommunications products, home appliances and computer products.
	   Local companies are selling off their assets and units to
foreign investors in a bid to streamline their businesses and
improve their financial positions.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Deputy Human Resources Minister
Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir said Malaysia's economic turmoil had put
73,983 people out of jobs as of Nov. 7, the Business Times
reported.
	   The newspaper's Tuesday edition quoted the minister as saying in
Parliament that the largest number of retrenchments was in the
state of Selangor, involving 17,605 workers, followed by Penang
with 15,169 and Kuala Lumpur with 9,944.
	   He didn't disclose the industries that has laid off those
workers.
	   Malaysia's total labor force is estimated at about 9 million
people.
	   In October, the Finance Ministry forecast unemployment would be
at 4.9 percent by the year's end, up from 2.6 percent a year
earlier.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A leading ratings agency lowered its assessment of
the Japanese government's creditworthiness Tuesday, the latest sign
of growing international dissatisfaction with Tokyo's management of
its economy.
	   Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its rating of all
securities issued or guaranteed by the Japanese government by one
notch from the highest rating of Aaa to Aa1.
	   ``The rating actions were taken because of the uncertainties and
heightened risks over the long term arising from economic and
policy weaknesses,'' the U.S.-based agency said in a statement.
	   The move could lead to higher borrowing costs for both the
government and world-class Japanese companies.
	   Minutes after announcing the downgrade, Moody's also cut its
ratings of four of Japan's largest utilities companies, which had
enjoyed the Aaa rating.
	   Moody's lowered its ratings of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Co., Chubu Electric Power Co., Kansai Electric Power Co. and Tokyo
Electric Power Co., also to Aa1.
	   In cutting the government's rating, Moody's cited concern over
Japan's ballooning government debt _ made worse just a day earlier
by a 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion) stimulus package.

Israel reserving judgment on Arafat's clarifications
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes by Netanyahu adviser,
committees meeting; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite Israel's threat to hold up a West Bank
troop pullback, Israeli and Palestinian officials held talks to try
and resolve a few remaining obstacles to carrying out the
land-for-security agreement, Palestinian negotiators said Tuesday.
	   The ongoing contacts suggested that Israel may not suspend the
pullback, scheduled to take place by the weekend, for an extended
period of time.
	   U.S. officials have criticized Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's decision Monday to hold up the withdrawal until
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat retracts threats to unilaterally
establish a Palestinian state in May and perhaps use force.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said the two sides
accepted certain obligations when they signed the peace accord last
month. ``And those obligations did not come with conditions about
every word that was said by every party,'' Rubin said, adding that
Arafat's statements were ``wrong.''
	   Late Monday, Arafat tried to soften his earlier remarks in hopes
of ending the latest crisis. ``Our position remains that peace is a
strategic option and we will not shift course,'' Arafat said in
remarks broadcast on Israel TV's prime time news cast.
	   Netanyahu reserved judgment on Arafat's new statement, saying
Monday evening that ``we expect a full retraction.''
	   Israel radio said Netanyahu discussed the dispute with advisers
Tuesday morning and decided to wait for additional clarifications
from Arafat.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said he did not
know whether the government would give the go-ahead for the
pullback based on Arafat's clarifications. ``My own assessment is
that it was neither a retraction nor a disavowal,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Netanyahu will bring the dispute before his Cabinet on
Wednesday.
	   Israel's parliament was expected to give overwhelming approval
to the peace accord Tuesday evening, at the end of a two-day
debate. Netanyahu had kicked off the stormy discussion Monday with
the announcement that he was holding up the withdrawal.
	   Despite the row, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met Monday
night, as scheduled, to try and conclude an agreement on setting up
a land route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   The head of the Palestinian delegation, Abdel Razek Yehiyeh,
said he expected all issues to be settled by next week, and said
the so-called ``safe passage'' could be opened within a month.
	   Another committee dealing with the release of Palestinian
prisoners was to meet Tuesday afternoon. Israel was to free a first
group of 250 prisoners by the weekend.
	   Hisham Abdel Razek, the senior Palestinian on the panel, said
Israel was offering to release car thieves and workers who had been
caught in Israel without a permit, rather than prisoners held for
security offenses. Abdel Razek said the Palestinians complained to
the United States that this was a violation of the accord.
	   An Israeli army officer said Monday that a first group of
prisoners was to be freed Tuesday, but later said the release was
being held up.
	   In all, Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank in
three stages by the end of January. The government has not
published the maps of withdrawal, but promised to present them to
the legislators before Tuesday's vote.
	   In the first pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank are to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction, and
7.1 percent are to go from shared to sole Palestinian control.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily published its own withdrawal map and
said most of the land changing hands was in the northern West Bank,
around the Palestinian towns of Jenin and Nablus.

Kurdish suicide bomber wounds four
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YUKSEKOVA, Turkey (AP) _ A Kurdish suicide bomber wounded two
soldiers and two civilians, including a child, when she exploded
bombs strapped to her body near a military garrison on Tuesday,
private television NTV reported.
	   The attack came days after the detention in Italy of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan prompted widespread protests by Kurds
throughout Europe. Turkey has asked for Ocalan to be returned to
Turkey.
	   The woman died in the attack in the southeastern town of
Yuksekova, bordering Iran and Iraq, the report said.
	   Among the injured were a non-commissioned officer, a soldier and
two civilians, including a 12-year-old child.
	   The rebels, fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast staged
two similar attacks in 1996, killing three policemen and seven
soldiers.
	   Some 37,000 people have been killed in the conflict since 1984.

Executive salaries go up at SOCOG
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Despite growing concern over Sydney's
Olympic budget, the money spent on organizing committee executive
salaries has more than doubled over the past financial year,
according to an annual report.
	   SOCOG's annual report was tabled in New South Wales state
parliament Tuesday.
	   The Australian dlrs 2.6 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.65 billion) budget
for the 2000 games was recently called ``ambitious but feasible''
by International Olympic Committee executive member Jacques Rogge.
	   SOCOG has admitted it struggling to reach the Australian dlrs
874 million (U.S. dlrs 542 million) in corporate sponsorship
planned under the budget.
	   SOCOG's marketing boss John Moore admits the organizers are
almost Aust dlrs 200 million (U.S. dlrs 124 million) short, while
chief executive Sandy Hollway says the target may prove a
``stretch.''
	   The annual report showed Australian dlrs 5.733 million (U.S.
dlrs 3.63 million) was paid to 23 executives in 1997/98 compared to
Australian dlrs 2.618 million (U.S. dlrs 1.65 million) paid to 17
executives in 1996/97.
	   The figures showed three executives received Australian dlrs
400,000 (U.S. dlrs 253,000) or more this year compared to one last
year.
	   SOCOG denied there had been a blowout in executive salaries.
	   A spokesman said a number of executives had been appointed
midway through the last financial year, so their full salaries were
not included in the 1996/97 figures but showed up in 1997/98. They
included Hollway and his deputy Jim Sloman.
	   The annual report also reinforced that SOCOG is behind schedule
in signing up sponsors for the games, although it remains hopeful
of meeting its sponsorship revenue targets.
	   ``Overall, total sponsorship revenue targets are expected to be
achieved, however to date the receipt of sponsorship revenue has
been later than budget due to delays in signing contracts,'' the
report said.
	   A SOCOG spokesman said sponsors had committed funds but the
formal signing of agreements had been delayed by legal discussions.
	   ``It's no big deal, we're still proceeding along merrily but
we've got to do all the i's and cross all the t's,'' he said.
	   While SOCOG has been criticized for not employing enough senior
women, the report showed that 24 per cent of the organization's
executives were female in 1997/98 compared to 20 per cent the year
before.

Philippine shares boosted by strong peso
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares finished strong
Tuesday, propped up by the peso's steady appreciation and
expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve would cut interest rates
again, traders said.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks rose
33.63 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,779.23 after advancing by 33.62
points Monday.
	   The broader All Shares Index was up 10.97 points to 571.29 after
gaining 7.51 points Monday.
	   Gainers outpaced losers 68 to 20, while 14 stocks were
unchanged.
	   Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., still in the midst of
takeover negotiations, remained the major focus of investors. PLDT
stock accounted for more than a quarter of Tuesday's turnover.
	   Softer domestic interest rates also encouraged buying in
property stocks such as Ayala Land, C and P Homes, and Filinvest
Land Inc.
	   The peso opened strong against the dollar, breaking the key
support level of 40 pesos to the dollar in morning trading.
	   It closed higher in heavy trading, lifted by expectations of a
U.S. interest rate cut and the stronger Japanese yen.
	   At the end of Tuesday's trading, the dollar averaged 39.857
pesos, below Monday's reference rate of 40.286 pesos.
	   The dollar traded in a range of 39.710 pesos to 40.050 pesos. It
was last traded at 39.895 pesos. Volume totaled dlrs 210 million,
compared with dlrs 112 million Monday.
	   Lower U.S. interest rates are seen as releasing more dollars
into global financial markets, putting some pressure on the U.S.
currency, traders said.
	   Traders said the peso is also riding on the positive regional
sentiment sweeping other Asian currency markets, largely on the
back of gains posted by the Japanese yen against the dollar.

Israel reserving judgment on Arafat's clarifications

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes by Netanyahu adviser,
committees meeting; changes byline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite Israel's threat to hold up a West Bank
troop pullback, Israeli and Palestinian officials met to try and
resolve obstacles to carrying out the land-for-security agreement,
Palestinian negotiators said Tuesday.
	   The ongoing contacts suggested Israel may delay in suspending
the pullback, which is scheduled to take place by the weekend.
	   U.S. officials have criticized Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's decision Monday to hold up the withdrawal until
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat retracts threats to unilaterally
establish a Palestinian state in May and perhaps use force.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said the two sides
accepted certain obligations when they signed the peace accord last
month. ``And those obligations did not come with conditions about
every word that was said by every party,'' Rubin said, adding that
Arafat's statements were ``wrong.''
	   Late Monday, Arafat tried to soften his earlier remarks in hopes
of ending the latest crisis. ``Our position remains that peace is a
strategic option and we will not shift course,'' Arafat said in
remarks broadcast on Israel TV's prime time news cast.
	   Netanyahu reserved judgment on Arafat's new statement, saying
Monday evening that ``we expect a full retraction.''
	   Israel radio said Netanyahu discussed the dispute with advisers
Tuesday morning and decided to wait for additional clarifications
from Arafat.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said he did not
know whether the government would give the go-ahead for the
pullback based on Arafat's clarifications. ``My own assessment is
that it was neither a retraction nor a disavowal,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Netanyahu will bring the dispute before his Cabinet on
Wednesday.
	   Israel's parliament was expected to give overwhelming approval
to the peace accord Tuesday evening, at the end of a two-day
debate. Netanyahu had kicked off the stormy discussion Monday with
the announcement that he was holding up the withdrawal.
	   Despite the row, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met Monday
night, as scheduled, to try and conclude an agreement on a land
route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   The head of the Palestinian delegation, Abdel Razek Yehiyeh,
said he expected all issues to be settled by next week, and said
the so-called ``safe passage'' could be opened within a month.
	   Another committee dealing with the release of Palestinian
prisoners was to meet Tuesday afternoon. Israel was to free a first
group of 250 prisoners by the weekend.
	   In all, Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank in
three stages by the end of January.

Philippine president urges Anwar's wife to fight for democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Tuesday he urged the wife of jailed Malaysian
politician Anwar Ibrahim to be patient and ``fight for the cause of
freedom and democracy.''
	   Estrada was the first international leader to publicly criticize
the arrest of the former Malaysian deputy prime minister, whom he
considers a friend.
	   But it had been unclear whether he would raise the issue during
meetings this week of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
after he did not discuss Anwar in talks Monday with Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   ``I never backed down just because I saw Prime Minister
Mahathir. He is the host, so I have to respect Mahathir,'' Estrada
said. ``That doesn't mean that I have dumped Anwar.''
	   Estrada said he met Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, in a hotel room
early Tuesday.
	   ``I gave her encouragement to be patient, to have more courage
to fight for the cause of freedom and democracy,'' he said.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said Estrada asked Azizah
how Anwar and their children were doing and expressed his personal
sympathy.
	   Estrada told her that ``particularly because of our own
experience in the Philippines, he felt very strongly about human
rights and due process,'' Barican said.
	   Human rights were widely violated in the Philippines during the
administration of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who was
ousted in a ``people's power'' revolt in 1986.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after his firing by
Mahathir set off massive anti-government protests. He has pleaded
innocent to 10 charges of corruption and illegal sex acts.
	   His case has dominated the sidelines of the APEC summit. Several
other APEC leaders have expressed support for him and for political
change in authoritarian Malaysia.
	   U.S. President Al Gore infuriated the Malaysian government
Monday night in a speech that indirectly expressed support for
Anwar's backers and compared their slogan of ``reformasi'' with the
Philippine call 12 years ago for ``people's power.''
	   Estrada said he supported Gore's remarks.
	   ``As president of a democratic country, I go along with his
opinion,'' he said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also met with Azizah
Sunday night. On Saturday two Canadian Cabinet members saw her.
	   After their meeting, Estrada and Azizah did not issue any public
statement.
	   Azizah, speaking later to reporters at her house, said only that
Estrada was ``very supportive and very nice.''
	   Estrada said he did not want to interfere in the internal
affairs of Malaysia, but that ``democracy, due process and human
rights are international values that transcend national
boundaries,'' Barican said.
	   The meeting, however, was opposed by some key officials in
Estrada's government.
	   Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, who strongly counseled Estrada
not to see Azizah, did not attend the meeting.
	   ``The president makes foreign policy,'' Barican said.

Kurdish suicide bomber wounds two in Turkey

 &UR; EDS: DECREASES number of injured; CHANGES source &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YUKSEKOVA, Turkey (AP) _ A Kurdish suicide bomber wounded an
officer and a 12-year-old child when she set off bombs strapped to
her body near a military garrison on Tuesday, the Anatolia news
agency said.
	   The attack came days after the detention of Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan set off protests by Kurds throughout Europe. Turkey
is asking for Ocalan's extradition.
	   The suicide bomber died in the attack in Yuksekova, a town in
Turkey's southeast near the borders with Iran and Iraq, the agency
said.
	   An earlier report on NTV television said four people were
injured.
	   In two similar attacks in 1996, three police officers and seven
soldiers died.
	   The Kurds have been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast
since 1984. The conflict has killed about 37,000 people.

Hong Kong share prices slump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong slumped Tuesday,
pushed down largely by profit-taking.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 149.40 points, or 1.4 percent, closing at 10,148.69. On
Monday, the index had surged 300.10 points.
	   Turnover slipped to 6.34 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
812 million) from Monday's 6.94 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 889 million).
	   Brokers said investors took profits following sharp gains in
share prices Monday due to expectations of a cut in U.S. interest
when the U.S. Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets later
Tuesday.
	   Despite an overnight rally on Wall Street, investors in Hong
Kong were cashing in on recent gains, brokers said.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 50 Hong Kong
cents to 54.75, and Cheung Kong fell 25 cents to 58.50.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 2.50 dollars to
180.50, and Hang Seng Bank fell 1.25 dollars to 64.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 1.00 dollar to 55.00, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 90 cents to 35.50.

Landmine kills four, grenade kills three
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ A land mine explosion killed four villagers
in India's troubled Kashmir state on Tuesday, police said.
	   A day earlier in another part of the state, a grenade explosion
at a bus stop killed three people, including an 11-year-old boy who
had been waiting to ride the bus home from school.
	   Authorities on Tuesday were trying to determine who had thrown
the grenade at the bus stop on a crowded street in Dooru, 60
kilometers (37 miles) south of Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital.
The land mine explosion at Madana, a village about 200 kilometers
(124 miles) south of Srinagar, was blamed on Muslim militants
fighting Indian forces to carve out a separate state or merge with
Pakistan.
	   Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority state in predominately Hindu
India, has been shaken by separatist attacks since 1989.

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ No. 12 maegashira (senior wrestler)
Kotonishiki bulldozed out higher-ranked Tochiazuma and kept the

Hoechst reports income slump, announces restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German pharmaceutical giant Hoechst
announced a major restructuring Tuesday, along with a 17-percent
slump in sales in the first nine months of 1998 that it blamed on a
turbulent world economy.
	   The group said it would split into two separate, listed
companies by spring 1999, spinning off its industrial chemicals
operations through a listing of subsidiary Celanese AG in Frankfurt
and New York.
	   Hoechst said the move will allow the parent company to focus on
its core business of life sciences _ pharmaceuticals, pesticides
and biotechnology.
	   Hoechst Chairman Juergen Dormann called it ``the most direct,
fastest and most favorable way to achieve our goal of transforming
Hoechst into a leading life sciences company.''
	   Recession in Japan, a slowing U.S. economy and financial turmoil
in Russia and South America ``contributed significantly to an
overall decline in our operating business in the third quarter,''
the company said in a statement.
	   Net income _ after taxes and minority interests _ slumped to
just 60 million marks (dlrs 37.5 million,) compared to 446 million
marks (dlrs 278.75 million) in the third quarter of 1997.
	   Sales in the third quarter alone were down 15 percent to 10.2
billion marks (dlrs 6.37 billion,) compared to 12 billion marks
(dlrs 7.5 billion) in the same quarter last year.
	   Operating profits in the third quarter fell by 7 percent to 552
million marks (dlrs 345 million,) compared to 596 million marks
(dlrs 372.5 million) over the period last year.
	   Operating profits for the first three quarters were down 16
percent compared to the year earlier to 2.4 billion marks (dlrs 1.5
billion.)
	   Allowing for a decline in restructuring charges, operating
profit fell 22 percent in the third quarter, the company said.
	   Hoechst also said it had cut its workforce by 12 percent at the
end of the third quarter compared to last year, leaving the company
with 109,977 employees.

Russia promises renewed help in search for Cold War prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos APEC112,113 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOE McDONALD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Russian prime minister
promised Tuesday to help find evidence of whether Soviet spy
agencies plotted to obtain U.S. prisoners from the Korean War.
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore asked Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov for help in a wide-ranging, two-hour meeting at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The bilateral meeting also touched on Russia's financial crisis,
a steel trade dispute, and America's concerns about anti-Semitic
comments made in Russia, according to U.S. officials.
	   Suspicions that at least a handful of U.S. POWs were sent to the
former Soviet Union have been fueled by the memoirs of a late
Russian military historian who said he had heard of such a plan.
	   A U.S.-Russian panel on POWs said in July 1997, that it could
not confirm such suspicions, despite a five-year investigation that
included reviewing more than 10,000 documents and interviewing
hundreds of Russians.
	   Gore gave Primakov a letter asking him to open Russian records
in hope of finding a final answer. Moscow sided with North Korea in
the 1950-53 war, which ended in a tense military standoff that
continues today.
	   ``Primakov said he would do whatever he could to help,'' said a
senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity.
	   More than 8,000 Americans are missing from the war. The families
of some say they may have been taken to the former Soviet Union,
and could still be alive. Some Russians claim to have seen
Americans in hospitals or prisons over the years.
	   U.S. officials stressed that they had no evidence to support
such suspicions.
	   But they said Washington wanted to look into a claim by Gen.
Dmitri A. Volkogonov, the military historian whose memoirs
described a possible plan to obtain Americans for questioning.
Volkogonov, who died in December 1995, wrote that he had tried in
vain to confirm that such a plan existed.
	   A former KGB director has told U.S. officials he knew of no such
plan but it may have been discussed in KGB documents, said another
U.S. official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   ``We were asking for the support of the Russian government in
finding documents and whether such a plan was put into effect,''
the official said.
	   Gore and Primakov also discussed trade, security issues and
weapons non-proliferation, the U.S. officials said.
	   They described the wide scope of their discussions at a Kuala
Lumpur hotel, which ran much longer than scheduled, as a reflection
of the close, cooperative relationship built in recent years by
Washington and Moscow.
	   Primakov outlined Russian economic reform plans, and spoke of
his desire to improve his country's battered international credit,
the U.S. officials said. They said Clinton administration officials
were ready to offer economic advice, but ``do not want to prescribe
to them.''
	   Primakov is ``telling us that he's already in agreement with the
kinds of things that we are worried about the most,'' an official
said. ``We don't have to tell him how bad hyperinflation could
be.''
	   Russia's default on billions of dollars in foreign debt in
August leveled its own economy and triggered market upheaval on
stock markets around the world.
	   Russia's action was the most severe market selloff that has
occurred in a financial crisis that began in Asia 17 months ago,
leaving many of its countries in their worst recession in decades.
	   The move by Russia also was major embarrassment for the
International Monetary Fund, which had just assembled a dlrs 22
billion bailout package for Russia in hops of staving off the
collapse of its currency, the ruble.
	   The IMF has suspended support for Russia until it comes up with
a new credible reform program. Before the APEC summit, the United
States and its allies had said they were awaiting further
information on just what Yeltsin's government plans to do.
	   The crisis with Iraq _ which forced President Bill Clinton to
cancel plans to attend the APEC meeting _ didn't come up in the
meeting, because Gore and Primakov decided their governments had
had ``ample communication'' on the matter, an official said.
	   The two leaders also touched on a U.S. anti-dumping complaint
against Russian steel imports, but didn't have any substantive
talks about this, the official said.
	   Primakov emphasized the importance of the steel industry to his
struggling economy, but he didn't ask for negotiations or press for
resolution of the dispute, according to the official.
	   ``The vice president understands that importance, noted the
importance of steel to the U.S. economy, and said the United States
will enforce its laws,'' he said.
	   Among ``special points'' raised by Gore were American concerns
about a recent upsurge in anti-Semitic statements by Russian
politicians, the U.S. officials said.
	   A Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, caused an uproar this
month when he blamed Russia's problems on Jews in a speech laced
with ethnic slurs. President Boris Yeltsin chided his government
for being slow to react, and there were calls to ban the Communist
Party after it refused to condemn the remarks by Makashov.
	   ``Primakov expressed a shared sense of shock about the
appearance of this kind of sentiment in Russian political life,''
the U.S. official said.

	   DOI INTHANON, Thailand (AP) _ Stargazers in Asia sought high
ground and clear skies Tuesday to view the most spectacular
celestial fireworks in 33 years.
	   The Leonids meteor shower was expected to blaze forth in its
entire glory over Asia and the Pacific after midnight and into
early Wednesday, regaling millions with a heavenly display of
falling stars too numerous to wish upon.
	   The front-row seats were expected to be wherever the sky was
darkest and clearest _ from the Mongolian steppes to the mountains
of northern Thailand to U.S. research planes breaking through cloud
cover over Okinawa, Japan.
	   For millions of others _ those befogged by weather or living in
North America, where the spectacle was to reach its peak at midday,
the worst time for viewing _ the Internet was the place to be.
	   In northern Thailand, hotels, campgrounds and airlines were
booked solid with people expected to head to Doi Inthanon, the
Southeast Asian country's highest peak at 2,565 meters (8,464
feet), and Doi Suthep, another mountain with a famed Buddhist
temple on top. Police feared car accidents on the treacherous
mountain roads.
	   Monday night, stargazing early birds already had ascended Doi
Inthanon, curling up in sleeping bags under the chilly skies,
cracking open beers and making wishes as the streaking star-fall
came into view at about 1:30 a.m. (1830 GMT).
	   To a backdrop of ``oohs'' and ``aahs,'' 33-year-old Thamarong
Kudpong made his wish: ``I already have a daughter. Now, I would
like a son.''
	   Many in Japan were wishing Tuesday for the weather to clear. The
government called on public offices and private businesses in the
cities to turn off their lights after nightfall to enhance viewing
possibilities.
	   Tens of thousands of grade-school students across Japan began
preparing to observe the shower and compare notes through the
Internet.
	   In Thailand, police anticipated a rush out of Bangkok, the
smog-ceilinged capital, by people looking for a clearer view.
Alternative traffic routes were posted to avoid worsening the
evening rush hour.
	   A Thai newspaper was teaming up with an astronomer from
Switzerland to hold a star party, charging 1,500 baht (dlrs 40) per
head for food, drink and a lecture.
	   The celestial fireworks are actually the long tail of the Comet
Tempel-Tuttle. The shower is nicknamed Leonids because ancient
observers thought the meteors came from the constellation Leo.
	   It occurs every November, usually with little fanfare. But every
33 years, the comet speeds through the inner solar system and sheds
swarms of particles as it nears the sun. In 1966, the Leonids
display peaked at 150,000 meteors per hour.
	   Earth plows straight through the comet's wake as it traces its
own orbit. The shower of ``falling stars'' is actually the glowing
contrails of comet dust, or meteoroids.
	   Many of the world's 600-plus satellites have been maneuvered to
reduce the possibility of damage from the speeding grit, which can
poke holes in solar panels, pit lenses, blast away mirror coatings
or cause damaging electromagnetic pulses.
	   Russian space authorities said the crew of the Mir space station
was prepared for a too-close encounter and would enter the Soyuz
escape capsule when the shower was at its peak.
	   ``It is better to be on the safe side,'' Deputy Mission Control
chief Viktor Blagov was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   In Romania, the Bucharest daily Evenimentul Zilei said in a
front-page headline: ``Romanians, Stay Inside! Leonide, the
Toughest Meteor Rain.''
	   In China, observation points were only going to be manned after
midnight Tuesday.
	   ``The meteor shower began on the 14th and will continue until
the 20th, but tonight is going to be the best time to see it, so
we're only watching it then,'' said a staffer at the Nanjing Purple
Mountain observatory, who gave only his surname, Shi.

Peacekeeping commander prepares force for Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJUL, Gambia (AP) _ The commander of a West African
peacekeeping force said his troops were preparing to deploy in
nearby Guinea-Bissau to monitor a recently signed cease-fire
agreement, state-run radio reported Tuesday.
	   Gen. Timothy Shelpidi of Nigeria will oversee the coalition
force to be based around that country's capital of Bissau.
	   Shelpidi told officials in the Gambia that troops from ECOMOG _
the Economic Community of West African States Military Observer
Group _ will move into Guinea-Bissau from neighboring Senegal once
communications facilities are put into place.
	   Guinea-Bissau descended into civil war earlier this year when
the country's top military commander, Ansumane Mane, led a revolt
against President Joao Bernardo Vieira. Tens of thousands of people
were forced from their homes in Bissau during endless weeks of
shelling and rocket fire.
	   The warring sides signed a cease-fire pact in recent weeks and
agreed to have ECOMOG troops monitor the treaty.
	   Troops from the West African force will also provide security
for relief agencies working near Guinea-Bissau's northern border
with Senegal.
	   During a fact-finding mission to Guinea-Bissau, Shelpidi met
with both side of conflict to discuss the ongoing cease-fire.
	   ``Life is gradually returning to normal with markets now
functioning,'' Shelpidi said.
	   Mane's rebel forces control much of the countryside, while
Vieira has a foothold in the capital.
	   Shelpidi, a veteran peacekeeping commander, has also led ECOMOG
operations in Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Tape thought to be first Beatles concert recording to be auctioned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The recording was nothing more than a sound check,
and not even that pleasing to the technician in charge.
	   But 25 years later, the tape _ thought to be the first known
concert recording of the Beatles _ is expected to fetch up to
35,000 pounds (dlrs 58,000) when it goes under the hammer at
Christie's next month.
	   Irene Draper, 52, said her father, the chief technician at the
Bournemouth Gaumont in southern England, made the reel-to-reel
recording in August 1963 to check sound quality. But he was not
overly impressed with the recording band, so he left the tape in a
workroom and forget about it.
	   He only looked for it at his daughter's urging.
	   ``I nearly went through the roof when I heard it again after all
these years,'' Mrs. Draper told the Daily Telegraph. ``It brought
memories of those wonderful, exciting days flooding back. I knew it
was really hot stuff.''
	   The 25-minute, 10-song tape picks up the female fans' screams _
still muted at this stage in the Beatles' career _ as well as jokey
remarks by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, the auction house said.
	   The auction is scheduled for Dec. 10. Also for sale will be four
backstage photographs of the Beatles, expected to fetch 500 pounds
(dlrs 835).

Philippine protest greets U.S.-led rescue plan for Asian countries

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ About 200 protesters demonstrated
Tuesday outside the U.S. Embassy against an economic rescue package
the United States proposed on the eve of a meeting of Asia-Pacific
leaders in Malaysia.
	   The protesters, shouting ``Junk APEC'' and ``APEC is a
scourge,'' marched to the seaside embassy from a nearby park. Some
of them spat and stomped on an American flag.
	   Crispin Beltran, chairman of the left-wing May One Movement,
said the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum ``merely serves to
tighten the already stifling stranglehold of big business on
labor.''
	   ``The Philippines should cut itself off from APEC,'' he added.
	   Beltran said the trade liberalization and globalization being
promoted by APEC have only led to unemployment, rising commodity
prices and lower wages in the Philippines.
	   Teodoro Casino, vice chairman of the New Patriotic Alliance,
said APEC is just a ``meeting of exploiters and oppressors ...
discussing how they can better take advantage of people, and the
exploited people worldwide should unite against their plan.''
	   Casino also criticized President Joseph Estrada, a former actor,
for participating in APEC.
	   ``He thinks the APEC is like a movie, where he only needs to
memorize the script and be able to deliver his dialogue very well
to be a hit in the conference,'' said Casino. ``But in Manila, he
will surely be booed for APEC is a big mistake.''
	   On Monday, U.S. Vice President Al Gore announced a new dlrs 10
billion support package for the stalled economies of the hard-hit
Asian region. Half of the money would come from the United States
and the other half from Japan, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank.
	   The economic crisis, which began 17 months ago, has devastated
many Asian economies, spread to Russia and Brazil and led to
turbulence on the U.S. and European stock markets.
	   Critics say trade liberalization, which is being pushed by APEC,
will only benefit developed countries and result in further
hardship for people in developing countries.

Russian Pacific Fleet scraps whale-training base
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The cash-strapped Russian Navy has closed a
Pacific base that trained whales for combat purposes and sent the
last trainees to the Black Sea, officials said on Tuesday.
	   The base in the Far East at Vityaz Bay belonged to the Russian
Pacific Fleet and was used to teach various kinds of toothed whales
to detect enemy divers and carry out other tasks. Extensive efforts
reportedly were made during the Soviet era to train whales and
dolphins for military purposes, including attacking enemy ships
with bombs strapped to the creatures.
	   The government closed the base earlier this month, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said. The Russian military is cutting back because of
the country's financial crisis and a lack of funds for the armed
forces.
	   The last remaining five Beluga Whales called Bob, Bion, Mezon,
Momon and Jerry, were flown to the Black Sea and turned over to a
civilian research center studying sea mammals.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian conscript disarmed a guard, shot one of
his comrades dead and wounded another before killing himself
Tuesday at a southern military base, officials said.
	   The incident happened at a military helicopter base near the
village of Yagarlykskaya in the Rostov region, about 1,000
kilometers (600 miles) south of Moscow.
	   Military officials said the attacker, identified only as Pvt. V.
Borisov, was drafted last May.
	   There was no immediate word on the possible motives.
	   Russia's armed forces have been plagued by abysmal living
conditions and the ritual hazing of young conscripts by older
soldiers, contributing to frequent shootings and suicides.
	   According to official figures, 50 soldiers were killed by fellow
servicemen last year, and about 500 committed suicide.

China, Philippines try to reduce tensions in Spratlys conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from Philippine president
about meeting, Philippine official saying China is building
structures to reinforce territorial claims, other details. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The leaders of China and the
Philippines gave their support Tuesday to a plan designed to reduce
tensions caused by their dispute over a reef in the South China
Sea.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin agreed to settle the dispute peacefully, and
endorsed a proposal to form a group of experts who will work on
finding ways to build confidence between the two nations.
	   Estrada's spokesman, Jerry Barican, said the leaders also agreed
that natural resources in the area of Mischief Reef should be used
jointly by the two nations.
	   With those two agreements, ``we are confident the problem at
Mischief Reef can be solved diplomatically,'' Barican said.
	   Earlier this month, Manila lodged a diplomatic protest with
Beijing over the construction of various buildings on the reef
which the Philippines believes could be used militarily. The reef
is part of the disputed Spratly Island group.
	   China says the structures are shelters for Chinese fishermen and
the construction photographed by Philippine reconnaissance planes
was just repair work.
	   The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said he
appreciated the efforts made by Estrada ``to resolve the matter
diplomatically.''
	   ``The Chinese side has repeatedly stated our position on this
question,'' Tang said at a briefing in Beijing. ``We are always
committed to peace and stability in the South China Sea, and the
Chinese government sincerely hopes the Philippine side will fully
understand China's sincere position and handle relevant matters
calmly and appropriately.''
	   The Spratlys, which straddle vital sea lanes in the South China
Sea, are claimed in whole by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and in part
by Malaysia and the Philippines. Brunei claims one reef.
	   Estrada and Jiang are in Kuala Lumpur for meetings of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The Philippine leader, a former movie star who is attending his
first APEC summit, read from cue cards during his meeting with
Jiang, appearing nervous in his new role.
	   In Manila, Estrada's executive secretary, Ronaldo Zamora, said
Philippine reconnaissance flights would continue over the disputed
area despite Tuesday's meeting.
	   ``While we have received the assurances of the Chinese
government, we are nonetheless still making sure that we don't drop
our guard completely,'' he said.
	   He said China built the structures on the reef mainly to
reinforce its territorial claims.
	   ``I don't really think that it is intended to threaten the
Philippines or any of the neighboring countries around the
Spratlys,'' he said. ``It is basically to beef up their own claims
to the Spratlys.''

Schroeder: No additional German aid for Moscow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kremlin saying Yeltsin and Schroeder didn't
discuss aid, quotes from Russian official in new grafs 9-10. &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS RIETIG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called the
Russian government's economic rescue plan a ``good start,'' but
indicated Germany would provide little more than moral support in
Russia's latest economic struggle.
	   Schroeder, on his first visit to Russia as German leader, met
Tuesday with President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin. Yeltsin
expressed hope that Russia and Germany ``will enter the next
century with their relations developing at the same pace as now.''
	   ``I'm sure they will,'' Schroeder responded.
	   Yeltsin looked fit and spoke distinctly at the start of the
meeting after weeks of renewed speculation about the state of his
health. He curtailed meetings last week with the visiting Japanese
prime minister, prompting new speculation that he was seriously
ill.
	   Schroeder's predecessor, Helmut Kohl, had close ties with
Yeltsin, which helped secure significant German investment and aid
but also drew criticism from those who blame Yeltsin for many of
Russia's problems.
	   Schroeder insisted Monday that the relationship between Germany
and Russia must not rely too much on personal ties.
	   After meeting with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Monday,
Schroeder said Germany will not give Russia any emergency financial
aid outside the money it's providing through international lenders.
	   ``The possibilities are exhausted'' for additional German aid,
Schroeder said _ though he did bring 1.5 tons (1.65 short tons) of
medical aid with him, German officials said.
	   Yeltsin and Schroeder didn't discuss any German loans, speaking
mainly about mutual trade, which dropped this year, said Sergei
Prikhodko, Yeltsin's aide who took part in the negotiations.
Yeltsin expressed hope that the slump can be overcome soon, he
said.
	   ``We felt that the German side is ready to develop large-scale
economic cooperation,'' Prikhodko said, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government desperately needs foreign
aid to pay off its huge debts, but the IMF and other international
lenders have stopped releasing loans, saying they want Moscow to
start implementing a sound economic plan first.
	   Schroeder called Russia's economic rescue plan, presented this
weekend, a ``good start'' toward convincing international lenders
to resume aid. He stopped short of saying Germany would recommend
that the IMF release the money.
	   Speaking after a meeting early Tuesday with Gennady Seleznyov,
the speaker of the Russian parliament's lower house, Schroeder
again said the government's blueprint was a ``good basis'' for
talks on more aid, but added that Russia must make it more concrete
to meet the IMF demands.
	   The IMF has criticized the latest government plan as too vague
and overloaded with state controls of the economy. Schroeder urged
the Russian Cabinet and the parliament to ``find answers to the IMF
questions.''
	   Germany is a key member of the IMF, the World Bank and the
European Union, all of which have provided aid to Russia.
	   Schroeder and Primakov pledged that Russian-German relations
would continue to flourish.
	   ``We realize Germany's standing in Europe and the world and
retrospectively view the path it has traveled since the end of
World War II to its current prosperity,'' Primakov said.
``Naturally, we would like to learn more about your experience.''
	   Primakov also said Russia was eager to attract foreign capital
and would guarantee investor security.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who met with Schroeder on
Monday, shrugged off the influx of German money that has made
Germany Russia's most important trading partner outside the former
Soviet Union.
	   ``The relations between former Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin were a mere camaraderie. Now I am
counting on good business contacts and mutual understanding,''
Zyuganov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

Judge orders first execution in Philippines in more than two
</HEADLINE>
decades &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine judge has ordered the
country's national prisons director to execute a poor house painter
convicted of repeatedly raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter,
officials said Tuesday.
	   The impending execution of Leo Echegaray, 38, would be the first
since capital punishment was restored in the country in 1994. The
sentence for Echegaray has triggered a debate on the death penalty
that has divided many Filipinos.
	   It was not immediately known whether an execution date had been
set by Judge Thelma Ponferada of the Quezon City Regional Trial
Court, which convicted Echegaray of rape in 1994.
	   In an order issued Monday but made public Tuesday, Ponferada
instructed National Prisons Director Pedro Sistoza to execute
Echegaray by lethal injection at a date to be set by her.
	   Echegaray's lawyers said they have appealed to Ponferada to
reconsider.
	   The 1987 constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option to restore it for crimes such as murder, ransom
kidnapping, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Under the law that restored the death penalty in 1994, an
execution should be carried out not earlier than one year or later
than 18 months after a death sentence has been declared final by
the Supreme Court.
	   The Supreme Court, which automatically reviews all death
sentences, declared Echegaray's death sentence final on Feb. 27,
1997, thereby setting the date of his execution between February
and August this year.
	   However, the execution was delayed because of several petitions
filed by Echegaray's lawyers at the Supreme Court.
	   Echegaray is the first to be scheduled for execution among more
than 800 death-row inmates.
	   Proponents say the death penalty would deter crimes by
frightening would-be criminals. They say crime remains rampant
because no one among the death row convicts has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposing the death
penalty say there is no proof of that, and that the poor are
disadvantaged because they cannot afford good lawyers for their

Report: Boyfriend of dead Taiwanese politician can return to
</HEADLINE>
Taiwan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The boyfriend of a Taiwanese politician
who died in a Chinese kidnapping can return home to Taiwan after
agreeing to make himself available to testify in the case, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Wei Dan-kang has been informed by Chinese authorities he can
leave this week _ nearly four months after the death of Lin
Ti-Chuan, the United Daily News said. Wei also had to agree to
repay U.S. dlrs 2.48 million to companies in the northeastern
Chinese city of Dalian, where the incident took place, the
newspaper said.
	   The kidnappings were believed connected with a dispute over
money owed by Wei.
	   Lin's death introduced new tensions in relations between China
and Taiwan and reinforced perceptions here that Chinese officials
neglect the safety of Taiwanese in China, where many have business
dealings. Such incidents also have cut back on vacations in China
by Taiwanese people, officials have said.
	   Wei and Lin, a member of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party from southern Kaohsiung, were kidnapped on July 27. Lin, 32,
developed breathing problems after being given forced injections of
depressants and the kidnappers took her to a hospital in nearby
Haicheng city, where she died July 29, according to witnesses in
the case.
	   Wei escaped and reported the crime to police. Authorities had
barred him from leaving Dalian since then.
	   At least four suspects in the kidnapping have been arrested.
Nine more people were rounded up for allegedly harboring the man
suspected of plotting the crime, Huang Guangzhi, who remains at
large.
	   But details of the investigation and any criminal charges remain
hazy. The newspaper article did not say whether any of the
companies owed money by Wei have been charged with anything.

Air France flights grounded as two-day strike begins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France flights were severely disrupted Tuesday
after flight attendants began a two-day strike to protest what they
say are unfair salary differences within the company.
	   Air France said it would assure 55 percent of long-haul flights
and 60 percent of short and medium-distance flights during the
strike action.
	   A 10-day pilots strike in early June cost Air France one billion
francs (dlrs 166 million) before the main pilots union accepted an
offer of stock in exchange for pay.
	   The strike coincided with the arrival of hundreds of thousands
of people to watch the World Cup.
	   The pilots had been protesting 500 million francs (dlrs 83
million) in proposed salary cuts. Air France had said the cuts were
needed to provide capital to modernize the airline, which was saved
from bankruptcy in 1993 but reported profits in 1996 and 1997.

Governor of Romania's central bank likely to remain in job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's longest-surviving official
of the post-communist years is likely to keep his job for another
six years as head of the central bank, media reports said Tuesday.
	   Political leaders from the fractured ruling coalition said late
Monday they considered Mugur Isarescu, 49, the only person suited
to head the central bank.
	   Isarescu was appointed governor of the national bank in 1990,
just after communism ended. Known for his tight monetary policy, he
has survived five governments whose members' economic policies
ranged from leftist to liberal.
	   Isarescu needs parliament's approval in a vote next week.

 &UR; Arafat backs off plans to declare independence in May unilaterally &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes by Arafat and U.S. envoy;

 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Trying to resolve the latest crisis
with Israel, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday disavowed
violence and backed off plans to declare independence in May.
	   Arafat's clarifications came a day after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu suspended Israel's troop withdrawal. The Israeli
leader said he would not hand over 2 percent of the West Bank by
the end of the week, as scheduled, until Arafat retracted threats
to establish a Palestinian state in May and perhaps use force.
	   The Israeli Cabinet was to decide Wednesday whether the
Palestinians have lived up to their obligations and whether to give
the go ahead for the upcoming pullback. The withdrawal, the first
of three, was to have been carried out on Monday, but Israel has
fallen behind schedule because of a series of disputes and delays.
	   In all, Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by
the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian campaign against
Islamic militants.
	   The U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, said he was confident the
row would be settled soon. ``Both sides have obligations and both
sides, I think, will fulfill their obligations,'' Ross told The
Associated Press after talks with Israeli Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky.
	   Ross said Arafat assured him Monday night that he would
``correct what had been had been said and that he would make it
very clear that his commitment is to peace.''
	   On Tuesday, Arafat opened a news conference with German
President Roman Herzog in the West Bank town of Jericho by reading
a statement concerning the dispute with the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis,'' Arafat said.
	   ``Peace is a Palestinian strategic choice and any differences in
the final status negotiations, we stress that we want them to be
solved by peaceful means through negotiations, and not in any other
way,'' Arafat said.
	   Arafat had issued a similar clarification Monday night. However,
on Tuesday he went a step further by backing off plans to
unilaterally declare statehood in May, at the end of the five-year
autonomy period.
	   Israel and the Palestinians are to have completed negotiations
on a permanent peace agreement by May, but with many difficult
issues on the agenda, including final borders and the future of
Jerusalem, it appears unlikley the deadline can be met.
	   Arafat also stressed in his statement that such an accord would
be reached by peaceful means. In a speech Sunday to loyalists from
his Fatah movement, he had alluded to the use of force, saying that
``our rifle is ready'' to take Jerusalem.
	   Israel's parliament, meanwhile, was expected to give
overwhelming approval to the peace accord Tuesday evening, at the
end of a two-day debate. Netanyahu had kicked off the stormy
discussion Monday with the announcement that he was holding up the
withdrawal.
	   Despite the row, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met Monday
night, as scheduled, to try and conclude an agreement on setting up
a land route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   The head of the Palestinian delegation, Abdel Razek Yehiyeh,
said he expected all issues to be settled by next week, and said
the so-called ``safe passage'' could be opened within a month.
	   Another committee dealing with the release of Palestinian
prisoners was to meet Tuesday afternoon. Israel was to free a first
group of 250 prisoners, out of a total of 750, by the weekend.
	   Hisham Abdel Razek, the senior Palestinian on the panel, said
Israel was offering to release car thieves and workers who had been
caught in Israel without a permit, rather than prisoners held for
security offenses. Abdel Razek said the Palestinians complained to
the United States that this was a violation of the accord.
	   Ross was evasive when asked about the complaint. ``I think there
was an agreement that there would be 750 prisoners released, and
that's a commitment that will be fulfilled,'' he said.
	   In the first pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank are to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction, and
7.1 percent are to go from shared to sole Palestinian control.
	   Israel's government has not presented withdrawal maps. The
Yediot Ahronot daily published its own map and said most of the
land changing hands was in the northern West Bank, around the
Palestinian towns of Jenin and Nablus.

 &UR; 11-year-old defends junior title &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) _ Eleven-year-old Zowie Norford took
about 45 seconds to defend her Australian boxing title on Tuesday.
But it will take the controversy surrounding her appearance in the
ring longer to die down.
	   The schoolgirl from nearby Ipswich, Queensland on Tuesday danced
and threw enough round-arm rights against 12-year-old Veronica
Cameron of New South Wales to prompt the referee to stop the fight
and award Norford her second consecutive Australian sub-junior
39-kilogram (86-pound) title.
	   But whether she will be able to continue to follow the family
sport in Queensland, let alone Australia, will depend upon
politicians.
	   Prompted by the Australian Medical Association (AMA) and Health
Minister Wendy Edmond, Queensland Premier Peter Beattie said Monday
that cabinet would consider a ban on boxing for those under the age
of 18.
	   Norford, a Grade 6 student, said the controversy surrounding her
appearance and that of other children in the Australian Amateur
Boxing League (AABL) titles at a Southport club was ``stupid.''
	   ``I should be able to fight. It keeps me fit,'' Norford said
after the fight.
	   Norford, who has been boxing for two years, comes from a long
line of fighters _ seven uncles have been boxers.
	   While admitting she finds its hard to punch up friends in the
ring, Norford, who is protected by head, breast, groin and mouth
guards and uses softer gloves during the one-minute rounds, said
she has never been hurt in the ring.
	   However her words may not be enough with New South Wales state
already banning women in the ring and the looming threat of an
Australia-wide ban for those under the age of 18.
	   The AABL is the only amateur group in Australia which allows
female boxing after breaking away from the Amateur Boxing Union of
Australia (ABUA) 12 years ago. The ABUA refuses women or girls the
chance to fight. (djp)

Atherton has treatment on troublesome back
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Key England batsman Michael Atherton
had a scan and injection in his lower back Tuesday in a desperate
bid to be fit for the first cricket test against Australia
beginning Friday.
	   England officials said the former captain had been plagued by a
recurrence of the injury since early this month.
	   As Atherton underwent treatment Tuesday, England's hierarchy
declared fellow batsman John Crawley available for the Ashes opener
at the Gabba.
	   Crawley suffered cuts and bruises to his face after being
assaulted by an unknown man in Cairns in north Queensland on Sunday
night.
	   Atherton had back surgery nine years ago and suffered back
stiffness in the four-day match against South Australia in Adelaide
that started on Nov. 7.
	   England physiotherapist Wayne Morton said the opener had an
injection while in Adelaide but his condition deteriorated during
the four-day match against Queensland in Cairns that finished
Monday.
	   Morton was hopeful the former captain would be fit for the first
test but said much would depend on how Atherton responded to
Tuesday's treatment.
	   He said Atherton, who was restricted to light duties as his
teammates held a fielding session at the Gabba late Tuesday, would
only play if he was at least 95 percent fit.
	   ``He's probably played when he was captain a lot worse than he
is now,'' Morton said. ``But he's very well aware now that he's not
captain the responsibility changes . . . and he doesn't want to let
anybody down.'' (djp)

Opposition says Indonesia's president like autocratic predecessor

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A leading opposition figure accused
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on Tuesday of ruling with an
``iron fist'' like his predecessor and onetime mentor, Suharto,
following street violence in which at least 16 people died.
	   ``Habibie's government has started to copy the pattern of
Suharto's iron fist that oppressed the people,'' said Amien Rais, a
prominent Muslim leader who is also a likely presidential
candidate.
	   The International Monetary Fund, which is helping Indonesia to
overcome its worst economic crisis in 30 years, also warned Tuesday
that continuing civil unrest and political instability could
threaten its chances of recovery.
	   If financial markets ``think it's the beginning of a prolonged
period of instability, then it would affect the exchange rate and
capital would flow out'' of Indonesia, the fund's top official in
Asia, Hubert Neiss, was quoted as saying by Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Ignoring student calls for his resignation following last week's
deadly street clashes, Habibie went to the Asia-Pacific summit in
Malaysia Tuesday on his first trip abroad since unrest dislodged
Suharto in May.
	   But worried about Indonesia's volatility, Habibie said he would
commute to the two-day meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysian capital is a
two-hour flight from Jakarta.
	   ``I cannot stay overnight because I have a lot of work to do at
home,'' State Secretary Akbar Tanjung quoted Habibie as saying.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto, who is also the target of
resignation calls, accompanied Habibie to Malaysia, but said he
would stay for both days of the summit.
	   At least 16 people, including eight students, were killed last
week in protests and rioting in Jakarta that recalled the tumult
six months ago that ended Suharto's 32-year autocratic rule.
	   Habibie now faces calls to step down despite his pledge to
dismantle the rigid political system left behind by the 77-year-old
Suharto. Activists who want swifter democratic change suspect
Habibie is maneuvering to stay in power.
	   Rais, the leader of the New National Mandate Party and former
chairman of the second largest Muslim organization in Indonesia,
accused Habibie of adopting Suharto's hard-line methods, the
official Antara news agency reported.
	   ``Finally Habibie duplicates Suharto's manner to crack down on
the student protesters and mass demonstrations,'' Rais said to
several thousand supporters in Bandar Lampung on Sumatra Island,
about 250 kilometers (155 miles) west of Jakarta.
	   Rais also demanded that Wiranto quit over the student killings.
	   ``Wiranto has to take accountability as No. 1 man for security
order,'' Rais said.
	   Student anger at Habibie intensified after the deadly clashes
with security forces last week, which touched off mob rioting by
thousands of youths with no apparent political agenda.
	   Jakarta's streets were quiet Tuesday, a Muslim holy day and
national holiday. Red and white Indonesian flags flew at half-staff
outside houses, hotels and offices in mourning for the slain
students.
	   On Monday, Wiranto stood at Habibie's side as the president
appeared on national television and accused his opponents of
orchestrating the street demonstrations. Habibie has indicated he
will stick by his military commander despite outrage over the
killings.
	   The violence erupted near Parliament as a special government
assembly passed political changes that students said fell short of
true democratic reform.
	   Police said they had interrogated 18 opposition figures,
including two retired generals, over Friday's violence, the
official Antara news agency reported. Human rights activists said
the government was trying to create scapegoats for the bloodshed.
	   Most of the opposition activists questioned by police had signed
a petition recently calling for Habibie's replacement with a
transitional government led by a presidium of community leaders,
and for general elections to be held immediately.
	   In an apparent concession to opposition groups, Habibie has said
he would not block moves to speed up next year's balloting for a
new president. Habibie, who is expected to be a candidate, had said
earlier that a new president would be selected in December 1999.
	   Several leading opposition figures have demanded that the
national assembly vote for a president within three months of next
year's parliamentary elections, set for May or June.

Report:Russia proposes giant natural gas pipeline to China, Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The giant Russian Gazprom company has proposed
building a natural gas pipeline to China with the possibility of
extending it to Japan, the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Gazprom president Rem Vyakhirev told Russian journalists at the
APEC summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia that the proposed pipeline
would enable the compaly to deliver 30 billion to 38 billion cubic
meters of natural gas for 30 years. Construction would be
supervised by Russia and the project would be financed
internationally, he said.
	   ``We are ready to start designing and forming a consortium.
Russia is offering builders, scientific resources, machinery and
know how, while the financing would be international. Someone is
looking for gas, and we money,'' he said.
	   The pipeline would take three years to four years to complete
and be completed by 2004 at the latest, Vyakhirev was quoted as
saying. The initial project would cost about dlrs 15 billion, he
said.
	   The pipeline could be a first step to an Asian-Pacific natural
gas system similar to an existing network in Europe. Japanese
officials were studying the option of extending the pipeline to
Japan, the report said.

U.N. weapons inspectors arrive in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 2nd graf U.N. inspector's name to Jaakko Ylitalo. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors arrived in Iraq on
Tuesday and said they want to get back to work as soon as possible
to test Iraq's pledge to cooperate in the search for its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   ``We are back, we are ready to work immediately,'' senior
weapons inspector Jaakko Ylitalo told reporters shortly after his
C-130 transport plane landed at the Iraqi military air base at
Habaniya outside Baghdad just a little after 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT).
	   He declined to give details on his inspection work Tuesday.
	   Ylitalo was among the 86 inspectors from UNSCOM and the
International Atomic Energy Agency who flew in from the Gulf state
of Bahrain.
	   At the air base, Ylitalo asked an Iraqi official if the Iraqis
had prepared for the resumption of their work.
	   ``Everything will be sorted out as soon as possible,'' the
unidentified official told Ylitalo.
	   Asked by reporters if Iraqi officials were helpful, Ylitalo
said: ``We have no problems.''
	   Three Iraqi buses transported the inspectors to their
headquarters in Baghdad, 70 kilometers (44 miles) away.
	   Earlier in Bahrain, the inspectors said they were going to test
Iraq's promise to cooperate.
	   ``The Iraqi authorities have promised cooperation. Obviously the
next few days are going to be very important,'' said Caroline
Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
arms inspections.
	   She spoke as the 80 UNSCOM and six IAEA inspectors left their
hotel in Bahrain, where they were evacuated last week, for the
flight back to Baghdad.
	   With the threat of American and British air strikes on Iraq over
for now, about 150 U.N. relief workers also returned to Baghdad
from the Jordanian capital of Amman, where they were sent at the
height of the crisis.
	   Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to
Baghdad, said in an interview Monday that Iraq was being watched
closely to measure its resolve in cooperating in the search for
forbidden weapons.
	   ``Many members of the Security Council want the question of
Iraq's cooperation with the inspectors to be tested and proved on
the ground,'' Shah said.
	   He added: ``If Iraq cooperates fully and unreservedly with the
inspections due to begin in the next few days, the comprehensive
review to be conducted by the council offers a hopeful sign for the
future.''
	   Shah was leaving Tuesday for New York to brief Annan and council
members on the situation.
	   Ms. Cross said as she readied to leave Bahrain that the
inspectors were anxious to get back on the job.
	   ``We will be back straight to work today,'' she said. ``The
first thing we will be doing is getting the office up and running,
reassembling some of the equipment and computers that we dismantled
or brought down.
	   ``We will be out on inspections _ within a few hours maybe,
later today or maybe tomorrow,'' she said. ``We will be out and
about doing our work as soon as possible.''
	   Among the inspectors returning were 80 from UNSCOM, which is
searching for Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles, and six from the separate U.N. agency examining the
country's nuclear weapons programs.
	   Of the about 150 U.N. relief workers pulled out last week, the
first 31 returned on a special U.N. flight from Jordan, where they
were evacuated, to Habaniya military air base west of Baghdad.
	   The other 120 traveled overnight on a bus convoy through the
desert of Jordan and Iraq and arrived in Baghdad early Tuesday
morning.
	   The threat of military action was averted Sunday when U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced that the United States had
accepted the Iraqi government's pledge a day earlier to lift its
three-month ban on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Once inspectors report they are able to work effectively, the
Security Council will conduct a review of Iraq's efforts to
eliminate its dangerous weapons. The Iraqi government wants the
review to lead quickly to the lifting of U.N. sanctions _ a move
both the United States and Britain have resisted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated
Iraq's economy.
	   The council has said they will not be lifted until the U.N.
Special Commission and the Vienna-headquartered International
Atomic Energy Agency certify that Iraq has eliminated its lethal
weaponry.

Crawley back on field after assault

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Crawley training, changes overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ England's cricketers have been warned
to be on guard when walking Australian streets after batsman John
Crawley suffered cuts and bruises to his face when assaulted Sunday
night.
	   Still bearing facial scars, Crawley trained Tuesday in Brisbane
with his teammates after being punched in the face by an unknown
man on a Cairns street.
	   England officials were relieved Crawley's injuries were not
serious but said the batsman suffered a slight concussion as a
result of the assault.
	   Manager Graham Gooch said he had told his players to be vigilant
when out of team hotels as a result of the incident.
	   Crawley was returning alone to his team's hotel in Cairns about
11 p.m. Sunday after socializing with teammates and some Queensland
players. England won the match over Queensland by one wicket on
Monday.
	   Gooch said the 28-year-old was struck in the face by an unknown
assailant after being verbally abused.
	   Crawley was not wearing clothes that identified him as a member
of England's Ashes squad and team officials denied Crawley was
subject to racial abuse prior to the attack.
	   Gooch said he had spoken to Cairns police on Tuesday but Crawley
had insisted no action be taken.
	   He said the Lancashire batsman wanted to forget about the
incident and focus on the first test against Australia starting at
the Gabba on Friday.
	   ``It's done and there's nothing we can do about it,'' Gooch
said.
	   ``Having spoken to John, he wants to forget about the incident
and concentrate on his cricket . . . he doesn't want to take any
action as far as police are concerned.''
	   Cairns police spokesman Phill Tori said police should have been
informed.
	   ``We can't investigate unless these incidents are reported, and
the sooner we know about it the better chance we have of locating
those involved,'' he said.
	   Cairns Mayor Tom Pyne said Tuesday he would write a letter of
apology to the team.
	   ``I'd like to catch the bloke who did this and give him a good
boot up the backside,'' Pyne said. (djp)

Gore comments hit a sour note on streets of Malaysian capital

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In the streets of Kuala Lumpur,
U.S. Vice President Al Gore's heavy-handed criticism of Malaysia
hit a sour note among average citizens on Tuesday.
	   ``He should learn to exercise diplomacy,'' said businessman
Kamal Abu Bakar, as he stood curbside trying to flag down taxis
driving past the Renaissance Hotel. Gore and his delegation are
staying at the gleaming downtown hotel.
	   ``The vice president's merely encouraging demonstrators here to
riot with his below-the-belt comments,'' Kamal added, shaking his
head.
	   Gopal Krishnan, a retired Army officer walking past the
Renaissance Hotel on the way to a bank, was in an even scrappier
mood.
	   ``If I could meet Al Gore face-to-face, I would tell him to get
lost,'' he said, as he crumpled his tweed cap in his hands. ``What
right does he have, talking about human rights when people in his
country send their aged parents to old folks' homes to die?''
	   On Monday, Gore infuriated Malaysian leaders when he sympathized
with the ``brave people of Malaysia'' who are part of a growing
street protest movement that calls for an end to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule.
	   Mahathir sacked his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, on Sept. 2. Anwar's
subsequent arrest and alleged beating while in police custody have
outraged world leaders.
	   Anwar is standing trial on 10 charges of corruption and sexual
misconduct, allegations he denies and calls trumped up to undermine
his challenge to Mahathir.
	   Since Anwar's arrest, ``Reformasi,'' or reform in the Malay
language, has become the battle cry of the anti-government
demonstrations here.
	   ``In a way, I'm glad the U.S. vice president said what he did,
because I support reformasi,'' said a 35-year-old office-cleaner,
who was too scared to give her name.
	   ``But I'm also wondering why Gore doesn't criticize his own
boss, who's been caught with his pants down,'' she added, slurping
from a bowl of curry noodles.
	   Even the rare individual who backed Gore's comments wasn't
really happy, either.
	   ``It's all words, words, words!'' said senior accountant Ronald
Khoo, swatting a rolled-up Wall Street Journal against his palm.
	   ``For the U.S. to send a really strong signal to Malaysia, Bill
Clinton should order one of his aircraft carriers to drop anchor in
our waters,'' he said, standing near the Hard Rock Cafe.
	   Mail messenger Amran Ibrahim, 24, had a more expansive view of
the political fracas roiling Malaysia as he sipped a traditional
Malay frothy milk-and-tea concoction under a shady tree behind the
five-star Renaissance Hotel.
	   ``It's peaceful here,'' he said, gesturing to office-workers
standing in line to buy food from nearby stalls. ``What can we get
from reformasi? Only riots, fights and demonstrations.''

Sacked health minister in Congo under guard
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila's outspoken
health minister has been effectively placed under house arrest
following his dismissal in recent days, a member of his family said
Tuesday.
	   Jean Baptiste Sondji was sacked as health minister last week and
has since been ordered to stay at home under the watchful eye of
state security agents, the family member said on condition on
anonymity.
	   ``He can't receive any visitors and he is not allowed to leave
his home,'' the relative said.
	   Sondji, who for months urged the government to pay more
attention to public health and education, expanded his criticism of
Kabila's regime, saying the president had stifled debate on
constitutional reform.
	   ``This is not an issue for only a few individuals to discuss,''
Sondji said of constitutional reform, ``this is an issue for the
entire country to debate.''
	   Sondji was quietly dismissed from his post on Friday,
interrogated over the weekend and ordered to return to his home,
the relative told The Associated Press.
	   Earlier this year, Kabila had at least six cabinet ministers,
including the finance minister and the director of state
broadcasting, arrested on unspecified charges.
	   Kabila, a former rebel leader, came to power in May 1997 after
toppling longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   The new president promised reform and democracy in his renamed
Democratic Republic of Congo, but many critics say his regime's 18
months in power have seen repressive policies and a growing
intolerance for criticism.
	   Disaffected members of his armed forces banded together with
ethnic Tutsi insurgents earlier this year and launched a rebellion
against Kabila, accusing the president of corruption, nepotism and
tribalism.
	   The rebels marched to the capital's eastern outskirts in August,
but were pushed back to the country's eastern region by Kabila's
allies from Angola and Zimbabwe.

Inflation again hits government target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British inflation hit the government's 2.5 percent
target in October, the third consecutive month.
	   The underlying inflation rate has held steady since it dropped
from July's rate of 2.6 percent, the government said.
	   At the same time, headline inflation _ which includes mortgage
interest repayments _ rose 0.1 percent for the month.
	   The figures are likely to increase the clamor from manufacturers
and unions for a further cut in interest rates to protect jobs from
the continuing global financial turmoil.
	   The main downward pressure on prices was a fall in motoring
costs as a result of reduced insurance premiums and lower used car
prices, the government said.
	   The costs of clothing and furniture also fell because of heavy
discounting by retailers in the autumn sales.
	   However, the downward effect was partially offset by higher
tuition fees for new university students.
	   ``Today's figures show that the government is steering a course
of stability with inflation at its target level for the third month
in a row, and our public finances are on track to achieve a debt
repayment for the year as a whole _ the first time this has
happened for nearly a decade,'' said Stephen Byers, chief secretary
of the treasury.

Asian stock markets close mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
key indexes slipping in Tokyo on disappointment over Japan's new
economic stimulus package but surging in Manila on expectations of
a cut in U.S. interest rates.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 15.27
points, or 0.11 percent, closing at 14,413.00. On Monday, the
average had climbed 160.06 points, or 1.12 percent.
	   Traders expressed disappointment with Monday's stimulus package
_ the largest in Japanese history at 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196
billion) _ because it once again avoided the painful structural
reforms that they said Japan needs to put its economy back on
track.
	   Shares were also dragged down by Moody's Investors Service's
announcement that it had cut its rating of Japanese government
securities because of Tokyo's inability to fix its economy or
balance its budgets.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.62 yen in late
afternoon, down 1.52 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but above its
late New York rate of 120.07 yen overnight.
	   Philippine shares closed sharply higher, boosted by the peso's
steady appreciation and expectations that the Federal Open Market
Committee would cut U.S. interest rates again at its scheduled
meeting later Tuesday.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks rose
33.63 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,779.23.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 39.857 pesos, below
Monday's rate of 40.286 pesos.
	   Prices in Taiwan also closed higher for the third consecutive
session after the government-supported stock stabilization task
force said it would invest more than U.S. dlrs 8.7 billion in the
stock market over the next three months.
	   The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 128.03
points, or 1.8 percent, to 7,131.90.
	   In Hong Kong, share prices slumped on profit-taking.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 149.40 points, or 1.4 percent, closing at
10,148.69. On Monday, the index had surged 300.10 points.
	   Brokers said investors took profits following sharp gains in
share prices Monday due to expectations of a cut in U.S. interest
rates.
	   The market was closed in Indonesia for a holiday.
	   Elsewhere:
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The benchmark
NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 11.28 points, or 0.5 percent, to
1,987.50.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed mixed after cautious
investors stuck to trading blue chips ahead of the U.S. Federal
Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee meeting later Tuesday. The
All Ordinaries index rose 2.1 points to 2,676.6.
	   SEOUL: Share prices prices closed higher on optimism that the
U.S. Federal Reserve will further cut its interest rates. The Korea
Composite Stock Price Index rose 2.22 points, or 0.5 percent, to
424.43.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher on buying
interest by local institutional funds. The Composite Index rose
2.10 points, or 0.4 percent, to 464.12.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed lower, dragged down by Moody's
Investors Service's downgrade of Japan's debt ratings, dealers
said. The benchmark Straits Times Index fell 5.98 points, or 0.48
percent, to 1,235.76.
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed marginally lower as local
retail investors sold stock on expectations that the Federal
Reserve Board won't cut U.S. interest rates further. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index lost 1.11 points, or 0.3 percent, to
344.08.

 &UR; Arafat backs off plans to declare independence in May unilaterally &QL;

 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Trying to resolve the latest crisis
with Israel, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday disavowed
violence and backed off plans to declare independence in May.
	   Arafat's clarifications came a day after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu suspended Israel's troop withdrawal. The Israeli
leader said he would not hand over 2 percent of the West Bank by
the end of the week, as scheduled, until Arafat retracted threats
to establish a Palestinian state in May and perhaps use force.
	   The Israeli Cabinet was to decide Wednesday whether the
Palestinians have lived up to their obligations and whether to
allow the upcoming pullback. The withdrawal, the first of three,
was to have been carried out on Monday, but Israel has fallen
behind schedule because of disputes and delays.
	   In all, Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by
the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian campaign against
Islamic militants.
	   The U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, said he was confident the
row would be settled soon. ``Both sides have obligations and both
sides, I think, will fulfill their obligations,'' Ross told The
Associated Press after talks with Israeli Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky.
	   Ross said Arafat assured him Monday night that he would
``correct what had been had been said and that he would make it
very clear that his commitment is to peace.''
	   On Tuesday, Arafat opened a news conference with German
President Roman Herzog in the West Bank town of Jericho by reading
a statement concerning the dispute with the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis,'' Arafat said.
	   ``Peace is a Palestinian strategic choice and any differences in
the final status negotiations, we stress that we want them to be
solved by peaceful means through negotiations, and not in any other
way,'' Arafat said.
	   Arafat had issued a similar clarification Monday night. However,
on Tuesday he went a step further by backing off plans to
unilaterally declare statehood in May, at the end of the five-year
autonomy period.
	   Israel and the Palestinians are to have completed negotiations
on a permanent peace agreement by May, but with many difficult
issues on the agenda, including final borders and the future of
Jerusalem, it appears unlikley the deadline can be met.
	   Arafat also stressed in his statement that such an accord would
be reached peacefully. In a speech Sunday to loyalists from his
Fatah movement, he had alluded to the use of force, saying that
``our rifle is ready'' to take Jerusalem.
	   Israel's parliament, meanwhile, was expected to give
overwhelming approval to the peace accord Tuesday evening, at the
end of a two-day debate. Netanyahu had kicked off the stormy
discussion Monday with the announcement that he was holding up the
withdrawal.
	   Despite the row, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met Monday
night, as scheduled, to try and conclude an agreement on setting up
a land route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   The head of the Palestinian delegation, Abdel Razek Yehiyeh,
said he expected all issues to be settled by next week, and said
the so-called ``safe passage'' could be opened within a month.
	   Another committee dealing with the release of Palestinian
prisoners was to meet Tuesday afternoon. Israel was to free a first
group of 250 prisoners, out of a total of 750, by the weekend.
	   In the first pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank are to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction, and
7.1 percent are to go from shared to sole Palestinian control.

Lufthansa reports doubling in pretax profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Lufthansa doubled its pretax profits
to 1.98 billion marks (dlrs 1.23 billion) in the first nine months
of 1998 despite fierce competition and price pressure, the German
airline said Tuesday.
	   The large profit was expected after the company recorded strong
gains in earnings throughout 1998, benefitting from cost-cutting
measures and the building of a global system of alliances with
partner airlines in recent years.
	   Pretax profits in the first three quarters were up from 975
million marks (dlrs 609 million), Lufthansa said.
	   The airline said it was sure it would exceed pretax profits of 2
billion marks (dlrs 1.25 billion) for the whole year after raking
in 1.6 billion marks (dlrs 1 billion) in 1997.
	   But company chairman Juergen Weber warned leaner times may be
ahead.
	   ``The weather radar is not showing the clear blue skies of 1997
and the prospect of staying that way well into the next
millennium,'' he said at a news conference.
	   Lufthansa said a ``substantial'' 4.9 percent increase in sales
to 16.4 billion marks (dlrs 10.25 billion) from 15.7 billion marks
(dlrs 9.81 billion), coupled with moderate expenditure increases,
boosted earnings during the nine months.

Taiwan's offers of aid to Southeast Asia draw fire from China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER WONACOTT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ With offers of loans and
investment worth more than U.S. dlrs 1 billion, Taiwan is quietly
riding to the rescue of crisis-hit Southeast Asian nations, while
side-stepping a diplomatic row with China.
	   Taiwanese officials attending the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit have made a splash by unveiling a holding
company, Southeast Asia Investments Co., that will funnel U.S. dlrs
300 million into the region's stock markets and companies.
	   Its officials also are seeking to interest APEC countries in the
possibility of collateralizing and repackaging bonds for stricken
nations to allow them to raise much needed cash.
	   Although most of the money comes from private sources, the
government's high-profile backing of the measures at the APEC
leaders summit has generated Chinese criticism. Taiwan also is
negotiating a loan for Malaysia that would extend U.S. dlrs 1
billion as a prepayment for oil and natural gas.
	   Taiwanese aid must be restricted to non-governmental channels,
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told reporters at
the summit. ``Our position on this is clear cut,'' Zhu said.
``Taiwan isn't a sovereign state.''
	   Though Taiwan is a full member of APEC, its top leader,
President Lee Teng-hui, is barred from attending the forum's
summits at China's insistence and must send a stand-in.
	   China has claimed Taiwan as a renegade province since the sides
split in 1949, and refuses to recognize its government's legitimacy
or right to international relations.
	   In all, Taiwan has invested nearly U.S. dlrs 37 billion in the
Southeast Asian region. Despite the Asian crisis, Taiwan's economy
has remained one of the strongest in the region, an advantage it
hopes to put to use countering China's efforts to isolate it.
	   The timing and venue of Taipei's offers has highlighted what's
becoming an increasingly tricky conflict: how Asian leaders balance
their desperate need for cash - and Taiwan's willingness to provide
it - with a wariness of angering China.
	   The United States and Japan seem ready to leave Taiwan out of a
plan to create a U.S. dlrs 5 billion fund to restructure Asian
corporate debt. Taiwan has been a key advocate of such a plan, but
Tokyo and Washington don't want to anger China.
	   Chiang Pin-kung, Taiwan's top economic planner and Lee's
representative at the summit, called Beijing's efforts to block
Taiwan's aid efforts ``nonsense.''
	   ``These countries are very keen to have capital because of the
crisis,'' Chiang told Dow Jones Newswires. ``You mustn't forget
that we are a sovereign state. We aren't a part of China.''
	   Andrew Hsia, Taiwan's main spokesman at APEC, said ``Taiwan is
one of the few economies that is willing and able to do something.
We not only have the right, but the obligation.''

Israeli fundraiser tells U.S. Jews to keep their money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A leading Israeli philanthropist told U.S. Jews
to reverse the traditional trend of sending the bulk of fundraising
money to Israel and instead spend it on their own communities.
	   Dov Lautman, who heads the Israeli branch of the United Jewish
Appeal, the largest fundraising arm of American Jewry, said
American Jews must realize that Israel is no longer a poor country
in need of the intensive support it once received from Jews abroad.
	   ``We need to stop thinking of American Jews as those who give.
The vast majority of resources and the money that are raised there
should be used to strengthen the young generation there,'' Lautman
told the Haaretz daily.
	   The UJA raises about dlrs 1.2 billion a year, about half of
which it sends to Israel.
	   Lautman is presiding over the General Assembly, an annual
conference of North American Jewish Federation leaders. Attended by
some 3,000 North American Jews and 1,500 Israelis, the General
Assembly is being held in Israel for the first time as part of the
country's 50th anniversary celebrations

Japanese leader promotes his country's stimulus package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Japan's new stimulus package is a
first step toward its economic recovery over the next two years,
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Tuesday.
	   Obuchi said he was aware that Japan's recovery is important for
other Pacific Rim countries hit by the region's financial crisis,
and that he expects Japan's economy will begin growing again in the
fiscal year starting in April.
	   Japan's recession has reduced its purchases of Southeast Asian
products.
	   In a speech to heads of state and business leaders at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Obuchi also noted other
efforts Japan is making to help Asia pull out of recession.
	   He said Japan is committed to reforming its struggling financial
sector and to quickly implementing a planned dlrs 30 billion
economic assistance program for the region.
	   He also said a joint plan with the United States to create a
dlrs 5 billion fund to guarantee new Asian bond issues is a
``timely response'' to the region's problems.
	   Obuchi said he saw an urgent need to strengthen the global
financial system, and he welcomed studies by the International
Monetary Fund on global capital flows.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

Former Khmer Rouge rebels doubt reports leader Khieu Samphan is
</HEADLINE>
dead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Former Khmer Rouge rebels expressed
doubt Tuesday about reports of the death of Khieu Samphan, a
longtime top leader of the guerrilla group.
	   Thai military sources along the border and the Cambodian Defense
Ministry also said they could not confirm a report from the
Japanese news agency Kyodo that the veteran guerrilla had died in
the jungles along the Thai-Cambodian border.
	   Kyodo quoted ``a well-informed source'' in the Thai border town
of Aranyaprathet as saying an aide to Khmer Rouge military chief Ta
Mok had disclosed the death last week.
	   However, former rebel military commander Sok Pheap, speaking by
telephone from Poipet, opposite the border from Aranyaprathet, said
he had not heard that Khieu Samphan was dead.
	   ``He may be politically dead, but he is still physically
alive,'' Sok Pheap told The Associated Press.
	   Sok Pheap was a key figure in a massive 1996 defection of rebel
fighters led by former Khmer Rouge deputy prime minister Ieng Sary,
a move that crippled the Maoist movement.
	   Yim Phanna, a Khmer Rouge commander whose defection earlier this
year led to the government's capture of the rebels' stronghold in
Anlong Veng, also said Tuesday that he did not believe Khieu
Samphan was dead.
	   ``I don't think that it is true yet,'' said Yim Phanna, adding
that his troops in Anlong Veng have been instructed to gather
information on the whereabouts of the dwindling band of Khmer Rouge
guerrillas still loyal to Ta Mok.
	   Khieu Samphan, 67, has been the nominal head of the Khmer Rouge
for much of the past two decades.
	   The group's supreme leader, Pol Pot, died of an apparent heart
attack in April as the guerrillas were being driven out of their
last major stronghold. Some reports have suggested that Khieu
Samphan is being held against his will by Ta Mok, commander of the
remaining Khmer Rouge forces.
	   A team of U.N. legal experts is now in Cambodia to assess
evidence that could be used to prosecute leaders of the Khmer
Rouge, which has been blamed for the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians when it ruled the country between 1975 and 1979.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Confidence in Hong Kong is coming back, despite
the government's controversial intervention in the stock and
futures markets, a top Wall Street executive said Tuesday.
	   Philip Purcell, chairman of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Co.,
said that although foreign investors were shaken by the
government's foray into the markets, he was ``surprisingly
positive'' that Hong Kong's markets would remain free.
	   ``Everybody understands that the government was in a difficult
position,'' Purcell told a luncheon audience.
	   Purcell said Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang's recent
assurances to European and U.S. investors that the government was
committed to a free and open market were ``very convincing.''
Purcell said effective regulations and a liberal market were ``not
in conflict.''
	   Meanwhile, Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority, the territory's de facto central bank, said late Tuesday
that the threat of another speculative attack on Hong Kong's
financial markets ``has not disappeared.''
	   ``There are so many unknowns,'' Yam told reporters.
	   Yam added that the massive 946 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 122 billion) in reserves ``can be used again'' to defend the
currency's 15-year-old peg to the U.S. dollar if necessary.
	   In August, the Hong Kong government spent U.S. dlrs 15 billion
to scoop up shares and futures contracts in an effort to drive
stock prices up to levels at which speculators _ who bet the market
would fall _ would be stuck with huge losses.
	   Hong Kong officials said they were not concerned about people
betting on lower stock prices. But they said they had to draw the
line at speculators who were selling the Hong Kong dollar at the
same time, forcing Hong Kong to raise interest rates, and thereby
pushing stocks lower.

Judge orders Pinochet to appear in court if immunity overruled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A magistrate ordered Tuesday that Gen. Augusto
Pinochet must appear before a court Nov. 27 if a High Court ruling
awarding the former Chilean dictator immunity from prosecution is
overturned.
	   Pinochet, arrested here Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant seeking his
extradition to face charges of genocide, torture and kidnapping,
remains under police guard in a London hospital after undergoing
back surgery.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of secret police during his 17-year
rule after he ousted Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist, in a
1973 military coup.
	   A five-judge tribunal in the House of Lords, Britain's highest
court, has not yet ruled on Spanish and British prosecutors' appeal
of the High Court ruling awarding Pinochet immunity from
prosecution for any crimes committed as a foreign head of state.
	   On Tuesday, Magistrate Graham Parkinson also set Dec. 2 as the
date by which Britain's Home Secretary should decide whether a
Spanish extradition request can go ahead.
	   Alun Jones, a lawyer representing prosecutors, said Pinochet is
now fit enough to be discharged from Grovelands Priory, the north
London hospital where he has been recovering from back surgery.
	   Parkinson then said he wanted Pinochet to be brought to the
court as soon as possible.
	   ``Some people are more well-known than others,'' the judge said.
``That does not mean the court should treat them in a different
way.''
	   Under Britain's 1989 Extradition Act, people whose extradition
is sought usually have to appear before Bow Street Magistrate's
Court within days.
	   On Monday, Britain's attorney general blocked a fresh bid to
have Pinochet tried under British law for torture and
hostage-taking.
	   John Morris said there was ``insufficient admissible evidence''
to bring criminal proceedings against the 82-year-old general.
	   Lawyer Geoffrey Bindman, representing human rights groups, had
presented Morris with fresh evidence of alleged torture and
disappearances.
	   France on Thursday submitted an extradition warrant for
Pinochet, one day after a warrant arrive from Switzerland. Three
French families have filed complaints against the former leader in
France.

Controversial U.S. school in Czech Republic closed

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A private American school where
four staff members face cruelty charges has been shut down and all
its students have left the Czech Republic, the school's secretary
said Tuesday.
	   Martina Krystofova said that the Brno school's program for
troubled American teen-agers was officially ended as a result of
the police investigation.
	   ``We closed down because of the consequences the investigation
had,'' Krystofova said but did not elaborate. She said all the
students left for the United States.
	   Charges were filed last Wednesday against two American and two
Czech employees of the Morava Academy whom police said kept some
students isolated or tied up and prevented them from using the
bathroom.
	   School principal Glenda Roach and her husband Steven of St.
George, Utah, along with two Czech employees, were charged with
cruelty to people in their custody and with curtailing the
students' freedom of movement.
	   They face up to eight years in prison if convicted.
	   All of those charged are currently free. Steven Roach was
released on bail of 200,000 koruna (dlrs 6,600).
	   Investigator Petr Netik said Tuesday that police took measures
to prevent the American couple from leaving the country.
	   ``We, of course, did not take their passports away from them,
but we won't let them cross the border if they try to leave,''
Netik said.
	   He also said Czech police had asked the FBI for assistance.
	   The school in Brno, 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of
Prague, was run by the Morava Academy agency, partly owned by Ralph
Atkin of St. George, Utah.
	   The academy billed itself as a boarding school for American
teen-agers who were neglecting school and had problems getting
along with their families.
	   A lawyer for the American couple, Robert Bezdek, said the
children had serious problems at home, including drug problems.
	   Police interviewed 25 of the school's 57 students earlier this
month and eight complained of harsh punishments, according to
police.

For Russians, new space station can't replace the beloved Mir

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After years of cosmic misfortune, could there
actually be a flash of good news coming from Russia's sputtering
space program?
	   On Friday, Russia plans to launch the first leg of the biggest
space project ever _ the International Space Station, which is
designed to serve as man's home away from the home planet for the
next two decades.
	   The new station should be a godsend for the impoverished
Russians, masters of long-term space flight. Russia gets to play a
central role in the premier manned space venture at the dawn of the
21st century, while most of the money comes from the 15 other
participating nations _ the United States, Canada, Japan and 12
European states.
	   Yet Russia's beleaguered space professionals, who have endured
deep funding cuts, failed rocket launches and several near
disasters on the Mir, can't seem to shake that hangdog look.
	   They remain hopelessly enthralled with the Mir, that smelly,
leaky, fire-singed bucket-of-bolts that has made 70,000 loops
around the Earth over the past 12 years.
	   And when the new station goes up, their venerated Mir is
supposed to come down.
	   ``There was euphoria when the Mir was launched,'' said Viktor
Blagov, the deputy flight controller at Russia's Mission Control
ever since the Mir was sent up in 1986. ``We don't have that same
feeling now. Nobody in Russia wants to see the Mir de-orbited.''
	   Russia can no longer afford a space station, let alone two. And
NASA says the price for participating in the new station is to
discard the Mir, which is supposed to vanish into the Pacific Ocean
around the middle of next year if all goes as planned.
	   Plans aren't etched in stone, however. An aide to President
Boris Yeltsin, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, raised the possibility on
Sunday that the Mir might stay in orbit until the end of 1999 or
early in 2000, possibily even longer.
	   The Russians insist they are fully committed to the deal. But
the new station can only replace the Mir in orbit, not in their
hearts.
	   ``The Mir is old, but it could stay up for five more years,''
said cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyov, who must surely know as much about
the station as anyone. A veteran of five Mir missions, his most
recent sojourn ended in February after he performed several
spacewalks to patch up some of the station's most serious problems.
	   Russia's emotional attachment to the Mir may seem odd to
outsiders, who consider it the orbital equivalent of a rusting
jalopy. But through Russian eyes, the Mir has been an unequaled
success.
	   Expected to last just five years, it has demonstrated the
feasibility of long-term human habitation in space, taught crews
how to improvise during extended journeys, and served as the model
for many aspects of the new space station.
	   When the Mir is gone, the Russians will be without a major space
project of their own for the first time in decades. And playing
second fiddle to the Americans won't come easy to a country that
put the first satellite in orbit and the first man in space.
	   For both Americans and Russians, this transition from the space
race to a celestial embrace requires all sorts of compromises their
space agencies have never had to make before.
	   The Mir and the U.S. space shuttle have both handled
international crews, and while these efforts were successes, they
also highlighted national differences over what is safe and what
isn't.
	   When the Mir suffered a string of accidents last year, the
Americans expressed skepticism about its safety and debated the
wisdom of sending up another astronaut.
	   The Russians, meanwhile, noted the Mir had been afflicted by
more than 1,500 breakdowns during its lifetime and said the latest
problems, like earlier ones, could be fixed without endangering the
crew.
	   No single country will be completely in charge of the new
station, making it a mini-United Nations in orbit that will require
equal measures of diplomacy in space and on the ground.
	   A few examples:
	   _The cash-strapped Russians have repeatedly missed deadlines on
building the key service module, which will house the first crew.
Washington keeps putting up extra money, but some U.S. congressmen
are agitated over Russia's poky pace, which has put the space
station a year behind schedule.
	   _The Russians have the most experienced space fliers, but less
experienced Americans will command the crews. The Russians have
agreed, reluctantly.
	   _There will be two mission control centers _ the main one in
Houston, a backup in Moscow. But the Russians have been pushing for
more control over their equipment and their cosmonauts.
	   The new station is essentially a bigger, better Mir, but it
won't be crossing any space frontiers. Like Mir, it will endlessly
circle the Earth, and critics joke that its mission is to boldly go
where man has gone so many times before.
	   Friday's liftoff from Baikonur in the former Soviet republic of
Kazakstan will send up an unmanned propulsion component. The space
shuttle Endeavor is to carry the Americans' first segment _ a
connecting passageway _ into space Dec. 3.
	   The first crews won't board the station until late 1999 or early
2000, after Russia's behind-schedule service module is in place.
	   Some think those dates are overly optimistic.
	   ``Awarding the Russians such a large role appears to be a
decision that was driven by politics, rather than by space
engineering,'' said Geoff Perry, head of Kettering Space Observers
Group in Britain and a leading expert on the Russian space program.
``It's risky putting the Russians in charge of such critical
elements, because if they fail, it will set the entire program
back.''
	   There's even speculation the Russians are secretly pleased with
the delays, because it will allow them to keep the Mir aloft
longer. The Russians adamantly deny this.
	   The Russians say they have earned their role through years of
long-term space missions. In fact, the Russians balked several
times when they thought they were not receiving their due.
	   ``When the Americans suggested they control everything from
Houston, we were not in agreement,'' Blagov said in an interview at
Russia's Mission Control in suburban Moscow. ``Why should we go
there when we have everything here?''
	   Asked what he will do once the Mir is brought down, Blagov, a
39-year veteran of the space program, offered a wry smile and said,
``I will work with the Mir until I die with the station.''

Free-trade summit begins in Malaysia amid deep discord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with the goal of the APEC summit and to
TRIM the story at the bottom.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim leaders tried on
Tuesday to set aside a diplomatic furor set off by the United
States and to concentrate on Asia's economic crisis during their
annual free-trade summit.
	   But U.S. Vice President Al Gore's decision to sympathize with
the anti-government reform movement in Malaysia, the host country,
in a speech the night before the summit began appeared to leave
deep divisions among some of the 21 leaders.
	   In fact, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, the third
Malaysian official to condemn Gore since the speech, said it could
put the very heart of the Asian country's democracy at risk.
	   ``The action by the U.S. patently is not to advance the cause of
democracy and the rule of law, but to serve its own narrow
political agenda,'' Abdullah said.
	   The goal of the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit
is for its leaders to deal with Asia's worst financial crisis in
decades by adopting a set of recommendations that would help
restart economic growth and stabilize markets.
	   Before it started Tuesday, Gore and Mathahir briefly shook hands
as the prime minister greeted the APEC leaders in the Grand Salon
of the lavish Palace of the Golden Horses hotel.
	   But Gore and Mahathir quickly separated to talk with the other
presidents and prime ministers, as they gathered at the foot of a
massive revolving statue of rearing horses.
	   When the 21 leaders stood together for a photograph in the lush
garden with palm trees outside the hotel, Canada's prime minister,
Jean Chretien, stood on one side of Mahathir, and Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley of New Zealand on the other.
	   Gore stood stiffly at the far right end of the group in the
pre-arranged lineup.
	   The leaders then walked around a beautiful man-made lagoon built
on an abandoned tin mine, with Gore a few steps behind Mahathir.
Gore and Philippine President Joseph Estrada strolled together,
laughing and chatting.
	   Estrada was the only Pacific Rim leader to publicly defend
Gore's comments on Malaysia's political reform movement.
	   None of the leaders appeared to talk about Gore's speech, or
Malaysia's anger over the decision of other top APEC officials to
meet and sympathize with the de facto leader of the country's
protest movement, Azizah Ismail.
	   Earlier in the day, other Asian countries joined Mahathir in
criticizing Gore for making this the first of the six APEC summits
to ever focus on the internal affairs of a member country, or on
subjects such as human rights.
	   But Gore defended his speech Monday night to Asian leaders and
businessmen in Kuala Lumpur, saying that nations fighting off
economic crises must work as hard to promote democracy.
	   ``My point is very simple: these economies have some very
difficult choices to make for reform to move forward,'' Gore told
reporters as he began a bilateral meeting with Russian Prime
Minister Yergency Primakov. ``Democracy and freedom are the
essential prerequisites for making those kinds of decisions and
getting that kind of support.''
	   Gore's speech on the eve of the summit was mostly devoted to the
Asian economic crisis, which began 17 months ago. It has decimated
Asian economies, spread to Russia and Brazil and led to wild swings
on U.S. and European stock markets.
	   Gore announced a new dlrs 10 billion support package for the
stalled economies of the hard-hit Asian region. Half the money will
come from the United States and the other half from Japan, the
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   In a slap at the United States, New Zealand's prime minister,
Jenny Shipley, said Tuesday: ``It's not New Zealand's style to do a
megaphone diplomacy. ... It's critical that bilateral issues do not
get confused with APEC.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton had planned to attend the APEC
summit, but he sent Gore in his place while holding emergency
meetings in Washington about the U.S.-Iraqi standoff.
	   In the end, Clinton canceled an expected military attack on Iraq
for expelling U.N. weapons inspectors. Clinton still plans to
complete the last part of the planned Asian trip, including stops
later this week in Japan and South Korea.
	   Mahathir, who has been in power 17 years, is now Asia's longest
serving ruler after violent protests in neighboring Indonesia ended
President Suharto's 32-year rule in May.
	   Malaysia's protest movement exploded two months ago after
Mahathir fired and then jailed his former protege and now political
rival, former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Anwar was charged with corruption and sexual misconduct _
allegations he says are false and politically motivated.
	   Anwar's trial has been suspended during the APEC summit, but
officials from the United States, Canada, Australia and the
Philippines have met with Azizah, Anwar's wife.
	   They expressed concern over reports that Anwar was severely
beaten in prison and over the fairness of his trail. This has
delighted Azizah and infuriated the Malaysian government.
	   Two protests, one involving thousands of pro-Anwar supporters,
have occurred since the APEC meetings began last week, including a
violent one. But no big protests have occurred this week.
	   Several other APEC officials criticized Gore's speech, too.
	   ``In APEC, we should concentrate on APEC matters. We should
leave the domestic matters alone,'' said Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's
prime minister.
	   Thailand's foreign minister, Surin Pitsuwan, said: ``You have to
be very, very careful toward each other's feelings. We are here to
solve the (economic) problem and compare notes.''

<TEXT>
	   Some facts on the International Space Station:
	   ___
	   PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen nations, with United States and Russia in
biggest roles. Canada, Japan and European Space Agency's 12 member
nations also taking part.
	   ___
	   FIRST LAUNCHES: Russians send up first component, a propulsion
unit, on Friday. Americans launch their first module, a connecting
passage, Dec. 3. Because station will weigh 500 tons (450 metric
tons), it'll take dozens of launches to send up all parts; won't be
completed until about 2004.
	   ___
	   FIRST ASTRONAUTS: First crew _ American commander and two
Russian cosmonauts _ won't be sent up until end of 1999 or early
2000. Station will be large, but maximum crew limited to seven
because that's number of seats available on emergency escape craft.
	   ___
	   MISSION: Station will be biggest and most advanced manned space
mission ever, but will never stray far. It will remain in orbit a
few hundred miles above Earth for up to 20 years.
	   ___
	   COST: United States plans to pay dlrs 21 billion of project's
planned dlrs 40 billion cost. However, station already year behind
schedule and some estimates say overall cost could double before
construction completed.

As Russia's space program shrinks, its stars fade away
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-Russia's Space &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Anatoly Solovyov, one of the world's most
experienced space fliers, was at the peak of his powers last year
when he clambered outside the Mir to make the most sensitive
repairs ever on the accident-prone station.
	   Solovyov would seem a strong candidate to serve on the new
International Space Station, but he's leaving the Russian space
program as it continues to shrink in the painful post-Soviet era.
	   A compact man with a serious demeanor, Solovyov, 50, represents
a generation that shared in Russia's space triumphs for decades,
but now sees a future with limited horizons.
	   ``We have some of the most sophisticated space technologies, but
we don't have enough money to realize these ambitions,'' he said in
an interview at Star City, the cosmonaut training camp in a birch
forest outside Moscow.
	   Solovyov caused a stir last year when the Russian press quoted
him as saying he wouldn't fly on the new space station under a less
experienced American commander.
	   He says he never made the remark, but is quick to make a similar
point.
	   ``There are certain approaches that have been worked out for
centuries. For example, the captain is the most experienced sailor
on a ship,'' he said.
	   ``I'm not against the commander (of the space station) being
from any country, not even a small nation,'' he said. ``But it
shouldn't be an inexperienced commander.''
	   During his five Mir missions, Solovyov performed more spacewalks
(16) and spent more time in open space (80 hours) than any other
person. And he wasn't just admiring the view.
	   His last visit to the Mir began in August 1997, when the outpost
was plagued by breakdowns. Solovyov undertook a demanding series of
repair missions immediately, and there's hardly been a squeak out
of the Mir since.
	   Solovyov returned from the Mir last February, and will formally
retire at the end of the year. He already knows he'll miss the
flights.
	   ``The most memorable moment is the first time you are launched
into orbit _ it's like entering a new stage of life,'' he said. ``I
was also fortunate to spend many hours in open space _ and I didn't
encounter a lot of problems. This is something I recall with
pleasure.''
	   Solovyov isn't the last of Russia's hotshot cosmonauts, but the
job's glamour is gone.
	   In the Soviet era, boys dreamed of being cosmonauts more than
anything else. But a poll last year found only 1 percent of young
Russians want to be cosmonauts, no match for today's hot
professions _ business, accounting and computers.
	   It's hardly surprising. The space program receives scant media
attention in Russia _ unless the Mir has problems. A starting
engineer in Russia's space program makes the equivalent of dlrs 100
month.
	   Solovyov knows Russia can't afford an expensive space program of
its own and takes a philosophical view of the 16-nation effort to
build the new station.
	   ``There was a time for romantic space travel, and then there was
a time for space competition,'' he said. ``I think now is the time
of rational space exploration.''

Police brace for riots on anniversary of student revolt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More than 5,000 police officers took up
positions Tuesday to brace for expected unrest during events
marking the 25th anniversary of a student uprising against military
rulers.
	   The commemoration of the 1973 Athens Polytechnic revolt is
marred each year by riots and vandalism from self-proclaimed
anarchist groups seeking confrontations with police.
	   At least 23 people died and hundreds were wounded in the revolt
when the army stormed the campus on Nov. 17, 1973. The actual death
toll has never been firmly established, but it is thought to be
considerably higher. The revolt is credited with helping bring the
downfall of 1967-74 military rule.
	   This year's anniversary carried additional worries for
authorities. More than 100 arson attacks this year have been
carried out by shadowy organizations widely believed to be linked
to the Polytechnic demonstrators.
	   Two cars were firebombed early Tuesday in separate attacks. No
one was hurt.
	   The atmosphere has been further charged by a string of police
scandals and recent government education reforms that have led to
school occupations and teachers' demonstrations.
	   On Monday, Premier Costas Simitis was pelted with eggs and
oranges during a visit to the Polytechnic to lay a wreath at the
memorial.
	   Greece's constitution bans police form entering the grounds of
Athens Polytechnic or other universities except with the permission
of the academic senate.
	   Students and the Communist-led construction workers union
guarded the grounds of the Polytechnic in central Athens.
	   The commemorations for the revolt end each year with a march to
the U.S. embassy to protest Washington's widely perceived support
of the dictatorship.
	   In January, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns issued a public
apology for Washington's role during the junta. ``I wish my own
country had stood more firmly on the side of democracy and freedom
during those years,'' said Burns.
	   Greece's deadliest terrorist group, November 17, takes its name
from the day the student uprising was crushed. Four Americans and
one U.S. Embassy employee have been among the 22 people killed by
the group.

offering Germany his visual history archive of Holocaust survivors
as part of a memorial or museum in Berlin, a magazine reported
Tuesday.
	   Spielberg, in the interview with Stern magazine, said it would
be ``wonderful if I could contribute.''
	   His offer follows media reports that Germany's new center-left
government wants to bring part of Spielberg's Shoah Visual History
Foundation to Berlin instead of building a Holocaust Memorial.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's culture secretary, Michael
Naumann, has refused comment on reports attributing the idea to
him. He is an outspoken critic of the decade-old plan to erect a
giant memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe in the heart of
Berlin.
	   ``I hope to hear from Mr. Naumann,'' Spielberg told Stern. But
he said it was up to the Germans to decide whether they want a
memorial or a museum.
	   Saying that young Germans needed to learn about the Holocaust,
Spielberg suggested ``meditation rooms'' in which visitors could
watch filmed interviews with Holocaust survivors, of which his
foundation has compiled nearly 50,000.
	   ``You know, the Germans tend to isolate themselves in a vacuum
of shame, regret and guilt,'' Spielberg was quoted as saying.
``They should look around: There are also other peoples that have
gone too far and placed evil above good.''
	   Schroeder's government plans to let parliament debate the
Holocaust Memorial project before deciding whether to proceed with
it.
	   Spielberg directed ``Schindler's List,'' the story of a
non-Jewish industrialist who saved thousands of Jews during World
War II. He was awarded one of Germany's highest state honors in
September.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ George Saade, leader of Lebanon's largest
Christian political party who overcame right-wing opposition to
negotiate with Muslims an end to the civil war, died of cancer
Tuesday, his party said. He was 68.
	   Saade died at dawn at his home in the Beirut suburb of Nakkash
after a long struggle with colon cancer.
	   Saade, a Maronite Catholic who served as Parliament deputy for
24 years of his political career, was head of the predominantly
Maronite Phalange Party, Lebanon's largest right-wing Christian
political faction.
	   ``George Saade had never shirked from duty... He taught us to
love the country, but in his own way, that is, to love the country
for the benefit of the country,'' Munir Hajj, Saade's deputy, said
in a tribute after an emergency Politburo meeting Tuesday.
	   Saade's political life was marked by the extreme and moderate
positions he held toward Lebanon's internal Christian-Muslim
conflict.
	   At the beginning of the civil war in 1975, Saade joined his
party in fighting Muslim militias and Palestinian guerrillas. In
1982, the party _ founded by the late Pierre Gemayel, father of two
Lebanese presidents _ welcomed Israel's invading troops.
	   But in 1989, he led Christian lawmakers in negotiations with
Muslim politicians for a power-sharing accord to end the civil war,
which killed 150,000 people over 15 years.
	   Within his own Maronite community, Saade was criticized for
surrendering too much power to Muslims and effectively ending the
dominant role Christians had in government since independence from
France in 1943.
	   He signed the Taif deal despite objections from right-wing
Christian militants, risking a split within the party.
	   In his late years, he shed the party's pro-Israeli image and
acknowledged Syria's domination over Lebanon.
	   Born in the northern Batroun region on Nov. 21, 1930, Saade
studied law at the state-run Lebanese University, where he later
taught. He earned a degree in Arabic literature from the Lebanese
Academy and a doctorate in philosophy from Madrid University in
1955.
	   Saade was first elected to Parliament in 1968. He held the post
until 1992, when he and major Christian groups decided to boycott
parliamentary elections to protest the influence of Syria, which
maintains 30,000 troops in Lebanon.
	   In the 1996 parliamentary elections, Saade failed to win a seat.
	   He also held Cabinet portfolios for planning in 1973, public
works in 1974, information in 1975, post and telecommunications
from 1989 until 1992 when he resigned in protest against the
government's failure to implement fully the Taif accord.
	   Saade led the Phalange Party since 1986. He headed the Lebanese
Front, the main Maronite political coalition, in 1987 after the
death of its leader, former President Camille Chamoun.
	   He wrote several books, the latest of which was ``My Story with
Taif'' that criticized the way the peace accord was implemented.
	   Saade is survived by his wife, Lili Khazen, two sons and a
daughter.
	   A funeral will be held in Beirut on Thursday and Saade will be
buried in his northern hometown of Shibtin.

Serbian president to stage talks despite Albanian refusal

 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian President Milan Milutinovic
pressed ahead Tuesday with efforts to hold peace talks with rival
Kosovo Albanian officials despite their refusal to meet with him.
	   Serbian government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Milutinovic will travel to Kosovo's capital Pristina on
Wednesday on a mission the ethnic Albanians have dismissed as a
publicity stunt.
	   Milutinovic wants to chair long-sought direct talks with the
ethnic Albanians, with international officials in attendance but
not as mediators.
	   The ethnic Albanians refuse to talk without U.S. and European
mediation, saying only foreign countries could guarantee that an
eventual agreement would be implemented by the Serbian government.
	   They have turned down 16 such invitations in the past six
months, prompting Serb authorities to show up at the prearranged
site anyway to try to show their sincerity and the ethnic
Albanians' uncooperativeness.
	   The Serbian government says the troubles in Kosovo, where
hundreds of people have died and tens of thousands were left
homeless in its crackdown against secessionists, are Serbia's
internal matter and should not involve foreign mediators.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders said Milutinovic's call for talks is a
part of Belgrade's effort to reduce international pressure on
Serbia to find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo turmoil. He said
ethnic Albanians support peace talks, but not under Serb
conditions.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has been shuttling between
Belgrade and Pristina in an effort to find a compromise peace plan,
was to meet representatives of the Albanians' rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army in the province on Tuesday, guerrilla sources said.
	   The militants have refused any compromise with the Serbian
government, demanding outright secession for Kosovo.
	   Kosovo Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova, meanwhile, also
advocates independence but is willing to negotiate a possible
three-year interim period during which Kosovo would regain the
autonomy it had stripped by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
in 1989.
	   Serbian state-run media reported Tuesday that Milosevic's ruling
Socialist Party gave full support to Milutinovic in his attempts to
hold the talks.
	   But the opposition Democratic Party said Milutinovic's call for
the talks is ``the sowing of mist'' which is aimed at fooling the
public at home and abroad.

	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ President Robert Kocharian made a spate
of replacements in his government Tuesday, saying new people were
needed to tackle the country's problems.
	   But while economic problems _ including 20 percent unemployment
and widespread poverty _ are among Armenia's most pressing,
officials said no changes in the government's economic policy were
planned.
	   According to decrees signed by Kocharian, Former Deputy Finance
and Economics Minister Meruzhan Mikayelian was appointed energy
minister.
	   Gaik Gevorkian, former head of the Orbit engineering firm, was
named minister for industry and trade, officials said.
	   Gaik Nikogosian, director of the Yerevan Diagnostic Center, was
appointed health minister.
	   Former Deputy Defense Minister Gevork Vardanian was named
environmental protection minister.
	   Kocharian also dismissed Minister for Pressing Issues Shagen
Karamanukian, and abolished the post. The duties were handed over
to Territorial Management Minister David Zadonian, officials said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim leaders strolled along
a tropical lake Tuesday, trying desperately to put a friendly face
on a summit rocked by political sniping and a failed trade pact.
	   The 21-leaders met for a group picture and to mingle in the
gardens of the opulent Palace of the Golden Horses hotel on the
first of their two-day meeting.
	   The event was designed to showcase the unity of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, but signs of dissonance drew the most
attention.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad greeted all the
leaders as they came down a grand stair case from the hotel lobby.
	   Mahathir tugged on his right ear and adjusted his tie as U.S.
Vice President Al Gore approached. The two men shook hands stiffly
and briefly _ then promptly ignored each other.
	   The night before, Gore enraged the Malaysian political and
business community by praising the ``brave people of Malaysia'' for
their political reform movement _ one whose goal is to end
Mahathir's 17-year leadership.
	   Some of the other leaders attending the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum slammed Gore for his comments, saying they were
undiplomatic and even rude.
	   ``You don't necessarily achieve desirable outcomes by constantly
hectoring other nations in order to change the way they run their
lives,'' snapped Australian Prime Minister John Howard.
	   Lining up for the annual leaders' photo, Gore stood stiffly near
the far right of the line of heads-of-state, speaking neither to
Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai to his right, or the the
Vietnamese prime minister, Phan Van Khai, to his left.
	   At the center of the line, Mahathir was flanked by Canada's
prime minister, Jean Chretien, and Prime Minister Jenny Shipley of
New Zealand. Custom dictates that the former and coming APEC hosts
stand on either side of the current one. The seventh annual summit
will be held in New Zealand.
	   As the leaders walked away from the from the line, Mahathir
moved to the front of the group, chatting with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and the leader of Brunei, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.
	   Gore fell to the back of the group as they attempted to mingle
during a walk-about around a beautiful manmade lagoon, built on an
abandoned tin mine.
	   The U.S. vice president looked up and waved to guests looking
out from rooms overlooking the gardens.
	   Hotel staff were heard complaining that the large security
details scattered throughout the 480-room hotel kept most of them
from catching a glimpse of any of the leaders.
	   Gore strolled together with Philippine President Joseph Estrada.
	   Estrada, the former movie actor who took office in June, was the
only Pacific Rim leader on Tuesday to defend Gore's comments on
Malaysia's political reform movement and the two laughed often as
they walked.
	   Above the gardens, in the hotel's corner-towers, security
officers scanned the perimeter of the lavish grounds with
binoculars.
	   The hotel, famous for its Moorish architecture and the carved
monkeys that appear on its concrete pillars, was the main venues
for the Nov. 17-18 leader's summit, and a host of meetings by
lower-ranking officials beforehand.
	   ``It's a beautiful hotel, just beautiful,'' Gore commented to
owner Lee Kim Yuh just before stepping into the first session of
the summit.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's best-known batsman says he
has revised his batting technique because bowlers are familiar with
his style.
	   From obscurity in a fishing village a few years ago, Sanath
Jayasuriya has risen to earn the nickname ``master blaster'' and
has put Sri Lanka on the top in world cricket.
	   During the recently concluded three-nation tournament in the
Middle East, Jayasuriya failed to live up to his reputation.
Jayasuriya says bowlers have have concentrated on his weak points,
going round the wicket to tap him leg before or hit his stumps.
	   Jayasuriya won't spell out his new technique, but he promised
reporters on Monday that he is determined to play the role of Sri
Lanka's main batting stay in future tournaments. Sri Lanka is
scheduled to go to Australia in January.
	   During the 1996 World Cup, Jayasuriya clobbered the ball with
ease for a hundred boundaries. The same year he traveled to
Pakistan with a Sri Lankan-B team and scored two centuries.
	   Although a gifted all-rounder, he is particularly good at
batting. He relishes one-day games and his ability to hit over the
top in the early overs has given his side a tremendous impetus.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A magistrate ordered Tuesday that Gen. Augusto
Pinochet must appear before a court Nov. 27 if a High Court ruling
awarding the former Chilean dictator immunity from prosecution is
overturned.
	   Pinochet, arrested here Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant seeking his
extradition to face charges of genocide, torture and kidnapping,
remains under police guard in a London hospital after undergoing
back surgery.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of secret police during his 17-year
rule after he ousted Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist, in a
1973 military coup.
	   A five-judge tribunal in the House of Lords, Britain's highest
court, has not yet ruled on Spanish and British prosecutors' appeal
of the High Court ruling awarding Pinochet immunity from
prosecution for any crimes committed as a foreign head of state.
	   On Tuesday, Magistrate Graham Parkinson also set Dec. 2 as the
date by which Britain's Home Secretary should decide whether a
Spanish extradition request can go ahead.
	   Alun Jones, a lawyer representing prosecutors, said Pinochet is
now fit enough to be discharged from Grovelands Priory, the north
London hospital where he has been recovering from back surgery.
	   Parkinson then said he wanted Pinochet to be brought to the
court as soon as possible.
	   ``Some people are more well-known than others,'' the judge said.
``That does not mean the court should treat them in a different
way.''
	   Under Britain's 1989 Extradition Act, people whose extradition
is sought usually have to appear before Bow Street Magistrate's
Court within days.
	   Pinochet, however, was arrested in a hospital bed and granted
bail on condition he remain in the hospital.
	   On Wednesday, the High Court will rule on altering the bail
conditions to let Pinochet be brought to court. There was no word
on where he would stay if discharged from the hospital.

Griqualand to put West Indies to bat again

	   KIMBERLEY, South Africa (AP) _ South African Test candidate Pat
Symcox blasted 50 runs off just 22 deliveries to end West Indies'
hopes of a quick victory over Griqualand West on Tuesday, the last
day of a four-day match.
	   The home side passed their target score of 195 to make West
Indies bat again, for a total of 258 in seven wickets at lunch.
	   At the wicket for 28 minutes, the 38-year-old veteran was
particularly severe on Shivnarine Chanderpaul, carting two overs
from the part-time legspinner for 43 runs.
	   Symcox's performance overshadowed a defiant sixth-wicket
partnership of 94 between overnight pairing Piet Barnard and Finley
Brooker, which made it all possible.
	   Barnard batted for 192 minutes for his 76 and together with
Brooker had taken his side to within two runs of avoiding an
innings defeat.
	   West Indies start their first Test with South Africa on Nov. 29,
and have one more match with the provincial Free State before then.
	   Griqualand West scored 271 in first innings, while West Indies
hold 466.

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ The latest dispute between Israel and
the Palestinians appeared resolved Tuesday after Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat disavowed violence and backed off plans to declare
independence in May.
	   Arafat's clarifications came a day after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu suspended Israel's troop withdrawal. The Israeli
leader said he would not hand over 2 percent of the West Bank by
the end of the week, as scheduled, until Arafat retracted threats
to establish a Palestinian state in May and perhaps use force.
	   After reviewing the Arafat statements, Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan said that Tuesday that the prime minister ``considers
this a retraction.''

Air France flights grounded as two-day strike begins

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France flights were severely disrupted Tuesday
after flight attendants began a two-day strike to protest what they
say are unfair salary differences within the company.
	   Air France said it would guarantee 55 percent of long-haul
flights and 60 percent of short and medium-distance flights during
the strike action.
	   The flight attendants are demanding that the company scrap a
two-tier salary scheme under which staff hired since December 1995
earn less than their counterparts.
	   The strike was called by six unions.
	   A 10-day pilots strike in early June cost Air France one billion
francs (dlrs 166 million) before the main pilots union accepted an
offer of stock in exchange for salary freezes.
	   The strike coincided with the arrival of hundreds of thousands
of people to watch the World Cup.
	   The pilots had been protesting 500 million francs (dlrs 83
million) in proposed salary cuts. Air France had said the cuts were
needed to provide capital to modernize the airline, which was saved
from bankruptcy in 1993 but reported profits in 1996 and 1997.

U.S., Italy, five other teams fined for loose shirts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Volleyball's world governing body fined defending
champion Italy, the United States and five other teams dlrs 3,000
each Tuesday for what it deemed sloppy dress in the current men's
world championships.
	   The body, FIVB, had taken similar action Nov. 6 against five
women's teams for not meeting new uniform standards for
international competition.
	   In announcing fines against the Italian, U.S., Argentina,
Brazilian, Polish, Russian and Turkish men's teams, the FIVB said
``their shirts did not fit the body and were too loose.''
	   There were no protests against the punishment, said Yoichi
Izawa, an official of the FIVB.
	   The verdict against the women's teams from Russia, Brazil,
Bulgaria, Croatia and Italy was shirts that were ``too loose and
baggy.'' Cuba defended its world women's championship last
Thursday, beating China in the final.
	   Izawa said the men's team fines were decided by the tournament's
control committee after a three-day preliminary round among 24
teams, which ended Sunday.
	   Of the teams that were fined, five have advanced to the 16-team
second round that starts Wednesday _ Italy, the United States,
Argentina, Brazil and Russia.
	   Also in the second round are Spain, Japan, Cuba, Bulgaria,
Canada, South Korea, Yugoslavia, the Netherlands, China, Greece and
Ukraine.
	   FIVB said the fines will be deducted from each team's prize
money.
	   The winning team receives dlrs 200,000 from a purse of dlrs 1.2
million.
	   In addition, dlrs 1 million in prizes will be awarded to
individual players, including dlrs 100,000 for the one chosen world
best.
	   The semifinals and finals will be played in Tokyo Nov. 28-29.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The world's newest automaker, DaimlerChrysler
AG, officially became a member of the global business community on
Tuesday when its shares began trading on the Frankfurt stock
exchange, shortly before their debut on Wall Street.
	   Celebrations were planned at DaimlerChrysler plants and offices
worldwide.
	   But when the ``Day One'' hoopla is over, ``Job One'' will
remain: the daunting task of truly melding the corporate cultures
of two distinctly different German and American corporations into
one international transportation powerhouse.
	   ``From the very beginning, that has been their major
challenge,'' said David Cole, director of the University of
Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. ``How
do you bring them together and get them to function on the same
team?
	   ``I think it's doable, but it's going to be very challenging.''
	   On the Frankfurt exchange, DaimlerChrysler shares were steady on
their first official day of trading Tuesday. Analysts said that
reflected investors' satisfaction with the merger process so far.
	   By late morning, the share price was at 142.85 marks (dlrs 85)
in electronic trading, up 1.95 marks (dlrs 1.16), or 1.4 percent,
from the day's start.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A leading Israeli philanthropist told U.S. Jews
to reverse the traditional trend of sending the bulk of fundraising
money to Israel and instead spend it on their own communities.
	   Dov Lautman, who heads the Israeli branch of the United Jewish
Appeal, the largest fundraising arm of American Jewry, said
American Jews must realize that Israel is no longer a poor country
in need of the intensive support it once received from Jews abroad.
	   ``We need to stop thinking of American Jews as those who give.
The vast majority of resources and the money that are raised there
should be used to strengthen the young generation there,'' Lautman
said in an interview with the Haaretz daily published Tuesday.
	   The UJA raises about dlrs 1.2 billion a year, about half of
which it sends to Israel.
	   Lautman is presiding over the General Assembly, an annual
conference of North American Jewish Federation leaders. Attended by
some 3,000 North American Jews and 1,500 Israelis, the General
Assembly which began Monday and ends Thursday, is being held in
Israel for the first time as part of the country's 50th anniversary
celebrations.

	   In all, Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by
the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian campaign against
Islamic militants.
	   The U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, said earlier Tuesday he was
confident the row would be settled soon. ``Both sides have
obligations and both sides, I think, will fulfill their
obligations,'' Ross told The Associated Press after talks with
Israeli Trade Minister Natan Sharansky.
	   Ross said Arafat assured him Monday night that he would
``correct what had been had been said and that he would make it
very clear that his commitment is to peace.''
	   On Tuesday, Arafat opened a news conference with German
President Roman Herzog in the West Bank town of Jericho by reading
a statement concerning the dispute with the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis,'' Arafat said.
	   ``Peace is a Palestinian strategic choice and any differences in
the final status negotiations, we stress that we want them to be
solved by peaceful means through negotiations, and not in any other
way,'' Arafat said.
	   Arafat had issued a similar clarification Monday night. However,
on Tuesday he went a step further by appearing to be backing off
plans to unilaterally declare statehood in May, at the end of the
five-year autonomy period.
	   Israel and the Palestinians are to have completed negotiations
on a permanent peace agreement by May, but with many difficult
issues on the agenda, including final borders and the future of
Jerusalem, it appears unlikley the deadline can be met.
	   Arafat also stressed in his statement that such an accord would
be reached by peaceful means. In a speech Sunday to loyalists from
his Fatah movement, he had alluded to the use of force, saying that
``our rifle is ready'' to take Jerusalem.
	   Israel's parliament, meanwhile, was expected to give
overwhelming approval to the peace accord Tuesday evening, at the
end of a two-day debate.
	   Despite the row, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met Monday
night, as scheduled, to try and conclude an agreement on setting up
a land route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   The head of the Palestinian delegation, Abdel Razek Yehiyeh,
said he expected all issues to be settled by next week, and said
the so-called ``safe passage'' could be opened within a month.
	   Another committee dealing with the release of Palestinian
prisoners was to meet Tuesday afternoon. Israel was to free a first
group of 250 prisoners, out of a total of 750, by the weekend.
	   In the first pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank are to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction, and
7.1 percent are to go from shared to sole Palestinian control.
	   Israel's government has not presented withdrawal maps. The
Yediot Ahronot daily published its own map and said most of the
land changing hands was in the northern West Bank, around the
Palestinian towns of Jenin and Nablus.

OECD: Greece needs more belt-tightening to qualify for EMU
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's needs more fiscal belt-tightening
if it hopes to qualify for European economic and monetary union,
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said
Tuesday.
	   In its semi-annual economic outlook, the OECD said Greece will
not hit its inflation target of 2.5 percent at the end of 1999
unless it further cuts spending and restrains wage increases.
	   It predicted that inflation will slow to an average of 4.8
percent in 1998 and 3.0 percent in 1999.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member European Union which
failed to qualify for the first round of EMU, with the Socialist
government vowing to be ready to join the single currency club by
2001. Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted out of joining in the first
round.
	   ``The key risk regards the pace of inflation reduction,'' the
Paris-based agency said. ``Macro-economic policies will need to be
tightened further to reduce inflation to the Maastricht target by
mid-2000.''
	   But the OECD did say Greece's economic activity should expand
over the next two years, although the growth is below the
government's expectations.
	   According to the agency, economic growth will accelerate to 3.2
percent in 1999 and 3.4 percent in 2000, from an estimated 3.0
percent in 1998. Greece's estimates were 3.7 percent in 1999 and
3.9 percent in 2000.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with lawyers saying they will seek U.N. help
to try to stop execution; Echegaray wouldn't be informed of
impending death until execution day; CORRECTS spelling of judge's
name to Ponferrada &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine judge has ordered the
country's national prisons director to execute a poor house painter
convicted of repeatedly raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter,
officials said Tuesday.
	   The impending execution of Leo Echegaray, 38, would be the first
since capital punishment was restored in the country in 1994. The
sentence for Echegaray has triggered a debate on the death penalty
that has divided many Filipinos.
	   It was not immediately known whether an execution date had been
set by Judge Thelma Ponferrada of the Quezon City Regional Trial
Court, which convicted Echegaray of rape in 1994.
	   In an order issued Monday but made public Tuesday, Ponferrada
instructed National Prisons Director Pedro Sistoza to execute
Echegaray by lethal injection at a date to be set by her.
	   Echegaray's lawyers said they have appealed to Ponferrada to
reconsider.
	   Lawyer Theodore Te said Echegaray's execution would be premature
because another appeal is before the Supreme Court.
	   Maria Socorro Diokno, secretary-general of the Free Legal
Assistance Group, which also provides legal counsel to Echegaray,
said the group plans to seek the help of the United Nations special
rapporteur on extra-judicial, summary and arbitrary execution to
try to stop the execution.
	   Diokno's group earlier petitioned the Supreme Court to declare
death by lethal injection unconstitutional and inhuman, but the
court rejected that.
	   The 1987 constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option to restore it for crimes such as murder, ransom
kidnapping, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Under the law that restored the death penalty in 1994, an
execution should be carried out not earlier than one year or later
than 18 months after a death sentence has been declared final by
the Supreme Court.
	   The Supreme Court, which automatically reviews all death
sentences, declared Echegaray's sentence final on Feb. 27, 1997,
thereby setting the date of his execution between February and
August this year.
	   However, the execution was delayed due to several petitions
filed by Echegaray's lawyers at the Supreme Court.
	   Under government rules, the execution should be set on a working
day. Echegaray would not be informed of date until after sunrise of
execution day, a prohibition described by his lawyers as inhuman.
	   ``If that's really his fate to be executed, it's going to be
very hard for him to prepare and that is the inhumanity of the
thing,'' Te said. ``His relatives, his friends, his supporters,
people who care for him, will not be in a position to help him on
that very day.''
	   Echegaray is the first to be scheduled for execution among more
than 800 death-row inmates.
	   Proponents say the death penalty would deter crimes by
frightening would-be criminals. They say crime remains rampant
because no one among the death row convicts has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposing the death
penalty say there is no proof of that, and that the poor are
disadvantaged because they cannot afford good lawyers for their
defense.
	   President Joseph Estrada has rejected an appeal from the bishops
to change his decision not to pardon Echegaray.

Stock Average slipped 15.27 points, or 0.11 percent, closing at
14,413.00. Traders expressed disappointment with Monday's
24-trillion yen (dlrs 196-billion) stimulus package because it once
again avoided painful structural reforms they said Japan needs.
Shares were also dragged down by Moody's Investors Service's
decision to cut its rating of Japanese government securities. The
U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.62 yen in late afternoon, down 1.52
yen from late Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
120.07 yen overnight. Philippine shares closed sharply higher,
boosted by the peso's steady appreciation and expectations of a
U.S. interest rate cut on Tuesday. The Philippine Stock Exchange
index of 30 selected stocks rose 33.63 points, or 1.9 percent, to
1,779.23. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A leading ratings agency cut its assessment of the
creditworthiness of the Japanese government Tuesday in the latest
sign of growing dissatisfaction with Tokyo's management of its
economy. Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its rating of all
securities issued or guaranteed by the Japanese government by one
notch from the highest rating of Aaa to Aa1. ``The rating actions
were taken because of the uncertainties and heightened risks over
the long term arising from economic and policy weaknesses,'' the
U.S.-based agency said in a statement. The move was a vote of no
confidence just a day after Japan announced its biggest stimulus
package ever as it struggles to jog its economy out of a stubborn
recession. The cut could lead to higher borrowing costs for both
the government and world-class Japanese companies.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The world's newest automaker, DaimlerChrysler
AG, officially became a member of the global business community on
Tuesday when its shares began trading on the Frankfurt stock
exchange, shortly before their debut on Wall Street. Celebrations
were planned at DaimlerChrysler plants and offices worldwide. But
when the ``Day One'' hoopla is over, ``Job One'' will remain: the
daunting task of truly melding the corporate cultures of two
distinctly different German and American corporations into one
international transportation powerhouse. On the Frankfurt exchange,
DaimlerChrysler shares were steady on their first official day of
trading Tuesday. Analysts said that reflected investors'
satisfaction with the merger process so far. By late morning, the
share price was at 142.85 marks (dlrs 85) in electronic trading, up
1.95 marks (dlrs 1.16), or 1.4 percent, from the day's start.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called the
Russian government's economic rescue plan a ``good start,'' but
indicated Germany would provide little more than moral support in
Russia's latest economic struggle. Schroeder, on his first visit to
Russia as German leader, met Tuesday with President Boris Yeltsin
in the Kremlin. Yeltsin expressed hope that Russia and Germany
``will enter the next century with their relations developing at
the same pace as now.'' ``I'm sure they will,'' Schroeder
responded. After meeting with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on
Monday, Schroeder said Germany will not give Russia any emergency
financial aid outside the money it's providing through
international lenders. ``The possibilities are exhausted'' for
additional German aid, Schroeder said _ though he did bring 1.5
tons (1.65 short tons) of medical aid with him, German officials
said. (RUSSIA-GERMANY)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France flights were severely disrupted Tuesday
after flight attendants began a two-day strike to protest what they
say are unfair salary differences within the company. Air France
said it would guarantee 55 percent of long-haul flights and 60
percent of short and medium-distance flights during the strike
action. The flight attendants are demanding that the company scrap
a two-tier salary scheme under which staff hired since December
1995 earn less than their counterparts. The strike was called by
six unions. A 10-day pilots strike in early June cost Air France
one billion francs (dlrs 166 million) before the main pilots union
accepted an offer of stock in exchange for salary freezes.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors arrived in Iraq on
Tuesday and said they want to get back to work as soon as possible
to test Iraq's pledge to cooperate in the search for its weapons of
mass destruction. ``We are back, we are ready to work
immediately,'' senior weapons inspector Jaakko Ylitalo told
reporters shortly after his C-130 transport plane landed at the
Iraqi military air base at Habaniya outside Baghdad just a little
after 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT). Ylitalo was among 86 inspectors from
UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency who flew in from
the Gulf state of Bahrain. Asked by reporters if Iraqi officials
were helpful, Ylitalo said: ``We have no problems.'' Earlier in
Bahrain, the inspectors said they were going to test Iraq's promise
to cooperate. (IRAQ)
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Trying to resolve the latest crisis
with Israel, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday disavowed
violence and backed off plans to declare independence in May.
Arafat's clarifications came a day after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu suspended Israel's troop withdrawal. The Israeli
leader said he would not hand over 2 percent of the West Bank by
the end of the week, as scheduled, until Arafat retracted threats
to establish a Palestinian state in May and perhaps use force. The
Israeli Cabinet was to decide Wednesday whether the Palestinians
have lived up to their obligations and whether to allow the
upcoming pullback. The withdrawal, the first of three, was to have
been carried out on Monday, but Israel has fallen behind schedule
because of disputes and delays. In all, Israel is to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank by the end of January, in exchange for a
Palestinian campaign against Islamic militants.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim leaders tried Tuesday
to set aside a U.S.-sparked diplomatic furor and to concentrate on
Asia's economic crisis during their annual free-trade summit. But
U.S. Vice President Al Gore's decision to sympathize with the
antigovernment reform movement in Malaysia, the host country, in a
speech the night before the summit began appeared to leave deep
divisions among some of the 21 leaders. In fact, Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, the third Malaysian official to condemn Gore
since the speech, said it could put the very heart of the Asian
country's democracy at risk. The goal of the two-day Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit is for its leaders to deal with Asia's
worst financial crisis in decades by adopting a set of
recommendations that would help restart economic growth and
stabilize markets. (APEC)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A leading opposition figure accused
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on Tuesday of ruling with an
``iron fist'' like his predecessor and onetime mentor, Suharto,
following street violence in which at least 16 people died.
``Habibie's government has started to copy the pattern of Suharto's
iron fist that oppressed the people,'' said Amien Rais, a prominent
Muslim leader who is also a likely presidential candidate. The
International Monetary Fund, which is helping Indonesia to overcome
its worst economic crisis in 30 years, also warned Tuesday that
continuing civil unrest and political instability could threaten
its chances of recovery. If financial markets ``think it's the
beginning of a prolonged period of instability, then it would
affect the exchange rate and capital would flow out'' of Indonesia,
the fund's top official in Asia, Hubert Neiss, was quoted as
saying. (INDONESIA)
	   DOI INTHANON, Thailand (AP) _ Stargazers in Asia sought high
ground and clear skies Tuesday to view the most spectacular
celestial fireworks in 33 years. The Leonids meteor shower was
expected to blaze forth in its entire glory over Asia and the
Pacific after midnight and into early Wednesday, regaling millions
with a heavenly display of falling stars too numerous to wish upon.
The front-row seats were expected to be wherever the sky was
darkest and clearest _ from the Mongolian steppes to the mountains
of northern Thailand to research planes breaking through cloud
cover over Okinawa, Japan. For millions of others _ those befogged
by weather or living in North America, where the spectacle was to
reach its peak at midday, the worst time for viewing _ the Internet
was the place to be. (METEOR SHOWER)

FA asked to investigate missing money from Chinese transfers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The chairman of Crystal Palace has asked the
English Football Association to investigate a reported
400,000-pound (dlrs 668,000) shortfall in the transfer deals which
brought two Chinese internationals to the London club.
	   The Independent newspaper reported Tuesday that its inquiries
revealed the huge gap between the amount the English first division
club agreed to pay for the players and the fees which Chinese
soccer authorities expect to receive.
	   Fan Zhiyi, the Chinese national captain, and Sun Jihai moved to
Selhurst Park in August in the first transfer deals ever between
English and Chinese clubs.
	   Palace chairman Mark Golberg said the club agreed to pay 1.35
million pounds (dlrs 2.2 million) for the players. But the Chinese
Football Association is only anticipating receiving a fee of
950,000 pounds (dlrs 1.5 million), the Independent said.
	   ``We are disturbed to learn that there is apparently a major
discrepancy between the transfer fee, which we agreed with
officials of the Chinese FA in London, and the amount which the
Chinese FA in Beijing are said to be expecting,'' Goldberg said.
``As a result, we have launched an immediate inquiry and have asked
the English FA to assist us.''
	   FA spokesman Steve Double said Tuesday that a formal complaint
had yet to be received.
	   ``We haven't received anything from Palace so far but if we do
we will certainly take a look at it,'' he said. ``And, because it
involves an international transfer, it may be something that FIFA
will want to get involved in as well.''
	   Former England soccer coach Terry Venables, who has been
embroiled in court cases involving alleged financial irregularities
in the past, was appointed Palace manager in June. He has no
financial role in the club and was quick to distance himself from
the deal.
	   ``Thank goodness transfers have nothing to do with me any more _
I am just the coach,'' he told The Independent.
	   The Independent said it had established that the shortfall could
not be accounted for by normal level of agents' fees, usually about
10 percent.
	   Chinese officials said their European agent, London-based
Greatgate Overseas Development Ltd., known in China as Gaode, would
be paid 10 percent from the dlrs 1.5 million.
	   Goldberg said the only English agent involved was Tom Lawrence
and he had been paid 25,000 pounds (dlrs 40,000) for introducing
the players and helping with their work permits. But Lawrence told
the paper that neither he, nor his company, Strata Sports Marketing
Ltd, was involved in any way.
	   The official Chinese representative in the deal was identified
as Liu Shijun of the Greatgate company. He refused to discuss the
transfer fees, citing a confidentiality clause in the contract.
	   The paper said Beijing-born Liu has been forging links between
Chinese and Western soccer clubs since 1994, when soccer in China
turned professional. In 1996, he arranged a tour of China and Hong
Kong by the England team.
	   The appearances of Fan and Sun in English soccer has attracted
big television audiences in China.
	   Fan was charged with misconduct by the FA last week for
allegedly pushing a referee after Palace's 3-2 defeat to West
Bromwich Albion on Nov. 3. He could face a suspension or fine or
both.

Man accused of four murders confesses to 50_victims mutilated
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ A man arrested for four murders in
northern India has confessed to leading a gang that killed and
mutilated more than 50 people, many of whom had their heads and
penises cut off.
	   Many of the victims in the two-decade spree led by Mohammed
Akhtar Nazim's were homeless people and petty criminals. Police
said the killings appear to have been triggered by the violent
death of Nazim's brother.
	   Nazim had been arrested 21 years ago for killing his wife, but
escaped and has been free ever since. In a written confession
police released on Tuesday, Nazim said his more than 50 victims
``were criminals or depraved persons.'' All those who died after
his wife were men.
	   Police inspector Arvind Singh Pundir said Nazim and three
accomplices were arrested Saturday by police acting on a tip. The
police were investigating the deaths of four men whose mutilated
bodies had been found over the last seven weeks dumped in Meerut,
66 kilometers (41 miles) northeast of New Delhi.
	   Police were checking out Nazim's confession to see if more
charges could be filed. Pundir said investigations could take
another two or three months.
	   Meerut police suspicions were aroused when so many bodies were
found within 200-300 meters (yards) of each other, all with their
heads and penises cut off. Nazim said he preyed on criminals,
making it likely police would have dismissed previous killings as
the result of gang feuds.
	   Nazim told police he saw his brother killed near New Delhi in
1975 by a man the brother had tried to stop from harassing a young
girl. Pundir said Nazim ``lost his mental balance'' after his
brother's death.
	   Two years later, Nazim was arrested in the death of his wife,
who was found beheaded in their bed in their Meerut home. Police
said he suspected she was having an affair.
	   He escaped before trial and, according to his confession, began
his spree. Police said he and his accomplices would visit towns in
the area, gather the names of criminals, lure the men to isolated
areas and serve them liquor until they were drunk.
	   The victims were then strangled by an ironsmith who was a member
of Nazim's gang. Other members would cut off the heads; Nazim
always cut off the penises.
	   After committing a murder, the gang would return to Meerut,
where Nazim earned money at odd jobs and seemed to have slipped
beyond the notice of police despite his earlier arrest.
	   ``Since they were a very close-knit group with no interaction
with other criminals, we never received any tip-offs from our
informers in the past,'' Pundir said.

EU regulators clear ING to buy bigger stake in Germany's BHF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators Tuesday
cleared Dutch financial group ING Groep N.V's purchase of a larger
stake in BHF-Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Germany's sixth-largest
listed corporate bank.
	   The European Commission said the purchase will strengthen ING's
European banking position beyond its base in the Netherlands and
Belgium, but ``does not create or strengthen a dominant position.''
	   ``Overlapping activities of each party in the core markets of
the other party are very small,'' the Commission said in a
statement
	   ING paid a reported 2.5 billion marks (dlrs 1.49) to lift its
holding in BHF to 39 percent from 4.5 percent.
	   Under EU rules, the Commission has powers to examine mergers and
takeovers that impact on markets within the 15-nation bloc. It can
demand changes or veto those judged to violate EU antitrust rules.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Phones are hard to come by in remote
Albania, so a villager used what was handy to summon help when he
saw a traffic accident _ he fired off his anti-aircraft machine
gun.
	   Police appreciated the gesture enough to not arrest the man for
possessing the heavy weapon, but still confiscated the 12.7 mm gun,
newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The incident occurred Saturday on the national highway near
Gramsh, 70 kilometers (45 miles) south of Tirana, when a truck
drove off the road, trapping the badly injured driver inside.
	   After witnessing the crash, the villager set up the heavy
machine gun on the roof of his nearby house and fired into the air
until police arrived.
	   The villager apparently didn't reveal how he came by the weapon
in gun-happy Albania, but Gramsh is the site of a huge army depot
that was looted last year during the unrest that followed the
collapse of pyramid schemes.

Arafat backs off plans to declare independence in May unilaterally

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday defused the latest crisis with Israel by disavowing
violence and endorsing negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Arafat's clarifications came a day after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu suspended Israel's troop withdrawal. The Israeli
leader said he would not hand over 2 percent of the West Bank by
the end of the week, as scheduled, until Arafat retracted threats
to establish a Palestinian state in May and perhaps use force.
	   After reviewing the Arafat statements, Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan said that Tuesday that the prime minister ``considers
this a retraction.''
	   Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that Israel's Cabinet would
still have to decide Wednesday whether to give the go ahead for the
upcoming pullback.
	   The withdrawal, the first of three, was to have been carried out
on Monday, but Israel has fallen behind schedule because of a
delays in ratifying the accord and disputes with the Palestinians.
	   In all, Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by
the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian campaign against
Islamic militants.
	   The U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, said earlier Tuesday he was
confident the latest row would be settled soon. ``Both sides have
obligations and both sides, I think, will fulfill their
obligations,'' Ross told AP after talks with Israeli Trade Minister
Natan Sharansky.
	   Ross said Arafat assured him Monday night that he would
``correct what had been had been said and that he would make it
very clear that his commitment is to peace.''
	   On Tuesday, Arafat opened a news conference with German
President Roman Herzog in the West Bank town of Jericho by reading
a statement concerning the dispute with the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis,'' Arafat said.
	   ``Peace is a Palestinian strategic choice and any differences in
the final status negotiations, we stress that we want them to be
solved by peaceful means through negotiations, and not in any other
way,'' Arafat said.
	   In a speech Sunday to loyalists from his Fatah movement, Arafat
had alluded to the use of force, saying that ``our rifle is ready''
to take Jerusalem.
	   While not specifically dropping the option to declare a state on
May 4, at the end of the five-year autonomy period, Arafat also
endorsed future negotiations with Israel on a permanent peace
accord that would settle final borders and the fate of Jerusalem.
	   Israel and the Palestinians are to have completed those
negotiations in May, but it appears unlikely the deadline can be
met. Israel has said it would consider a unilaterally declaration
of statehood by the Palestinians as a grave violation and has
threatened to annex West Bank areas in response.
	   Israel's parliament, meanwhile, was expected to give
overwhelming approval to the peace accord Tuesday evening, at the
end of a two-day debate.
	   Despite the row, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met Monday
night, as scheduled, to try and conclude an agreement on setting up
a land route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   The head of the Palestinian delegation, Abdel Razek Yehiyeh,
said he expected all issues to be settled by next week, and said
the so-called ``safe passage'' could be opened within a month.
	   Another committee dealing with the release of Palestinian
prisoners was to meet Tuesday afternoon. Israel was to free a first
group of 250 prisoners, out of a total of 750, by the weekend.
	   In the first pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank are to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction, and
7.1 percent are to go from shared to sole Palestinian control.
	   Israel's government has not presented withdrawal maps. The
Yediot Ahronot daily published its own map and said most of the
land changing hands was in the northern West Bank, around the
Palestinian towns of Jenin and Nablus.

French goalscoring hero Papin set to retire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Jean-Pierre Papin, one of France's all-time great
strikers, was set to announce his retirement Tuesday, French news
reports said.
	   The 35-year-old scored 326 goals in 584 matches for eight clubs
and the French national team.
	   In 54 matches for France, including 11 as captain, Papin scored
30 goals _ a record bettered only by Michel Platini _ and played in
the 1986 World Cup finals and 1992 European Championships.
	   Papin shot to fame in 1986 after signing for Marseille, where he
scored 181 goals in 279 games, won four championship medals and was
top French goalscorer for five seasons.
	   After transferring to AC Milan in 1992, Papin won a European Cup
medal in 1994, though he didn't play in the final against his
former club Marseille.
	   Papin also played for Bayern Munich, helping the Germany club
win the UEFA Cup in 1996, before moving back to France.
	   He moved to French second division club Guingamp in pre-season,
but struggled to hold down a place.
	   Papin also played for Vichy, Valenciennes, Bruges and Bordeaux.

Serbian president to stage talks despite Albanians' refusal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with KLA spokesman praising U.S. envoy, other
comments &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian President Milan Milutinovic
pressed ahead Tuesday with efforts to hold peace talks with rival
Kosovo Albanian officials despite their refusal to meet with him.
	   Serbian government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Milutinovic will travel to Kosovo's capital Pristina on
Wednesday on a mission the ethnic Albanians have dismissed as a
publicity stunt.
	   Milutinovic wants to chair long-sought direct talks with the
ethnic Albanians, with international officials in attendance but
not as mediators.
	   The ethnic Albanians refuse to talk without U.S. and European
mediation, saying only foreign countries could guarantee that an
eventual agreement would be implemented by the Serbian government.
	   They have turned down 16 such invitations in the past six
months, prompting Serb authorities to show up at the prearranged
site anyway to try to show their sincerity and the ethnic
Albanians' uncooperativeness.
	   The Serbian government says the troubles in Kosovo, where
hundreds of people have died and tens of thousands were left
homeless in its crackdown against secessionists, are Serbia's
internal matter and should not involve foreign mediators.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders said Milutinovic's call for talks is a
part of Belgrade's effort to reduce international pressure on
Serbia to find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo turmoil. They said
ethnic Albanians support peace talks, but not under Serb
conditions.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has been shuttling between
Belgrade and Pristina in an effort to find a compromise peace plan,
was to meet representatives of the Albanians' rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army in the province on Tuesday, guerrilla sources said.
	   Adem Demaci, a guerrilla spokesman, praised Hill's decision to
meet the KLA commanders.
	   ``Rugova can sign anything, but there could be no deal without
KLA consent,'' Demaci told reporters in Pristina, speaking of
Kosovo Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Commenting on Milutinovic's scheduled talks, Demaci said ``it's
a bluff intended to say that Albanians don't want dialogue and thus
deserve to be beaten by force.''
	   The militants have refused any compromise with the Serbian
government, demanding outright secession for Kosovo.
	   Rugova also advocates independence but is willing to negotiate a
possible three-year interim period during which Kosovo would regain
the autonomy stripped by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in
1989.
	   Serbian state-run media reported Tuesday that Milosevic's ruling
Socialist Party gave full support to Milutinovic in his attempts to
hn Democratic Party said Milutinovic's call for the talks is ``the
sowing of mist'' which is aimed at fooling the public at home and
abroad.

Mobil to begin oil exploration in Sao Tome waters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ U.S. company Mobil Corp.
is to begin oil exploration in this twin-island nation's
territorial waters by the end of the year, a company spokesman said
Tuesday.
	   Jimmy Callender told reporters a four-man team of experts would
supervise the drilling of two exploratory wells.
	   Sao Tome and Principe lies in the Gulf of Guinea _ about 240
kilometers (150 miles) west of Gabon _ in one of the most active
oil exploration areas in the African continent.
	   A delegation from French oil company Elf Aquitaine held talks
with local officials last weekend, but they left without speaking
to reporters.
	   Callender met with Prime Minister Raul Braganca Neto to discuss
Mobil's plans and said the discovery of oil pointed to ``a bright
future'' for this impoverished nation of 120,000 people.
	   Last April, U.S. company Environmental Remediation Holding
Corp., which started offshore oil exploration in July 1997, said it
had found oil in the country's territorial waters.
	   The company, in conjunction with Mobil, entered a joint venture
with the government, called STPETRO, to develop the country's oil
and gas reserves.

EU to start Russian food aid deliveries in January
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The European Union expects to start delivering
food aid to Russia in January to help people in remote regions that
face food shortages, a senior EU official said Tuesday.
	   Ottokar Hahm, the EU's permanent representative in Russia, said
January was the right time for deliveries to begin because February
and March usually are the most difficult, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Russia is receiving food aid from the EU and the United States
worth about dlrs 1 billion to help deal with the country's economic
crisis.
	   Russia has been hit hard by economic and financial problems and
the worst grain harvest in 40 years. But there are conflicting
reports on the seriousness of the situation since Russia is still
exporting wheat.
	   Hahm said some Russian regions, particularly in the north and
the far east, may experience food shortages, but he noted that the
situation is normal in other regions, some of which have food
surpluses.
	   The EU says it will provide about dlrs 480 million worth of food
aid to Russia. The United States plans to provide Russia with food
aid worth dlrs 600 million.

U.N. weapons inspectors arrive in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Iraqi editorial at end; TRIMS throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors returned to Iraq on
Tuesday, saying they would get back to work as soon as possible to
test Iraq's pledge to cooperate in the search for its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   ``We are back. We are ready to work immediately,'' senior
weapons inspector Jaakko Ylitalo told reporters after his C-130
transport plane landed at the Habaniya military air base outside
Baghdad about 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT).
	   Ylitalo was among 86 inspectors from UNSCOM and the
International Atomic Energy Agency who arrived from the Gulf state
of Bahrain, where they were evacuated last week when U.S. air
strikes on Iraq seemed likely.
	   At the air base, Ylitalo asked an Iraqi official if the Iraqis
had prepared for the resumption of their work.
	   ``Everything will be sorted out as soon as possible,'' the
unidentified official told Ylitalo.
	   Asked by reporters if Iraqi officials were helpful, Ylitalo
said: ``We have no problems.''
	   With the threat of American and British air strikes on Iraq over
for now, about 150 U.N. relief workers also returned to Baghdad
from the Jordanian capital of Amman, where they were sent at the
height of the crisis.
	   The arms inspectors have been working for more than seven years
to unearth Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles. Their work has been frequently blocked by Iraq. But the
latest threat of attack by U.S. and British forces produced a
renewed promise to cooperate.
	   Three Iraqi buses transported the inspectors to their
headquarters in Baghdad, 70 kilometers (44 miles) from Habaniya air
base.
	   Caroline Cross, the spokeswoman for the inspectors in Iraq, told
reporters that Iraq's disarmament activities would start in earnest
Wednesday.
	   She said UNSCOM was looking forward to ``a productive and
professional relationship'' with the Iraqi government. First, she
said, the inspectors will ``get all the computers on line, making
sure the camera system is working. That is our first priority.''
	   From their headquarters the inspectors can monitor about 120
remote control cameras at suspected Iraqi weapons sites. They also
carry out both announced and spot visits.
	   Before the inspectors left Bahrain, Ms. Cross said they would
quickly test Iraq's pledge of cooperation.
	   ``The Iraqi authorities have promised cooperation. Obviously the
next few days are going to be very important,'' she said.
	   Eighty 80 UNSCOM arms experts and six inspectors from the
International Atomic Energy Agency _ which is studying Iraq's
nuclear weapons program _ returned to the Iraqi capital.
	   The threat of military action was averted Sunday when U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced the United States had accepted the
Iraqi government's pledge a day earlier to lift its three-month ban
on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Once inspectors report they are able to work effectively, the
Security Council will conduct a review of Iraq's efforts to
eliminate its dangerous weapons. The Iraqi government wants the
review to lead quickly to the lifting of U.N. sanctions _ a move
both the United States and Britain have resisted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated
Iraq's economy.
	   The council has said they will not be lifted until UNSCOM and
the Vienna-headquartered nuclear agency certify that Iraq has
eliminated its lethal weaponry.
	   Despite Iraq's backdown from its ban on arms inspections, Iraq's
state-run newspapers declared Tuesday that President Saddam
Hussein's reversal in policy had undercut the United States.
	   Al-Iraq said Saddam's last-minute change of mind ``hit America
in the heart and forced the hands of evil back into their holes.''
	   It said Saddam wisely averted ``a conspiracy by America as it
hastened to implement another crime.''
	   ``The flag of Iraq flies high, while America's flies half
mast,'' the official al-Ittihad weekly said in a red banner
headline.

Premier: asylum-seeking Kurdish leader must renounce terrorism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Massimo D'Alema told parliament on Tuesday
that Italy will not grant political asylum to a jailed Kurdish
rebel leader unless it is convinced he has really renounced
terrorism.
	   ``I consider this a minimum for our country to be able to
process an asylum request,'' D'Alema told the lower house in a
briefing on the case of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of Kurdish
rebels fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey.
	   ``Our country doesn't intend to be a host for terrorist
activities,'' he said
	   Ocalan was arrested in Rome last week and has asked for
political asylum. But Turkey, one of Italy's NATO allies and a
strong trading partner, is pushing hard for his extradition.
	   Extradition appears unlikely because Ocalan is on trial in
absentia for capital crimes in Turkey but Italy's courts have
forbidden extraditing anyone to a country where they could be
executed.
	   ``This is not an act of hostility toward Turkey, but one of
respect for our own laws, history and values,'' said D'Alema, a day
after a gloves-off warning to Turkey that Italy wouldn't give in to
``threats, pressure,'' or ``blackmail.''
	   D'Alema told lawmakers that Ocalan has ``rejected all terrorist
actions'' in a statement issued Monday. ``Now it's a matter of
seeing whether he sticks to it,'' the premier said.
	   In his statement, Ocalan also said he wanted to work for a
peaceful solution to the bitter, 14-year Kurdish conflict. The war
between his Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK and the Turkish army has
claimed about 37,000 lives.
	   D'Alema told lawmakers that there was no prior deal with Ocalan,
but said Turkey had warned authorities here that he might be headed
for Italy.
	   Ocalan lived for years in Syria, but Damascus kicked him out
recently after Turkey threatened it with military attacks. Ocalan
then sought asylum in Russia, but was rebuffed.
	   The Kurdish cause enjoys sympathy in many European circles. The
so-called Kurdish parliament-in-exile met recently in Rome, which
may have encouraged Ocalan to seek asylum in Italy, D'Alema said.
	   Kurds from throughout Europe have come to Rome in solidarity
with Ocalan and demonstrators have been camped outside the military
hospital in Rome where he is believed held since last week.
	   In Ankara, hundreds of Turks demonstrated outside the Italian
Embassy, protesting Italy's reluctance to extradite Ocalan.
	   ``If he's not handed over, we'll walk to Italy, we'll annex
Italy, we'll turn Italy upside down!'' one demonstrator screamed
into a loudspeaker. Another burned an Italian flag.
	   Ocalan is Turkey's most wanted fugitive and Ankara is so eager
to get him back that it has moved to abolish capital punishment.
	   The U.S. State Department Monday called the arrest an important
step in the fight against global terrorism and said Ocalan should
be extradited.

Arafat backs off plans to declare independence in May unilaterally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Netanyahu adviser saying
Netanyahu considers Arafat's latest statement a retraction, crisis
apparently resolved; No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday defused the latest crisis with Israel by disavowing
violence and endorsing negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Arafat's clarifications came a day after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu suspended Israel's troop withdrawal. The Israeli
leader said he would not hand over 2 percent of the West Bank by
the end of the week, as scheduled, until Arafat retracted threats
to establish a Palestinian state in May and perhaps use force.
	   After reviewing Arafat's statement, Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan said Tuesday that the prime minister ``considers this a
retraction.''
	   Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that Israel's Cabinet would
still have to decide Wednesday whether to give the go ahead for the
upcoming pullback.
	   Israel's parliament, meanwhile, was expected to give
overwhelming approval to the peace accord this evening, at the end
of a two-day debate.
	   The withdrawal, the first of three, was to have been carried out
on Monday, but Israel has fallen behind schedule because of a
series of disputes and delays.
	   In all, Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by
the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian campaign against
Islamic militants.
	   The U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, said earlier today he was
confident the row would be settled soon. ``Both sides have
obligations and both sides, I think, will fulfill their
obligations,'' Ross told The Associated Press after talks with
Israeli Trade Minister Natan Sharansky.
	   On Tuesday, Arafat opened a news conference with German
President Roman Herzog in the West Bank town of Jericho by reading
a statement concerning the dispute with the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis,'' Arafat said.
	   ``Peace is a Palestinian strategic choice and any differences in
the final status negotiations, we stress that we want them to be
solved by peaceful means through negotiations, and not in any other
way,'' Arafat said.
	   Arafat had issued a similar clarification Monday night. However,
today he went a step further by appearing to be backing off plans
to unilaterally declare statehood in May, at the end of the
five-year autonomy period.
	   Israel and the Palestinians are to have completed negotiations
on a permanent peace agreement by May, but with many difficult
issues on the agenda, including final borders and the future of
Jerusalem, it appears unlikely the deadline can be met.
	   Arafat also stressed in his statement that such an accord would
be reached by peaceful means. In a speech Sunday to loyalists from
his Fatah movement, he had alluded to the use of force, saying that
``our rifle is ready'' to take Jerusalem.
	   Despite the row, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met Monday
night, as scheduled, to try to conclude an agreement on setting up
a land route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   The head of the Palestinian delegation, Abdel Razek Yehiyeh,
said he expected all issues to be settled by next week, and said
the so-called ``safe passage'' could be opened within a month.
	   Another committee dealing with the release of Palestinian
prisoners was to meet this afternoon. Israel was to free a first
group of 250 prisoners, out of a total of 750, by the weekend.
	   In the first pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank are to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction, and
7.1 percent are to go from shared to sole Palestinian control.
	   Israel's government has not presented withdrawal maps. The
Yediot Ahronot daily published its own map and said most of the
land changing hands was in the northern West Bank, around the
Palestinian towns of Jenin and Nablus.

Bright red meteors result in mistaken rescue efforts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Rescuers were swamped with calls from
concerned Norwegians who spotted what they thought were red
distress rockets fired from ships in trouble off the southern
coast.
	   What they actually saw was a meteor shower from the
Tempel-Tuttle Comet that is tracing a path near earth.
	   During the night Monday and early Tuesday, the Norwegian Rescue
Coordination Center - Southern Norway launched three separate
rescue efforts, only to call ships back after discovering the
source of the bright red streaks of light.
	   ``There were a lot of calls,'' rescue leader Ben Vikoeren said
by telephone from the center's base in the west coast town of Sola.
``The meteors really changed color, and sometimes they were bright
red, so I can understand that people associated them with distress
rockets.''
	   Vikoeren said three of the reports sounded so much like distress
flares that rescue boats were sent to investigate. He said the
longest search lasted about two hours.
	   The Tempel-Tuttle comet passes Earth annually, leaving a trail
of meteors that turn bright colors as they burn on their way
through the Earth's atmosphere. The meteor show is reaching its
33-year peak this week.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Phones are hard to come by in remote
Albania, so a villager used what was handy to summon help when he
saw a traffic accident _ he fired off his anti-aircraft machine
gun.
	   Police appreciated the gesture enough to not arrest the man for
possessing the heavy weapon, but still confiscated the gun,
newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The incident occurred Saturday on the national highway near
Gramsh, 70 kilometers (45 miles) south of Tirana, when a truck
drove off the road, trapping the badly injured driver inside.
	   After witnessing the crash, the villager set up the heavy
machine gun on the roof of his nearby house and fired into the air
until police arrived.
	   The villager apparently didn't reveal how he came by the weapon
in gun-happy Albania, but Gramsh is the site of a huge army depot
that was looted last year during the unrest that followed the
collapse of pyramid schemes.

Serbian president to stage talks despite Albanians' refusal

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian President Milan Milutinovic
pressed ahead Tuesday with efforts to hold peace talks with rival
Kosovo Albanian officials despite their refusal to meet with him.
	   Serbian government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Milutinovic will travel to Kosovo's capital Pristina on
Wednesday on a mission the ethnic Albanians have dismissed as a
publicity stunt.
	   Milutinovic wants to chair long-sought direct talks with the
ethnic Albanians, with international officials in attendance but
not as mediators.
	   The ethnic Albanians refuse to talk without U.S. and European
mediation, saying only foreign countries could guarantee that an
eventual agreement would be implemented by the Serbian government.
	   They have turned down 16 such invitations in the past six
months, prompting Serb authorities to show up at the prearranged
site anyway to try to show their sincerity and the ethnic
Albanians' uncooperativeness.
	   The Serbian government says the troubles in Kosovo, where
hundreds of people have died and tens of thousands were left
homeless in its crackdown against secessionists, are Serbia's
internal matter and should not involve foreign mediators.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders said Milutinovic's call for talks is a
part of Belgrade's effort to reduce international pressure on
Serbia to find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo turmoil. They said
ethnic Albanians support peace talks, but not under Serb
conditions.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has been shuttling between
Belgrade and Pristina in an effort to find a compromise peace plan,
was to meet representatives of the Albanians' rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army in the province on Tuesday, guerrilla sources said.
	   Adem Demaci, a guerrilla spokesman, praised Hill's decision to
meet the KLA commanders.
	   ``Rugova can sign anything, but there could be no deal without
KLA consent,'' Demaci told reporters in Pristina, speaking of
Kosovo Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Commenting on Milutinovic's scheduled talks, Demaci said ``it's
a bluff intended to say that Albanians don't want dialogue and thus
deserve to be beaten by force.''
	   The militants have refused any compromise with the Serbian
government, demanding outright secession for Kosovo.
	   Rugova also advocates independence but is willing to negotiate a
possible three-year interim period during which Kosovo would regain
the autonomy stripped by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in
1989.
	   Serbian state-run media reported Tuesday that Milosevic's ruling
Socialist Party gave full support to Milutinovic in his attempts to
hold the talks.
	   But the opposition Democratic Party said Milutinovic's call for
talks is ``the sowing of mist'' which is aimed at fooling the
public at home and abroad.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian authorities deployed
riot police at key locations throughout Kuala Lumpur late Tuesday,
to prevent anti-government protests during a Pacific Rim summit.
	   A water cannon truck backed up specially trained officers
outside the Mandarin Hotel, where the government leaders were
having dinner.
	   There was a similar show of force around the luxury hotel were
U.S. Vice President Al Gore was staying, and at the sites of two
noisy weekend protests.
	   Extra police were stationed at major intersections of the
Malaysian capital.
	   No trouble or protests were reported as of 8 p.m. (1200 GMT),
when the banquet began.
	   Malaysia is current hosting the summit of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
has promised to crack down on any demonstrations against his
17-year rule.

Cambodian tyrant's widow marries late husband's aide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The widow of Pol Pot, the notorious
leader of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement, has married
one of her late husband's aides, a guerrilla defector said Tuesday.
	   Yim Phanna, a former Khmer Rouge commander, confirmed reports
this week in Phnom Penh newspapers that Pol Pot's widow, Mea Som,
had married Tep Khunnal, formerly a middle-ranking Khmer Rouge
functionary, shortly after the two defected to the government in
September. Pol Pot's 14-year-old daughter, Mea Sith, defected along
with her mother.
	   ``They had a small ceremony arranged when they were in a refugee
camp in Thailand,'' said Yim Phanna, whose own defection earlier
this year led to the government's capture of the rebels' stronghold
in Anlong Veng. ``Maybe Pol Pot asked him to take care of her. She
has no one to rely on since the contemptible Pol Pot died.''
	   Pol Pot died on April 15 this year at the age of 73 while under
house arrest by his comrades. He had been toppled from his
leadership position last year.
	   His death, reportedly from heart failure, came as government
forces were driving the guerrillas out of Anlong Veng, their last
major stronghold.
	   Mea Som was one of several thousand refugees who encamped at the
Thai border as fighting flared around the base.
	   Tep Khunnal was one of the last so-called ``intellectuals'' to
remain with the group as its remnants hid in the jungle under the
command of veteran guerrilla fighter Ta Mok, who has a reputation
for brutality.
	   Pol Pot married Mea Som in 1987. She and her daughter described
Pol Pot after his death as a good husband and father.
	   He was better known to the world as the head of a brutal
communist regime whose extremist policies were responsible for the
deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians in the late 1970s.
	   Pol Pot's first marriage in 1956 to fellow revolutionary Khieu
Ponnary was childless. She is said to have suffered a breakdown in
the 1980s and never recovered. It is unclear what happened to her
afterward.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) - The government says it will privatize
the state water company in the country's five major cities.
	   The five cities include the capital Maputo, Nampula and Pemba in
northern Mozambique and Beira and Quelimane in the center of the
country.
	   Minister of Public Works and Housing, Roberto White, defended
the plan on Monday in Parliament. The existing state companies are
close to collapse, and the minister said that that it was not worth
investing in near-bankrupt companies.
	   He told the deputies that over the past 20 years, the percentage
of urban residents with access to piped water had dropped from 48
to 30 per cent, due largely to the rapid expansion in urban
populations during the civil war.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ South African President Nelson
Mandela arrived in Tanzania Tuesday to thank the East African
nation for its support to the African National Congress in the
struggle to end apartheid.
	   During a brief airport ceremony, Mandela received a 21-gun
salute from the Tanzanian Defence Forces and then went to State
House where he held private talks with President Benjamin Mkapa.
	   Although the agenda was not make public, the talks were expected
to touch on the widening conflict in neighboring Congo, for which
South Africa has been attempting arrange a cease-fire.
	   Mandela was to meet with the executive committee of the ruling
Chama Cha Mapinduzi party and then address a rally at National
Stadium where he was to bid farewell to Tanzanians before his
official retirement next year.
	   --
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency has suspended an airlift
to return refugees from Guinea to Sierra Leone after several cases
of meningitis were discovered among people preparing to go back, a
spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The operation was suspended on Friday after seven cases of the
disease were reported in refugee camps in Guinea's Gueckedou area,
according to Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Some 3,000 Sierra Leoneans were returned to the country's
capital, Freetown, in the first phase of the airlift in August and
September.
	   The second phase started last Wednesday but took back just 305
people before it was suspended. Some 1,800 people have registered
to return and the airlift will be resumed next week if no further
meningitis cases are reported, Janowski said.
	   Earlier this year, a Nigerian-led coalition force ousted Sierra
Leone's ruling military junta and returned President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah to power.
	   Although Kabbah and the coalition force are firmly in control of
the capital, former junta soldiers and their rebel allies still
control parts of the country and have been waging a terrorist
campaign against the civilian population.
	   UNHCR estimates there are some 350,000 refugees from Sierra
Leone in Guinea and 90,000 in Liberia.
	   --
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Hundreds of ethnic Krahns from Liberia
have begun returning home from the neighboring Ivory Coast, where
they were seeking refuge from persecution for their ties to a
former warlord, aid workers reported.
	   At least 500 people have returned home in recent weeks, local
aid agencies and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
said Tuesday.
	   The refugees, laden with personal belongings, trekked on foot
across the border, the aid workers reported.
	   Last month, a U.N. mission in the Ivory Coast reported that at
least 4,000 Liberians had recently arrived at several border towns.
	   Most of the refugees cited harassment or the fear of persecution
for leaving Liberia. They said they were targeted because of their
ethnic ties to former warlord Roosevelt Johnson, a Krahn.
	   In September, Johnson was the target of a shooting incident by
government troops as he sought shelter in the U.S. Embassy.
	   __
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ The trial of a Lebanese businessman
accused of stealing dlrs 1.7 million from Ivorian coffers began
Tuesday in Abidjan after months of delays.
	   The case of Roger Nasra generated a media frenzy two years ago
when he escaped custody in the Ivory Coast and fled to France.
	   Nasra's many charges include fraud, corruption, embezzlement,
writing false checks and falsifying public documents.
	   Seventeen other suspects were also scheduled to appear in court
with Nasra in a case in which at least four government treasury
officials have been imprisoned, the daily Fraternite-Matin
newspaper reported.
	   In July, police arrested and imprisoned the head of the National
Treasury, Julien Boadu, in connection with the case.
	   In May, Nasra was extradited from France, he has since been kept
in a maximum security prison.

Kwame Ture to be buried in adopted Africa homeland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ Black activist and self-described
socialist Kwame Ture will be buried this weekend in his adopted
homeland of Guinea, a close friend and colleague said Tuesday.
	   Ture, known to many as Stokley Carmichael, died Sunday of
prostate cancer at the age of 57.
	   His funeral is scheduled for Sunday in the Guinean capital of
Conakry, said Ture's longtime friend Bob Brown.
	   In the wake of a turbulent career in the United States as a
militant social activist that was underscored by his rallying cry,
``Black Power,'' Ture left American and moved to Guinea in 1969,
where he continued to pursue his dream of Pan-African unity and
empowerment.
	   Friends and colleagues are expected to attend the funeral,
including members of Ture's All-African People's Revolutionary
Party.
	   The Rev. Jesse Jackson visited with Ture three times at his home
in Guinea during a trip to Africa last week. Jackson remembered
Ture as a man determined to transform the United States and Africa
to end racial inequities.
	   From Guinea, Ture vowed to wage an ``unrelenting armed struggle
against the white Western empire for the liberation of our
people.''
	   Born in Trinidad, Ture spent much of his time after moving to
Africa speaking to audiences to preach black power and champion
socialism while condemning America, capitalism and Zionism.

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday defused the latest crisis with Israel by disavowing
violence and endorsing negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Arafat's remarks were
``positive'' and that the Palestinian leader cleared an obstacle on
the way to implementing last month's land-for-security agreement.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu had suspended Israel's troop withdrawal
from 2 percent of the West Bank, which was scheduled for later this
week, until Arafat retracted threats to unilaterally establish a
Palestinian state in May and perhaps use force.
	   After reviewing Arafat's latest statements, Netanyahu adviser
David Bar-Illan saidt the prime minister ``considers this a
retraction.''
	   Netanyahu said Israel's Cabinet would still have to decide
Wednesday to review whether the Palestinians have lived up to all
of their obligations and whether to give the go ahead for the
upcoming pullback.

Onassis heiress on family island for memorial to mother
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The 13-year-old heiress to the Onassis
fortune arrived on the family's private island Tuesday to attend a
graveside memorial on the 10th anniversary of her mother's death.
	   Athina Roussel, the granddaughter of the late shipping tycoon
Aristotle Onassis, was accompanied by her father Thierry Roussel to
the Ionian island of Skorpios, about 260 kilometers (160 miles)
northwest of Athens.
	   The family holds a memorial for Christina Onassis each year in
Switzerland, where Athina lives with Roussel, his Swedish wife and
the couple's three children.
	   Athina has visited her mother's grave, but this will be the
first time she attended a memorial ceremony there. Following the
ceremony on Wednesday, Athina will return to her school in Geneva,
said Roussel's spokesman, Alexis Mantheakis.
	   French-born Roussel is locked in a battle for management of the
dlrs 600 million fortune that Athina stands to inherit on her 18th
birthday.
	   The Greek trustees administering the inheritance sued Roussel
for slander, perjury and other charges after he lost a court case
in which he accused them of fiscal mismanagement. The trial is
being held in Athens.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ U.S. pop star Michael Jackson paid a
secretive visit to Zimbabwe at the invitation of the state arms
maker and on Tuesday met with President Robert Mugabe.
	   Jackson refused to speak with reporters at Mugabe's State House
offices because, said Mugabe, he was suffering from a tooth ache.
	   Mugabe said he discussed ideas with Jackson for investment in a
hotel development in the northwestern Zimbabwe resort of Victoria
Falls.
	   Mugabe, 74, an ascetic known for his criticism of unkempt hair,
extrovert dress and poor discipline in pop music culture, said his
own 9-year-old son Robert was an avid fan of Jackson.
	   ``My boy has seen Michael Jackson. He wants to be like Michael
Jackson. Every young boy wants to be like Michael Jackson,'' Mugabe
said.
	   Jackson arrived late Monday without advance notice and was
scheduled to leave Harare later Tuesday.
	   But hundreds of screaming young fans hearing of his arrival
thronged his downtown hotel and the U.S. singer signed a few
autographs Monday before attending a cocktail party hosted by the
state arms maker, Zimbabwe Defense Industries.
	   The arms maker has been a main supplier of weapons and equipment
to the forces of embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   More than 8,000 Zimbabwean troops are fighting alongside
Congolese forces against rebels aiming to topple Kabila.
	   Jackson was accompanied to Mugabe's office by leading Zimbabwean
affirmative action campaigner Philip Chiyangwa, who has
controversial business interests in the Congo.
	   Jackson came with a delegation from Washington, D.C.-based
United Pacific Holdings Group, said Col. Tshinga Dube, head of
Zimbabwe Defense Industries. Dube said Jackson holds a financial
interest in the group, which was invited by the state arms maker.
	   He said the U.S. manufacturing, trading and energy group had
``various business arrangements'' with the arms maker.
	   ``We have already signed an agreement to represent them here,''
he said.
	   He did not elaborate. The arms maker manufactures guns, mortars,
artillery shells and other military supplies.

Turkish president arrives amid tight security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ About 1,000 policemen were assigned to
protect Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, who arrived Tuesday on
a three-day official visit.
	   President Thomas Klestil's invitation for the visit was issued
to take place during Austria's European Union presidency.
	   Austrian government officials reportedly will try to open up a
``longer-term perspective'' for Turkey's EU membership.
	   A related topic certain to come up is Cyprus, among six
countries with whom the European Union started formal membership
talks on Nov. 10.
	   In a rare joint statement, the Netherlands, Germany and France
said the inability of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reconcile their
differences weighed heavily on their island's membership chances.
	   They spoke of ``fundamental problems'' in the Cyprus negotiating
process, adding ``a political solution is urgently required.''
	   Austrian police took special measures to ensure the safety of
the Turkish visitor.
	   ``The political situation requires comprehensive security
measures,'' the Austria Press Agency quoted Walter Zehetmayr, a
senior police officer, as saying.
	   The extra effort was prompted by the arrest last week in Rome of
Abdullah Ocalan, the chief of the Turkish Workers Party PKK,
Zehetmayr said. He hinted that he expects large protests of Turkish

Mahathir thanks Japan for not taking sides in Anwar trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad thanked Japan on Tuesday for not taking sides on an issue
that has overshadowed a summit of Pacific Rim nations _ the trial
of jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim.
	   In a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Mahathir
criticized countries, including the United States, which have
expressed support for the dismissed Malaysian deputy prime
minister, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar in early September after the two differed
on economic policy. Anwar then led a series of protests against
Mahathir and was arrested and charged with corruption and sodomy,
which he has denied.
	   Mahathir told Obuchi he could not support mass movements which
try to destabilize the Malaysian government, the official said.
	   ``I'm concerned about people who are listening to only one
side,'' the official quoted him as saying.
	   He said he appreciated that Japan has not taken a position in
relation to the case, said the official, who briefed reporters on
condition of anonymity.
	   Obuchi said Japan has a deep interest in the trial and hopes
that due process and justice will be respected, the official said.
	   Obuchi is in Malaysia for meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore infuriated the Malaysian government
Monday night in a speech that indirectly expressed support for
Anwar's backers.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Philippine President
Joseph Estrada and several other APEC officials have also met with
Anwar's wife to communicate their support.

Chechen president to head anti-kidnapping drive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov is
personally heading a campaign to destroy gangs blamed for a wave of
kidnappings in the breakaway region, officials said Tuesday.
	   Security Minister Aslanbek Arsayev told journalists that
large-scale operations had started to arrest people involved in
kidnappings and to release hostages. Security forces had compiled
information on the gangs and a series of raids was planned, he
said.
	   Maskhadov was determined to end the wave of kidnappings of
Russians, Chechens and foreigners that have plagued the lawless
republic in recent years, the officials said. Up to 700 people are
being held by kidnappers, according to some estimates.
	   Similar anti-kidnapping drives in the past have failed to end
the problem.
	   Chechnya, which regards itself as independent after a two-year
war with Russia, has been plagued by lawlessness, frustrating
efforts to rebuild the war-shattered region.

Cabinet allows national airport to grow on present site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Dutch government has agreed to
scrap a 44 million passengers-per-year limit at Amsterdam's
Schiphol Airport so the ambitious hub can keep expanding.
	   The decision by the Cabinet late Monday could lead to a doubling
of the airport's capacity to a maximum of 80 million passengers
each year. Last year, it handled 32 million travelers.
	   Environmentalists said Tuesday they would protest the decision,
warning that it could lead to increased air and noise pollution.
	   The Cabinet also said it would investigate how the airport, one
of Europe's busiest, can continue to grow in the future. Schiphol's
directors want to shift most airport operations to a manmade island
in the North Sea.
	   Schiphol believes that once its new fifth runway is built in
2003, it will be able to handle a maximum of 600,000 takeoffs and
landings on its current site. When that limit is reached, the
airport wants to have the island ready to allow further growth.
	   The government is due to make a policy statement on Schiphol's
future growth in mid-December.

Germany, Belgium don't want Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Belgium and Germany said Tuesday they don't want
Italy to send them Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan as an
alternative to extraditing him to Turkey, where he is on trial in
absentia as a terrorist.
	   ``We are having problems enough in Belgium'' with the Kurdistan
Workers Party or PKK, which has been fighting for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey since 1984, Belgian Foreign Minister Erik
Derycke said in Rome.
	   Derycke said he did not want to see Ocalan in Belgium _ where
the PKK maintains a parliament in exile. ``We are already not very
keen to have that Kurdish parliament in Belgium.'' he added.
	   And German Foreign Minister Fisher, whose country issued an
arrest warrant for the PKK leader in 1990, said Ocalan is ``a
matter for Italy.''
	   He and Derycke spoke separately to reporters after a meeting of
EU foreign and defense ministers in Rome.
	   Fischer said he told Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem on
Monday that Ankara must improve its human rights record and ``make
concessions to a minority.''
	   In a sign of eagerness to get Ocalan back, Turkey has moved to
abolish its death penalty. Italy does not extradite people to
countries where they face execution.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Ocalan's fate was in
the hands of an Italian court. He said he did not expect a decision
for at least 40 days.
	   Turkey's fight against the PKK has claimed an estimated 37,000
lives since 1984. Ocalan was arrested last week at Rome's
international airport when he arrived on a flight from Moscow.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore said
Tuesday a dlrs 5 billion joint U.S.-Japan plan to guarantee new
Asian debt issues will help speed debt restructuring in the region.
	   Speaking to a group of heads of state and business leaders at
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Gore said the plan _
announced Monday _ would help recapitalize Asian banks and restore
the flow of credit to the region's companies.
	   The U.S.-Japan plan, which includes dlrs 3 billion in funding
from Tokyo, is likely to be used to guarantee bonds that crisis-hit
Asian countries issue, U.S. officials have said. The proceeds of
the bonds would then be used to recapitalize Asian banks, which
have an estimated dlrs 2 trillion in problem loans.
	   ``It is a recognition of the fact that action by these countries
is important in getting creditors and debtors together,'' said J.
Gary Burkhead, vice chairman of Fidelty Management Resources Corp.,
one of the executives in the APEC Business Advisory Council.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.
	   Its Asian members were battered last year by the region's
currency crisis.
	   The business council met with the APEC leaders and urged
immediate steps to revive growth in Asia.
	   ``APEC's response to the crisis to date has been inadequate in
relation to the magnitude and depth of the crisis facing Asian
businesses and people,'' said Tajudin Ramli, chairman of the
council.
	   The group presented a variety of proposals aimed at restoring
investor confidence in the region, stabilizing regional currencies
and attracting foreign investment.
	   It also called on the group to fulfill its commitment to free
trade. It urged APEC leaders to approve measures to address the
severe impact of the crisis on small and medium-size businesses.
	   Gore agreed that APEC must move ahead with its free trade
agenda, and said he hoped the group would complete a plan to cut
tariffs on nine industries over the next year.
	   APEC ministers failed on Sunday to reach agreement on reducing
tariffs in two of the nine sectors that had been selected during
the 1997 APEC summit.
	   Business leaders were also concerned that political issues could
cloud APEC's vision. On Monday, Gore upset host Malaysia with
remarks in a speech to the business forum about jailed former
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``I regret that the vice president saw fit to bring his
political judgment to the forum,'' said Philip Burdon, a New
Zealand businessman.

Former Olympic champ David Hemery elected president of UK

Athletics, pledges anti-doping fight

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Former Olympic hurdles champion David
Hemery was elected Tuesday as president of the governing body of
British athletics, saying one of his main priorities will be to
lead the fight against doping.
	   Hemery, who won the gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles at the
1968 Mexico City Olympics and is a former world record-holder in
the event, defeated former Olympic champion Steve Ovett and three
other candidates in voting for president of UK Athletics.
	   The 54-year-old Hemery receiving 426 votes in the polling of
Britain's athletic clubs. Sir Eddie Kulukundis was second with 309
votes and Ovett third with 274, followed by Tom McNab with 129 and
Michael Turner with 99.
	   Ovett, gold medalist in the 800 meters at the 1980 Moscow
Olympics and former world record-holder at 1,500 meters, had been
considered the favorite.
	   ``All the gambling money would have been on Steve Ovett,''
Hemery said. ``I was sure he'd get the job.''
	   One of Hemery's first tasks will be to help appoint a chief
executive of Athletics UK, the body given the task of running the
sport following the financial collapse last year of the British
Athletics Federation.
	   David Moorcroft, former 5,000-meter world record-holder, has
been running the organization since then and is expected to be
named chief executive.
	   Hemery will be a figurehead, working in an honorary capacity
alongside the chief executive.
	   Hemery has been a coach, teacher, manager and writer since
retiring from the sport. He has worked in management training for
the past 10 years.
	   He has an image of integrity, representing the old-fashioned
values of the amateur era.
	   ``What I really care about is honesty and fair play in
athletics,'' he said. ``I want to try to be the conscience of our
sport.''
	   Hemery said he is determined to ensure Britain leads an
international campaign against the use of performance enhancing
drugs.
	   ``I love this sport and when I see an outstanding individual
performance, I may think, `That's awesome, that's fabulous,''' he
said. ``But there's a niggling little question gnawing in the back
of my mind which says, `I wonder if there's any performance
enhancing stuff going on here.' That's a horrible thing to have to
think.''
	   ``In years gone by, people looked at British sport as a model of
fair play,'' Hemery said. ``I think it would be a great pity if we
ignore that tradition which is why I'll be certainly trying to pool
ideas about how we can free the sport from drugs. It has to be an
international approach. I'd like to think everyone is on the same
playing field.''
	   The drug problem worries Hemery even more because his
16-year-old son, Adrian, is a promising decathlete.
	   ``I do not want this to be a sport where a parent has to turn
around to their child and say, `I'm not sure I want you to be in
this sport,''' he said.
	   Emery will also be trying to lure the World Championships, which
have never been held in Britain, to London in 2003.

Prosecutors charge South Korean soccer officials with corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Prosecutors have charged 29 coaches,
officials and parents with taking or giving bribes to arrange for
high school soccer players to enter colleges or be chosen as
national junior players.
	   Twelve high school and college soccer coaches and one referee
were indicted Monday on charges of receiving bribes of up to dlrs
32,000 each from parents of high school athletes since 1996.
	   Prosecutors also charged 16 parents with paying bribes.
	   They said the referee fixed matches so that certain players
would score more and accused the coaches of influence-peddling in
selecting players for college soccer teams and the national junior
team.
	   Prosecutors said all 16 soccer players under question have
entered colleges or have been selected as national junior soccer
players, but did not reveal their names.
	   If found guilty, those charged face up to five years in prison.

U.N. weapons inspectors arrive in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Iraqi editorial at end; TRIMS throughout. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors returned Tuesday to
Iraq, saying they would get to work as soon as possible to test
Iraq's pledge to cooperate in the search for its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The arms inspectors have been working for more than seven years
to unearth Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles, but Iraq has frequently blocked their work. The latest
threat of attack by U.S. and British forces produced a renewed
promise to cooperate.
	   ``We are back. We are ready to work immediately,'' senior
weapons inspector Jaakko Ylitalo told reporters after his C-130
transport plane landed Tuesday morning at the Habaniya military air
base outside Baghdad.
	   Ylitalo was among 86 inspectors from UNSCOM and the
International Atomic Energy Agency who arrived from the Gulf state
of Bahrain, where they were evacuated last week from Iraq when U.S.
airstrikes seemed likely.
	   At the airbase, an Iraqi official told Ylitalo that if Iraq had
prepared for the resumption of their work.
	   ``Everything will be sorted out as soon as possible,'' the
unidentified official told Ylitalo.
	   Asked by reporters if Iraqi officials were helpful, Ylitalo
said: ``We have no problems.''
	   With the threat of American and British airstrikes on Iraq over
for now, about 150 U.N. relief workers also returned to Baghdad
from the Jordanian capital of Amman, where they were sent at the
height of the crisis.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the inspectors in Iraq, said
that Iraq's disarmament activities would start Wednesday in
earnest.
	   Once inspectors report they are able to work effectively, the
U.N. Security Council will conduct a review of Iraq's efforts to
eliminate its dangerous weapons. The Iraqi government wants the
review to lead quickly to the lifting of U.N. sanctions _ a move
both the United States and Britain have resisted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated
Iraq's economy. The council has said they will not be lifted until
UNSCOM and the Vienna-base nuclear agency certify that Iraq has
eliminated its lethal weaponry.
	   Cross said UNSCOM was looking forward to ``a productive and
professional relationship'' with the Iraqi government. First, she
said, the inspectors will ``get all the computers on line, making
sure the camera system is working. That is our first priority.''
	   From their headquarters the inspectors can monitor about 120
remote control cameras at suspected Iraqi weapons sites. They also
carry out both announced and spot visits.
	   Before the inspectors left Bahrain, Ms. Cross said they would
quickly test Iraq's pledge of cooperation.
	   ``The Iraqi authorities have promised cooperation. Obviously the
next few days are going to be very important,'' she said.
	   The threat of military action was averted Sunday when U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced the United States had accepted the
Iraqi government's pledge a day earlier to lift its three-month ban
on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Despite Iraq's backdown, Iraq's state-run newspapers declared
Tuesday that President Saddam Hussein's reversal in policy had
undercut the United States.
	   Al-Iraq said Saddam's last-minute change of mind ``hit America
in the heart and forced the hands of evil back into their holes.''
	   It said Saddam wisely averted ``a conspiracy by America as it
hastened to implement another crime.''
	   ``The flag of Iraq flies high, while America's flies half
mast,'' the official al-Ittihad weekly said in a red banner
headline.

Australian minister tells Anwar's wife to remain strong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An Australian official urged the
wife of jailed Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday to
``remain strong'' in her efforts to publicize his struggle.
	   Former Australian Finance Minister Gareth Evans added his name
to the list of top officials who have used their visits to Malaysia
for an economic summit to publicly criticize the arrest of Anwar,
the former Malaysian deputy prime minister.
	   Anwar was jailed on charges of abuse of power and sexual
misconduct after launching a nationwide, anti-government reform
movement. He contends the charges against him were fabricated by
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's government.
	   After meeting Azizah Ismail, Anwar's 46-year-old wife, Evans
said that Anwar may have been the victim of a government plan to
simply discard one of its opponents.
	   Azizah has taken over for her husband as de-facto leader of the
reform movement that he started and has fought to bring his plight
to the attention of the international community.
	   Several influential politicians, attending this week's
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur, have met
with Azizah to express support for her campaign.
	   The visits included a secret lunch on Sunday with Australia's
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, followed by a half-hour talk
with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he
urged Azizah to be patient and ``fight for the cause of freedom and
democracy'' during his meeting with her.

Broncos stay unbeaten, rout Chiefs 30-7
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ Quarterback Bubby Brister ran 38
yards for a touchdown on the first series and the Denver Broncos
cruised to an easy 30-7 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs Monday
night.
	   Terrell Davis also ran 41 yards for a score as the Broncos
jumped ahead early and became the the first U.S. National Football
League team to go win their 10 games in a season since the 1991
Washington Redskins.
	   Brister completed 13-of-23 pass attempts for 180 yards and
Davis, who leads the NFL in rushing, carried 18 times for 111
yards. The Denver defense held the Chiefs to 31 yards on the
ground.
	   It was the fifth straight loss for Kansas City, (4-6), which
looked before the season like the most dangerous threat to the
Broncos in both their division and conference.
	   But the Chiefs, who had never lost as many as four straight
during Marty Schottenheimer's 10 seasons as coach, looked like a
dispirited bunch against the Broncos, who now have outscored
opponents 114-13 in first quarters this season.
	   It took just 2:42 for Denver to take a 7-0 lead, on the bootleg
around right end by the 36-year-old Brister, who is now 4-0 as a
starter in place of John Elway _ who is nursing pulled rib muscles.
Brister was virtually untouched after his fake to Davis pulled the
entire Kansas City defense to the opposite side of the field.
	   The next score was even quicker _ a 79-yard drive that took only
three plays and 1:05 and was capped by the burst by Davis, who
finished with 111 yards on 18 carries. He was tripped up 10 yards
downfield, regained his balance, and continued on into the end
zone.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Phones are hard to come by in remote
Albania, so a villager used what was handy to summon help when he
saw a traffic accident _ he fired off his anti-aircraft machine
gun.
	   Police appreciated the gesture enough to not arrest the man for
possessing the heavy weapon, but still confiscated the gun,
newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The incident occurred Saturday on the national highway near
Gramsh, 70 kilometers (45 miles) south of Tirana, when a truck
drove off the road, trapping the badly injured driver inside.
	   After witnessing the crash, the villager set up the heavy
machine gun on the roof of his nearby house and fired into the air
until police arrived.
	   The villager apparently didn't reveal how he came by the weapon
in gun-happy Albania, but Gramsh is the site of a huge army depot
that was looted last year during the unrest that followed the
collapse of pyramid schemes.

Chechen president to head anti-kidnapping drive

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov is
personally heading a campaign to destroy gangs blamed for a wave of
kidnappings in the breakaway region, officials said Tuesday.
	   Security Minister Aslanbek Arsayev told journalists that
large-scale operations had started to arrest people involved in
kidnappings and to release hostages. Security forces had compiled
information on the gangs and a series of raids was planned, he
said.
	   Maskhadov was determined to end the wave of kidnappings of
Russians, Chechens and foreigners that have plagued the lawless
republic in recent years, the officials said. Up to 700 people are
being held by kidnappers, according to some estimates.
	   Similar anti-kidnapping drives in the past have failed to end
the problem.
	   Chechnya, which regards itself as independent after a two-year
war with Russia, has been plagued by lawlessness, frustrating
efforts to rebuild the war-shattered region.
	   Six Chechen police officers were kidnapped Monday on the border
with the neighboring region of Ingushetia, apparently part of a
feud between the two regions, the Interfax news agency reported
Tuesday.

First Swedish Roman Ctholic bishop since Reformation appointed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ For the first time in 400 years,
Sweden's Roman Catholics will have a bishop who's a Swede.
	   The Vatican on Tuesday named the Rev. Anders Arborelius as
bishop of the Stockholm diocese, which covers all of Sweden.
Arborelius was born in Switzerland of Swedish parents and grew up
in the Swedish city of Lund.
	   He replaces Bishop Hubertus Brandenburg, a German, who on
Tuesday turned 75, the usual retirement age for bishops.
	   Arborelius will become the first Swede to head the church in
this country since the Protestant Reformation swept the country in
the 1500s. The Reformation changed Sweden from an almost entirely
Catholic country into one where Catholics were banned.
	   Until 1860, no native Swedes were allowed to be Catholics and
today the church claims only about 2 percent of the population _
about 165,000 people _ and most of its priests are foreign-born,
according to the Stockholm diocese.

Study: Chinese preference for platinum jewelry props up global
</HEADLINE>
demand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A growing demand among China's urban middle class
for platinum rather than gold jewelry has boosted sales, despite
deteriorating global economic conditions, according to an industry
study released Tuesday.
	   Sales of platinum to jewelry makers could be up by as much as 40
percent this year, said Johnson Matthey, the British refiner and
marketer of platinum group metals.
	   ``In China, platinum continues to gain in popularity with
younger consumers, who see it as a modern, fashionable and
sophisticated alternative to gold jewelry,'' the company's report
said.
	   Johnson Matthey reported that North American demand for platinum
jewelry also grew strongly, spurred by the increasing popularity of
platinum wedding rings, especially among middle-income consumers.
	   Demand in Japan _ the world's biggest buyer of platinum jewelry
_ was reported to be holding relatively steady despite the
country's economic difficulties.
	   ``The retail market for platinum jewelry has been protected from
the impact of the recession by a fashion trend in favor of white
metal,'' according to Johnson Matthey's report.
	   It noted that sales of lightweight platinum earrings and
necklaces were on the rise in Japan this year, although sales of
rings and the more expensive gem-set products were falling.
	   Total world platinum demand in 1998 is forecast by Johnson
Matthey at 5.13 million ounces, down 40,000 ounces from 1997.
Supply this year is expected to be at 5.04 million ounces, compared
with 4.97 million ounces last year, the report said.
	   Use for jewelry _ the metal's biggest outlet _ is forecast at a
record 2.190 million ounces this year, up from 2.160 million ounces
in 1997.
	   But the volume of platinum going into making auto-catalysts _
which clean up vehicle exhaust emissions _ is seen falling to 1.800
million ounces from 1.870 million ounces in 1997.
	   This is partly the result of the ongoing switch by U.S. vehicle
manufacturers to cheaper palladium-based catalysts to meet
tightening emissions legislation, Johnson Matthey said.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain launched a 6 billion pound (dlrs 10
billion) investment plan Tuesday to turn London into the world's
leading millennium destination.
	   England's capital is being marketed as ``London, Millennium
City'' under the plan, which includes improvements to existing
museums and galleries and the construction of 55 new hotels.
	   The centerpiece attraction will be the Millennium Dome, a vast
millennium-themed performance and exhibition space rising on the
banks of the Thames in south London.
	   The National Maritime Museum at Greenwich nearby will reopen
next year after an extensive redevelopment that includes the
addition of 11 galleries, which will tell the story of Britain and
the sea.
	   And on the wall above Greenwich's Meridian Line, a clock will
count down the hours until the millennium.
	   London will be ``the most exciting city destination in the world
for the new millennium,'' said David Batts, chairman of the London
Tourist Board.
	   The plan includes The String of Pearls Millennium Festival,
which will bring together more than 50 famous landmarks along the
Thames, linked by new river passenger services and walkways.
	   In 2000, the festival will provide a year-long program of guided
tours, exhibitions, concerts and community projects.
	   Famous landmarks involved include the Tower of London, the
Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's Cathedral and
the National Gallery.
	   Sir John Egan, the tourist board's president, said research
showed international visitors were ``largely unaware of the breadth
of London's renaissance.''

Arafat defuses crisis with Israel by disavowing violence

 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday defused the latest crisis with Israel by disavowing
violence and endorsing negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Arafat's remarks were
``positive'' and that the Palestinian leader had cleared an
obstacle on the way to implementing last month's land-for-security
agreement.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu had suspended Israel's troop withdrawal
from 2 percent of the West Bank, which was scheduled for later this
week, until Arafat retracted threats to unilaterally establish a
Palestinian state in May and perhaps use force.
	   After reviewing Arafat's latest statements, Netanyahu adviser
David Bar-Illan saidt the prime minister ``considers this a
retraction.''
	   Netanyahu said his Cabinet would still have to meet Wednesday to
review whether the Palestinians have lived up to their obligations
and whether to give the go ahead for the upcoming pullback.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinians have
met all their commitments so far, such as resuming security
cooperation with Israel. Later this week, the Palestinians plan to
announce the legal framework for confiscating illegal weapons and
on Nov. 23, a committee reviewing cases of incitement will meet for
the first time, Erekat said.

Portugal urges U.N. to reopen East Timor massacre investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama
has asked the United Nations to reopen its investigation into a
1991 massacre in East Timor following new claims that Indonesian
troops executed about 150 pro-independence demonstrators.
	   Gama sent a letter Monday to U.N. high commissioner for human
rights Mary Robinson detailing the new allegations by Mario
Carrascalao, who was governor of the disputed territory at the time
of the events, a ministry spokeswoman said Tuesday.
	   Carrascalao told Portuguese weekly Expresso that some 150
demonstrators arrested during a march at the Santa Cruz cemetery in
Dili, the East Timor capital, were later summarily executed at two
locations.
	   A U.N. fact-finding commission in 1994 quoted Indonesian
officials as saying just 50 people were killed when troops opened
fire on the protesters.
	   However, independent sources and human rights activists insisted
at the time that some 200 had died.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops
intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of
Portuguese rule.
	   Human rights groups have accused the Indonesian military of
abuses in the half-island territory 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles)
east of Jakarta.
	   The United Nations still considers Portugal the administering
power and is brokering ongoing talks between Lisbon and Jakarta to
resolve the dispute.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin
expressed concern Tuesday over the treatment of ethnic Chinese in
Indonesia, Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas said.
	   During the widespread riots in May that toppled President
Suharto, looting of shops was concentrated on those owned by ethnic
Chinese. Reports that ethnic Chinese women were raped
systematically during the unrest are being investigated.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie assured Jiang during a
bilateral meeting at the Aisa-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
Malaysia that his government strongly condemned the crimes against
the Chinese, Alatas said.
	   Habibie said the Indonesia government is determined to eliminate
the racial, social and economic gaps between ethnic Indonesians and
Chinese, Alatas said. The small Chinese minority owns a large
percentage of the country's businesses and companies.
	   Jiang expressed satisfaction with Habibie's explanation, but
said he hopes such riots don't happen again.
	   Habibie also said he hopes that what happened during the unrest
in May won't affect relations between the two countries, Alatas
said. ``Don't let what happened in the past become a stumbling
block to our future cooperation,'' Alatas quoted Habibie as saying.
``We should take it as a lesson to prevent it from happening again
in the future.''

Parkinson's disease drug suspended in EU, Roche says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche said
Tuesday it has suspended the use of its anti-Parkinson's disease
drug Tasmar in the European Union and will issue a revised label
restricting its use in the United States.
	   ``Evolving safety information has led Roche to revise the
recommendations to physicians on the appropriate use of the drug,''
the company said in a statement.
	   The European Commission has asked member states to suspend the
use of Tasmar from Tuesday. First launched in August 1997, it is
available in 38 countries.
	   On Monday, the U.S. government warned the drug may cause fatal
liver damage and should be reserved for severe cases unhelped by
other therapies.
	   The Food and Drug Administration approved Tasmar in January. But
after learning of three deaths from severe liver damage, it ordered
Roche to put the government's strongest warning on the drug's
label.
	   Patients taking Tasmar should consult physicians and shouldn't
precipitately stop treatment, since inappropriate change in therapy
might trigger serious harm, Roche said.
	   The company said that for a restricted number of patients the
addition of Tasmar to standard therapy is providing a ``clinically
significant benefit that outweighs the risk.''
	   Roche last month confirmed it had sent an advisory letter to
doctors asking them to report any liver troubles in patients taking
Tasmar.
	   About 60,000 people worldwide have taken Tasmar, including up to
30,000 Americans.

Arafat backs off plans to unilaterally declare independence in May

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday defused the latest crisis with Israel by disavowing
violence and endorsing negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Arafat's remarks
were ``positive'' and that the Palestinian leader cleared an
obstacle on the way to implementing the land-for-security agreement
signed last month.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu suspended Israel's troop withdrawal from 2
percent of the West Bank, which was scheduled for later this week,
until Arafat retracted threats to unilaterally establish a
Palestinian state in May and perhaps use force.
	   After reviewing Arafat's latest statements, Netanyahu adviser
David Bar-Illan said the prime minister ``considers this a
retraction.''
	   Netanyahu said Israel's Cabinet would still have to decide
Wednesday to review whether the Palestinians have lived up to their
obligations and whether to give the go ahead for the pullback.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinians have
met all their commitments so far, such as resuming security
cooperation with Israel. Later this week, the Palestinians plan to
announce the legal framework for confiscating illegal weapons and
on Nov. 23, a committee reviewing cases of incitement will meet for
the first time, Erekat said.
	   The withdrawal, the first of three, was to have been carried out
on Monday, but Israel has fallen behind schedule because of a
series of disputes.
	   Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of
January, in exchange for a Palestinian campaign against Islamic
militants.
	   The U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, said earlier Tuesday that
he was confident the row would be settled. ``Both sides have
obligations and both sides, I think, will fulfill their
obligations,'' Ross said after talks with Israeli Trade Minister
Natan Sharansky.
	   Arafat opened a news conference Tuesday with German President
Roman Herzog in the West Bank town of Jericho by reading a
statement concerning the dispute with the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis,'' Arafat said.
	   ``Peace is a Palestinian strategic choice and any differences in
the final status negotiations, we stress that we want them to be
solved by peaceful means through negotiations, and not in any other
way,'' the Palestinian leader said.
	   Arafat issued a similar clarification Monday night. However, on
Tuesday he went a step further by appearing to be backing off plans
to unilaterally declare statehood in May, at the end of the
five-year autonomy period.
	   Israel and the Palestinians are to have completed negotiations
on a permanent peace agreement by May, but with many difficult
issues on the agenda, including final borders and the future of
Jerusalem, it appears unlikely the deadline can be met.
	   Arafat also stressed in his statement that such an accord would
be reached by peaceful means. In a speech Sunday to loyalists from
his Fatah movement, he had alluded to the use of force, saying that
``our rifle is ready'' to take Jerusalem.
	   Despite the dispute, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met
Monday night, as scheduled, to try to conclude an agreement on
setting up a land route for Palestinians between the West Bank and
Gaza.
	   The head of the Palestinian delegation, Abdel Razek Yehiyeh,
said he expected all issues to be settled by next week, and said
the so-called ``safe passage'' could be opened within a month.
	   Another committee dealing with the release of Palestinian
prisoners was meeting this afternoon. Israel was to free a first
group of 250 prisoners, out of a total of 750, by the weekend.
	   In the first pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank is to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction, and
7.1 percent is to go from shared to sole Palestinian control.
	   Israel's government has not presented withdrawal maps. The
Yediot Ahronot daily published its own map and said most of the
land changing hands was in the northern West Bank, around the
Palestinian towns of Jenin and Nablus.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin
expressed concern Tuesday over the treatment of ethnic Chinese in
Indonesia, Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas said.
	   During the widespread riots in May that toppled President
Suharto, looting of shops was concentrated on those owned by ethnic
Chinese. Reports that ethnic Chinese women were raped
systematically during the unrest are being investigated.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie assured Jiang during a
bilateral meeting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
Malaysia that his government strongly condemned the crimes against
the Chinese, Alatas said.
	   Habibie said the Indonesia government is determined to eliminate
the racial, social and economic gaps between ethnic Indonesians and
Chinese, Alatas said. The small Chinese minority owns a large
percentage of the country's businesses and companies.
	   Jiang expressed satisfaction with Habibie's explanation, but
said he hopes such riots don't happen again.
	   Habibie also said he hopes that what happened during the unrest
in May won't affect relations between the two countries, Alatas
said. ``Don't let what happened in the past become a stumbling
block to our future cooperation,'' Alatas quoted Habibie as saying.
``We should take it as a lesson to prevent it from happening again
in the future.''

	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ An appeals court on Tuesday upheld a
conviction against far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen but reduced
the punishment, banning him from politics for one year instead of
two for assaulting a Socialist politician.
	   The court also gave Le Pen a three-month suspended sentence, and
a reduced fine of 5,000 francs (about dlrs 900). He had originally
been fined 20,000 francs (dlrs 3,333).
	   The ruling means Le Pen, 70, cannot hold office, run for office,
or vote for a year.

Report:Mexican president to visit Russia in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo will visit Russia in
May, 1999 for talks on boosting trade by resolving disputes that
have blocked better economic relations, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported Tuesday.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgi Mamedov said in Mexico
City that the visit had been agreed after consultations between the
two nations, the agency reported.
	   Mamedov said several important documents are being drafted for
the Mexican president's visit, including a new approach to
bilateral relations and ways to tackle common problems.
	   These include non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, trade and
economic cooperation, terrorism, drug trafficking, organised crime,
money laundering, corruption and regional crises.
	   ``Having wonderful relations at the political level, we
understand at the same time that potentials for developing mutually
advantageous trade and economic cooperation have not been tapped up
to this time,'' Mamedov said.
	   Obstacles to improving trade include anti-dumping hearings
against Russian steel exports and problems over certification of
Russian equipment and technology, including military equipment, in
Mexico.

Portugal urges U.N. to reopen East Timor massacre investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama
has asked the United Nations to reopen its investigation into a
1991 massacre in East Timor following new claims that Indonesian
troops executed about 150 pro-independence demonstrators.
	   In a letter Monday to U.N. high commissioner for human rights
Mary Robinson, Gama detailed the new allegations by Mario
Carrascalao, then governor of the disputed territory, a ministry
spokeswoman said Tuesday.
	   Carrascalao told Portuguese weekly Expresso that some 150
demonstrators arrested during a march at the Santa Cruz cemetery in
Dili, the East Timor capital, were later summarily executed at two
locations.
	   A U.N. fact-finding commission in 1994 quoted Indonesian
officials as saying just 50 people were killed when troops opened
fire on the protesters.
	   However, independent sources and human rights activists insisted
at the time that about 200 had died.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops
intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of
Portuguese rule.
	   Human rights groups have accused the Indonesian military of
abuses in the half-island territory 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles)
east of Jakarta.
	   The United Nations still considers Portugal the administering
power and is brokering ongoing talks between Lisbon and Jakarta to
resolve the dispute.

Federation doctor suspects athletes using sophisticated drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's top track and field doctor
suspects some German athletes of taking undetectable
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Dr. Karlheinz Graff, chief doctor for the national track and
field team, has told the German Athletics Federation (DLV) that two
athletes have asked him for plasma, which can be used to fight
blood thickening that can be a result of taking EPO.
	   EPO is a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of
oxygen-carrying red blood cells and cannot be detected by existing
drug tests. The substance gained notoriety during the scandal that
marred this year Tour de France cycling race.
	   According to DLV, Graff has ''strong suspicion that at least one
DLV athlete has been using blood doping or doping through EPO for a
long time.''
	   Graff declined to name any athletes.
	   The DLV welcomed Graff's disclosure on Tuesday and asked him for
a written statement so that its anti-doping panel can prepare any
possible action.
	   ''The DLV hopes to make further progress in fighting the abuse
of EPO by taking joint action with physicians and lawyers,'' DLV
president Helmut Digel said.

Injured Kenyans receive compensation for U.S. Embassy bombing

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ They came, many of them soaked in a
downpour, on crutches, tapping white canes and leaning on friends'
shoulders.
	   After a 13-week wait, dozens of Kenyans received compensation
Tuesday for brutal injuries they suffered in the terrorist bombing
of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya.
	   No one _ not the victims, nor the officials handing out the
checks _ pretended it was enough.
	   ``This money today is just enough to say, sorry,'' said Susan
Mutungi of the Kenya Red Cross Society.
	   Pius Maina, whose eyes were gouged out by flying glass, agreed.
In his hand was a rain-speckled check he could not see for 300,000
Kenyan shillings (dlrs 5,000), more money than the 64-year-old ever
had before.
	   ``This is too little, in fact,'' Maina said. ``But it can
help.''
	   He's given up farming because he can no longer tend his crops,
and plans to use his money to build small rental houses on his
property. He still has two children to put through school, feed and
clothe.
	   ``I have a lot of difficulties,'' said Maina, who was in a bus
outside the embassy when the blast went off.
	   He was one of 49 people who crouched beneath dripping trees and
slid through mud at downtown Nairobi's Uhuru Park to collect checks
from 242 million Kenyan shillings (dlrs 4 million) in donations to
the National Disaster Emergency Fund Committee.
	   The panel of businessmen, social workers and government
officials is reviewing 2,514 compensation claims ranging from
300,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 5,000) for those who were blinded or
lost limbs, to 30,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 500) for those who
were badly cut and bruised.
	   A total of 213 people were killed Aug. 7, including a dozen
Americans, and more than 5,400 people were injured, mostly
passersby sliced by flying glass. A near-simultaneous attack on the
U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania killed 11 people, all
Africans.
	   U.S. authorities believe Osama bin Laden, Saudi exile and
militant Muslim, masterminded the bombings. On Nov. 4, a 238-count
indictment opened in New York City charged bin Laden and a cohort
with murder and conspiracy. Three alleged co-conspirators are
already jailed in New York.
	   So far, the committee has paid 194 death claims.
	   Originally, families received 150,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs
3,000) each for compensation and burials. That figure will be
supplemented to 400,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 6,700), said Robert
Shaw, fund spokesman.
	   In addition to a check for 300,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs
5,000), the committee on Tuesday had a special gift for Catherine
Bwire _ baby clothes for her daughter. Jean Bahati was born 11
weeks after her 25-year-old mother was blinded in the blast.
	   Balanced on crutches, Magani Mauko, 51, said he needed his
compensation of 240,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 4,000) for more
surgery on his right leg, which was badly mangled in the collapse
of a building.
	   ``I'd like to start a new business,'' the former handyman said,
``but first I need to walk, to feed my family and to pay rent.''
	   Some of the most seriously injured were unable to leave
hospitals to collect their checks.
	   Samuel Njenga said his wife of 16 years, Teresia Karanja, was
lying paralyzed from the waist down in a hospital bed.
	   On her behalf, he accepted top benefits, 300,000 Kenyan
shillings (dlrs 5,000), but just a third of the amount needed to
send the computer technician and mother of four to South Africa for
two months of rehabilitation.
	   ``Even if I started shouting in anger, it wouldn't do any
good,'' Njenga said. ``You just have to accept the situation, and
keep on trying.''

computer has not only changed the world but ``certainly my life.''
	   Pope John Paul II is not known to use a computer, but the

words and images go out over the Internet.
	   ``The computer has changed the world a little bit, certainly my
life,'' he told students after receiving a computer as a gift

	   In a speech, the pope said ``economic and professional needs
must never cover up the principal goal of education, which is
creating masters of life.''

Abducted oil workers released by Nigeria youths
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Eight oil workers abducted last week by a
group of militant youths in southern Nigerian were released Tuesday
unharmed and in good spirits, a Texaco official said.
	   The oil workers _ three Americans, a Briton, an Italian, a
Croatian a South African and a Nigerian _ were taken hostage last
week by armed youths from the ethnic Ijaw community who were
demanding a ransom for their release.
	   The hostages, working for various oil service companies on
contract with Texaco, were taken from an exploration drilling rig
near the Niger River delta in southern Nigeria.
	   ``They appeared to have been well treated and look fine,'' said
Yusuf N'jie, the assistant managing director of Texaco's joint
venture company in Nigeria.
	   Their release came after days of negotiations between the youths
and representatives of Nigeria's military government.
	   The Ijaw youths were using the kidnapping to draw the
government's attention toward the substandard conditions in which
many people from the poverty-stricken Niger delta area live.
	   Oil companies are frequent targets of protests, and occasionally
hostage-takings, by people who feel that the government is
unconcerned with their plight.
	   Although Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil producer,
residents of the delta often live in desperate poverty _ without
paved roads, electricity or running water.
	   In the past few years, oil companies have begun large-scale aid
programs in the delta, supplying millions of dollars for such
things as schools and clinics.
	   But with the government unresponsive, companies continue to be
targeted.

Tight security measures for Albania-Greece soccer game.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP)- Special police units were guarding the
stadium where Albania was scheduled to play Greece on Wednesday in
the first international soccer game to take place in Albania since
1996.
	   ``Special police units have been posted in and around the
stadium since Sunday,''Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga
said Tuesday.
	   He said that there will be tight control of the fans on
Wednesday before they enter the stadium.
	   Albania's general police director Veton Gjoliku was put in
charge of the police operations to secure the stadium, said Bizhga.
	   The last international game played at Tirana's Qemal Stafa
stadium was in March 1996 against Latvia.
	   In 1997, all sport activities were halted due to chaos and
lawlessness reigning in the country following the collapse of dodgy
investment schemes.
	   Despite efforts of the new government to reestablish public
order, crime remains high, and there are daily reports of
casualties, robberies and people held at gunpoints.
	   The Greek team was escorted Monday by police to the stadium for
training, while the Albanian team trained at a basketball court for
lack of other soccer fields.
	   Albanian players have been promised dlrs 4,000 each if they win,
which is the highest premium players have ever been paid.

	   ``Is somebody seeking my political death?'' he asked. ``I have
no regrets, except for having fallen into an ambush,'' he added,
calling on his supporters to protest if his conviction were upheld.
	   The National Front has consistently won about 15 percent of the
vote in national elections. It blames immigrants, particularly from

counselor in the Provence-Alpes-Cotes d'Azur region of southern

parliamentary immunity so German prosecutors can investigate
whether he broke laws that make trivializing the Holocaust a crime.
	   The charges came from comments he has made several times, saying
the Nazi gas chambers were a ``detail'' of history.

Kurds in Romania protest detention in Italy of rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Thousands of Kurds living in Romania
closed down restaurants, shops and companies to protest the arrest
of leader Abdullah Ocalan by Italian authorities, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   Kurdish business leaders said the one-day shutdown Monday cost
their 1,000 businesses some dlrs 700,000, daily Evenimentul Zilei
reported. There are some 4,000 Kurds living in Romania.
	   Kurdish students cut classes and workers didn't go to work. Some
41 Kurds declared a hunger strike Monday to protest Ocalan's
detention.
	   The protesters have refused any medical assistance from Romanian
authorities, relying on the services of two Kurdish doctors, the
paper reported.
	   ``We are not terrorists, as we are considered by the Turkish
state and its friends,'' said Aihan Dogan, a Kurdish leader.
	   The detention in Italy of Kurdish rebel leader Ocalan prompted
widespread protests by Kurds throughout Europe. Turkey has asked
for Ocalan to be returned to Turkey.

Federation doctor suspects athletes using sophisticated drugs

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix category code &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's top track and field doctor
suspects some German athletes of taking undetectable
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Dr. Karlheinz Graff, chief doctor for the national track and
field team, has told the German Athletics Federation (DLV) that two
athletes have asked him for plasma, which can be used to fight
blood thickening that can be a result of taking EPO.
	   EPO is a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of
oxygen-carrying red blood cells and cannot be detected by existing
drug tests. The substance gained notoriety during the scandal that
marred this year Tour de France cycling race.
	   According to DLV, Graff has ``strong suspicion that at least one
DLV athlete has been using blood doping or doping through EPO for a
long time.''
	   Graff declined to name any athletes.
	   The DLV welcomed Graff's disclosure on Tuesday and asked him for
a written statement so that its anti-doping panel can prepare any
possible action.
	   ``The DLV hopes to make further progress in fighting the abuse
of EPO by taking joint action with physicians and lawyers,'' DLV
president Helmut Digel said.

Nuclear material spills on autobahn in crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WIESBADEN, Germany (AP) _ A van carrying nuclear material for
medical labs spilled its load onto a German autobahn after crashing
into the center guardrail, police said Tuesday.
	   The Hesse state environment ministry said radioactivity levels
at the scene were ``not dramatic,'' but that five vehicle drivers
who stopped and helped after the crash were being tested for
contamination.
	   Containers with 265 kilograms (580 pounds) of radioactive
material were flung onto the highway and burst in the Monday night
crash, police said. The van driver was lightly injured.
	   Eight cars and one truck rolled over the contents before police
closed the highway at Lorsch, about 50 kilometers (31 miles)
southwest of Frankfurt.
	   The autobahn was closed in both directions for nearly seven
hours as decontamination crews cleaned up a stretch of about 200
meters (650 feet). The cause of the crash was under investigation.

Boeing aircraft diverts to Madeira islands due to engine problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A backup plane was to take a group of
holidaymakers from Madeira to Scotland on Tuesday after a Boeing
757 carrying them from Spain to Glasgow was forced to land in the
Portuguese islands because of an engine problem.
	   A spokeswoman at Porto Santo airport in the islands, located in
the Atlantic Ocean just off the Moroccan coast, said the 275
passengers were due to leave at 2.30 p.m. (1430 GMT) on a specially
chartered plane that had arrived from Britain.
	   The Boeing 757 flying from the Spanish Canary Island of Tenerife
made a ``precautionary'' landing, with fire engines standing by, on
Monday after a smell of smoke filtered through the aircraft, the
British news agency Press Association reported.
	   A spokesperson for the British holiday firm Britannia said the
plane had engine problems but there was no smoke visible in the
aircraft, according to the report.
	   Porto Santo officials did not know the cause of the problem.

 &UR; Eds: Combines pvs; clarifies in 2nd graf that appeals court upheld
three-month suspended sentence &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ An appeals court on Tuesday upheld a
conviction of far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen but reduced the
punishment, banning him from politics for one year instead of two
for assaulting a Socialist politician.
	   The court also upheld a three-month suspended sentence, and
ordered Le Pen to pay a reduced fine of 5,000 francs (about dlrs
900). He had originally been fined 20,000 francs (dlrs 3,333).
	   The ruling means Le Pen, 70, cannot hold office, run for office,
or vote for a year.
	   The conviction, unless successfully appealed, makes Le Pen
ineligible to run in the June 1999 European Parliament elections.
He has said that his wife, Jany, would run in his place _ a
position that put him on a collision course with his party's No. 2
man, Bruno Megret.
	   Le Pen wasn't present at Tuesday's court hearing.
	   He could lodge a final appeal with the Cour de Cassation,

Mantes-La-Jolie, west of Paris.

Japan uses APEC summit to help Peru financially
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi has pledged new loans and foreign aid to Peru, a Japanese
government official said Tuesday.
	   Obuchi made the offer when he met with Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori during the two-day Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum leaders' summit.
	   According to the official, Japan will extend 57.2 billion yen
(dlrs 474 million) in yen-denominated loans to support Peru's poor
and develop its rural areas. Japan also will give Peru a 1 billion
yen (dlrs 8 million) grant-in-aid to help it combat drug dealers.
	   Obuchi said he welcomed the recent improvement in relations
between Peru and Ecuador, and pledged that Japan will dispatch a
fact-finding mission to see whether it can cooperate in developing
the two countries' border areas.
	   Peru became a new APEC member this year, along with Russia and
Vietnam.

Amnesty International accuses Jordan of continued violations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 0001 GMT Wednesday. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Human rights violations continue in Jordan
despite political reforms that were introduced nine years ago, a
report by Amnesty International says.
	   It said the kingdom lacks ``the safeguards to prevent such
violations,'' which include alleged prolonged incommunicado
detention of political opponents, torture of detainees and
restrictions on freedom of expression.
	   It appears that several detainees have died in jail over the
last two years following beatings by members of different security
services and that ``sometimes there has been no proper
investigation'' of the alleged torture, Amnesty said in the report
faxed Tuesday to The Associated Press office in Amman, Jordan.
	   It said detainees had no access to family or lawyers.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Jordanian government,
which boasts of a ``transparent'' policy and democracy in a largely
totalitarian Arab world.
	   Officials have repeatedly said that Jordan has no political
prisoners since the reforms nine years ago which oversaw the
revival of a multi-party system.
	   Officials also have dismissed reports of torture and coerced
confessions from detainees by the country's largely feared General
Intelligence Department.
	   ``There seems to be almost total impunity for members of the
security services involved in torturing or ill-treating
detainees,'' the Amnesty report said.
	   It alleged arbitrary detention of political activists even those
who committed no violent acts, but may have slandered King Hussein
in public.
	   It said other detainees include fans of heavy metal music
accused of being ``satanists'' and students who took down a

college in southern Jordan in May 1997.
	   The report urged Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh, who took office
in August, to rescind a controversial press and publications law
enacted under a previous government three months ago.
	   The law gives the state the right to control and censor the
media, imposes stringent restrictions on reporting and hefty fines
on violators which include confiscating press credentials and
closing down the media outlet.
	   The statement urged the government to bring ``Jordanian law and
practice closer to the letter and spirit of international human
rights treaties to which it is a state party.''
	   It recommended ``an end to incommunicado detention, amending the
Press Law to guarantee the right to freedom of expression and the
inspection of detention centers by an independent body.''

U.N. rights expert to visit Nigeria from Sunday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U.N. investigator will travel to Nigeria for the
first time this weekend to check on the human rights situation
there, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   In a move aimed at restoring its international image, the
Nigerian government in September invited Indian expert Soli
Sorabjee to travel to the African nation ``as soon as possible.''
	   Sorabjee's visit will start Sunday and finish on Dec. 1, said
Jose Diaz, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human
Rights.
	   Sorabjee will report his findings back to the U.N. Human Rights
Commission.
	   Nigeria's new leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has promised to
end human rights abuses and restore democracy and civilian rule.
	   Nigeria is on a special watch list at the U.N. commission for
countries accused of the most flagrant violations. However, the
late military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, refused to allow Sorabjee
into Nigeria for a first-hand investigation.

Serbian president to stage talks despite Albanians' refusal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with KLA spokesman praising U.S. envoy, other
comments &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian President Milan Milutinovic
pressed ahead Tuesday with efforts to hold peace talks with rival
Kosovo Albanian officials despite their refusal to meet with him.
	   Serbian government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Milutinovic will travel Wednesday to Kosovo's capital Pristina
on a mission the ethnic Albanians have dismissed as a publicity
stunt.
	   Milutinovic wants to chair direct talks with the ethnic
Albanians, with international officials in attendance but not as
mediators.
	   The ethnic Albanians refuse to talk without U.S. and European
mediation, saying only foreign countries could guarantee that an
eventual agreement would be implemented by the Serbian government.
	   They have turned down 16 such invitations in the past six
months, prompting Serb authorities to show up at the prearranged
site anyway to try to show their sincerity and the ethnic
Albanians' lack of cooperation.
	   The Serbian government says the troubles in Kosovo, where
hundreds of people have died and tens of thousands were left
homeless in its crackdown against secessionists, are Serbia's
internal matter and should not involve foreign mediators.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders said Milutinovic's call for talks is a
part of Belgrade's effort to reduce international pressure on
Serbia to find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo turmoil. They said
ethnic Albanians support peace talks, but not under Serb
conditions.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has been shuttling between
Belgrade and Pristina to reach a compromise peace plan, was to meet
representatives of the Albanians' rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in
the province on Tuesday, guerrilla sources said.
	   Adem Demaci, a guerrilla spokesman, praised Hill's decision to
meet the KLA commanders.
	   ``Rugova can sign anything, but there could be no deal without
KLA consent,'' Demaci told reporters in Pristina, speaking of
Kosovo Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Commenting on Milutinovic's scheduled talks, Demaci said ``it's
a bluff intended to say that Albanians don't want dialogue and thus
deserve to be beaten by force.''
	   The militants have refused any compromise with the Serbian
government, demanding outright secession for Kosovo.
	   Rugova also advocates independence but is willing to negotiate a
possible three-year interim period during which Kosovo would regain
the autonomy stripped by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in
1989.
	   Serbian state-run media reported Tuesday that Milosevic's ruling
Socialist Party gave full support to Milutinovic in his attempts to
hold the talks.
	   But the opposition Democratic Party said Milutinovic's call for
talks is ``the sowing of mist'' aimed at fooling the public at home
and abroad.

Kurds in Romania protest detention in Italy of rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Thousands of Kurds living in Romania
closed down restaurants, shops and companies to protest the arrest
of leader Abdullah Ocalan by Italian authorities, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   Kurdish business leaders said the one-day shutdown Monday cost
their 1,000 businesses some dlrs 700,000, daily Evenimentul Zilei
reported. There are some 4,000 Kurds living in Romania.
	   Kurdish students cut classes and workers didn't go to work. Some
41 Kurds declared a hunger strike Monday to protest Ocalan's
detention.
	   The protesters have refused any medical assistance from Romanian
authorities, relying on the services of two Kurdish doctors, the
paper reported.
	   ``We are not terrorists, as we are considered by the Turkish
state and its friends,'' said Aihan Dogan, a Kurdish leader.
	   The detention in Italy of Kurdish rebel leader Ocalan prompted
widespread protests by Kurds throughout Europe. Turkey has asked
for Ocalan to be returned to Turkey.

Turkish president arrives amid tight security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ About 1,000 policemen were assigned to
protect Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, who arrived Tuesday on
a three-day official visit.
	   President Thomas Klestil's invitation for the visit was issued
to take place during Austria's European Union presidency.
	   Austrian government officials reportedly will try to open up a
``longer-term perspective'' for Turkey's EU membership.
	   A related topic certain to come up is Cyprus, among six
countries with whom the European Union started formal membership
talks on Nov. 10.
	   In a rare joint statement, the Netherlands, Germany and France
said the inability of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reconcile their
differences weighed heavily on their island's membership chances.
	   They spoke of ``fundamental problems'' in the Cyprus negotiating
process, adding ``a political solution is urgently required.''
	   Austrian police took special measures to ensure the safety of
the Turkish visitor.
	   ``The political situation requires comprehensive security
measures,'' the Austria Press Agency quoted Walter Zehetmayr, a
senior police officer, as saying.
	   The extra effort was prompted by the arrest last week in Rome of
Abdullah Ocalan, the chief of the Turkish Workers Party PKK,
Zehetmayr said. He hinted that he expects large protests of Turkish
groups in Vienna.
	   Demirel, who was accompanied by five Cabinet members and a large
trade delegation, is the first head of state of the Turkish
Republic to visit Austria, APA said.
	   Following his talks with Klestil and a luncheon in the
president's residence, Demirel was scheduled to meet Parliament
president Heinz Fischer and other senior officials. He was also to
deliver a speech to the Foreign Policy Society later Tuesday.

Schroeder: No additional German aid for Moscow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Schroeder saying Yeltsin looked
active, comment on economic program, Zyuganov; Yeltsin invited to
next Group of Seven summit; TRIMS, CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called the
Russian government's economic rescue plan a ``good start,'' but
indicated Germany would provide little more than moral support in
Russia's latest economic struggle.
	   Schroeder, on his first visit to Russia as German leader, met
Tuesday with President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin. Yeltsin
expressed hope that Russia and Germany ``will enter the next
century with their relations developing at the same pace as now.''
	   ``I'm sure they will,'' Schroeder responded.
	   Yeltsin looked fit and spoke distinctly at the start of the
meeting after weeks of renewed speculation about the state of his
health. He curtailed meetings last week with the visiting Japanese
prime minister, prompting new speculation that he was seriously
ill.
	   Speaking at a news conference after the talks, Schroeder said
Yeltsin was ``active and well-informed.''
	   He said Yeltsin will join the summit of the Group of Seven
industrialized nations in Cologne next June. Schroeder said he
would again travel to Moscow to hold further talks with Russian
officials.
	   Schroeder's predecessor, Helmut Kohl, had close ties with
Yeltsin, which helped secure significant German investment and aid
but also drew criticism from those who blame Yeltsin for many of
Russia's problems.
	   Schroeder insisted Monday that the relationship between Germany
and Russia must not rely too much on personal ties.
	   After meeting with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Monday,
Schroeder said Germany will not give Russia any emergency financial
aid outside the money it's providing through international lenders.
	   ``People in Russia fully realize the contribution Germany has
made,'' Schroeder said at a news conference Tuesday. ``I think
Russians duly assess it and realize that our opportunities are
limited.''
	   Schroeder said his talks with Russian officials focused on
cooperation in aerospace industry and improving conditions for
foreign investors in Russia. A delegation of German executives with
business interests in Russia joined Schroeder on the trip.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government desperately needs foreign
aid to pay off its huge debts, but the IMF and other international
lenders have stopped releasing loans, saying they want Moscow to
start implementing a sound economic plan first.
	   Schroeder called Russia's economic rescue plan, presented this
weekend, a ``good start'' toward convincing international lenders
to resume aid.
	   ``That program should be augmented so that it meets conditions
set by the IMF,'' he said Tuesday.
	   He stopped short of saying Germany would recommend that the IMF
release the money.
	   The IMF has criticized the latest government plan as too vague
and overloaded with state controls of the economy. Schroeder urged
the Russian Cabinet and the parliament to ``find answers to the IMF
questions.''
	   Germany is a key member of the IMF, the World Bank and the
European Union, all of which have provided aid to Russia.
	   Schroeder also met with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
speakers of both parliament houses and politicians, including
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov.
	   At a news conference Tuesday, Schroeder defended his meeting
with the Communist leader.
	   ``Mr. Zyuganov is the leader of the largest parliament
faction,'' he said. ``I may voice a different opinion on certain
subjects, but that doesn't impede us from having a dialogue.''
	   The Communist Party recently provoked an outburst when it failed
to publicly condemn anti-Semitic remarks of one of its members. ``I
pointed out to Mr. Zyuganov that anti-Semitism is unacceptable in a
democratic country, and he agreed with me,'' Schroeder said.

 &UR; First Swedish Roman Catholic bishop since Reformation appointed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ For the first time in 400 years,
Sweden's Roman Catholics will have a bishop who's a Swede.
	   The Vatican on Tuesday named the Rev. Anders Arborelius as
bishop of the Stockholm diocese, which covers all of Sweden.
Arborelius was born in Switzerland of Swedish parents and grew up
in the Swedish city of Lund.
	   He replaces Bishop Hubertus Brandenburg, a German, who on
Tuesday turned 75, the usual retirement age for bishops.
	   Arborelius will become the first Swede to head the church in
this country since the Protestant Reformation swept the country in
the 1500s. The Reformation changed Sweden from an almost entirely
Catholic country into one where Catholics were banned.
	   Until 1860, no native Swedes were allowed to be Catholics and
today the church claims only about 2 percent of the population _
about 165,000 people _ and most of its priests are foreign-born,
according to the Stockholm diocese.

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ An appeals court on Tuesday upheld a
conviction of far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen but reduced the
punishment, banning him from politics for one year instead of two
for assaulting a Socialist politician.
	   The court also upheld a three-month suspended sentence, and
ordered Le Pen to pay a reduced fine of 5,000 francs (about dlrs
900). He had originally been fined 20,000 francs (dlrs 3,333).
	   The ruling means Le Pen, 70, cannot hold office, run for office,
or vote for a year.
	   The conviction, unless successfully appealed, makes Le Pen
ineligible to run in the June 1999 European Parliament elections.
He has said that his wife, Jany, would run in his place _ a
position that put him on a collision course with his party's No. 2
man, Bruno Megret.
	   Le Pen wasn't present at Tuesday's court hearing.
	   Samuel Marechal, a party official and Le Pen's son-in-law,
called the ruling ``scandalous.''
	   ``The system has invented a jurisprudence specifically for
Jean-Marie Le Pen,'' he said.
	   ``But nothing will prevent Jean-Marie Le Pen from standing in
France's final battle, the presidential elections in 2002.''
	   The National Front has consistently won about 15 percent of the
vote in national elections. It blames immigrants, particularly from
North Africa, for high unemployment and urban violence. It has been
widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   Le Pen could lodge a final appeal with the Cour de Cassation,
France's highest court, but has not decided whether to do so, said
his lawyer, Jean-Francois Galvaire.
	   Le Pen was convicted in April of assaulting Annette
Peulvast-Bergeal, a Socialist opponent of his daughter in the race
for parliament, at a 1997 election rally in the town of
Mantes-La-Jolie, west of Paris.
	   Television footage showed Le Pen shoving Ms. Peulvast-Bergeal in
the chest during a scuffle with protesters. But Le Pen denies he
attacked her.
	   Peulvast-Bergeal said she was ``satisfied'' by Tuesday's ruling.
	   ``Le Pen remains condemned and this condemnation brings him to a
halt,'' she said.
	   In an interview published Tuesday in the daily Le Parisien, Le
Pen said his career would not be over if his conviction were
upheld.
	   ``Whatever happens, I am and will remain head of the National
Front,'' Le Pen was quoted as saying.
	   ``Is somebody seeking my political death?'' he asked. ``I have
no regrets, except for having fallen into an ambush.''
	   Le Pen holds a seat in the European Parliament and is a regional
counselor in the Provence-Alpes-Cotes d'Azur region of southern
France.
	   Last month, the European Parliament voted to lift his
parliamentary immunity so German prosecutors can investigate
whether he broke laws that make trivializing the Holocaust a crime.
	   The charges came from comments he has made several times, saying
the Nazi gas chambers were a ``detail'' of history.

Mediator urges meeting between Togo president and rival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ A growing rift between Togo's President
Gnassingbe Eyadema and his main rival could escalate into a
political crisis unless the two sides find common ground, says a
special envoy from France.
	   A report made public Tuesday by French member of parliament Kofi
Yamgnane urged Eyadema and opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio to
settle their election-related dispute and work together.
	   Olympio has filed a protest with Togo's Supreme Court,
contesting the results of June presidential elections which Eyadema
won.
	   Election monitors from the European Union said the vote was
flawed and even members of Togo's election commission have resigned
in protest.
	   Yamgnane, who is of Togolese descent, spent much of last week in
Togo's capital trying to bring Olympio and Eyadema together for a
meeting.
	   Eyadema earlier offered to form a coalition government with
Olympio, but the opposition leader rejected the proposal and said
he would continue to contest the June election results.
	   Olympio, who lives in neighboring Ghana, met on Monday with that
country's president, Jerry Rawlings, to discuss the political
impasse in Togo.
	   Rawlings urged the two sides to work together and called on
France to help find a solution to the problem.
	   Eyadema has ruled Togo since seizing power 31 years ago in a
bloody military coup, during which he ordered the execution of
former President Sylvanus Olympio, Gilchrist's father.

Fire breaks out at hotel in western Japan; no injuries

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Fire broke out Tuesday night at a nine-story hotel
in western Japan and spread to its five-story annex and parts of a
nearby forest, but all 51 guests were evacuated safely, police
said.
	   There were no reports of injuries among guests or workers at the
Hotel Tenzankaku, said Masanori Ueno, a spokesman of police in
Shirahama, a resort about 450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of
Tokyo.
	   The fire broke out at 6:38 p.m. (0938 GMT) and still was burning
four hours later, with 30 fire engines fighting the flames, Ueno
said. The cause of the fire was not immediately known, he added.
	   Kyodo News agency said the flames, fanned by strong winds, had
reached the roof of the hotel.
	   The 37-year-old Hotel Tenzankaku has 93 rooms, capable of
accommodating about 450 people.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Eight oil workers abducted last week by a
group of militant youths in southern Nigerian were released Tuesday
unharmed and in good spirits, a Texaco official said.
	   The oil workers _ three Americans, a Briton, an Italian, a
Croatian, a South African and a Nigerian _ were taken hostage last
week by armed youths from the ethnic Ijaw community who were
demanding a ransom for their release.
	   The hostages, working for various oil service companies on
contract with Texaco, were taken from an exploration drilling rig

	   ``They appeared to have been well treated and look fine,'' said
Yusuf N'jie, the assistant managing director of Texaco's joint

Former Khmer Rouge rebels doubt reports leader Khieu Samphan is

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Thai Foreign Ministry statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Former Khmer Rouge rebels expressed
doubt Tuesday about reports of the death of Khieu Samphan, a
longtime top leader of the guerrilla group, while neighboring
Thailand's Foreign Ministry called the reports untrue.
	   Thai military sources along the border and the Cambodian Defense
Ministry said they could not confirm a report from the Japanese
news agency Kyodo that the veteran guerrilla had died in the
jungles along the Thai-Cambodian border.
	   The Thai Foreign Ministry, in a statement issued Tuesday night,
said it had checked with other government agencies as well as news
agencies and found the account of the death to be ``untrue.'' It
also denied that Khieu Samphan had crossed into Thai territory.
	   Kyodo quoted ``a well-informed source'' in the Thai border town
of Aranyaprathet as saying an aide to Khmer Rouge military chief Ta
Mok had disclosed the death last week.
	   However, former rebel military commander Sok Pheap, speaking by
telephone from Poipet, opposite the border from Aranyaprathet, said
he had not heard that Khieu Samphan was dead.
	   ``He may be politically dead, but he is still physically
alive,'' Sok Pheap told The Associated Press.
	   Sok Pheap was a key figure in a massive 1996 defection of rebel
fighters led by former Khmer Rouge deputy prime minister Ieng Sary,
a move that crippled the Maoist movement.
	   Yim Phanna, a Khmer Rouge commander whose defection earlier this
year led to the government's capture of the rebels' stronghold in
Anlong Veng, also said Tuesday that he did not believe Khieu
Samphan was dead.
	   ``I don't think that it is true yet,'' said Yim Phanna, adding
that his troops in Anlong Veng have been instructed to gather
information on the whereabouts of the dwindling band of Khmer Rouge
guerrillas still loyal to Ta Mok.
	   Khieu Samphan, 67, has been the nominal head of the Khmer Rouge
for much of the past two decades.
	   The group's supreme leader, Pol Pot, died of an apparent heart
attack in April as the guerrillas were being driven out of their
last major stronghold. Some reports have suggested that Khieu
Samphan is being held against his will by Ta Mok, commander of the
remaining Khmer Rouge forces.
	   A team of U.N. legal experts is now in Cambodia to assess
evidence that could be used to prosecute leaders of the Khmer
Rouge, which has been blamed for the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians when it ruled the country between 1975 and 1979.

Eight dead, 10 injured in massacre south of Algiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Armed men massacred eight people and injured 10
others in an overnight attack south of Algiers, authorities said.
The attackers slit the throats of most of the victims and burned
their houses, according to hospital workers.
	   The attack took place about 150 kilometers (93 miles) south of
Algiers near Ain Defla, authorities said in a brief statement on
state radio.
	   There was no claim of responsibility and no further details were
provided on the attack, which occurred in an area where Islamic
insurgents are thought to be hiding out.
	   Such attacks are blamed by authorities on the Armed Islamic
Group, the radical insurgency movement trying to topple this North
African nation's military-backed government.
	   The attack occurred less than five weeks before the start of the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan _ usually marked by a surge in
violence since the start of the insurgency in 1992.
	   The insurgency was triggered by the military-backed government's
decision to cancel legislative elections that the now-banned
Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.
	   An estimated 75,000 people _ civilians, soldiers and insurgents
_ have been killed in the violence.

Onassis heiress on family island for memorial to mother
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The 13-year-old heiress to the Onassis
fortune arrived on the family's private island Tuesday to attend a
graveside memorial on the 10th anniversary of her mother's death.
	   Athina Roussel, the granddaughter of the late shipping tycoon
Aristotle Onassis, was accompanied by her father Thierry Roussel to
the Ionian island of Skorpios, about 260 kilometers (160 miles)
northwest of Athens.
	   The family holds a memorial for Christina Onassis each year in
Switzerland, where Athina lives with Roussel, his Swedish wife and
the couple's three children.
	   Athina has visited her mother's grave, but this will be the
first time she will attend a memorial ceremony there. Following the
Wednesday ceremony, Athina will return to her school in Geneva,
said Roussel's spokesman, Alexis Mantheakis.
	   French-born Roussel is locked in a battle for management of the
dlrs 600 million fortune that Athina stands to inherit on her 18th
birthday.
	   The Greek trustees administering the inheritance sued Roussel
for slander, perjury and other charges after he lost a court case
in which he accused them of fiscal mismanagement. The trial is
being held in Athens.

Federation doctor suspects athletes using sophisticated drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT category coding. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's top athletics doctor
suspects some German athletes of taking undetectable
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Dr. Karlheinz Graff, chief doctor for the national athletics
team, has told the German Athletics Federation (DLV) that two
athletes have asked him for plasma, which can be used to fight
blood thickening that can be a result of EPO use.
	   EPO is a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of
oxygen-carrying red blood cells and cannot be detected by existing
doping tests. The substance gained notoriety during the scandal
that marred this year Tour de France cycling race.
	   According to DLV, Graff has ``strong suspicion that at least one
DLV athlete has been using blood doping or doping through EPO for a
long time.''
	   Graff declined to name any athletes.
	   The DLV welcomed Graff's disclosure on Tuesday and asked him for
a written statement so that its anti-doping panel can prepare any
possible action.
	   ``The DLV hopes to make further progress in fighting the abuse
of EPO by taking joint action with physicians and lawyers,'' DLV
president Helmut Digel said.

Ukraine's capital facing energy shortages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Much of Ukraine's capital Kiev may be
without electricity in the coming days because the city's
cash-strapped energy provider cannot afford to meet the growing
demand, news reports said Tuesday.
	   The Kievenergo company, which distributes electricity and heat
for this city of 3 million, has no other choice but to start to
``massively'' cut off consumers in order to compensate for power
shortages, Kievenergo said in a statement cited by the independent
Ukrainian News Service.
	   Kievenergo appealed to companies and enterprises to begin
working during night hours when demand for energy is lower, and
warned Kiev city authorities to take preventive measures to avoid
possible damage from sudden electricity cutoffs.
	   Temperatures throughout most of Ukraine have sunk below 0 C (32
F) and heavy snowfalls have hit Kiev in recent days, causing a
sharp increase in gas and electricity consumption.
	   But Kiev's energy plants, owed tremendous sums by consumers, are
unable to purchase enough fuel to increase production and are
already buying fuel with money allocated for wage payments,
Kievenergo chief Ivan Plachkov said.
	   The situation with energy supplies to Kiev will become
``unpredictable'' if the temperature continues to drop, the daily
Fakty quoted Plachkov as saying.
	   The former Soviet republic's energy sector is plagued by
mounting cash problems. Most Ukrainian companies have become
loss-making as a result of the country's continuing economic
decline and have practically stopped paying for electricity and
heat.
	   Consumers' total energy debt rose to 4.3 billion hryvna (dlrs
1.25 billion) by November, increasing by nearly 500 million hryvna
(dlrs 145 million) in October alone, Ukrainian News said.

European Parliament pays tribute to protectors of Jews in WWII
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A Portuguese diplomat and a Bulgarian
politician who defied their governments to save thousands of Jews
from the Nazis during World War II received a posthumous tribute
Tuesday from the European Parliament.
	   ``There were some brave men and women, the just, who risked
their lives, their careers and confronted barbarism any way they
could ... Today we pay homage to two of these heroes,'' said
European Parliament President Jose-Maria Gil-Robles, opening the
ceremony in Strasbourg, France.
	   Aristides de Sousa Mendes was Portuguese consul general in
Bordeaux, France, when the Germans invaded in 1940. He ignored
government orders and issued visas to an estimated 10,000 Jews and
20,000 other refugees fleeing the Nazi advance.
	   As a result, he was called back to Lisbon, where he was vilified
by dictator Antonio Salazar. Dismissed from the diplomatic service,
denied a pension and barred from practicing law, Sousa Mendes died
in poverty in 1954.
	   Dimitar Peshev played a key role in saving the 48,000 Jews
living in Bulgaria in 1943. As deputy chairman of Bulgarian
parliament, he vehemently opposed plans of the pro-fascist
government to deport the entire Jewish community to the Auschwitz
death camp.
	   After the communists took over in 1944, Peshev was sentenced to
15 years in prison for collaborating with the Nazis. He was
released after one year and died in 1973.
	   The tribute to Sousa Mendes and Peshev was attended by
Portugal's foreign minister Jaime Gama, speaker of the Bulgarian
parliament Yordan Sokolov, and Israel's ambassador to the European
Union, Harry Kney-Tal.

Jordanian women stage pro-Iraq rally

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ About 70 Jordanian political activists
staged a sit-in outside the Iraqi Embassy Tuesday to protest U.S.
threats of strikes against neighboring Iraq.
	   The silent protest organized by the Jordan Women Association
urged Arab states to defy the crippling U.N. sanctions against
Iraq.
	   The protesters carried pictures of malnourished Iraqi children,
who have been suffering under the sanctions which were imposed
following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``No for striking at Iraq,'' the women said in a statement.
	   ``Striking at Iraq will not erase Clinton's scandals,'' it
added, referring to the U.S. president's recent sex scandal with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``Arab dignity is at stake'' if the United States and Britain
attack Iraq, the statement said.
	   The threat of an attack was averted after Iraq on Saturday
rescinded its Oct. 31 decision to suspend cooperation with U.N.
inspection teams.
	   But Clinton warned that a military strike was still an option if
Iraq failed to cooperate with the inspectors. Some 86 inspectors
returned to Baghdad Tuesday to resume their work.

German authorities warn of food blackmailer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German authorities warned Tuesday that
a food blackmailer may be targeting Nestle, just as police said
they had arrested a man who tried to extort 25 million marks (dlrs
15 million) in diamonds from the company.
	   Police said they nabbed Alexandru Nemeth, 43, by tracking
carrier pigeons with which he had ordered the company to deliver
the diamonds in September.
	   Frankfurt police chief Wolfhard Hoffmann said Nemeth was
suspected of trying to blackmail Thomy, a Nestle brand, by
poisoning supermarket products with cyanide in at least 20 German
cities over the last two years. No one was hurt in the incidents.
	   Police said Nemeth denied involvement, and they were seeking
accomplices.
	   In Baden-Wuerttemberg state, authorities warned people certain
Nestle products sold by a supermarket chain Saturday may have been
tampered with, and asked them to check for damaged packaging, or
strange odor or color.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the two cases were
connected.
	   Nestle said it was ``relieved, happy and thankful'' about the
arrest, but didn't comment on the possibility of a second blackmail
attempt.
	   Nemeth, a Romanian of German descent, allegedly began his
poisoning spree in August 1996. Police traced many of the tainted
foods, informed by the attacker who apparently wanted to prove he
was serious.
	   Last December, he allegedly delivered poisoned Christmas
chocolates to randomly chosen homes. He later left a
cyanide-poisoned drink in a Cologne playground.
	   Police say Nemeth finally directed Thomy in September to a car
with 12 carrier pigeons and small sacks for the diamonds he had
demanded.
	   Using helicopters, police tracked the pigeons to a garden plot
outside Frankfurt rented by Nemeth. He was arrested the next day,
Sept. 26, in the town of Eschborn. The diamonds never were
delivered, police said.
	   Police gave no explanation for the delay in their announcement.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A truck carrying sand and at least 100
hitchhiking schoolchildren overturned at the side of a highway
Tuesday in eastern India, killing at least eight and injuring 28
others.
	   At least five of the injured were in serious condition in
Balasore, near India's eastern coast in Orissa state, police
official Devin Mohanty said by telephone. The town is 1,250
kilometers (775 miles) to the southeast of New Delhi.
	   One hundred children were crouching or squatting on the truckbed
of sand to hitch a ride from their remote village schools to a
science exhibition at a regional government school.
	   Fourteen students were buried in the sand when the truck
swerved, lost control and toppled over near Kuchiakoili town,
Mohanty said. The driver fled the spot.
	   Few other details were immediately available.

British promises to search art collections for Nazi loot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCH STACY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The British government agreed Tuesday to join the
nation's museums in a comprehensive search of their art collections
for works that may have been looted by the Nazis during World War
II.
	   At the urging of The Holocaust Educational Trust, the government
and museums have agreed to audit their collections as part of an
international campaign to identify art stolen by the Nazis and
return it to the rightful owners or heirs.
	   Britain is a focal point because many works plundered from
conquered countries are believed to have made their way to London
after the war, sold by dealers unconcerned or less than truthful
about their origins, according to a new report by the Holocaust
group.
	   ``The hunt for Nazi loot has already turned into the greatest
treasure hunt in history,'' Lord Janner, the group's chairman, said
Tuesday.
	   The art restitution issue will be the focus of a 42-nation
conference starting Nov. 30 at the U.S. State Department in
Washington.
	   The Holocaust group's report cites inconsistencies in the
handling of art and other holdings seized by the Allies for
restitution after the Nazi defeat. Efforts to return the property
to its rightful owners were ended in 1949, with most works still
unaccounted for.
	   ``The restitution was partial and perfunctory, and missed a
great deal of paintings,'' said Stephen Ward, co-author of the
report.
	   If art in Britain is identified as Nazi loot and traced to an
owner, ``we hope then an amicable settlement can be reached,'' said
Toby Sargent, a spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport, which oversees galleries and the government's own collection
of 11,500 works.
	   Last week, the World Jewish Congress challenged the French
government to step up efforts to track the ownership of 678
artworks in the Louvre believed to have been looted by Hitler's
friends and agents.
	   The French government has acknowledged that 2,058 looted
paintings, sculptures and drawings _ valued at hundreds of millions
of dollars _ are in French museums and collections, including the
Louvre.
	   ``We've been in touch with the French government, but so far
nothing has happened,'' Elan Steinberg, the World Jewish Congress'
executive director, said last week. ``We're challenging France and
other European countries holding art plundered by the Nazis to get
the works to their original owners.''

Peace activists demand that army dismantle settler outposts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli peace activists demanded Tuesday that
the army dismantle seven Jewish settlement outposts on remote West
Bank hills and said they would appeal to the Supreme Court if the
order was not given by the end of the week.
	   The outposts, consisting of several trailers each, have been set
up since last month's Mideast peace summit during which Israel
agreed to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of
January.
	   Jewish settler leaders said they have been setting up the
outposts because they do not want the land to fall into Palestinian
hands in the future.
	   They were encouraged earlier this week by Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon who said settlers ``should move, should run,
should grab more hills, expand the territory.''
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Monday that
Sharon's statement served to ``undermine the trust and confidence''
needed to make peace.
	   Sharon's ministry, in turn, said in a statement Tuesday that it
was ``taken aback'' by Rubin's comments, saying Sharon's point had
been the need to strengthening existing settlements.
	   However, the Israeli daily Haaretz said Sharon's call to seize
hilltops appeared to be contradicting a quiet pledge by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the United States more than a year
ago that settlements would only be expanded to ``immediately
contiguous'' areas. This would exclude the settling of areas
several hills removed from the nearest built-up land, Haaretz said.
	   Haaretz said the understanding was confirmed by five different
Israeli and U.S. officials. The newspaper said the Americans
accepted the limited pledge because Netanyahu made it clear that
his coalition would not accept a settlement freeze.
	   In a speech to parliament Monday, Netanyahu denied that he had
accepted any restrictions on Jewish settlement building.
	   Concerning the latest settlement outposts, the Israeli group
Peace Now and opposition legislator Dedi Zucker said Tuesday they
have asked Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai in writing to
dismantle them. If this is not done by the end of the week, Zucker
said, the activists would ask the Supreme Court to step in.
	   Zucker said the settlers are breaking the law and that the
Israeli army, which is in charge of enforcing the law in West Bank
areas under its control, is required to take action.
	   In recent weeks, Israeli soldiers have made no efforts to
dismantle the seven outposts, Zucker said.
	   However, troops did thwart the latest attempt Monday in which
settlers from the Kedumim settlement seized a hill and set up two
mobile homes. Troops ordered the settlers to leave.
	   The Defense Ministry said it had not received the Peace Now
letter and had no comment.

	   DOI INTHANON, Thailand (AP) _ Stargazers in Asia sought high
ground and clear skies Tuesday to view the most spectacular
celestial fireworks in 33 years, after enjoying a low-key preview
Monday night.
	   The Leonids meteor shower was expected to blaze forth in its
entire glory over Asia and the Pacific after midnight and into
early Wednesday, regaling millions with a heavenly display of
falling stars too numerous to wish upon.
	   Sky-watchers will get a final chance at the big show Wednesday
night, after which sporadic showers may be visible for several
days.
	   The front-row seats were expected to be wherever the sky was
darkest and clearest _ from the Mongolian steppes to the mountains
of northern Thailand to U.S. research planes breaking through cloud
cover over Okinawa, Japan.
	   For millions of others _ those befogged by weather or living in
North America, when the spectacle was to reach its peak at midday,
the worst time for viewing _ the Internet was the place to be.
	   In northern Thailand, hotels, camp grounds and airlines were
booked solid with people expected to head to Doi Inthanon, the
Southeast Asian country's highest peak at 2,565 meters (8,464
feet).
	   For those who went up Monday night, the streaking star-fall came
into view at about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday (1830 GMT Monday) to a chorus
of ``oohs'' and ``aahs,'' and 33-year-old Thamarong Kudpong made
his wish: ``I already have a daughter. Now, I would like a son.''
	   Many in Japan were wishing Tuesday for the weather to clear. The
government called on public offices and private businesses in the
cities to turn off their lights to enhance viewing possibilities.
	   In Thailand, police anticipated a rush out of Bangkok, the
smog-ceilinged capital, by people looking for a clearer view.
Alternative traffic routes were posted to avoid worsening evening
rush hour.
	   Officials in the capital ordered all public parks closed Tuesday
night for fear that hordes of stargazers would not be safe in the
dark, said a local television station.
	   At least one member of the Thai royal family, Princess
Sirindhorn, was traveling to a rural eastern province to observe
the show, ITV also reported.
	   The celestial fireworks are actually the long tail of the Comet
Tempel-Tuttle. The shower is nicknamed Leonids because ancient
observers thought the meteors came from the constellation Leo.
	   It occurs every November, usually with little fanfare. But every
33 years, the comet speeds through the inner solar system and sheds
swarms of particles as it nears the sun. In 1966, the Leonids
display peaked at 150,000 meteors per hour.
	   Earth plows straight through the comet's wake as it traces its
own orbit. The shower of ``falling stars'' is actually the glowing
contrails of comet dust, or meteoroids.
	   Many of the world's 600-plus satellites have been maneuvered to
reduce the possibility of damage from the speeding grit, which can
poke holes in solar panels, pit lenses, blast away mirror coatings
or cause damaging electromagnetic pulses.
	   Russian space authorities said the crew of the Mir space
stations was prepared for a too-close encounter and would enter the
Soyuz escape capsule when the shower is at its peak.
	   ``It is better to be on the safe side,'' Deputy Mission Control
chief Viktor Blagov was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   In Romania, the Bucharest daily Evenimentul Zilei said in a
front-page headline: ``Romanians, Stay Inside! Leonide, the
Toughest Meteor Rain.''

	   LLANES, Spain (AP) _ Seven teenagers and a truck driver were
killed when a school bus collided head-on with the truck in
northern Spain early Tuesday.
	   The bus was carrying some 40 boys and girls, aged between 12 and
17, to school in this small coastal town when the accident occurred
at 7.45 a.m. (0645 gmt), police in the regional capital of Oviedo
said.
	   Another 32 people traveling on the school bus were injured in
the accident. The dead included four girls and three boys.
	   Police said the accident happened when the truck crossed to the
other side of the two-lane road. They said there was fog in the
area at the time.

Premier: asylum-seeking Kurdish leader must renounce terrorism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Germany will not seek extradition, Kurds march
through Rome, arrests in Turkey &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Massimo D'Alema told parliament on Tuesday
that Italy will not grant political asylum to a jailed Kurdish
rebel leader unless it is convinced he has really renounced
terrorism.
	   ``I consider this a minimum for our country to be able to
process an asylum request,'' D'Alema told the lower house in a
briefing on the case of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of Kurdish
rebels fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey.
	   ``Our country doesn't intend to be a host for terrorist
activities,'' he said
	   Ocalan was arrested in Rome last week and has asked for
political asylum. But Turkey, one of Italy's NATO allies and a
strong trading partner, is pushing hard for his extradition.
	   Extradition appears unlikely because Ocalan is on trial in
absentia for capital crimes in Turkey but Italy's courts have
forbidden extraditing anyone to a country where they could be
executed.
	   ``This is not an act of hostility toward Turkey, but one of
respect for our own laws, history and values,'' said D'Alema, a day
after a gloves-off warning to Turkey that Italy wouldn't give in to
``threats, pressure,'' or ``blackmail.''
	   D'Alema told lawmakers that Ocalan has ``rejected all terrorist
actions'' in a statement issued Monday. ``Now it's a matter of
seeing whether he sticks to it,'' the premier said.
	   In his statement, Ocalan also said he wanted to work for a
peaceful solution to the bitter, 14-year Kurdish conflict. The war
between his Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK and the Turkish army has
claimed about 37,000 lives.
	   D'Alema told lawmakers that there was no prior deal with Ocalan,
but said Turkey had warned authorities here that he might be headed
for Italy.
	   Ocalan lived for years in Syria, but Damascus kicked him out
recently after Turkey threatened it with military attacks. Ocalan
then sought asylum in Russia, but was rebuffed.
	   The U.S. State Department Monday called the arrest an important
step in the fight against global terrorism and said Ocalan should
be extradited.
	   In Europe, however, the Kurdish cause enjoys considerable
sympathy. The so-called Kurdish parliament-in-exile met recently in
Rome, which may have encouraged Ocalan to seek asylum in Italy,
D'Alema said.
	   Kurds from throughout Europe have come to Rome in solidarity
with Ocalan and demonstrators have been camped outside the military
hospital in Rome where he is believed held since last week.
	   Thousands of Kurds waving red and gold Kurdish flags marched
through the streets of central Rome Tuesday, chanting ``We Want
Ocalan!'' in English.
	   In Ankara, hundreds of Turks demonstrated outside the Italian
Embassy, protesting Italy's reluctance to extradite Ocalan.
	   ``If he's not handed over, we'll walk to Italy, we'll annex
Italy, we'll turn Italy upside down!'' one demonstrator screamed
into a loudspeaker. Another burned an Italian flag.
	   Pro-Ocalan demonstrators in southern Turkey, however, were
arrested by Turkish police. The Anatolia news agency said about 100
people were detained in the city of Mersin.
	   Ocalan is Turkey's most wanted fugitive and Ankara is so eager
to get him back that it has moved to abolish capital punishment.
	   Turkey is not the only country where Ocalan is a wanted man.
Germany has an outstanding warrant for him issued in 1990 on
terrorism-related charges. But Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
said Tuesday in Rome that Germany would not ask for his
extradition. Ocalan now is ``a matter for Italy,'' he said.

Mandela urges regional effort on Congo on last official visit to
</HEADLINE>
Tanzania &QL; 
 &UR; By RODRIQUE NGOWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ On his last official visit to a
country that provided precious moral and concrete support to the
fight to end apartheid in South Africa, President Nelson Mandela
Tuesday made an impassioned plea for increased regional efforts to
end the conflict in neighboring Congo.
	   ``Unless we, as African leaders, find the way to a peaceful
resolution of these and other conflicts, the rebirth of our
continent, made possible by liberation, will be endangered. Peace,
stability and democracy are essential conditions for development,''
Mandela told members of the governing Chama Cha Mapinduzi party.
	   Later, the 80-year-old Mandela later told a crowd at Dar es
Salaam's National Stadium that escalation of the Congo conflict
threatened to destabilize the continent even further as more
countries become militarily involved.
	   ``In a situation of such complexity, impacting on all the
countries of our region and beyond, the further shedding of the
blood of innocents serves neither the people of the Democratic
Republic of Congo nor those who are intervening in the situation,''
he said.
	   Congolese rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda launched a
rebellion in eastern Congo on Aug. 2 against Congolese President
Laurent Kabila, claiming his one-year regime was corrupt, plagued
with nepotism and was actively seeking to eradicate minority ethnic
groups like the Tutsi from the entire country.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia _ and later Chad _ intervened to
bolster the fractured Congolese army and prop up Kabila.
	   Tanzania, which is hosting peace talks among the warring parties
in Burundi, has remained outside the Congolese conflict.
	   But President Benjamin Mkapa has been involved in fact-finding
missions to sound out the various participants, including the
rebels.
	   The Congolese accuse Pretoria of aiding and abetting the rebels
by receiving them in South Africa. Kabila has refused to accede to
a rebel demand for direct talks to end the conflict.
	   ``This is the place where the plot has started. South Africa is
really the home of the so-called rebels,'' Congolese Foreign
Minister Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe told reporters in Pretoria
Monday after meeting with his counterpart Alfred Nzo.
	   Nzo replied that South Africa believes the rebels ``are a factor
in the political dynamics of the DRC, and unless this fact is
accepted, there will be no progress in resolving the current
crisis.''
	   The London-based Economist weekly noted in its Nov. 14-20
edition that although South Africa is the major sub-Saharan power,
it is having problems pursuing a coherent foreign policy in Africa,
partly because of the difficulty in balancing concern for human
rights with the country's direct political and economic interests.
	   Mandela repeated his call for an immediate cease-fire, a
standstill of military forces and the withdrawal of all foreign
forces from the Congo.
	   ``It requires a dialogue of all parties to the conflict on the
security concerns of all affected sates,'' he said. ``And it means
an all inclusive political process within the DRC to achieve the
conditions for lasting peace.''

	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ The U.S. activist who invented the
rallying cry ``Black Power'' and later moved to Africa to promote
his dream of pan-African unity will be buried this weekend in his
adopted homeland of Guinea, a close friend and colleague said
Tuesday.
	   Kwame Ture, born Stokely Carmichael, died Sunday of prostate
cancer at the age of 57.
	   His funeral is scheduled for Sunday in the Guinean capital of
Conakry, said Ture's longtime friend Bob Brown.
	   ``He just loved West Africa to the fullest, with all his
heart,'' said Ture's teen-age son, Bocar, greeting mourners at his
father's small home on a hill overlooking the ocean. ``To him it
was home.''
	   Tuesday morning, more than a dozen people had gathered at Ture's
to remember him. His mother was there, and his second ex-wife
Marlyatou, and Brown, who was getting arrested with Ture in the
1960s and stayed with him ever since.
	   ``He wanted to show people worldwide that Africans can come home
and stay,'' said Brown, who like many of Ture's relatives says the
FBI and the CIA conspired to give him cancer.
	   ``He never ceased fighting U.S. imperialism.''
	   Ture's friends and colleagues _ from Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan to Libya's Moammar Gadhafi to Ture's first ex-wife,
famed South African singer Miriam Makeba to members of his
All-African People's Revolutionary Party _ have been invited, Brown
said.
	   He said it was not yet clear who would be attending.
	   In the wake of a turbulent career in the United States as a
militant social activist Ture left American and moved to Guinea in
1969, where he continued to pursue his dream of Pan-African unity
and empowerment.
	   The Rev. Jesse Jackson visited with Ture three times during a
trip to Guinea last week. Jackson remembered Ture as a man
determined to transform the United States and Africa to end racial
inequities.
	   From Guinea, Ture vowed to wage an ``unrelenting armed struggle
against the white Western empire for the liberation of our
people.''
	   Born in Trinidad, Ture spent much of his time after moving to
Africa speaking to audiences to preach black power and champion
socialism while condemning America, capitalism and Zionism.
	   His fiery rhetoric, though, stood in stark contrast to his
gentle nature. A book sitting on Ture's kitchen table Tuesday was
slowly being filled by the visitors who stopped by to pay their
respect. Many came from neighborhood children, who Ture used to
take to the beach, thanking him for his kindness.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Singing and shouting anti-American
slogans, thousands of Greek Cypriot youths staged a protest Tuesday
outside the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia to mark the 25th anniversary of
a bloody student uprising in Greece.
	   Witnesses said about 4,000 high school students gathered in
Nicosia's main square and later marched to the nearby embassy
carrying Greek and Cypriot flags and chanting ``Americans -
murderers.''
	   The protesters dispersed peacefully after attending an open air
concert outside the embassy, which was guarded by scores of
policemen.
	   The demonstration is an annual event in Cyprus to mark the
anniversary of the death and injury of scores of Greeks during the
1973 student uprising in Athens against the U.S.-backed military
Junta then ruling Greece.
	   U.S. officials have since apologized publicly for their
government's support of the junta, which ruled Greece from 1967 to
1974.

Ukraine's authorities undecided over shutdown of Chernobyl reactor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine could continue operating the only
functioning reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear plant through the
winter despite orders to stop it for repairs, a senior official was
quoted as saying Tuesday.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko said increased
demand for energy during winter months may force the government to
postpone the reactor's shutdown until it becomes warmer.
	   ``If the weather continues to stay cold, we will have to wait
until the spring,'' Holubchenko said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   Holubchenko spoke during a meeting with Joachim Jahnke, vice
president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD), who was in Kiev to discuss Chernobyl with Ukrainian
officials.
	   The EBRD has agreed to grant dlrs 118 million for upgrading
Chernobyl's reactor No. 3, the only one of Chernobyl's four
reactors working. Ukraine has pledged to fully close the plant by
year 2000.
	   There have been frequent malfunctions at the reactor recently
even after it underwent lengthy repairs from July 1997 until this
May.
	   Ukraine's Nuclear Regulation Administration ordered Chernobyl
officials last month to stop the reactor as of Dec. 1 after an
inspection showed that some of its safety equipment was reaching
the end of its operational life.
	   The decision was made despite pleas from state energy officials
to let the reactor work until the spring because of growing worries
over the ability of Ukraine's troubled energy industry to produce
enough electricity during the fall and winter months.
	   Environment Minister Vasyl Shevchuk recently said the decision
to stop the reactor on Dec. 1 was ``final.''
	   However, Holubchenko said that cold weather may lead the
government to change its mind.
	   ``We haven't heard such an early winter for a long time,'' he
said. Temperatures in most of Ukraine dropped below 0 degrees C (32
F) in recent days.
	   Ukrainian leaders are increasingly complaining that the West,
including the EBRD, is disbursing the promised aid for the plant's
closure too slowly to complete the required shutdown procedures on
time.
	   One Chernobyl reactor was destroyed in the 1986 explosion and
fire, the world's worst nuclear accident, while another of the
plant's reactors was stopped after a 1991 fire. A third was shut
down two years ago.

Havel not happy with political climate, but not losing hope
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Marking the ninth anniversary of
the demise of the Communist regime, President Vaclav Havel said
Tuesday he was not particularly happy about the political climate
in the country.
	   ``There are many things which I keep criticizing and which don't
make me particularly happy, mainly ... the political and social
climate,'' the news agency CTK quoted Havel as saying after he laid
flowers on downtown Narodni Street where students' protest started
the so-called Velvet Revolution nine years ago.
	   For the last several years, Havel has been criticizing the
country's leaders for not giving enough support to the creation of
a civil society in the Czech Republic and complained about a lack
of morals in society.
	   ``But I'm not loosing hope,'' Havel said, adding he relies on
the young generation which ``is not deformed by years of
communism.''
	   Havel's presidential powers are mostly ceremonial, but he still
is considered by many a moral compass in the transition to
capitalism. However, he has somewhat lost his once phenomenal
prestige among the Czechs.

Europeans to rewrite NATO partnership with US, details vague
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Trying to shed their image as freeloaders under
America's security blanket, NATO's European allies said Tuesday
they will rewrite their relationship with Washington to become more
credible alliance partners.
	   They said they wanted to complete their debate by April 24-25,
the dates of a NATO summit in Washington at which Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic will join the alliance.
	   They also pledged to cooperate more in military procurement to
end costly duplication in arms-making and narrow the large gap in
research and development spending with the United States.
	   But after two days of talks, European Union foreign and defense
ministers were vague on how they plan to craft a greater profile in
pan-European security or crisis management.
	   The impetus to work toward that end came after Britain ended
years of opposition and agreed to help turn the Western European
Union, the EU's embryonic defense group, into a more effective
organization.
	   ``This is the starting point of a far-reaching study into
European security and defense,'' Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said after the meeting.
	   He spoke of ``a new awareness of the shortcomings'' of West
Europeans in projecting influence and stability eastward, which has
left Washington dominating Balkan peace efforts.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the Europeans can
either fold the WEU into the EU, strengthen it as a defense group
parallel to NATO, or let the EU take political decisions on
security matters and put NATO in charge of the military
implementation.
	   He cited no preference for any of the options.
	   The Netherlands favored killing off the WEU. Belgium and France
opposed that, arguing that would leave the East European nations
which are associate members of the WEU in the cold.
	   Also NATO members Norway and Turkey are not in the EU and _
complicating matters further _ EU members Ireland, Austria, Finland
and Denmark are not in the WEU.
	   Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said unless the WEU
becomes a credible arm of NATO, France will never fully participate
in the alliance.
	   Dini said that ``what emerged at the meeting was a feeling of
dissatisfaction with the unwieldiness'' of the security groups that
crowd Europe's political landscape.
	   The WEU was created in the early 1950s but was always
overshadowed by NATO. Post-Cold War efforts to give it some teeth
have remained fruitless as overlapping organizations got involved
in European security: NATO, the EU, the WEU, the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, the United Nations and the
``Contact Group'' countries.
	   In a move related to boosting West European standing in defense
and security, the EU countries agreed to create an arms agency to
end duplication in weapons manufacture.
	   European defense spending equals two-thirds of that of the
United States, but is not reflected in the NATO defense tasks
Europe shoulders. European spending on military
research-and-development is only 16 percent of the U.S. level.
	   There are at least four tank-building programs in Europe,
compared to one in the United States, officials said. For infantry
combat vehicles, Europeans have 16 different programs, against
three in the United States. And while less than half a dozen U.S.
companies make helicopters and military planes, in Europe there are
10.

Defense Minister hopes for South African contract decision by
</HEADLINE>
month's end &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Defense Minister Joe Modise
said Tuesday that he hoped for a decision on large international
defense contracts by month's end, seeking to quash speculation that
the deals could be off.
	   ``I am sparing no effort to achieve this target,'' Modise said
at the opening of an international defense exhibition in Pretoria.
	   The defense purchases would be South Africa's largest since the
fall of the heavily militarized apartheid state in 1994.
	   His remarks followed recent reports in three major Johannesburg
newspapers _ including Business Day on Tuesday _ about a power
struggle within President Nelson Mandela's Cabinet over whether the
country could afford to buy heavy equipment and arms from abroad.
	   Quoting unnamed sources, Business Day reported that Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel opposes the borrowing of an additional 7.5
billion rand (dlrs 1.3 billion) to finance the purchase of new
warships, helicopters, tanks, submarines and light fighter
aircraft.
	   Parliament has already earmarked 22 billion rand (dlrs 4
billion) for the project, Business Day said. Past reports said 10
billion rand (dlrs 1.8 billion) had been earmarked.
	   Manuel could not be reached for comment.
	   The contracts have attracted intense bidding from international
manufacturers despite strings attached by the government. The
government is requiring that countries wishing to sell weapons must
invest the same amount paid by South Africa into high technology
South African industry.
	   Business Day reported that defense officials are asking the
cabinet to approve the purchase of four corvettes and three
submarines from the German Frigate Consortium; 28 Gripen jet
fighters from Saab/British Aerospace (BAe) of Sweden and England;
and 24 Hawk-100 jet trainers from BAe.
	   ``We are committed to defending our hard-won freedom in an
unpredictable world,'' Modise said.

EU fraud squad attacks irregularities, errors in EU accounting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The European Union's fraud watchdog on
Tuesday revealed continued lapses in budgetary controls from EU
authorities that allowed runaway spending in some sectors during
1997 and left the field open for swindlers.
	   In its annual report, the EU's Court of Auditors said some 5
percent of the Union's 83 billion European currency unit (dlrs 97
billion) budget was liable to errors and irregularities.
	   ``Enormous amounts of money are lost,'' said Court's President
Bernhard Friedmann.
	   A statement from the court said the level of errors affecting
payments by the EU's executive body, the European Commission, ``is
too high for the Court to provide assurance about their legality
and regularity.''
	   Following a spate of fraud allegations against the EU
Commission, its President Jacques Santer last month promised to
create an independent anti-fraud unit.
	   The Court's report pinpointed the EU agriculture and regional
development budgets as the main culprits.
	   In farming, the watchdog was baffled by the 1.74 billion ecu
(dlrs 2 billion) subsidy program for durum wheat, which is used to
make pasta and semolina. The court said that more than compensates
producers, who are mostly from Italy, Greece, Spain and France.
	   ``There is now not a single objective factor to justify such
favorable treatment,'' said the report.
	   Measures to combat ``mad cow'' disease were also criticized. A
total of 2.1 billion ecus (dlrs 2.46 billion) was spent to cut EU
beef production to prevent the spread of the disease, with about a
quarter going to Britain, where the disease caused a major health
scare.
	   ``There was a lack of rigor and consistency in the
implementation of measures,'' the court said.
	   In fishing too, the lack of monitoring and controls has made
sure that a measure aimed at cutting the capacity and size of the
EU fleet ``has had practically no effect on fishing activity in EU
waters.''
	   On the EU's regional development budget, amounting to 31.8
billion ecus (dlrs 37.2 billion), the court said, ``financial
planning is often unrealistic ... monitoring and controls were
insufficient.''
	   Aid programs for poor non-EU nations tend to be slow and overly
centralized. On various occasions, aid projects in eastern and
central Europe ``turned out to be unrealistic when they came to be
put into effect.'' It said that some programs ``that had clearly
lost any sense of direction were being carried on by force of
inertia.''

Amnesty International accuses Jordan of continued violations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 0001 GMT Wednesday. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Human rights violations continue in Jordan
despite political reforms introduced nine years ago, a report by
Amnesty International says.
	   It said the kingdom lacks ``safeguards to prevent such
violations,'' which include torture of detainees and restrictions
on freedom of expression.
	   It appears that several detainees have died in jail over the
last two years after beatings by security forces and that
``sometimes there has been no proper investigation'' of the alleged
torture, Amnesty said in the report faxed Tuesday to The Associated
Press office in Amman, Jordan.
	   It said detainees were denied access to family or lawyers.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Jordanian government,
which boasts of a ``transparent'' policy and democracy in a largely
totalitarian Arab world.
	   Officials have repeatedly said that Jordan has no political
prisoners since the reforms nine years ago which oversaw the
revival of a multiparty system.
	   Officials also have dismissed reports of torture and coerced
confessions from detainees by the country's largely feared General
Intelligence Department.
	   ``There seems to be almost total impunity for members of the
security services involved in torturing or ill-treating
detainees,'' the Amnesty report said.
	   It alleged arbitrary detention of political activists who may
have slandered King Hussein in public but committed no violent
acts.
	   It said other detainees include fans of heavy metal music
accused of being ``satanists'' and college students who took down a
portrait of Hussein during a May 1997 protest against price hikes.
	   The report urged Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh, who took office
in August, to rescind a controversial press and publications law
enacted three months ago under a previous government.
	   The law gives the state the right to control and censor the
media, imposes stringent restrictions on reporting and hefty fines
on violators which include confiscating press credentials and
closing down the media outlet.
	   The statement urged the government to bring ``Jordanian law and
practice closer to the letter and spirit of international human
rights treaties to which it is a state party.''
	   It recommended ``an end to incommunicado detention, amending the
Press Law to guarantee the right to freedom of expression and the
inspection of detention centers by an independent body.''

Strike in Italy idles 80 percent of trains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian train workers staged a one-day walkout
Tuesday, the latest in a series of strikes that have disrupted
travel throughout Italy for the past two weeks.
	   The unions said 80 percent of the nation's trains were idled,
but the state railway system said service continued on all
essential routes.
	   The nationwide, 24-hour walkout was scheduled to end 21:00
(22:00 GMT) Tuesday.
	   The strike involved about 10 percent of the nations 120,000
railway workers, who were protesting a stalemate in contract
renewal talks.
	   Airport workers plan a nationwide strike on Friday.

Mobil to begin oil exploration in Sao Tome waters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ U.S. company Mobil Corp.
is to begin oil exploration in this twin-island nation's
territorial waters by the end of the year, a company spokesman said
Tuesday.
	   Jimmy Callender told reporters a four-man team of experts would
supervise the drilling of two exploratory wells.
	   Sao Tome and Principe lies in the Gulf of Guinea _ about 240
kilometers (150 miles) west of Gabon _ in one of the most active
oil exploration areas in the African continent.
	   A delegation from French oil company Elf Aquitaine held talks
with local officials last weekend, but they left without speaking
to reporters.
	   Callender met with Prime Minister Raul Braganca Neto to discuss
Mobil's plans and said the discovery of oil pointed to ``a bright
future'' for this impoverished nation of 120,000 people.
	   Last April, U.S. company Environmental Remediation Holding
Corp., which started offshore oil exploration in July 1997, said it
had found oil in the country's territorial waters.
	   The company, in conjunction with Mobil, entered a joint venture
with the government, called STPETRO, to develop the country's oil
and gas reserves.

Top European clubs back expanded Champions' League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Top European soccer clubs on Tuesday
endorsed plans for a new 32-team Champions' League designed to
counter a breakaway Super League proposed by Media Parnters, news
reports said.
	   The accord was reached at a meeting of 14 teams at a Madrid
hotel, including Real Madrid, Inter Milan and Manchester United,
the state news agency Efe said.
	   These teams said they accepted UEFA's proposal to expand the
Champions' League from 24 to 32 teams and urged European football's
governing body to implement the new format starting next season.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Tuesday reiterated his opposition
to a Super League.
	   ``Let's be clear about this: such a project is not possible.
FIFA will work in close cooperation with UEFA, who share FIFA's
concerns about this project, and whose own Champions League project
is threatened by it, to assert the principles of the statutes'
forbidding teams and players to take part in competitions run by
parties outside the football establishment.
	   ``The prospect may be appealing in itself, especially with large
financial rewards on offer, but we should not fail to understand
that the organization of football solely for the profit motive, by
unqualified sporting entities, would provoke anarchy in our
sport,'' he added.

Pavarotti to perform in Lebanon June 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti will give
a one-night performance in Lebanon in June 1999, organizers said
Tuesday.
	   Pavarotti, 63, will sing at Beirut's Sports City stadium on June
12 in what organizers are billing as a ``historic event'' to mark
the country's emergence from the 1975-90 civil war.
	   The performance will take place about 17 years after Israeli
warplanes bombed the stadium and destroyed it during Israel's 1982
invasion.
	   The 50,000-seat Sports City was rebuilt at a cost of dlrs 75
million for the Pan-Arab Games in July 1997.
	   Ticket prices for the Pavarotti show are yet to be announced.
Proceeds will go to charity.
	   Since the end of the 1975-90 civil war, Lebanon has hosted a
number of international performers, such as Spanish tenor Jose
Carreras, Julio Iglesias, Paul Anka, Shirley Bassey and cellist
Mstislav Rostropovitch.

Former German coach proposes new international competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's former coach Berti Vogts has
proposed a new European competition for national teams that would
guarantee top soccer nations an automatic berth in major
championships.
	   The proposal, reported Tuesday in Germany's media, was made
during a meeting of the technical commission of UEFA, Europe's
governing soccer body.
	   The so-called ``Classic Nations Cup'' would involve eight
nations with the best record over the most recent two European
Championships and World Cups. They would be split into two
four-team round-robin groups, with the top two advancing to the
semifinals and the other playing off for places 5-8.
	   The eight nations would be automatically seeded for the next
European Champions and the World Cup and would not have to qualify.
	   The remaining European nations would go through the normal
qualifications process, with the group winners advancing. Two best
second-placed teams would then play off against the bottom-placed
``Classic Cup'' teams for two more berths.
	   German reports said the proposal was supported by some other
members of UEFA's technical commission.
	   Vogts said the current eight European nations that could be
invited to the new competition could be Germany, France, England,
Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Denmark and Croatia.
	   ``In the Champions League, the German champion doesn't have to
go to Albania anymore. Why should the national team have to do it
then?,'' Vogts asked rhetorically.
	   Vogts said some revenue from the new competition could be
distributed among Europe's ``smaller'' soccer nations.
	   Vogts' successor as German coach, Erich Ribbeck, supported the
plan.
	   ``I don't think it's opportune anymore to have to qualify
against 'small' nations,'' he told reporters Tuesday.
	   ``According to my information, UEFA is already thinking about
this but it's still not as far yet as with club competitions,''
Ribbeck said.
	   No one was available at UEFA's Swiss headquarters to comment on
the reported proposal.
	   Germany, the reigning European champion, has not had much
success lately against what it considers ``small'' soccer nations _
drawing 1-1 with Malta and losing 1-0 to Turkey.

	   ITTERVOORT, Netherlands (AP) _ Police were searching Tuesday for
thieves who stole a multi-million-dollar shipment of Viagra pills
from a Dutch warehouse.
	   The pills, valued at 30 to 50 million guilders (dlrs 16 to 27
million), were taken from the back of a truck parked at a transport
company in Ittervoort, 180 kilometers (110 miles) southeast of
Amsterdam, according to a police press release.
	   The theft was discovered Sunday night by a truck driver who was
supposed to drive the impotency pills to Spain.

Eritrea: Ethiopia deports another 661 Eritreans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopia has deported another 661
Eritreans, among them infants and elderly people, after holding
them for four months in detention under poor conditions, the
Eritrean News Agency said Tuesday.
	   The government news agency said the latest expulsions brought to
34,000 the number of Eritreans expelled by Ethiopia since border
hostilities erupted between the two countries six months ago.
	   Ethiopia says it has expelled only 8,000 Eritreans since the
conflict began, accusing those deported of spying for the Eritrean
government or raising funds for the Eritrean war chest.
	   Ethiopia also accuses Eritrea of deporting 27,000 Ethiopians, a
claim the Eritrean government denies.
	   The news agency said the deportees said they had suffered from
hunger and disease during their detention.
	   The allegations could not be independently confirmed.
	   The border dispute between the two countries broke out with two
weeks of full-scale war in early June, killing several hundred
people. Since then, it has simmered in a massive troop standoff
along the border, with sporadic artillery exchanges at Zalambesa
and at other border points that appear to be intensifying.
	   Heavy shelling was reported this week at Zalambesa, now occupied
by Eritrea.
	   In late October an exchange of artillery described by residents
as worse than usual killed two people and left dozens of fields in
flames in southern Eritrea.
	   Eritrea fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia and gained
independence in 1993. But the border between the two countries was
never officially declared.

Albanian leadership signals for first time his side will settle for
</HEADLINE>
less than independence
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Albanian U.S. envoy meeting guerrillas, comments
by Albanian negotiator; trims.
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top negotiator in Kosovo suggested
Tuesday for the first time that ethnic Albanians could settle for
less than independence of the Serb-ruled province.
	   Even if serious, the comments did not mean all Kosovo Albanian
factions were ready to compromise. Radical ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, who met the top U.S. envoy for Kosovo Tuesday, have yet
to say that they will accept anything short of the independence
they have been fighting for.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the Albanian negotiating team for talks
with the Serbian government, said his side had made a proposal for
Kosovo which could have the province remaining a part of Yugoslavia
with the same status as the republics of Serbia and Montenegro.
	   ``A period of three to five years would be enough to see whether
such a union could function,'' Agani, who normally expresses views
of the moderate Kosovo Albanian leadership headed by Ibrahim
Rugova, said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``If it
could, we would want to stay in it. If not I don't see why we would
stay.''
	   Agani's comments were the first time that an ethnic Albanian
leader has openly accepted the idea of a solution involving less
that full independence for Kosovo, though he indicated he didn't
really believe it was possible.
	   World powers have rejected the possibility of an independent
Kosovo because of fears that could be achieved only through
prolonged bloodshed. It was not clear what U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill, mediating the negotiations, thought of the Albanian proposal.
	   Agani confirmed Tuesday that his delegation would not attend
direct talks called for by Serbian President Milan Milutinovic.
Agani said Milutinovic's invitation for talks was ``an act of
propaganda,'' and that security and political conditions for direct
talks still have not been met.
	   Nonetheless, Milutinovic pressed ahead Tuesday with efforts to
hold peace talks with rival Kosovo Albanian officials _ Serbian
government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Milutinovic will travel to Kosovo's capital Pristina on Wednesday.
	   Milutinovic wants to chair long-sought direct talks with the
ethnic Albanians, with international officials in attendance but
not as mediators.
	   The ethnic Albanians refuse to talk without U.S. and European
mediation, saying only foreign countries could guarantee that an
eventual agreement would be implemented by the Serbian government.
	   They have turned down 16 such invitations in the past six
months, prompting Serb authorities to show up at the prearranged
site anyway, in an attempt meant to demonstrated their sincerity
and the ethnic Albanians' lack of cooperation.
	   The Serbian government says the troubles in Kosovo, where
hundreds of people have died and tens of thousands were left
homeless in its crackdown against secessionists, are Serbia's
internal matter and should not involve foreign mediators.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders said Milutinovic's call for talks is a
part of Belgrade's effort to reduce international pressure on
Serbia to find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo turmoil. They said
ethnic Albanians support peace talks, but not under Serb
conditions.
	   Hill, who has been shuttling between Belgrade and Pristina in an
effort to find a compromise peace plan, met representatives of the
Albanians' rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in the province on Tuesday,
guerrilla sources said.
	   The meeting in the village of Dragobilje, about 50 kilometers
(31 miles) southwest of Pristina, lasted for about two hours and
was Hill's second with KLA representatives since Nov. 6.
	   Jakup Krasniqi, a KLA official who attended the talks, said that
the guerrillas voiced their complains about Hill's draft plan and
added that more meetings were scheduled. He said the guerrillas
would express their opinion of the plan publicly within 10 days.
	   Adem Demaci, a guerrilla spokesman, praised Hill's decision to
meet the KLA commanders.
	   ``Rugova can sign anything, but there could be no deal without
KLA consent,'' Demaci told reporters in Pristina.

Peace group: Israel stifles Palestinian building in east Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is trying to stifle Palestinian
development in east Jerusalem through discriminatory building
regulations, an Israeli peace group charged in a report published
Tuesday.
	   Ir Shalem, an activist group that advocates equitable
development in Jerusalem, accused Israel of creating a Jewish
majority in the traditionally Arab sector of the city by
expropriating Palestinian land for housing for Jews while denying
Palestinians permission to build on the land they retain.
	   ``The ability to receive a building permit is reserved for the
fortunate few,'' said Daniel Seideman, the report's author.
	   Since Israel captured and later annexed east Jerusalem after the
1967 Mideast War, it has allowed some 10,000 housing units to be
built for Palestinians, compared to 70,000 for Jewish residents of
Jerusalem, Seideman said. Israel has built more than 40,000 housing
units for Israelis on land expropriated from Palestinians, Seideman
said.
	   Israel's zoning laws allow Palestinian construction on only 7.3%
of the total area of east Jerusalem, partly by designating
Palestinian land as ``green open areas'' where building is
forbidden, Seideman said.
	   Several other peace groups have issued similar reports in the
past.
	   Joanne Malka, a spokeswoman for the Jerusalem municipality,
denied the city had a discriminatory building policy. Malka said
the difference in the number of housing units for Jews and Arabs
was due to construction habits _ Palestinians tend to build
horizontally while Jews in western Jerusalem build vertically,
creating more housing units for Jews.
	   Malka said the municipality was planning projects that would add
thousands of housing units to Arab neighborhoods in east Jerusalem.

EU fraud squad attacks irregularities, errors in EU accounting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The European Union's fraud watchdog on
Tuesday said continued lapses in budgetary controls allowed runaway
spending in some accounts last year and left the field open for
swindlers.
	   In its annual report, the EU's Court of Auditors eatimated that
5 percent of the Union's 83 billion European currency unit (dlrs 97
billion) budget _ about 17 billion European currency units (5
billion dollars) _ was wasted due to errors and irregularities.
	   ``Enormous amounts of money are lost,'' said Court's President
Bernhard Friedmann.
	   A statement from the court said the level of errors affecting
payments by the EU's executive body, the European Commission, ``is
too high for the Court to provide assurance about their legality
and regularity.''
	   Following a spate of fraud allegations against the EU
Commission, President Jacques Santer last month promised to create
an independent anti-fraud unit.
	   The Court's report pinpointed the EU agriculture and regional
development budgets as the source of most problems.
	   In farming, the watchdog was baffled by size of a 1.74 billion
ecu (dlrs 2 billion) subsidy program for durum wheat, used to make
pasta and semolina. The court said that more than compensates
producers, who are mostly from Italy, Greece, Spain and France.
	   ``There is now not a single objective factor to justify such
favorable treatment,'' said the report.
	   The report also criticized measures to prevent the spread of
``mad cow'' disease. A total of 2.1 billion ecus (dlrs 2.46
billion) was spent to cut EU beef production, but only one-fourth
went to Britain, where the disease caused a major health scare.
	   ``There was a lack of rigor and consistency in the
implementation of measures,'' the court said.
	   In fishing too, the lack of monitoring meant that a measure to
cut the EU fleet ``has had practically no effect on fishing
activity in EU waters.''
	   Aid programs for poor non-EU nations tend to be slow and overly
centralized. On various occasions, aid projects in eastern and
central Europe ``turned out to be unrealistic when ... put into
effect.'' It said that some programs ``that had clearly lost any
sense of direction were being carried on by force of inertia.''

Gravestones removed from sidewalk in central square
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ It's Greece's version of death row _ just
a short stroll from parliament.
	   The tombstone of Aggela Koutelakis was part of the sidewalk in
central Syntagma square until Tuesday when the marble slab was
pried up.
	   The hasty removal followed a public outcry from media reports
that tombstones taken from the capital's public cemeteries were
allegedly being used to fix the square's marble sidewalks.
	   City hall officials denied that such slabs were used in
Syntagma, although they admitted the municipality recycled marble
graves that were no longer being used.
	   ``We never use marble with inscriptions,'' Deputy Mayor Ilias
Skaleos told a television station.
	   A few broken headstones were visible in a pile of marble slabs
lying in a construction area inside the square. Local media also
speculated that some tombstones had been fitted upside down to hide
the letters.
	   Other city hall officials said the marble was supplied by a
contractor hired to renovate the square after a new subway station
is completed. But it was not known if the city had paid for new
marble and had instead been supplied with graveyard discards.
	   Tombs in Greece are often elaborate affairs crafted in marble.
Due to the high cost of a grave site in Athens, families often rent
a tomb for a period of three years. They pay for the marble that is
fitted around the grave. After that, the remains are usually either
transferred to graves in the provinces or moved into an ossuary.
	   Ms. Koutelakis died in 1994 at age 94 and her son said her
remains were removed three years later. All the marble except for
the headstone was broken into small pieces.
	   ``It seems that recycling has found supporters in the wrong
places,'' commented Athens' private Skai television.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian and US troops ended maneuvers on
Tuesday designed to improve operational and combat capabilities of
Egyptian armed forces, officials said.
	   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
four-stage maneuvers, code named Iron Copra, involved paratroopers,
mechanized infantry, warplanes and transport aircraft.
	   The officials would not say where the exercises were conducted
or give further details.
	   The U.S. and Egyptian armies conduct major war games every two
years involving tens of thousands of troops and air and naval
units.
	   The armies started cooperating in 1981 to help train U.S. troops
in desert warfare and to improve Egyptian military skills. The
exercises were later broadened to include other countries.

Doctor sentenced for sex attacks on patients
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAIDSTONE, England (AP) _ A physician was sentenced to 3 1/2
years in prison Tuesday for sexually assaulting female patients
over the past 17 years.
	   Dr Gerald Walmsley, 50, of Langton Green, Kent, was found guilty
of indecently assaulting eight women, two of them twice.
	   Prosecutors said Walmsley, who is married with two grown
daughters, preyed on young female patients who often had a poor
body image or low self-esteem. Many of the assaults occurred after
he offered ``confidence boosting'' relaxation massages, they said.
	   Walmsley assaulted three of the women between 1980 and 1986 when
he was working near Leeds, Yorkshire, in northern England. The
other five women were patients of the doctor after he moved to
Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in southeastern England.
	   Detectives said there may be more victims who did not come
forward.
	   At least two of the women who were assaulted said they were
considering lawsuits.

holding real estate seized from Jews during World War II, an
exhaustive probe shows there were only a handful of such seizures,
and the owners or heirs were paid back, the mayor said Tuesday.
	   The report presented by Mayor Jean Tiberi was yet another effort
by French officials to show they are actively investigating wartime
abuses by the collaborationist Vichy regime.
	   Only last week, the Foreign Ministry published a catalog of
missing Dutch and Flemish paintings looted by the Nazis from a
Jewish family, in an effort to trace the works.
	   That came after a wave of criticism last year when hundreds of
Nazi-looted art works were revealed to be still hanging in French
museums, their ownership yet untraced.
	   The report released Tuesday was the culmination of two years of
research, overseen by a commission of historians, lawyers,
archivists and representatives of the Jewish community.
	   It was looking into charges that hundreds of buildings and
apartments _ notably in the Marais, the historic Jewish quarter of
Paris _ might have been seized from Jews by wartime French
authorities, and their heirs never compensated.
	   When the charges hit the press in November 1996, largely due to
publication of a book, ``Private Domain,'' by journalist Brigitte
Vital-Durand, Tiberi halted sales of any apartments that could be
suspect.
	   But now, he said Tuesday, ``it appears that the city possesses
no property that one can say today was the result of uncompensated
seizures from Jewish owners.''
	   Researchers found that only 1.3 percent of property acquired by
the city during the war belonged to Jews.
	   That can be explained by the fact that many Jews were poor, and
rented rather than owned apartments.
	   Commission president Noel Chahid-Nourai told a news conference
his group had found ``no systematic policy,'' but only ``a few
isolated cases'' of uncompensated seizures from Jewish owners.
	   Specifically, the report says, out of 3,694 city acquisitions
during the war, 49 were definitely from Jewish owners, and only
seven cases are considered suspect.
	   In two of those, property was seized outright, and in five
cases, owners were paid _ but at discriminatory prices, meaning
more than 20 percent less than would have been paid to a non-Jew.
	   These wrongs were compensated soon after the war, the report
says.
	   But in some 50 cases throughout the city, it wasn't possible to
trace whether payment for property actually ever reached the owners
or their heirs _ if they left any. The money was put into accounts
in their names, and the state authority in charge of those deposits
is now looking into its records.
	   There is no way of knowing how many of those cases involve Jews.
	   The majority of Parisian Jews _ about 25,000 _ lived in the
Marais at the time of the war. But only 5,000 were left at the end.
	   Of the 75,000 Jews delivered to the Nazis by Vichy authorities,
only 2,500 returned after the war. Many families were completely
destroyed, leaving no heirs.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Europe's top soccer clubs on Tuesday
endorsed plans for a new 32-team Champions' League designed to
counter a breakaway Super League proposed by Media Partners, news
reports said.
	   The accord was reached at a meeting of 14 teams at a Madrid
hotel, including Real Madrid, Inter Milan and Manchester United,
the state news agency Efe said.
	   These teams said they accepted UEFA's proposal to expand the
Champions' League from 24 to 32 teams and urged European football's
governing body to implement the new format starting next season.
	   They also formed a sub-group of five teams _ Real Madrid, AC
Milan, Bayern Munich, Olympique Marseille and Oporto _ to discuss
the new format with UEFA. All 14 teams will meet again in Madrid
Dec. 18.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Tuesday reiterated his opposition
to a Super League.
	   ``Let's be clear about this: such a project is not possible.
FIFA will work in close cooperation with UEFA, who share FIFA's
concerns about this project, and whose own Champions League project
is threatened by it, to assert the principles of the statutes'
forbidding teams and players to take part in competitions run by
parties outside the football establishment.
	   ``The prospect may be appealing in itself, especially with large
financial rewards on offer, but we should not fail to understand
that the organization of football solely for the profit motive, by
unqualified sporting entities, would provoke anarchy in our

Ukraine's security service establishes informer hotline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's national Security Service has set
up a telephone hotline for informants and turncoats, offering
confidentiality and pardon in exchange for information on security
threats to the country.
	   The announcement, published Tuesday in several Ukrainian
newspapers, encouraged anyone who has information on dangerous
crimes against the government or treason and espionage cases to
phone a Kiev telephone number.
	   The security service, or SBU, said it has recently exposed
several Ukrainians who actively collaborated with foreign
intelligence services or attempted to pass state secrets to foreign
citizens.
	   The security service gave no details of the cases, but said most
of these involved people forced to engage in espionage for ``money
or other material gains,'' apparently meaning that the Ukrainians
in question were pushed into espionage by poverty or blackmail.
	   The SBU did not say it would pay callers to its hotline for
information.
	   Ukrainian law calls for a prison term of 10 to 15 years for
espionage and state treason, and only those people who voluntarily
stop such activities and have not caused any harm to the country
can expect pardon, the SBU added.
	   In June 1997, Russia's Federal Security Service, the main
successor to the Soviet KGB, announced a similar telephone deal for
Russian turncoats.
	   The Russian agency promised them full confidentiality and said
such agents would be granted immunity from prosecution and retain
the money paid by their foreign masters.
	   Some of the calls have yielded unspecified ``positive'' results,
Yeltsin's press service has said.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government plans to build a second port
on the Red Sea's Gulf of Aqaba to handle industrial trade activity,
a government official said Tuesday.
	   The new port is expected to cost 40 million Jordanian dinars
(dlrs 56.3 million) and will be operational in 2000, according to
Nasser Madadha, director of the State Tenders Department.
	   He said the port will be constructed south of the existing one
at Aqaba, Jordan's only sea outlet that is located 350 kilometers
(210 miles) south of the capital Amman.
	   The new port was expected to handle industrial exports such as
potash and minerals, he said. A total of twelve international
construction companies and several local contractors have submitted
bids for the first stage of the project.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Central Bank has finalized a draft law
granting it total independence from the government, its governor
Ismail Hassan said in remarks published Tuesday.
	   The draft law would be soon presented to Parliament for
approval, Hassan told the London-based Arabic daily Asharq
al-Awsat.
	   The bank's existing legal framework, he said, did not give it
total independence. As an example, Hassan cited the fact that
representatives of the ministries of finance, economy and planning
sit on the bank's board.
	   Under the draft law, the president will take from the prime
minister the authority to appoint central bank governors, he said.
	   The Central bank will also have wider powers to monitor the
operations of commercial banks and fine those which violate credit
regulations.
	   ____
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) - ICO Global Communications, the mobile
communications company, has signed a distribution agreement with
Bahrain Telecommunications Co., or Batelco, the company said
Tuesday.
	   Under the agreement, Batelco will have exclusive rights to act
as the ICO distributor in Bahrain, the U.K.-based company said in a
press release.
	   ICO, which specializes in global mobile communication by
satellite, did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.
	   ICO, which was established in January 1995, will launch its
satellite service in 2000. It will be based on pocket-sized mobile
telephones that will allow users to make and receive calls anywhere
in the world.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Workers succeeded in capping a leaking
gas well in southwestern Hungary Tuesday, allowing residents
evacuated from nearby villages to return home, the MTI news agency
reported.
	   The well burst early Saturday, releasing a cloud of noxious
gasses containing carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, leading
authorities to order the evacuation of 2,000 people from three
villages in the area.
	   The accident occurred while the Hungarian Oil and Gas Co. was
drilling a well near Nagylengyel, 200 kilometers (125 miles)
southwest of Budapest.
	   Some evacuees were lodged in the sports hall in the nearest
large community, Zalaegerszeg. Many others were given shelter at
private homes.

Painting fetches thousands for girls' school
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HITCHIN, England (AP) _ Students at a girls' school were
celebrating Tuesday after a painting purchased for 31 pounds (dlrs
50) and given to the school two decades ago fetched nearly 300,000
pounds (dlrs 500,000) at an auction.
	   The C.S. Lowry May Day scene had been displayed in the hallway
of Princess Helena College in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, 40 miles
north of London, since it was given to the school by a former
student.
	   It was sold to a private collector at an auction in London
recently for 298,500 pounds (dlrs 498,495).
	   Appropriately, the money will go toward improvements in the
school's art department.
	   ``Although we will all of course be sorry to see the Lowry go,
it is going to be used for its original purpose, to benefit the
school,'' head teacher Anne-Marie Hodgkiss said.
	   School officials decided to sell the painting after it was
appraised recently and deemed too valuable to be left in the hall.

Report: Soviets showed dummy missiles on Red Square parades
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Many of the monstrous strategic missiles displayed
in Red Square parades during the Soviet era were only dummies, but
they scared the West into an expensive response, a Russian magazine
reported Tuesday.
	   One such fake, GR-1, an acronym for Global Missile, showed
during a May 9, 1965, parade prompted the United States to build an
anti-missile defense system worth billions of dollars, said the
weekly Vlast (Power).
	   In fact, the Soviets had abandoned the GR-1 project long before
the parade.
	   Another two mobile ballistic missiles shown on the same day were
also fakes, their test launches having been a complete failure, the
magazine said.
	   ``Foreign military attaches were scared to death, triggering
panic in NATO headquarters,'' it said. ``A huge international
uproar followed, and only those who prepared this demonstration
knew they were dummies.''
	   One of the authors of the Vlast report worked as a Soviet
missile engineer and said he had personally worked on a support
system for one of the fake missiles to prevent it from bouncing on
the stone-paved Red Square.
	   The magazine said Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev first bluffed
the West with the legend of powerful Russian missiles, saying the
Soviet Union was making them ``like sausage.''
	   ``Such comparison sounded ambiguous for the Soviet people,
because the sausage was in deficit, but it duly impressed
foreigners,'' it said.
	   At the time Krushchev made the comment, the Soviets only had
four intercontinental ballistic missiles on duty, while the United
States had 60.
	   ``The myth about the Soviet missile superiority was convenient
for both the Soviet leadership and the American military industrial
complex, which was getting huge contracts,'' the magazine said.
	   It wasn't until 1970 that the Soviet Union reached a parity with
the United States on land-based intercontinental ballistic
missiles, and the overall nuclear balance was attained only shortly
before the 1991 Soviet collapse, Vlast said.
	   ``That was the end of the missile race,'' it said. ``The Soviet
Union broke its neck in the financial and technological competition
and collapsed.''

Indonesian world champion banned for steroids
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Badminton has become the latest sport to be hit by
a doping scandal, with world men's doubles champion Budiarto Sigit
of Indonesia suspended for 13 months after failing a drug test.
	   The International Badminton Federation said Sigit, 22, tested
positive for the steroid Nandrolone at the Konica Cup in Singapore
in August. Sigit won the doubles' title there with partner Candra
Wijaya.
	   Sigit was also fined dlrs 2,000 and he and his partner had to
forfeit their dlrs 10,000 in prize money and ranking points from
winning the tournament.
	   The suspension means Sigit will be unable to defend his world
doubles title in Copenhagen in May.
	   It's the most serious doping case in badminton in 16 years since
Hastomo Arbi, another Indonesian, received a 14-month ban after
testing positive for steroids at the 1982 All England
championships.
	   A third Indonesian, Minarti Timur, was banned for 18 months in
the early 1990s after failing a drug test.
	   ``This is particularly disappointing because it involves a
tournament winner and a world champion,'' said Lu Shengrong, the
IBF president.
	   ``I think it will prove to be an isolated blemish on our
relatively dope-free record,'' added IBF chief executive Neil
Cameron.

<TEXT>
	   KADENA AIR BASE, Okinawa (AP) _ Stargazers gathered across Asia
Tuesday and NASA scientists boarded planes to get above the clouds
over Japan for the climax of the biggest meteor storm in decades.
	   From the top of the highest mountain in Thailand to the
neon-drenched streets of Tokyo, Asians turned their eyes to the sky
for climax of the Leonid meteor storm.
	   In northern Thailand, hotels, camp grounds and airlines were
booked solid with people heading for Doi Inthanon, the Southeast
Asian country's highest peak at 2,565 meters (8,464 feet), and Doi
Suthep, another mountain with a famed Buddhist temple on top.
	   In Tokyo and many other Japanese cities, public offices and
private businesses heeded a government plea to turn down their
lights to enhance viewing.
	   A spotty cloud cover, however, obscured much of the sky over the
capital.
	   ``I hoped that we would be able to see them, but the weather
doesn't look so good,'' said Miki Sunagawa, a young woman waiting
for a friend in Tokyo's swank Ginza shopping district late Tuesday
night.
	   To beat the clouds, two NASA research planes brimming with
scientific sensors took off from this U.S. Air Force base on this
southern Japan island in what officials said was the American space
agency's first major astrobiology mission.
	   NASA sees this year's storm as a rare opportunity to study the
composition of both comets and meteoroids _ and perhaps learn
something about the origin of life on Earth in the process.
	   ``We have a very unique opportunity here to get some information
about the way life may have arisen,'' said NASA astrobiology
specialist Gregg Schmidt.
	   Some scientists believe the elements necessary for life on Earth
may have been brought here by comets or meteorites. Astrobiology is
the study of life on earth and its connection with the cosmos.
	   Though Asia was deemed the best place for viewing the climax of
the storm, which was to occur over the continent before dawn
Wednesday, the Leonids were seen _ but not necessarily recognized _
elsewhere as well.
	   Rescuers in Norway were swamped with calls from concerned
Norwegians who spotted what they thought were red distress rockets
fired from ships in trouble off the southern coast.
	   ``The meteors really changed color, and sometimes they were
bright red, so I can understand that people associated them with
distress rockets,'' said rescue leader Ben Vikoeren.
	   The shower is caused by the earth's passage through the long
tail of the Comet Temple-Tuttel. It is called the Leonid shower
because the meteors appear to come from the direction of the
constellation Leo.
	   Though the Leonids occur every November, they are usually not
particularly spectacular. But every 33 years the comet speeds
through the inner solar system and sheds swarms of particles as it
nears the sun.
	   And when the earth crosses that path, the skies light up.
	   NASA scientist Schmidt said the Leonid storm in 1833, for
example, packed as many as 10,000 meteors per hour.
	   ``The 1833 Leonid shower started a religious revival based on
what people saw,'' he said.
	   The mission of the two NASA aircraft out of Kadena Air Base was
to circle around the East China Sea with imaging equipment,
infrared sensors and spectrometers to analyze visible light.
	   The equipment will provide scientists with data that can be used
to determine the cosmic debris' molecular composition _ and find
traces of any organic material it may carry.
	   Many of the world's 600-plus satellites have been maneuvered to
reduce the possibility of damage from the speeding grit, which can
poke holes in solar panels, pit lenses, blast away mirror coatings
or cause damaging electromagnetic pulses.
	   Russian space authorities said the crew of the Mir space station
was prepared for a too-close encounter and would enter the Soyuz
escape capsule when the shower hit its peak.
	   But Air Force Capt. Steve Butow, a senior member of the NASA
Leonid project, said there probably wasn't much cause for concern
for airplanes or people on the ground.
	   ``Most of the stuff that's making the trails in the sky are
probably no larger than the size of a small marble at the
maximum,'' he said. ``These things will abort at about 100
kilometers (60 miles). So no Armageddon tonight.''

U.S. energy secretary to promote investment in Kuwait, Saudi
</HEADLINE>
Arabia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Tuesday
that he will visit Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in January to encourage
both nations to open up to foreign investment in their oil
industries.
	   ``That will be one of the main purposes of my visit,''
Richardson said at a press conference following his speech to the
the 19th Oil and Money Conference.
	   Saudi Arabia recently has begun seeking help from U.S. oil
companies in developing energy reserves, the first time outside
participation has been solicited since the kingdom's oil industry
was nationalized in 1973.
	   Richardson described the Saudi policy shift as ``a potential
major breakthrough.''
	   Industry analysts said the change was forced by low oil prices,
which have dried up the capital available to oil-producing nations.
	   In his speech to the conference, Richardson said revenues will
fall by a third _ or dlrs 50 billion _ in 1998 for members of the
Organization of Oil Exporting Countries.
	   ``In this cycle of low oil prices, competition for capital is
intense,'' Richardson told the conference.
	   For those nations seeking outside investment, Richardson
prescribed: ``private ownership; the sanctity of contracts; fair,
non-discriminatory treatment of participants; free flow of oil
across international borders; and stable, transparent, legal,
fiscal regulatory and trade regimes.''

Sweden gets first Roman Catholic bishop who's a Swede since
</HEADLINE>
Reformation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ For the first time in 400 years,
Sweden's Roman Catholics will have a bishop who's a Swede.
	   The Vatican on Tuesday named the Rev. Anders Arborelius as
bishop of the Stockholm diocese, which covers all of Sweden.
Arborelius was born in Switzerland of Swedish parents and grew up
in the Swedish city of Lund.
	   He replaces Bishop Hubertus Brandenburg, a German, who on
Tuesday turned 75, the usual retirement age for bishops.
	   Arborelius will become the first Swede to head the church in
this country since the Protestant Reformation swept the country in
the 1500s. The Reformation changed Sweden from an almost entirely
Catholic country into one where Catholics were banned.
	   Until 1860, no native Swedes were allowed to be Catholics and
today the church claims only about 2 percent of the population _
about 165,000 people _ and most of its priests are foreign-born,
according to the Stockholm diocese.

Muslim leaders will hand over war-crimes suspects in areas they
</HEADLINE>
control
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Authorities in
Muslim-controlled parts of Bosnia said Tuesday they do not expect
the U.N. war crimes tribunal to issue secret indictments for
suspects in their areas.
	   Mirza Harjic, adviser to the Muslim member of the joint Bosnian
presidency, said such a policy was unnecessary because ``we are the
only side that has done everything the Tribunal has ordered.''
	   He said Muslim authorities would continue to turn over war
crimes suspects indicted by the tribunal on demand. Secret
indictments have most frequently been issued for suspects in the
Serb half of Bosnia, where authorities have opposed their
extradition.
	   Hajric spoke a day after the first trial against ex-members of
Muslim led forces during the Bosnian war was concluded in The
Hague, Netherlands, where the tribunal is located. One suspect _ a
Muslim _ was found innocent. Two others and a Bosnian Croat were
found guilty of wartime atrocities against Bosnian Serbs held in a
prison camp.
	   The camp warden, Bosnian Croat Zdravko Mucic, was found guilty
of 11 offenses and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions for
overseeing guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. He was
sentenced to seven years in prison.
	   Deputy Commander Hazim Delic was sentenced to 20 years in prison
for the murder, rape and torture of prisoners. Guard Esad Landzo
was ordered jailed for 15 years for murdering three inmates and
torturing others.
	   But prosecutors failed to make the command responsibility
argument stick to Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim military commander
accused of having overall control of the camp.
	   The judges acquitted him, saying there was not enough evidence
to link him to the atrocities.
	   Although currently there are no former members of the Muslim-led
government forces on the official indictment list of the tribunal,
Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt said on Monday prosecutors were
currently working on more investigations involving Serbs as the
victims of war crimes.
	   Hajric said the Muslim-led authorities in Bosnia arrested and
handed two of the four for trial by the tribunal. The other two
were arrested in Germany and Austria.

Former German coach proposes new international competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's former coach Berti Vogts has
proposed a new European competition for national teams that would
guarantee top soccer nations an automatic berth in major
championships.
	   The proposal, reported Tuesday in Germany's media, was made
during a meeting of UEFA's technical commission.
	   The so-called ``Classic Nations Cup'' would involve eight
nations with the best record over the most recent two European
Championships and World Cups. They would be split into two
four-team round-robin groups, with the top two advancing to the
semifinals and the other playing off for places 5-8.
	   The eight nations would be automatically seeded for the next
European Championship and the World Cup and would not have to
qualify.
	   The remaining European nations would go through the normal
qualifications process, with the group winners advancing. Two best
second-placed teams would then play off against the bottom-placed
``Classic Cup'' teams for two more berths.
	   German reports said the proposal was supported by some other
members of UEFA's technical commission.
	   Vogts said the current eight European nations that could be
invited to the new competition could be Germany, France, England,
Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Denmark and Croatia.
	   ``In the Champions League, the German champion doesn't have to
go to Albania anymore. Why should the national team have to do it
then?,'' Vogts asked rhetorically.
	   Vogts said some revenue from the new competition could be
distributed among Europe's ``smaller'' soccer nations.
	   Vogts' successor as German coach, Erich Ribbeck, supported the
plan.
	   ``I don't think it's opportune anymore to have to qualify
against 'small' nations,'' he told reporters Tuesday.
	   ``According to my information, UEFA is already thinking about
this but it's still not as far yet as with club competitions,''
Ribbeck said.
	   No one was available at UEFA's Swiss headquarters to comment on
the reported proposal.
	   Germany, the reigning European champion, has not had much
success lately against what it considers ``small'' soccer nations _
drawing 1-1 with Malta and losing 1-0 to Turkey.

Brazzaville files charges against ex-Prime Minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ The government has called
for criminal charges to be filed against ousted Prime Minister
Bernard Kolelas in connection to a string of killings by an
outlawed militia force he used to head, a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   ``The barbaric crimes committed by Kolelas and his accomplices
will not go unpunished, '' Communications Minister and government
spokesman Francois Ibovi announced Tuesday.
	   Calls for the charges came a day after a report that Kolelas'
former ``Ninja'' rebel movement had gunned down dozens of
worshipers in a church during a weekend raid south of Brazzaville.
	   At least six of the victims were members of an independent peace
delegation trying to halt the increasingly frequent attacks.
	   The Ninja rebel group responsible for the attack allegedly still
has links to Kolelas.
	   Ibovi, who accused Kolelas of trying to ``destabilize'' the
country, said the government had contacted the prosecutor's office
to demand that charges be filed against the former prime minister.
	   The weekend killings are just the latest in a growing number of
attacks on civilian and government targets in the Republic of
Congo's south.
	   The Ninjas, who backed Kolelas during the Republic of Congo's
civil war last year, have refused to recognize the government of
Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who won the war.
	   Since his take over, Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia
groups including his own Cobras.

Second weekly strike slated for Wednesday in Zimbabwe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The main labor federation said Tuesday
it will hold the second in a series of weekly one-day strikes to
protest price increases and failing government economic policies.
	   The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions began distributing
leaflets with a strike call for Wednesday after a meeting with
government ministers failed to avert strike action.
	   Morgan Tsvangirai, who heads the trade congress, said that
neither the government nor employers agreed on Monday over workers'
demands for immediate price reviews and 20 percent wage increases
to pay for soaring prices.
	   ``There are insufficient grounds to call off the stay-away,'' he
said on Tuesday.
	   Last Wednesday, the group organized a crippling strike to
protest a 67 percent hike in gasoline prices. The hike triggered
price booms in commuter fares, sugar, cooking oil and foodstuffs.
	   Labor leaders met for four hours Monday with President Robert
Mugabe's trade and industry ministers and with employer
representatives.
	   Acting Labor Minister Nathan Shamuyarira urged workers to
abandon strikes while negotiations continued. He said the
government would not involve itself in wage negotiations.
	   The gasoline price increase touched off three days of rioting
and demonstrations earlier this month that claimed one life.
	   The government blames the gasoline price hike on an 80 percent
Zimbabwe currency drop against the U.S. dollar in the past year.
	   But Tsvangirai said the state would better spend its money on
the crumbling economy than on military actions in the Congo.
	   ``If we are able to subsidize a war, why not be able to
subsidize fuel?'' he said.
	   Zimbabwe is spending an estimated 17 million Zimbabwe dollars
(dlrs 500,000) a day on maintaining thousands of combat troops and
other equipment to support Congolese President Laurent Kabila in
Congo.
	   Unrest over alleged economic mismanagement and government
corruption is posing the most serious threat yet to Mugabe, who has
ruled the former Rhodesia since it gained independence from Britain
in 1980.

Veteran journalist buried in Greek homeland

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Harry Stathos, a veteran American newsman
who worked for newspapers and news agencies, was buried Tuesday.
	   Stathos, 69, died of a heart attack last Thursday while
returning from an Armistice Day dinner hosted by the U.S. Embassy
and American College.
	   The Greek-born Stathos began his career in Atlanta and later
worked for United Press International. While based in Spain for UPI
in the early 1960s, Stathos was the first to break the story that
the United States had lost a pair of nuclear weapons in the region.
	   He then worked at the New York Daily News, the New York Post and
the Washington Times. Stathos moved to Greece in the late 1980s and
worked as a freelance journalist.

Top European clubs back expanded UEFA competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Europe's top soccer clubs on Tuesday
endorsed plans for a new 32-team Champions' League designed to
counter a breakaway Super League proposed by Media Partners, news
reports said.
	   The accord was reached at a meeting of 14 teams at a Madrid
hotel, including Real Madrid, Inter Milan and Manchester United,
the state news agency Efe said.
	   The teams said they accepted UEFA's proposal to expand the
Champions' League from 24 to 32 teams and urged UEFA to implement
the new format starting next season.
	   They also formed a sub-group of five teams _ Real Madrid, AC
Milan, Bayern Munich, Olympique Marseille and Oporto _ to discuss
the new format with UEFA. All 14 teams will meet again in Madrid
Dec. 18.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Tuesday reiterated his opposition
to a Super League.
	   ``Let's be clear about this: such a project is not possible.
FIFA will work in close cooperation with UEFA, who share FIFA's
concerns about this project, and whose own Champions League project
is threatened by it, to assert the principles of the statutes'
forbidding teams and players to take part in competitions run by
parties outside the football establishment.
	   ``The prospect may be appealing in itself, especially with large
financial rewards on offer, but we should not fail to understand
that the organization of football solely for the profit motive, by
unqualified sporting entities, would provoke anarchy in our
sport,'' he added.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors returned Tuesday to
Iraq, saying they would get to work as soon as possible to test
Iraq's pledge to cooperate in the search for its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The arms inspectors have been working for more than seven years
to unearth Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles, but Iraq has frequently blocked their work. The latest
threat of attack by U.S. and British forces produced a renewed
promise to cooperate.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the inspectors, said that
disarmament activities would start Wednesday in earnest.
	   ``We are back. We are ready to work immediately,'' senior
weapons inspector Jaakko Ylitalo told reporters after his C-130
transport plane landed Tuesday morning at the Habaniya military air
base outside Baghdad.
	   Ylitalo was among 86 inspectors from the U.N. team and the
International Atomic Energy Agency who arrived from the Gulf state
of Bahrain, where they were evacuated last week from Iraq when U.S.
airstrikes seemed likely.
	   At the airbase, an Iraqi official told Ylitalo that Iraq had
prepared for the resumption of their work.
	   With the threat of American and British airstrikes on Iraq over
for now, about 150 U.N. relief workers also returned to Baghdad
from the Jordanian capital of Amman, where they were sent at the
height of the crisis.

Tough security measures for German-Dutch game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) _ Fearing fan violence, German and
Dutch police experts have stepped up security for Wednesday's
exhibition soccer match between Germany and the Netherlands.
	   ``We have to assume that German hooligans will use the match to
make a show of themselves once again,'' said Wilhelm Hennes,
security chief for the German soccer federation (DFB).
	   The games between the two bitter neighboring rivals often
trigger violence between fans. The last time the two teams played
against each other, in April 1996, about 1,000 German neo-Nazi
hooligans ran riot in Rotterdam. Germany won the match 1-0.
	   German and Dutch police officers have been working together for
several months in advance of the match. More than 1,000 policemen,
including Dutch experts, will provide security around the stadium
and in downtown Gelsenkirchen.
	   The city is less than an hour's drive from the Dutch border and
nearly 10,000 Dutch fans are expected for the match at the stadium
where Schalke plays its Bundesliga games.
	   Prosecutors and judges have set up special courts to deal
rapidly with offenders.
	   ``We've done our homework,'' said police spokesman Ulrich
Grzella.
	   Soccer violence experts from other German cities also have been
drafted into duty. Police will escort fans into the stadium and
separate parking lots have been allocated.
	   Hooligans known to the police have been visited by officers at
home or at work, in both countries.
	   ``We are making it clear to the hooligans that they can't hope
for anonymity,'' said Michael Endler, a spokesman for state police
in Duesseldorf. ``We are taking comprehensive preventive
measures.''
	   Police officers think about 1,000 violence-prone fans from both
sides may come to the match.
	   German officials are keen to clean up the country's image after
German neo-Nazis attacked a French policeman and left him in coma
in Lens during the World Cup. The policeman is recovering.

Peace group: Israel stifles Palestinian building in east Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is trying to stifle Palestinian
development in east Jerusalem through discriminatory building
regulations, an Israeli peace group charged in a report published
Tuesday.
	   Ir Shalem, an activist group that advocates equitable
development in Jerusalem, accused Israel of creating a Jewish
majority in the traditionally Arab sector of the city by
expropriating Palestinian land for housing for Jews while denying
Palestinians permission to build on the land they retain.
	   ``The ability to receive a building permit is reserved for the
fortunate few,'' said Daniel Seideman, the report's author.
	   Since Israel captured and later annexed east Jerusalem after the
1967 Mideast War, it has allowed some 10,000 housing units to be
built for Palestinians, compared to 70,000 for Jewish residents of
Jerusalem, Seideman said. Israel has built more than 40,000 housing
units for Israelis on land expropriated from Palestinians, Seideman
said.
	   Israel's zoning laws allow Palestinian construction on only 7.3
percent of the total area of east Jerusalem, partly by designating
Palestinian land as ``green open areas'' where building is
forbidden, Seideman said.
	   Several other peace groups have issued similar reports in the
past.
	   Joanne Malka, a spokeswoman for the Jerusalem municipality,
denied the city had a discriminatory building policy. Malka said
the difference in the number of housing units for Jews and Arabs
was due to construction habits _ Palestinians tend to build
horizontally while Jews in western Jerusalem build vertically,
creating more housing units for Jews.
	   Malka said the municipality was planning projects that would add
thousands of housing units to Arab neighborhoods in east Jerusalem.

Russia's Lebed cuts short visit to Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russian political leader and provincial
governor Alexander Lebed cut short a visit to Germany on Tuesday,
apparently because of Russia's financial crisis.
	   Lebed, considered a potential candidate to succeed President
Boris Yeltsin, had been scheduled to meet Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer and business executives during a one-day trip to Bonn.
	   He was also supposed to give a speech about the crisis facing
Russia's regions.
	   The Itar-Tass news agency quoted him as saying that his abrupt
departure was prompted by Tuesday's expiration of Russia's 90-day
moratorium on repayment of foreign debts.
	   With business in his area at stake, Lebed said he had to be in
Moscow to represent the interests of the Krasnoyarsk region, where
he is governor.
	   The German Society for Foreign Affairs, which had invited Lebed,
said he left Bonn ``head over heels,'' apparently because of the
region's financial problems.
	   There was no official comment from the foreign ministry.
	   Lebed, a former army general, founded his own political party
last year. He was elected governor of Krasnoyarsk this year.

Peace group: Israel stifles Palestinian building in east Jerusalem

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is trying to stifle Palestinian
development in east Jerusalem through discriminatory building
regulations, an Israeli peace group charged in a report published
Tuesday.
	   Ir Shalem, an activist group that advocates equitable
development in Jerusalem, accused Israel of creating a Jewish
majority in the traditionally Arab sector of the city by
expropriating Palestinian land for housing for Jews while denying
Palestinians permission to build on the land they retain.
	   ``The ability to receive a building permit is reserved for the
fortunate few,'' said Daniel Seideman, the report's author.
	   Since Israel captured and later annexed east Jerusalem after the
1967 Mideast War, it has allowed some 10,000 housing units to be
built for Palestinians, compared to 70,000 for Jewish residents of
Jerusalem, Seideman said. Israel has built more than 40,000 housing
units for Israelis on land expropriated from Palestinians, Seideman
said.
	   Israel's zoning laws allow Palestinian construction on only 7.3
percent of the total area of east Jerusalem, partly by designating
Palestinian land as ``green open areas'' where building is
forbidden, Seideman said.
	   Several other peace groups have issued similar reports in the
past.
	   Joanne Malka, a spokeswoman for the Jerusalem municipality,
denied the city had a discriminatory building policy. Malka said
the difference in the number of housing units for Jews and Arabs
was due to construction habits _ Palestinians tend to build
horizontally while Jews in western Jerusalem build vertically,
creating more housing units for Jews.
	   Malka said the municipality was planning projects that would add
thousands of housing units to Arab neighborhoods in east Jerusalem.

Free-trade summit begins in Malaysia amid deep discord

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim leaders tried on
Tuesday to set aside a diplomatic furor set off by the United
States and to concentrate on Asia's economic crisis during their
annual free-trade summit.
	   But U.S. Vice President Al Gore's decision to sympathize with
the anti-government reform movement in Malaysia, the host country,
in a speech the night before the summit began appeared to leave
deep divisions among some of the 21 leaders.
	   In fact, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, the third
Malaysian official to condemn Gore since the speech, said it could
put the very heart of the Asian country's democracy at risk.
	   ``The action by the U.S. patently is not to advance the cause of
democracy and the rule of law, but to serve its own narrow
political agenda,'' Abdullah said.
	   The goal of the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit
is for its leaders to deal with Asia's worst financial crisis in
decades by adopting a set of recommendations that would help
restart economic growth and stabilize markets.
	   Before it started Tuesday, Gore and Mathahir briefly shook hands
as the prime minister greeted the APEC leaders in the Grand Salon
of the lavish Palace of the Golden Horses hotel.
	   But Gore and Mahathir quickly separated to talk with the other
presidents and prime ministers, as they gathered at the foot of a
massive revolving statue of rearing horses.
	   When the 21 leaders stood together for a photograph in the lush
garden with palm trees outside the hotel, Canada's prime minister,
Jean Chretien, stood on one side of Mahathir, and Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley of New Zealand on the other.
	   Gore stood stiffly at the far right end of the group in the
pre-arranged lineup.
	   The leaders then walked around a beautiful man-made lagoon built
on an abandoned tin mine, with Gore a few steps behind Mahathir.
Gore and Philippine President Joseph Estrada strolled together,
laughing and chatting.
	   Estrada was the only Pacific Rim leader to publicly defend
Gore's comments on Malaysia's political reform movement.
	   None of the leaders appeared to talk about Gore's speech, or
Malaysia's anger over the decision of other top APEC officials to
meet and sympathize with the de facto leader of the country's
protest movement, Azizah Ismail.
	   Earlier in the day, other Asian countries joined Mahathir in
criticizing Gore for making this the first of the six APEC summits
to ever focus on the internal affairs of a member country, or on
subjects such as human rights.
	   But Gore defended his speech Monday night to Asian leaders and
businessmen in Kuala Lumpur, saying that nations fighting off
economic crises must work as hard to promote democracy.
	   ``My point is very simple: these economies have some very
difficult choices to make for reform to move forward,'' Gore told
reporters as he began a bilateral meeting with Russian Prime
Minister Yergency Primakov. ``Democracy and freedom are the
essential prerequisites for making those kinds of decisions and
getting that kind of support.''
	   Gore's speech on the eve of the summit was mostly devoted to the
Asian economic crisis, which began 17 months ago. It has decimated
Asian economies, spread to Russia and Brazil and led to wild swings
on U.S. and European stock markets.
	   Gore announced a new dlrs 10 billion support package for the
stalled economies of the hard-hit Asian region. Half the money will
come from the United States and the other half from Japan, the
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   In a slap at the United States, New Zealand's prime minister,
Jenny Shipley, said Tuesday: ``It's not New Zealand's style to do a
megaphone diplomacy. ... It's critical that bilateral issues do not
get confused with APEC.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton had planned to attend the APEC
summit, but he sent Gore in his place while holding emergency
meetings in Washington about the U.S.-Iraqi standoff.
	   In the end, Clinton canceled an expected military attack on Iraq
for expelling U.N. weapons inspectors. Clinton still plans to
complete the last part of the planned Asian trip, including stops
later this week in Japan and South Korea.
	   Mahathir, who has been in power 17 years, is now Asia's longest
serving ruler after violent protests in neighboring Indonesia ended
President Suharto's 32-year rule in May.
	   Malaysia's protest movement exploded two months ago after
Mahathir fired and then jailed his former protege and now political
rival, former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Anwar was charged with corruption and sexual misconduct _
allegations he says are false and politically motivated.
	   Anwar's trial has been suspended during the APEC summit, but
officials from the United States, Canada, Australia and the
Philippines have met with Azizah, Anwar's wife.
	   They expressed concern over reports that Anwar was severely
beaten in prison and over the fairness of his trail. This has
delighted Azizah and infuriated the Malaysian government.
	   Three protests by pro-Anwar supporters, including a small one on
Tuesday night, have occurred in Kuala Lumpur since the APEC
meetings began last week. But only one of them turned violent.
	   Several other APEC officials criticized Gore's speech, too.
	   ``In APEC, we should concentrate on APEC matters. We should
leave the domestic matters alone,'' said Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's
prime minister.
	   Thailand's foreign minister, Surin Pitsuwan, said: ``You have to
be very, very careful toward each other's feelings. We are here to
solve the (economic) problem and compare notes.''

Ultra-Orthodox rabbis sign religious ruling against peace accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The spiritual leaders of a powerful religious
block in government signed a decree Tuesday prohibiting Israel from
carrying out a West Bank troop withdrawal it committed to in the
latest Mideast peace accord.
	   ``The borders of our Holy Land were established by God and
Israel cannot make any concessions on these borders,'' nine rabbis
affiliated with the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism coalition
wrote in a statement.
	   Religious Jews believe the West Bank, which Israel captured from
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast War, is part of the biblical land
promised to the Jews by God.
	   Under the latest peace accord signed in Washington last month,
Israel agreed to withdraw its troops from 13 percent of the West
Bank, area where the Palestinians hope to set-up a future state.
	   The decree has no formal or legal binding whatsoever but
reflects the growing opposition to the accord from Israel's
religious community which weilds considerable power in Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.
	   The rabbis called upon the ultra-Orthodox community to oppose
the peace accord and participate in a prayer rally against it.
	   ``It should not be done,'' said Menachem Porush, chairman of
Agudat Yisrael, one of the parties that make up the UTJ coalition.
	   The decree charged that land handed over to the Palestinians
would be used as launching pads for terrorists and threaten Jewish
lives.
	   The ruling was handed down as Israeli lawmakers met to continue
debate and vote on the accord which was expected to pass late
Tuesday. Porush said the ruling did not necessarily mean that UTJ's
four lawmakers would vote against the agreement during the
parliamentary vote.

Minister resigns over dispute with ultranationalist party leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serbian government minister
resigned Tuesday in protest of her ultranationalist party leader's
``dictatorship'' and his handling of the Kosovo crisis, media
reported.
	   Rada Trajkovic, the minister for family affairs, told reporters
she was stepping down because of a long-lasting dispute with her
party leader Vojislav Seselj, leader of her ultranationalist
Serbian Radical Party.
	   It was not clear whether she was resigning from the party as
well.
	   She blamed Seselj for ``dictatorship'' and said she disagreed
with his ``run ins with high-ranking Radical Party officials.'' She
didn't elaborate further.
	   Seselj, who also is Serbia's deputy premier, on Tuesday denied
any rifts within his party which together with Yugoslav president
Slobodan Milosevic's Socialists and the neo-communists of
Milosevic's wife Mirjana Markovic forms the ruling Serbian
coalition.
	   The outspoken Seselj has been voicing anti-Western views and has
consistently demanded a tougher line against ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo. He was also instrumental in a recent government purge of
independent media.
	   But he also supported Milosevic in accepting a U.S.-brokered
agreement for Kosovo, strongly criticized by some other Serbian
ultra-nationalists.
	   Without elaborating, Trajkovic told independent B 92 radio that
all she cared about was the freedom of her Serb people in Kosovo.
	   Milosevic launched a bloody crackdown on Kosovo's Albanian
separatists in February but, faced with a threat of NATO
intervention, pledged last month to withdraw excess security police
and Yugoslav army troops and abide by a U.S.-sponsored peace
agreement for the province.
	   Trajkovic, a psychiatrist by profession and a native of Kosovo,
was considered crucial in boosting Seselj's popularity among Kosovo
Serbs.

EU fraud squad attacks irregularities, errors in EU accounting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The European Union's fraud watchdog on
Tuesday said continued lapses in budgetary controls allowed runaway
spending in some accounts last year and left the field open for
swindlers.
	   In its annual report, the EU's Court of Auditors eatimated that
5 percent of the Union's 83 billion European currency unit (dlrs 97
billion) budget _ about 17 billion European currency units (5
billion dollars) _ was wasted due to errors and irregularities.
	   ``Enormous amounts of money are lost,'' said Court's President
Bernhard Friedmann.
	   A statement from the court said the level of errors affecting
payments by the EU's executive body, the European Commission, ``is
too high for the Court to provide assurance about their legality
and regularity.''
	   Following a spate of fraud allegations against the EU
Commission, President Jacques Santer last month promised to create
an independent anti-fraud unit.
	   The Court's report pinpointed the EU agriculture and regional
development budgets as the source of most problems.
	   In farming, the watchdog was baffled by size of a 1.74 billion
ecu (dlrs 2 billion) subsidy program for durum wheat, used to make
pasta and semolina. The court said that the subsidy was greater
than the actual value of the product mostly grown in Italy, Greece,
Spain and France.
	   The report also criticized sloppy handling of programs to
prevent the spread of ``mad cow'' disease. A total of 2.1 billion
ecus (dlrs 2.46 billion) was spent to cut EU beef production,
one-fourth of it in Britain, where the disease caused a major
health scare.
	   ``There was a lack of rigor and consistency in the
implementation of measures,'' the court said.
	   In fishing too, the lack of monitoring meant that a measure to
cut the EU fleet ``has had practically no effect on fishing
activity in EU waters.''
	   Aid programs for poor non-EU nations tend to be slow and overly
centralized. On various occasions, aid projects in eastern and
central Europe ``turned out to be unrealistic when ... put into
effect.'' It said that some programs ``that had clearly lost any
sense of direction were being carried on by force of inertia.''

Kuwait hails Qatar's plans for an elected parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's parliament applauded Qatar's plans for an
elected legislature and a constitution on Tuesday, describing them
as a ``giant leap'' into the future.
	   Kuwait boasts the only parliament among the six Arab states of
the Gulf, although women do not have the right to vote or run for
it. The other states are Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates.
	   Qatar's ruler, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, announced
Monday that he was setting up a committee to work out a
constitution which would call for an elected parliament.
	   ``The National Assembly in the state of Kuwait is extremely
pleased with (Qatar's) democratic, historic decision,'' said a
statement read at the end of the house's weekly session.
	   The statement said the Qatari legislature would be a ``giant
leap'' that would give ``reason for optimism'' in the Gulf.
	   Women as well as men would have the right to vote and be elected
to parliament under the Qatari proposals.
	   Sheik Hamad has made a series of moves toward liberalizing Qatar
since he seized power from his conservative father in a bloodless
palace coup in 1995.
	   Qatar, a small emirate on the eastern side of the Arabian
Peninsula, has not allowed popular participation in decision-making
since its independence from Britain in 1971.

	   Stathos, 69, died of a heart attack last Thursday while
returning from an Armistice Day dinner hosted by the U.S. Embassy

	   The Greek-born Stathos began his career in Atlanta and later
worked for United Press International. While based in Spain for UPI
in the early 1960s, Stathos was the first to break the story that
the United States had lost a pair of nuclear weapons in the region.
	   He then worked at the New York Daily News, the New York Post and
the Washington Times. Stathos moved to Greece in the late 1980s and
worked as a freelance journalist.

	   In farming, the watchdog was baffled by size of a 1.74 billion
ecu (dlrs 2 billion) subsidy program for durum wheat, used to make
pasta and semolina. The court said that the subsidy was greater
than the actual value of the product mostly grown in Italy, Greece,
Spain and France.
	   The report also criticized sloppy handling of programs to
prevent the spread of ``mad cow'' disease. A total of 2.1 billion
ecus (dlrs 2.46 billion) was spent to cut EU beef production,
one-fourth of it in Britain, where the disease caused a major
health scare.

Former Olympic champ David Hemery elected president of UK

Athletics, pledges anti-doping fight
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes on 2003 world championships

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Former Olympic hurdles champion David
Hemery was elected Tuesday as president of the governing body of
British athletics. He said his goals are to fight doping and bring
the World Championships to London in 2003.
	   Hemery, who won the gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles at the
1968 Mexico City Olympics and is a former world record-holder in
the event, defeated former Olympic champion Steve Ovett and three
other candidates in voting for president of UK Athletics.
	   The 54-year-old Hemery receiving 426 votes in the polling of
Britain's athletic clubs. Sir Eddie Kulukundis was second with 309
votes and Ovett third with 274, followed by Tom McNab with 129 and
Michael Turner with 99.
	   Ovett, gold medalist in the 800 meters at the 1980 Moscow
Olympics and former world record-holder at 1,500 meters, had been
considered the favorite.
	   ``All the gambling money would have been on Steve Ovett,''
Hemery said. ``I was sure he'd get the job.''
	   One of Hemery's first tasks will be to help appoint a chief
executive of Athletics UK, the body given the task of running the
sport following the financial collapse last year of the British
Athletics Federation.
	   David Moorcroft, former 5,000-meter world record-holder, has
been running the organization since then and is expected to be
named chief executive.
	   Hemery will be a figurehead, working in an honorary capacity
alongside the chief executive.
	   Hemery has been a coach, teacher, manager and writer since
retiring from the sport. He has worked in management training for
the past 10 years.
	   He has an image of integrity, representing the old-fashioned
values of the amateur era.
	   ``What I really care about is honesty and fair play in
athletics,'' he said. ``I want to try to be the conscience of our
sport.''
	   Hemery said he is determined to ensure Britain leads an
international campaign against the use of performance enhancing
drugs.
	   ``I love this sport and when I see an outstanding individual
performance, I may think, `That's awesome, that's fabulous,''' he
said. ``But there's a niggling little question gnawing in the back
of my mind which says, `I wonder if there's any performance
enhancing stuff going on here.' That's a horrible thing to have to
think.''
	   ``In years gone by, people looked at British sport as a model of
fair play,'' Hemery said. ``I think it would be a great pity if we
ignore that tradition which is why I'll be certainly trying to pool
ideas about how we can free the sport from drugs. It has to be an
international approach. I'd like to think everyone is on the same
playing field.''
	   The drug problem worries Hemery even more because his
16-year-old son, Adrian, is a promising decathlete.
	   ``I do not want this to be a sport where a parent has to turn
around to their child and say, `I'm not sure I want you to be in
this sport,''' he said.
	   Emery will also be trying to lure the World Championships, which
have never been held in Britain, to London in 2003. An athletics
track will be installed in a renovated Wembley Stadium as part of
Britain's bid to stage the event.
	   ``It is very important that we host the championships,'' Emery
said. ``It would provide us with a showcase we have not had for a
very long time. The last major event we staged was the Olympics in
1948. That is far too long.''

Police brace for riots on anniversary of student revolt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with clashes, more than 100 arrests, march underway &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More than 100 people were arrested Tuesday
in clashes with police during events marking the 25th anniversary
of a student uprising against military rulers.
	   About 10,000 people took part in a march from the Athens
Polytechnic University, site of the revolt, to the United States
embassy.
	   They were surrounded by more than 5,000 police officers who were
tasked with preventing riots and acts of vandalism from
self-proclaimed anarchist groups seeking confrontations with
police. Every year the commemoration of the 1973 Athens Polytechnic
revolt is marred by such incidents.
	   At least 23 people died and hundreds were wounded in the revolt
when the army stormed the campus on Nov. 17, 1973. The actual death
toll has never been firmly established, but it is thought to be
considerably higher. The revolt is credited with helping bring the
downfall of 1967-74 military rule.
	   This year's anniversary carried additional worries for
authorities. About 200 arson attacks this year have been carried
out by shadowy organizations widely believed to be linked to the
Polytechnic demonstrators.
	   Two cars were firebombed early Tuesday in separate attacks. No
one was hurt.
	   The atmosphere has been further charged by a string of police
scandals and recent government education reforms that have led to
school occupations and teachers' demonstrations.
	   On Monday, Premier Costas Simitis was pelted with eggs and
oranges during a visit to the Polytechnic to lay a wreath at the
memorial.
	   Greece's constitution bans police form entering the grounds of
Athens Polytechnic or other universities except with the permission
of the academic senate.
	   Students and the Communist-led construction workers union
guarded the grounds of the Polytechnic in central Athens.
	   The commemorations for the revolt end each year with a march to
the U.S. embassy to protest Washington's widely perceived support
of the dictatorship.
	   In January, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns issued a public
apology for Washington's role during the junta. ``I wish my own
country had stood more firmly on the side of democracy and freedom
during those years,'' said Burns.
	   Greece's deadliest terrorist group, November 17, takes its name
from the day the student uprising was crushed. Four Americans and
one U.S. Embassy employee have been among the 22 people killed by
the group.

Another round of presidential elections set
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovak Parliament chairman Jozef
Migas set Dec. 3 as the date for another round of presidential
elections, the parliament's press department announced Tuesday.
	   But a new president is unlikely to be elected next month because
the new governing four-party coalition, which enjoys a comfortable
majority in parliament, wants the president to be elected by
popular vote.
	   Slovakia has been without a president since March 2 when Michal
Kovac's term of office expired. Parliament has failed to elect a
president in the last nine months, with the then governing
coalition and the opposition now in power blocking each other in
the chamber.
	   Candidates for the post are to be named by the political parties
by Nov. 23, but it was unclear if anyone would be nominated by
either the governing parties or the opposition. None of the parties
have named any person so far.
	   Under existing law the new government wants changed, the
presidential vote in parliament has to take place every 30 days
until a head of state is elected.
	   The ruling coalition holds 93 seats in the parliament, a
majority sufficient to change Slovakia's constitution.
	   On Monday, the coalition parties submitted a proposal for a
change in the Slovak constitution providing for presidential
elections by direct vote. That is expected to take place next year.

Ukraine's central bank has no plans for hryvna devaluation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's central bank has no plans to
devalue the national hryvna currency despite a growing demand for
U.S. dollars and has not yet considered a change in the key
interest rates, officials said.
	   ``We have no (devaluation) plans. At this point this would not
give us anything and would only create a stupid demand for
dollars,'' the head of the National Bank's currency regulation
department, Serhiy Yaremenko, said in remarks cited Tuesday by the
independent Ukrainian News service.
	   The bank has been struggling since August to limit fallout of
the economic crisis in neighboring Russia on Ukraine's financial
market.
	   The hryvna, which traded at about 2.1 to the dollar before the
crisis, lost more than 50 percent of its value in September in
response to the Russian ruble's fall.
	   That forced the Ukrainian government to widen the currency
trading band it had previously set for this year. The National Bank
imposed restrictions on hard currency purchases, slowing the
hryvna's fall to 0.6 percent in October.
	   The hryvna's rate has remained stable at about 3.43 to the
dollar since mid-October, staying within the government's new band
of 2.5 to 3.5.
	   Separately, National Bank spokesman Dmytro Rikberg told
Ukrainian News that the bank has not considered lowering the main
interest rates.
	   National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko said earlier in the
month that the rates might be lowered because the bank has managed
to restore stability in Ukraine's financial markets.
	   ``Clearly, the economic situation does not allow us to do so,''
Rikberg said.
	   The bank's discount rate of 82 percent has remained unchanged
since July.

Hoechst reports income slump, announces restructuring

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hoechst share price down 4.3 percent, ADDS
Hoechst, Rhone-Poulenc decline to comment on takeover or merger
speculation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German pharmaceutical giant Hoechst on
Tuesday announced a severe sales slump in the first three quarters
_ and a major restructuring that fed speculation it might merge
with France's Rhone-Poulenc.
	   Both companies declined to comment on the speculation, which had
boosted their share prices Monday.
	   Nevertheless, Hoechst chairman Juergen Dormann said, ``there
will be a further consolidation process'' in the pharmaceuticals
industry.
	   Hoechst said it would split into two separate, listed companies
by spring 1999, spinning off its industrial chemicals operations
through a listing of subsidiary Celanese AG in Frankfurt and New
York.
	   Hoechst said the move will allow the parent company to focus on
life sciences _ pharmaceuticals, pesticides and biotechnology.
	   Dormann called it ``the most direct, fastest and most favorable
way to achieve our goal of transforming Hoechst into a leading life
sciences company.''
	   Hoechst's share price tumbled 4.3 percent on Tuesday after it
announced a 17-percent slump in sales in the first nine months of
1998 that it blamed on a turbulent world economy.
	   Recession in Japan, a slowing U.S. economy and financial turmoil
in Russia and South America ``contributed significantly to an
overall decline in our operating business in the third quarter,''
the company said in a statement.
	   Net income _ after taxes and minority interests _ slumped to
just 60 million marks (dlrs 37.5 million,) compared to 446 million
marks (dlrs 278.75 million) in the third quarter of 1997.
	   Sales in the third quarter alone were down 15 percent to 10.2
billion marks (dlrs 6.37 billion,) compared to 12 billion marks
(dlrs 7.5 billion) in the same quarter last year.
	   Operating profits in the third quarter fell by 7 percent to 552
million marks (dlrs 345 million,) compared to 596 million marks
(dlrs 372.5 million) over the period last year.
	   Operating profits for the first three quarters were down 16
percent compared to the year earlier to 2.4 billion marks (dlrs 1.5
billion.)
	   Allowing for a decline in restructuring charges, operating
profit fell 22 percent in the third quarter, the company said.
	   Hoechst also said it had cut its workforce by 12 percent at the
end of the third quarter compared to last year, leaving the company
with 109,977 employees.

 &UR; Muslim leaders will hand over war-crimes suspects in areas they
control
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Authorities in
Muslim-controlled parts of Bosnia said Tuesday they do not expect
the U.N. war crimes tribunal to issue secret indictments for
suspects in their areas.
	   Mirza Harjic, adviser to the Muslim member of the joint Bosnian
presidency, said such a policy was unnecessary because ``we are the
only side that has done everything the Tribunal has ordered.''
	   He said Muslim authorities would continue to turn over war
crimes suspects indicted by the tribunal on demand. Secret
indictments have most frequently been issued for suspects in the
Serb half of Bosnia, where authorities have opposed their
extradition.
	   Hajric spoke a day after the first trial against ex-members of
Muslim led forces during the Bosnian war was concluded in The
Hague, Netherlands, where the tribunal is located. One suspect _ a
Muslim _ was found innocent. Two others and a Bosnian Croat were
found guilty of wartime atrocities against Bosnian Serbs held in a
prison camp.
	   The camp warden, Bosnian Croat Zdravko Mucic, was found guilty
of 11 offenses and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions for
overseeing guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. He was
sentenced to seven years in prison.
	   Deputy Commander Hazim Delic was sentenced to 20 years in prison
for the murder, rape and torture of prisoners. Guard Esad Landzo
was ordered jailed for 15 years for murdering three inmates and
torturing others.
	   But prosecutors failed to make the command responsibility
argument stick to Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim military commander
accused of having overall control of the camp.
	   The judges acquitted him, saying there was not enough evidence
to link him to the atrocities.
	   Although currently there are no former members of the Muslim-led
government forces on the official indictment list of the tribunal,
Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt said on Monday prosecutors were
currently working on more investigations involving Serbs as the
victims of war crimes.
	   Hajric said the Muslim-led authorities in Bosnia arrested and
handed two of the four for trial by the tribunal. The other two
were arrested in Germany and Austria.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three ethnic Albanians accused of
belonging to a rebel organization in Kosovo were convicted Tuesday
and given five-year prison sentences, the state-run Tanjug news
agency reported.
	   A district court in Serbia's Kosovo province handed down the
guilty verdicts to Zef, Pjetr and Hilj Kchiraj, all from Zub
village in Djakovica county, 70 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of
the provincial capital Pristina.
	   The court ruled the three had ``conspired to activities against
the state'' by joining the Kosovo Liberation Army in July.
Subsequently, they crossed into neighboring Albania for the purpose
of procuring arms for the guerrillas, it said.
	   They were arrested while illegally crossing the border back into
Kosovo and smuggled weapons were found in their possession, Tanjug
reported.

Judge orders Pinochet to appear in court if immunity overruled

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A judge ordered Gen. Augusto Pinochet to appear in
court Dec. 2 for extradition proceedings unless he wins a battle
for immunity from arrest, after a lawyer said the former Chilean
dictator is well enough to leave the hospital.
	   Earlier, a magistrate said the former Chilean dictator should
appear Nov. 27 in Bow Street Magistrate's Court, which handles
extraditions.
	   But at a later hearing to alter bail conditions so Pinochet can
be brought to Bow Street, High Court Judge Andrew Collins ordered
that the 82-year-old general appear Dec. 2.
	   The new date coincided with the date by which Britain's Home
Secretary has to decide whether the extradition proceedings,
instigated by Spain, should go ahead.
	   Pinochet, who was arrested here Oct. 16 on allegations of
genocide, torture and kidnapping, remains under police guard in a
London hospital after undergoing back surgery.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of secret police during his 17-year
rule after he ousted Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist, in a
1973 military coup.
	   A five-judge tribunal in the House of Lords, Britain's highest
court, has not yet ruled on Spanish and British prosecutors' appeal
of the High Court ruling awarding Pinochet immunity from
prosecution for any crimes committed as a foreign head of state.
	   If the Lords rule in Pinochet's favor, he could leave the
country immediately and the extradition proceedings would fall
away. The same would happen if Home Secretary Jack Straw blocked
the extradition proceedings.
	   Alun Jones, a lawyer representing prosecutors, said in the
magistrate's court that Pinochet is now fit enough to be discharged
from Grovelands Priory, the north London hospital where he has been
recuperating.
	   Magistrate Graham Parkinson then said he wanted Pinochet to be
brought to the court.
	   ``Some people are more well-known than others,'' the magistrate
said. ``That does not mean the court should treat them in a
different way.''
	   Under Britain's 1989 Extradition Act, people whose extradition
is sought usually have to appear before Bow Street Magistrate's
Court within days.
	   Pinochet, however, was arrested in a hospital bed and granted
bail on condition he remain in the hospital.
	   There was no word on where Pinochet would stay if discharged
from the hospital.
	   On Monday, Britain's attorney general blocked a fresh bid to
have Pinochet tried under British law for torture and
hostage-taking saying there was ``insufficient admissible
evidence.''

Arafat defuses crisis with Israel by disavowing violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israel confirming that negotiations on a
permanent peace agreement are to begin Wednesday, prisoners to be
released in the next few days, Israeli army commander saying first
troop pullback in northern West Bank &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday defused the latest crisis with Israel by disavowing
violence and endorsing negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Arafat's pledge
``positive'' and appeared to interpret it as backing down from
threats to unilaterally establish a Palestinian state in May,
perhaps using force.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu suspended Israel's troop withdrawal from 2
percent of the West Bank, scheduled for later this week, until
Arafat retracted the threats.
	   After reviewing Arafat's latest statements, Netanyahu adviser
David Bar-Illan said the prime minister ``considers this a
retraction.''
	   Netanyahu said his Cabinet would still have to decide Wednesday
whether the Palestinians have lived up to all of their obligations
and whether to approve the upcoming pullback.
	   However, in a sign that the process was back on track, Israel
and the Palestinians decided to resume negotiations on a permanent
peace agreement on Wednesday, after a suspension of 18 months.
	   In the first session, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was
to meet with Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas and the speaker of the
Palestinian legislature, Ahmed Qureia, at Sharon's office.
	   The two sides face a May 4 deadline _ the end of the five-year
period of Palestinian autonomy _ to wrap up agreement on such
deeply contested issues as final borders, the status of Jerusalem
and the fate of the Jewish settlements.
	   It appears unlikely that the deadline can be met, and in the
past, Arafat threatened to declare a state unilaterally if a peace
accord is not in place by then.
	   On Tuesday, Arafat opened a news conference with German
President Roman Herzog in the West Bank town of Jericho by reading
a statement concerning the latest dispute with the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis,'' Arafat said.
	   ``Peace is a Palestinian strategic choice and any differences in
the final status negotiations, we stress that we want them to be
solved by peaceful means through negotiations, and not in any other
way,'' Arafat said.
	   In a speech Sunday to loyalists from his Fatah movement, Arafat
had alluded to the use of force, saying that ``our rifle is ready''
to take Jerusalem.
	   While not specifically dropping the option to declare a state on
May 4, Arafat endorsed permanent status negotiations with Israel.
	   Israel has said it would consider a unilaterally declaration of
statehood by the Palestinians as a grave violation of the peace
accords and has threatened to annex West Bank areas in response.
	   The first troop withdrawal under last month's Wye agreement was
to have been carried out on Monday, but Israel has fallen behind
schedule because of a delays in ratifying the accord and disputes
with the Palestinians.
	   In all, Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by
the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian campaign against
Islamic militants.
	   The U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, said earlier Tuesday he was
confident the latest row would be settled soon. ``Both sides have
obligations and both sides, I think, will fulfill their
obligations,'' Ross told AP.
	   Israel's parliament was expected to give overwhelming approval
to the peace accord Tuesday evening, after a two-day debate.
	   Despite the row, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been
meeting as scheduled. The Israeli minister of public security,
Avigdor Kahalani, said a first group of Palestinian prisoners would
be released in the next few days, as promised. In all, Israel has
pledged to release 750 Palestinians by the end of January.
	   Israel radio said 250 Palestinians would be freed Thursday.
	   In the first pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank are to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction, and
7.1 percent are to go from shared to sole Palestinian control.
	   The armed forces chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said
that in the upcoming stage, most of the land changing hands would
be in the northern West Bank, around the Palestinian town of Jenin.
	   Israel's government has not yet presented withdrawal maps.

The Spiral gets the nod: A unique museum addition for posh London
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A proposed extension of the Victoria and Albert
Museum that sparked an uproar among traditionalists because of its
resemblance to a collapsing deck of cards has been approved by
municipal planners.
	   The planning and conservation committee of the Royal Borough of
Kensington and Chelsea voted Monday night in favor of the 75
million pound (dlrs 125 million) extension, known as The Spiral.
	   The museum, the South Kensington home of the world's decorative
arts, now hopes to open the project in 2004, director Alan Borg
said.
	   ``We are overjoyed,'' Borg said Tuesday. ``We feel it's a really
important day for new architecture in Britain.''
	   Construction funds are being sought in Britain and abroad, since
the design was considered too controversial to receive money from
the National Lottery.
	   The architect, Polish-born American Daniel Libeskind, recently
completed his extension to the Berlin Museum _ in the shape of a
transformed Star of David _ for its history of Jewish life in the
city.
	   ``I am naturally delighted,'' he said of the approval for The
Spiral, a continuous spiral wall wrapped around in 23 planes, with
none of the angles a right angle. The structure will be covered in
ivory-colored ceramic tiles.
	   The project, with four floors below ground and seven above, will
fill a gap between two of the museum's Victorian buildings.
	   There is nothing like it anywhere in Britain, and very little
like it in the world.
	   Carol Seymour-Newton, secretary of the Knightsbridge
Association, which covers area business and residents, called the
project the ``wrong development in the wrong place'' and a
``classic example of architectural bad manners.''
	   But the project is backed by English Heritage, which cares for
historic buildings and monuments. The Royal Fine Arts Commission
called it ``daring and innovative.''
	   The Victoria and Albert Museum, popularly known as the V and A,
gets 1 million visitors a year. It was founded in 1852 to support
and encourage excellence in art and design.

Six-month border conflict adversely affects Eritrean development
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JULIA STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ In just seven years, Eritreans built a
solid economy from the wreckage of three decades of a war for
independence, but donors are worried a six-month border conflict
with neighboring Ethiopia may ruin development plans.
	   The government forecast an 11 percent increase in gross national
product through 2000 in an economic policy paper released about two
weeks ago but drawn up two months before fighting erupted in May.
	   ``Our economy was indeed poised to take off, and we are
determined to maintain that momentum. We strongly believe that the
conflict with Ethiopia is only a temporary distraction,'' President
Isaias Afwerki said.
	   The government's economic plan said areas for potential
development included mineral and petroleum resources, agriculture
and fisheries.
	   But Danish diplomat Peter Truelsen said at a donors' meeting in
early November that there was ``an overriding assumption that this
type of policy framework can't work in a war scenario.''
	   Woldai Futur, an economist on leave from the World Bank to
advise the government, said the conflict has adversely affected
manufacturing because many workers have been mobilized.
	   He estimated that before the conflict, about one-third of the
military budget had been going toward development projects.
	   ``But if war breaks out, it will be totally different and
production will be given up,'' he said.
	   The latest round of peace talks ended Nov. 7 with no
breakthrough. Eritrea and Ethiopia did not meet directly. And
another stab a week later at shuttle diplomacy by U.S. envoy
Anthony Lake appeared to fare no better.
	   The simmering border war involving at least 200,000 Eritrean and
Ethiopian troops has left Eritrea desperate for foreign currency
because of heavy spending on weapons and a loss of Ethiopian
business at its Red Sea ports of Assab and Massawa.
	   Eritrea and Ethiopia have imported tens of millions of dollars
worth of weapons from abroad since the conflict began in May,
according to the Washington-based Africa Policy Information Center.
	   Before the contested border was closed with landlocked Ethiopia,
Eritrea's much larger southern neighbor, 70 percent of Ethiopian
imports passed through Assab. Now the port and oil refinery are
nearly at a standstill for lack of business.
	   Ethiopia has shifted its business south to Djibouti on the Gulf
of Aden, an arrangement that may become permanent.
	   Revenue from port fees accounts for about 20 percent of
Eritrea's total annual revenues.
	   In addition, state-owned Ethiopian Airlines canceled all flights
to Eritrea on May 13, and many phone lines later were cut, further
hampering trade.
	   The sole benefit brought by the war to Eritrea's budget is a
rise in crucial remittances from the 500,000 Eritreans living
abroad. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimated that expatriates
remitted dlrs 300 million last year and are being even more
generous this year.
	   Futur put the figure at dlrs 260 million, and said it could rise
to 280 million this year.
	   In March, Eritrea's foreign debt stood at dlrs 75.74 million.
The Finance Ministry expected the total deficit to rise to about
dlrs 96 million this year.
	   Last year, Eritrea's GDP was dlrs 676 million, double the figure
at de facto independence in 1991. Isaias said real GDP growth from
1992-97 was about 7 percent a year.
	   Eritrea fought a 30-year war with Ethiopia. Independence was
formally proclaimed in 1993.
	   Last year, the government introduced its own currency, the
nakfa. The rate has held fairly steady, rising from 7.28 nakfa to
the dollar last November to 7.5 nakfa now. The introduction of the
nakfa to replace the Ethiopian birr was one factor that exacerbated
tensions between the two countries.
	   The World Bank has promised to triple loans to the nation of 3.5
million to dlrs 220 million over the next three years.
	   ``Eritrea is among the best performing ... borrowers, not just
in Africa but worldwide,'' said Oey Astra Meesok, World Bank
director in Eritrea.

Supreme Court rejects Pollard's bid to block prisoner release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Supreme Court rejected an appeal
Tuesday to prevent Israel from releasing Palestinian prisoners
until an American who spied for the Jewish state is released as
well.
	   The appeal was submitted Monday on behalf of Jonathan Pollard,
who is serving a life sentence in a federal prison in North
Carolina. Pollard was arrested outside the Israeli Embassy in
Washington in 1985 and convicted of turning over secret documents
to Israel while serving as a naval intelligence officer.
	   His case was highlighted recently when Israel tried to hinge its
agreement to a U.S.-brokered peace accord with the Palestinians on
Pollard's release. President Clinton said he would review Pollard's
case.
	   Pollard's wife Esther said Tuesday the court had failed to
recognize a committment she said she was given by the Israeli
government to ensure her husband's release as part of the deal
peace.
	   ``The fact is that we had a clear promise from the prime
minister and the cabinet that not a single terrorist would go free
until Jonathan's release was assured,'' she said.
	   Supreme Court spokesman Moshe Gorali said the court found no
such promise had been made by the government and added that ``the
Supreme Court won't intervene in politics.''
	   Under the peace deal, which was expected to be approved by the
Israeli parliament later Tuesday, Israel is to release about 750
Palestinian prisoners.
	   Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani's spokesman Rafi Levy
said that if the accords were approved as expected, 250 of those
prisoners would be released on Friday.

Russia's Lebed cuts short visit to Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background on Lebed. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russian political leader and provincial
governor Alexander Lebed cut short a visit to Germany on Tuesday,
apparently because of Russia's financial crisis.
	   Lebed, considered a potential candidate to succeed President
Boris Yeltsin, had been scheduled to meet Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer and business executives during a one-day trip to Bonn.
	   He was also supposed to give a speech about the crisis facing
Russia's regions.
	   The Itar-Tass news agency quoted him as saying that his abrupt
departure was prompted by Tuesday's expiration of Russia's 90-day
moratorium on repayment of foreign debts.
	   With business in his area at stake, Lebed said he had to be in
Moscow to represent the interests of the Krasnoyarsk region, where
he is governor.
	   The German Society for Foreign Affairs, which had invited Lebed,
said he left Bonn ``head over heels,'' apparently because of the
region's financial problems.
	   There was no official comment from the foreign ministry.
	   Lebed, a former army general, founded his own political party
last year after a failed bid for the presidency in 1996.
	   He was elected governor of Krasnoyarsk, a vast region in
Siberia, this year in what was widely seen as a preparatory bid for
the 2000 presidential elections.
	   He is credited with negotiating the truce ending the war in
breakaway Chechnya while serving as Russia's national security
chief.

Tough security measures for German-Dutch game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) _ German and Dutch police experts
have stepped up security to quell or head off any anticipated
violence at Wednesday's exhibition soccer match between Germany and
the Netherlands.
	   ``We have to assume that German hooligans will use the match to
make a show of themselves once again,'' said Wilhelm Hennes,
security chief for the German soccer federation (DFB).
	   The games between the two bitter neighboring rivals often
trigger violence between fans. The last time the two teams played
against each other, in April 1996, about 1,000 German neo-Nazi
hooligans ran riot in Rotterdam. Germany won the match 1-0.
	   German and Dutch police officers have been working together for
several months in advance of the match. More than 1,000 police,
including Dutch experts, will provide security around the stadium
and in downtown Gelsenkirchen.
	   The city is less than an hour's drive from the Dutch border and
nearly 10,000 Dutch fans are expected for the match at the stadium
where Schalke plays its Bundesliga games.
	   Prosecutors and judges have set up special courts to deal
rapidly with offenders.
	   ``We've done our homework,'' police spokesman Ulrich Grzella
said.
	   Soccer violence experts from other German cities also have been
drafted into duty. Police will escort fans into the stadium and
separate parking lots have been allocated.
	   Hooligans known to the police have been visited by officers at
home or at work, in both countries.
	   ``We are making it clear to the hooligans that they can't hope
for anonymity,'' said Michael Endler, a spokesman for state police
in Duesseldorf. ``We are taking comprehensive preventive
measures.''
	   Police officers think about 1,000 violence-prone fans from both
sides may come to the match.

IAAF says Morocco-Israel dispute is `closed'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Morocco and Israel have settled their
dispute over Morocco's refusal to grant visas to Israeli runners
for the World Cross Country Championships last March, the IAAF said
Tuesday.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation said the case was
``declared closed'' after an agreement was signed Monday by
administrators of the Royal Moroccan Athletics Federation, the
Israeli Athletics Association and IAAF president Primo Nebiolo.
	   Israeli runners were stranded in Paris when Morocco refused to
grant them visas for the March 21-22 championships in Marrakech.
	   In June, the IAAF ordered Morocco to pay financial compensation
to the Israelis, barred Morocco from bidding for the 1999 IAAF
Grand Prix Final and said the country could be ineligible to hold
any IAAF events in the future.
	   Monday's agreement described the denial of the visas as
``reasons beyond the control of the organizing committee.''
	   All parties pledged to abide by IAAF rules stating that all
athletes must be allowed to compete regardless of race, religion,
ideology or nationality.
	   The statement upheld the decision to force Morocco to reimburse
Israel, a figure which an IAAF spokesman estimated at between dlrs
10,000 and dlrs 15,000.
	   The spokesman, Giorgio Reineri, said the IAAF Council is now
expected to drop all other sanctions against Morocco, meaning the
country can bid to stage other events in the future.

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ While the NBA lockout continues,
Portland Trailblazers center Arvydas Sabonis will join the
Lithuanian national team, the Baltic News Service reported Tuesday.
	   Lithuanian Basketball Federation president Algimantas Pavilionis
told BNS that if the NBA lockout ends, Sabonis would immediately

Former Nazi moved to military prison from house arrest after
</HEADLINE>
conviction upheld &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A day after his life sentence for a wartime massacre
was upheld by Italy's highest appeals court, former Nazi Erich
Priebke Tuesday was transferred to a military prison in Rome.
	   Priebke, 86, had been serving his time under house arrest while
his conviction was on appeal. Italian law, however, does not permit
the serving of a life sentence under house arrest once all appeals
have been exhausted.
	   Paramilitary police went to Priebke's Rome apartment on Tuesday
and took him to the Forte Boccea military prison.
	   One of Priebke's lawyers, Giosue Bruno Naso, said the defense
has asked for a suspension of the sentence because of Priebke's
poor health. A panel of expert will evaluate the request.
	   The court also upheld the life sentence of Priebke's
codefendant, former SS Maj. Karl Haas, 87.
	   A military court convicted them in March for their roles in the
1944 massacre of 335 people at the Ardeatine Caves on the outskirts
of Rome during the German occupation of the capital. The massacre
was retaliation for a bombing by Italian resistance fighters that
killed 33 German soldiers.
	   Both men said in their trial that they were following orders
from Adolf Hitler and had no other choice.

New German coalition in furor over immigration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new center-left government won
unusual praise from conservatives Tuesday for a tough stand on
immigration that one critic said would hearten anti-foreigner
extremists.
	   Interior Minister Otto Schily, a Social Democrat, has angered
liberals in the new center-left government by declaring last
weekend that immigration to Germany was ``over the limit'' and
needed to be curbed.
	   The Greens, junior partner in Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
ruling coalition, criticized Schily on Tuesday. A party leader,
Rezzo Schlauch, called his comments ``inappropriate.''
	   Murat Cakir, head of a national council on foreigners' affairs,
blasted the remarks as ``very dangerous,'', saying they would
encourage the extreme right.
	   But the interior minister of Bavaria, Germany's most
conservative state, applauded. Schily had been ``remarkably
realistic and hearteningly clear,'' Guenter Beckstein said in an
interview in the Berliner Morgenpost daily.
	   With nearly 4 million Germans out of work, the new government is
as concerned about immigrants adding to the jobless rolls as the
previous center-right administration that was defeated in September
elections.
	   At the same time, Schroeder's government plans to promote
integration of the 7 million foreigners already living in Germany _
about 9 percent of the population _ by easing citizenship laws
based on German blood ties.
	   Schily defended his stance Tuesday. Taking up an argument of the
previous government of Helmut Kohl, he suggested Germany already
bear more than its share of immigration to Europe.
	   ``Germany will remain committed to its humanitarian duties and
will, for example, take in civil war refugees,'' Schily said on ZDF
national television. ``But a fair distribution of the burden in the
European Union is needed.''
	   Germany took in some 350,000 Bosnian refugees during the war in
the Balkans, by far the most of any country. Many ethnic Albanians
fleeing fighting in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province have showed up at
German borders this year.

Arafat defuses crisis with Israel by disavowing violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CHANGES syntax in second Arafat quote to improve translation

 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday defused the latest crisis with Israel by disavowing
violence and endorsing negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Arafat's pledge
``positive'' and appeared to interpret it as backing down from
threats to unilaterally establish a Palestinian state in May,
perhaps using force.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu suspended Israel's troop withdrawal from 2
percent of the West Bank, scheduled for later this week, until
Arafat retracted the threats.
	   After reviewing Arafat's latest statements, Netanyahu adviser
David Bar-Illan said the prime minister ``considers this a
retraction.''
	   Netanyahu said his Cabinet would still have to decide Wednesday
whether the Palestinians have lived up to all of their obligations
and whether to approve the upcoming pullback.
	   However, in a sign that the process was back on track, Israel
and the Palestinians decided to resume negotiations on a permanent
peace agreement on Wednesday, after a suspension of 18 months.
	   In the first session, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was
to meet with Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas and the speaker of the
Palestinian legislature, Ahmed Qureia, at Sharon's office.
	   The two sides face a May 4 deadline _ the end of the five-year
period of Palestinian autonomy _ to wrap up agreement on such
deeply contested issues as final borders, the status of Jerusalem
and the fate of the Jewish settlements.
	   It appears unlikely that the deadline can be met, and in the
past, Arafat threatened to declare a state unilaterally if a peace
accord is not in place by then.
	   On Tuesday, Arafat opened a news conference with German
President Roman Herzog in the West Bank town of Jericho by reading
a statement concerning the latest dispute with the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis,'' Arafat said.
	   ``Peace is a strategic choice of the Palestinians,'' Arafat
said. ``We stress that concerning any differences in final status
negotiations, we want to solve these issues by peaceful means,
through negotiations, and not in any other way.''

Ruling party juniors glorify war crimes suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The youth of Croatia's ruling party are
printing a controversial ``We are with You, Hague 1999'' calendar,
in support of Bosnian war crimes suspects at the Netherlands-based
international court.
	   Orlando Medo, a spokesman of the ruling Croatian Democratic
Union said Tuesday the project is still in the coordination phase,
but the party's monthly newsletter announced it earlier this month.
	   According to the party bulletin, the calendar's cover is
emblazoned with the red-and-white checked Croatian coat of arms and
``We are with You, Hague 1999.'' Inside the calendar portraits of
12 Bosnian Croats indicted by the Hague tribunal are presented, one
for each month, as Croat knights.
	   The editor's note said the calendar was motivated by a desire to
help the families of the accused and gather material funds for
their legal defense.
	   The men are currently awaiting trial for crimes ranging from
crimes against humanity. Whilst the party insists the men are
innocent till proven guilty, the undertaking of the calendar has
drawn criticism from most Croats, who find the project unsavory.
	   Bosnian Croats, abetted by leaders in neighboring Croatia,
fought a bloody war with Bosnian Muslims in 1993-94. Most of the
accused have been allegedly linked to atrocities committed in
central Bosnia, where hundreds of civilians were massacred.
	   Nationalist Croats, however, either deny the crimes or try to
justify the war as one of survival as a minority in central Bosnia.

Griqualand brings West Indies to draw

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Griqualand turning match around; NO PICKUP &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIMBERLEY, South Africa (AP) _ Griqualand West broke a
hundred-year-old record on Tuesday to confound West Indies with a
massive 435 score in their second innings.
	   Play was called off at 4:30 p.m. local time (1430 gmt) after
Griqualand more than doubled the points it needed to force West
Indies to bat a second innings.
	   Griqualand West scored 271 in first innings, while West Indies
held 466.
	   The four-day match ended on Tuesday, part of West Indies' run-up
to a Test series against South Africa that begins Nov. 26.
	   Inspired by a 22-ball 50 by veteran Pat Symcox, tailenders
Finley Brooker and Wendell Bossenger dug in their heels to set a
new Griqua eighth-wicket partnership record of 148.
	   The previous mark of 129 was recorded against Eastern Province
in the early 1890s.
	   Assuming the match would not drag out into the day, Qriqualand's
general manager Brian Kidson reportedly decided not to order lunch
for the players.
	   At the wicket for 28 minutes, the 38-year-old Symcox was
particularly severe on Shivnarine Chanderpaul, carting two overs
from the part-time legspinner for 43 runs.
	   Symcox's performance overshadowed a defiant sixth-wicket
partnership of 94 between overnight pairing Piet Barnard and
Brooker, which made it all possible.
	   Barnard batted for 192 minutes for his 76 and together with
Brooker had taken his side to within two runs of avoiding an
innings defeat.

Turin team worried with political tensions prior to Champions
</HEADLINE>
League game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Italian league champion Juventus of Turin,
worried by growing political tension between Italy and Turkey, will
demand tightened security for next week's decisive Champions League
match against the Turkish side Galatasaray.
	   Relations between Italy and Turkey are because of the arrest of
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan in Rome.
	   Turkey has asked for his extradition, but Italy appears unlikely
to grant the request because Ocalan faces a death sentence in
Turkey. There have been several demonstrations in Turkey pressing
Italy to extradite.
	   ``We will ask through UEFA (Europe's soccer governing body) that
security be tightened in case the current political crisis between
the two countries gets worse,'' a spokesman for the Turin club said
Tuesday.
	   ``We can't expect that the match to be played on a neutral
ground,'' Juventus president Vittorio Chiusano told Italian media.
``But we can try to obtain guarantees in terms of public order.''
	   The Group B match between Juventus and the Turkish team is
scheduled in Istanbul next Wednesday.
	   Galatasary enters the game as group leader, with seven points in
four games, and could land a decisive blow to Juventus' qualifying
hopes.
	   The Turin team, a three-time finalist in the last three editions
of the European competition, has four points and only two rotation
games still to play in the four-team group.
	   In addition to security worries, Juventus will have to do
without its star-forward Alessandro Del Piero, sidelined with a
torn left knee ligament for the remainder of the season.
	   Meanwhile Italy's largest sports daily Gazzatta dello Sport
reported Tuesday that Turkish police set up special security
measures for Italy's women's basketball team of Priolo which plays
a Coppa Ronchetti game against Botasspor in Adana, in south-east
Turkey, Wednesday.

Security agent accuses his bosses of plotting to kill Berezovsky
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian intelligence agent on Tuesday accused
his bosses of ordering kidnappings, extortion and contract murders,
including a plot to kill controversial business mogul Boris
Berezovsky.
	   Lt. Col. Alexander Litvinenko of the Federal Security Service,
the main successor to the Soviet KGB, reported to President Boris
Yeltsin's office this spring that his commanding officer had
ordered him to kill Berezovsky.
	   On Tuesday, Litvinenko said one of his employers publicly
rebuked him later for bringing the matter into the open.
	   ``A deputy head of the department told me: You prevented
patriots from killing a Jew who has robbed half of the nation,''
Litvinenko said. He referred to his boss only by his last name,
Yenin.
	   Berezovsky is a billionaire whose vast business interests range
from oil to cars to media holdings, and who has close Kremlin ties.
His Jewish roots have made him a favorite target for Russian
anti-Semites.
	   When Litvinenko first brought the charges in the spring, the
chief prosecutor's office started a inviestigation, then suspended
it for lack of evidence.
	   The officer who allegedly gave the order to kill Berezovsky,
Alexander Kamyshnikov, deputy head of the Federal Security
Service's department for organized crime, has denied the claims.
	   Last week, Berezovsky drew attention to the probe in an open
letter to Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federal Security Service,
known as the FSB.
	   In his letter, published by the daily Kommersant, Berezovsky
claimed many top FSB officers share a Communist ideology and dream
of undoing democratic reforms and restoring the repressive security
system of the Soviet times.
	   Putin, a former Yeltsin aide who served as a KGB spy in Germany
during Soviet times, defended the service and dismissed
Berezovsky's allegations.
	   If the probe reveals evidence that FSB officers were plotting to
kill Berezovsky, they will face trial, but if the claims prove
false, the FSB will sue all perpetrators for libel, Putin said in a
letter carried by the Interfax news agency.
	   Litvinenko insisted Tuesday that many senior FSB officers were
violating the law on undercover activities.
	   ``Unfortunately, the order to kill Berezovsky wasn't something
extraordinary for today's FSB,'' he told a news conference.
	   ``We hope the FSB will find the courage to get rid of those
officials who have come to occupy senior positions in the service
and ... are giving illegal orders to commit acts of terrorism,
killings, hostage-takings and extortion.''
	   Several other officers supported Litvinenko's account and
attended the news conference Tuesday. One wore a ski mask and the
others, except Litvinenko, wore sunglasses.
	   Berezovsky was injured in 1994 when a bomb explosion destroyed
his armored Mercedes sedan and killed his driver. The case has
never been solved. Litvinenko was among those who conducted that
probe, Russian media said.
	   Berezovsky is also executive secretary of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, a loose alliance of 12 ex-Soviet republics.

Court bans Le Pen banned from politics for a year

to appeal set for Monday

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ A French appeals court Tuesday upheld
an assault conviction of far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen,
banning him from politics for a year.
	   The ruling means Le Pen, 70, cannot hold office, run for office
or vote for a year unless he launches a final, successful appeal.
If not, he will be ineligible for the June 1999 European Parliament
elections. He has said his wife, Jany, would run in his place.
	   The court rejected Le Pen's appeal against an April conviction
for assaulting a Socialist politician, but reduced the punishment
from a two-year ban to one year.
	   It also upheld a three-month suspended sentence, and ordered him
to pay a reduced fine of 5,000 francs (about dlrs 900). He
originally had been fined 20,000 francs (dlrs 3,333).
	   Le Pen did not attend the hearing. Speaking to reporters in
Strasbourg, he called the ruling ``slimy.''
	   ``This ruling is contrary to fact, law and justice,'' he said.
``It's a matter of excluding Jean-Marie Le Pen, who is supported by
several million voters, from electoral competition.''
	   He said he will meet with the party's executive branch Monday to
decide whether to launch a final appeal in the Court of Cassation,
France's highest court.
	   Le Pen was convicted of assaulting Annette Peulvast-Bergeal, a
Socialist opponent of his daughter in the race for parliament, at a
1997 election rally in the town of Mantes-La-Jolie, west of Paris.
	   Television footage showed Le Pen shoving Ms. Peulvast-Bergeal in
the chest during a scuffle with protesters. Le Pen denies he
attacked her.
	   Peulvast-Bergeal said she was ``satisfied'' by Tuesday's ruling.
	   ``Le Pen remains condemned and this condemnation brings him to a
halt,'' she said.
	   The National Front called Tuesday's ruling ``a political
decision, not a judicial decision.''
	   The National Front consistently has won about 15 percent of the
vote in national elections. It blames immigrants, particularly from
North Africa, for high unemployment and urban violence. It has been
widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   In an interview published Tuesday in the daily Le Parisien, Le
Pen seemed undaunted by the prospect of a ban.
	   Le Pen holds a seat in the European Parliament and is a regional
counselor in the Provence-Alpes-Cotes d'Azur region of southern
France.
	   Last month, the European Parliament voted to lift his
parliamentary immunity so German prosecutors can investigate
whether he broke laws that make trivializing the Holocaust a crime.
	   The charges came from comments he has made several times, saying
the Nazi gas chambers were a ``detail'' of history.

Arafat disavows violence, drawing praise from Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Israel saying negotiations on
permanent peace agreement to begin Wednesday, prisoners to be
released in next few days, Israeli army commander says first troop
pullback to be in northern West Bank. No Pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday defused the latest crisis with Israel by disavowing
violence and endorsing negotiations to achieve a permanent peace
agreement.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Arafat's pledge
``positive'' and appeared to interpret it as backing down from
threats to unilaterally establish a Palestinian state in May,
perhaps using force.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu suspended Israel's troop withdrawal from 2
percent of the West Bank, scheduled for later this week, until
Arafat retracted the threats.
	   After reviewing Arafat's latest statements, Netanyahu adviser
David Bar-Illan said the prime minister ``considers this a
retraction.''
	   Netanyahu said Israel's Cabinet would still have to decide
Wednesday whether the Palestinians have lived up to their
obligations and whether to give the go-ahead for the pullback.
	   However, in a sign the process was back on track, Israel and the
Palestinians decided to resume negotiations on a permanent peace
agreement on Wednesday, after an 18-month suspension.
	   In the first session, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was
to meet with Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas and the speaker of the
Palestinian legislature, Ahmed Qureia, at Sharon's office.
	   The two sides face a May 4 deadline _ the end of the five-year
period of Palestinian autonomy _ to wrap up an agreement on such
deeply contested issues as final borders, the status of Jerusalem
and the fate of the Jewish settlements.
	   It appears unlikely the deadline can be met, and in the past,
Arafat has threatened to unilaterally declare a state if a peace
accord is not in place by then.
	   On Tuesday, Arafat opened a news conference in the West Bank
town of Jericho by reading a statement concerning the dispute.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis,'' Arafat said.
	   ``Peace is a strategic choice of the Palestinians,'' Arafat
said, speaking in Arabic. ``We stress that concerning any
differences in final status negotiations, we want to solve these
issues by peaceful means, through negotiations, and not in any
other way.''
	   In a speech Sunday to loyalists from his Fatah movement, Arafat
had alluded to the use of force, saying that ``our rifle is ready''
to take Jerusalem.
	   While not specifically dropping the option to declare a state in
May, Arafat on Tuesday endorsed permanent status negotiations with
Israel and disavowed violence.
	   Israel has said it would consider any unilateral declaration of
statehood by the Palestinians a grave violation of the peace
accords and has threatened to annex West Bank areas in response.
	   The first troop withdrawal under last month's peace agreement
was to have occurred Monday, but Israel has fallen behind schedule
because of delays in ratifying the accord and disputes with the
Palestinians.
	   In all, Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by
the end of January, in exchange for Palestinian security measures
against Islamic militants.
	   The U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, said Tuesday he was
confident the latest row would be settled soon. ``Both sides have
obligations and both sides, I think, will fulfill their
obligations,'' Ross said.
	   Israel's parliament was expected to give overwhelming approval
to the peace accord this evening, after a two-day debate.
	   Despite the dispute, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have
been meeting as scheduled. The Israeli minister of public security,
Avigdor Kahalani, said a first group of Palestinian prisoners would
be released in the next few days, as promised. In all, Israel has
pledged to release 750 Palestinians by the end of January.
	   Israel radio said 250 Palestinians would be freed Thursday.
	   In the first pullback, 2 percent of the West Bank is to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction, and
7.1 percent is to go from shared to sole Palestinian control.
	   The armed forces chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said
most of the land changing hands in the first pullback would be in
the northern West Bank, around the Palestinian town of Jenin.
	   Israel's government has not yet presented withdrawal maps.

Parkinson's disease drug suspended in EU, Roche says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche said
Tuesday it has suspended the use of its anti-Parkinson's disease
drug Tasmar in the European Union and will issue a revised label
restricting its use in the United States.
	   ``Evolving safety information has led Roche to revise the
recommendations to physicians on the appropriate use of the drug,''
the company said in a statement.
	   The European Commission has asked member states to suspend the
use of Tasmar from Tuesday. First launched in August 1997, it is
available in 38 countries.
	   On Monday, the U.S. government warned the drug may cause fatal
liver damage and should be reserved for severe cases unhelped by
other therapies.
	   The Food and Drug Administration approved Tasmar in January. But
after learning of three deaths from severe liver damage, it ordered
Roche to put the government's strongest warning on the drug's
label.
	   Patients taking Tasmar should consult physicians and shouldn't
precipitately stop treatment, since inappropriate change in therapy
might trigger serious harm, Roche said.
	   The company said that for a restricted number of patients the
addition of Tasmar to standard therapy is providing a ``clinically
significant benefit that outweighs the risk.''
	   Roche last month confirmed it had sent an advisory letter to
doctors asking them to report any liver troubles in patients taking
Tasmar.
	   About 60,000 people worldwide have taken Tasmar, including up to
30,000 Americans.

German government to hold first session in Berlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new government will hold its
first Cabinet meeting in Berlin, the prewar capital, next week, a
spokeswoman said Tuesday.
	   It was a sign that Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's first chancellor
without personal experience of World War II, intends to hasten the
government's planned return to Berlin despite new reports of
building delays and cost overruns.
	   Government ministers will meet next Tuesday in a central Berlin
building once used by communist East German rulers that is serving
as Schroeder's interim office in Berlin, government spokeswoman
Charima Reinhardt said.
	   Schroeder, who is chairing the session, will be in the capital
to meet governors of eastern German states.
	   Plans for the 20 billion mark (dlrs 12 billion) move of the
capital from Bonn call for parliament to meet in Berlin starting
next fall, marking the start of the ``Berlin Republic.''
	   A government review of the move reportedly has determined that
most construction of government offices had fallen behind. But the
government said Monday it will keep to the schedule.
	   Schroeder, 54, unseated longtime chancellor Helmut Kohl in
September elections.

Yugos, Albanians at home again; Del Piero, Owen, Bergkamp missing
</HEADLINE>
through injury &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Yugoslavia and Albania are glad to be playing at
home again. Alessandro Del Piero, Michael Owen and Dennis Bergkamp
are unhappy they're not playing at all.
	   Wednesday is Europe's final big night of international soccer
for 1998, with Yugoslavia and Albania playing on home soil again
after months of political strife and postponements.
	   With security problems finally out of the way, Yugoslavia and
Albania have been given the go-ahead to play their Euro 2000
qualifying games against Ireland and Greece in Belgrade and Tirana.
	   Other qualifying games Wednesday are: Northern Ireland vs.
Moldova, Malta vs. Macedonia and San Marino vs. Cyprus.
	   But the most eye-catching games of the night are friendlies _
Italy vs. Spain, Germany vs. the Netherlands, England vs. the Czech
Republic and Brazil vs. Russia.
	   Some of the big names are out with injuries, though, including
Del Piero, Owen, Bergkamp, Alan Shearer, Edgar Davids and Ronald de
Boer.
	   The threat of NATO air strikes on military targets in Yugoslavia
over the conflict in Kosovo forced UEFA to postpone the national
team's Oct. 10 Group 8 game against the Irish in Belgrade. When
tensions eased, the game was given the go-ahead for Wednesday.
	   The Yugoslavs are playing their first qualifying game of the
competition, while the Irish already have a maximum six points from
victories over Croatia and Malta. In the same group, Macedonia is
strongly favored to win at point-less Malta.
	   Due to civil unrest, Albania has not played a home game since
November of 1996. The Greek team preparing for Wednesday's Group 2
game at Tirana's Qemal Stafa had a police escort during its
training session.
	   With only one point from two away games, the Albanians are last
in the group. The Greeks bid to replace Latvia as group leader by
winning in Tirana.
	   A 5-0 Northern Ireland victory over Moldova would lift Lawrie
McMenemy's team from fourth to top of Group 3 because Finland,
Turkey and Germany aren't involved in qualifying games.
	   San Marino has little hope of its first ever European
Championship victory when it hosts a Cypriot team that downed
favored Spain 3-2 in Group 6.
	   Although no Euro 2000 points are at stake, the games at
Gelsenkirchen, Salerno and Wembley are valuable in terms of
prestige.
	   The Germans, Dutch, Italians and Spaniards have relatively new
coaches, while England's Glenn Hoddle has been under fire after
some poor Euro 2000 performances.
	   German coach Erich Ribbeck has recalled 37-year-old Lothar
Matthaeus to the position of libero and 31-year-old Andreas Moeller
to midfield. Christian Woerns, who completed a two-game suspension
after his World Cup expulsion against Croatia, is back in defense.
	   Matthaeus, who made his international debut against the Dutch in
1980, believes he still has a role to play in the national team.
	   ``I hope I can show the fans that the so-called `old man' can
still do his job,'' he said.
	   Frank Rijkaard, who took over as Dutch coach after the World
Cup, is unable to call up injured stars Bergkamp, Davids, Aron
Winter and Ronald de Boer. PSV Eindhoven striker Ruud van
Nistelrooy and midfielder Dries Boussatta of AZ Alkmaar will make
their debuts.
	   The game in Gelsenkirchen will go ahead amid strong security
because Germany-Netherlands games often attract serious fan
violence.
	   Coincidentally, Italy's game against Spain is taking place at
the same stadium where a match official was hit by a home-made bomb
thrown by a fan during the UEFA Cup game between Fiorentina and
Grasshoppers of Zurich two weeks ago. UEFA kicked Fiorentina out of
the competition and awarded the game to Grasshoppers.
	   Italian coach Dino Zoff likely will field Francesco Totti and
Filippo Inzaghi together for the first time in attack because
injuries have robbed him of Del Piero, Pierluigi Casiraghi and
Nicola Ventola.
	   ``We have many good players so we can do without those who are
injured,'' said Zoff, who replaced Cesare Maldini after Italy's
World Cup flop.
	   Spanish coach Jose Antonio Camacho has broken with tradition and
chosen only one player each from powerhouses Real Madrid (striker
Raul Gonzalez) and Barcelona (defender Sergi Barjuan).
	   Along with Valencia goalkeeper Santiago Canizares, they were the
only players on Spain's World Cup squad in France.
	   With Shearer, Owen and Paul Scholes all ruled out through
injury, England coach Hoddle may have to call on an aging
strikeforce of 34-year-old Ian Wright and 31-year-old Dion Dublin
against the Czechs at Wembley.
	   Hoddle badly needs a good performance and result against the
Czechs after a dismal run. After losing to Sweden, the English were
held 0-0 at home by Bulgaria and looked far from convincing in a
3-0 victory over Luxembourg.
	   The Czechs will be without AS Roma midfielder Pavel Nedved, who
is suffering from a knee injury. But the squad contains seven of
the team who played in the Euro '96 final against Germany at
Wembley.
	   In other exhibition games Wednesday, Egypt hosts Norway, and
Belgium welcomes neighbor Luxembourg.

Long-lost Rimbaud manuscript fetches disappointing dlrs 517,000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - A six-page, hand-scrawled rough draft of Arthur
Rimbaud's masterpiece ``A Season in Hell'' was sold Tuesday to
France's National Library for 2.9 million francs (dlrs 517,000),
about half of its presale estimate.
	   The state-run library which opened to the public in 1996
exercized its right of preemption and obtained the manuscript for
the amount of the final bid.
	   All state-run institutions in France have the right to preempt
art and other valuables for its collections.
	   The sale at the Drouot-Montaigne auction house fetched a total
of 12 million francs (dlrs 2.1 million). The sale included 10
autographed poems by Rimbaud and two letters by Lautreamont, a 19th
century novelist.
	   Smudged, yellowed with age, and filled with corrections, the
notebook-size pages give a rare glimpse into the creative genius of
the precocious writer who renounced poetry at 19 to travel the
world.
	   ``Une Saison en Enfer'' (A Season in Hell), a prose poem dating
from 1873, has long been a cult work among Rimbaud admirers. It
expresses his passion for the writer Paul Verlaine, his lover with
whom he would eventually quarrel, as well as his religious and
aesthetic convictions.
	   The manuscript, which experts thought had been destroyed long
ago, belonged to a 97-year-old bibliophile who claimed he had never
shown it in public.
	   Jacques Guerin, one of France's foremost collectors, said he
first stumbled on the Rimbaud manuscript in London in 1938, but
couldn't afford to buy it.
	   He finally tracked it down in 1950 and never let it out of his
sight.
	   In March, the library shelled out 3 million francs (dlrs
535,000) for the manuscript of Rimbaud's ``La Lettre du Voyant''
(The Letter of the Clairvoyant).

 &UR; U.S. envoy meets Kosovo guerrillas
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with more detail from the meeting,
background. Trims and recasts. Changes dateline and byline.
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Struggling to find a peace formula
backed by all Kosovo factions, a special American envoy discussed a
plan Tuesday with ethnic Albanian guerrillas whose support is
crucial for the future of any deal on the province.
	   Christopher Hill's second meeting with the rebels this month
came as a top ethnic Albanian politician involved in U.S.-mediated
talks with the Serbian government for the first time suggested that
his side could settle for less than independence for Kosovo.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the Albanian negotiating team, told The
Associated Press his team had proposed a solution that envisaged
the Albanian-majority Serbian province remaining part of Yugoslavia
with a status equal to that of the republics of Serbia and
Montenegro.
	   ``A period of three to five years would be enough to see whether
such a union could function,'' said Agani, a top aide to the
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. ``If it could, we would want to
stay in it. If not, I don't see why we would stay.''
	   Agani called for a referendum to decide on the final status of
Kosovo at the end of the three-to-five-year period.
	   He said the offer was ``a compromise solution'' but acknowledged
it had already been rejected by the Serbian government, an
illustration of how hard it is to bring the two sides together on
the future of Kosovo.
	   Serbia insists Kosovo must remain within its borders while most
of the majority ethnic Albanians want secession. The Albanians
themselves are divided over how tough their policies should be.
	   Authorities have previously ruled out Yugoslav republic status
for Kosovo, which is basically what Agani appeared to be
suggesting.
	   Hill, who has drafted a peace plan for Kosovo, met the
representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army for two hours in
ethnic Albanian village of Dragobilje, about 50 kilometers (30
miles) southwest of Pristina. The talks were held in a house in the
village, with KLA fighters providing security.
	   Hill made no comment, but Jakup Krasniqi, a KLA official who
attended the talks, said the guerrillas voiced their complaints
about the plan and would send their final response in a written
form within 10 days.
	   The rebels' backing of any agreement for Kosovo is crucial. But
the KLA, which fought Serb forces for months, has in the past ruled
out any deal that falls short of independence. They have also
criticized Rugova for his readiness to compromise.
	   Adem Demaci, a guerrilla spokesman, said the KLA would have the
final say on any deal.
	   ``Rugova can sign anything, but there could be no deal without
KLA consent,'' Demaci told reporters in Pristina.
	   Meanwhile Serbian president Milan Milutinovic pressed ahead with
a plan to hold direct talks with ethnic Albanian politicians,
despite their refusal to appear at the meeting.
	   Serbian government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Milutinovic will travel to Kosovo's capital, Pristina, on
Wednesday. The Serb authorities are apparently hoping the gesture
will demonstrate sincerity on their part and ethnic Albanian
obstructionism.
	   Agani called Milutinovic's invitation for talks ``an act of
propaganda.'' He said basic political conditions for direct
negotiations have not yet been met, adding such a meeting could
only come after a basic formula had been agreed.
	   The ethnic Albanians refuse to talk without U.S. and European
mediation, saying only foreign countries could guarantee that an
eventual agreement would be implemented by the Serbian government.
	   They have turned down 16 Serb invitations in the past six
months.
	   The Serbian government says the troubles in Kosovo, where
hundreds of people have died and tens of thousands were left
homeless in the authorities' crackdown against secessionists, are
Serbia's internal matter and should not involve foreign mediators.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The world's newest automaker, DaimlerChrysler
AG, officially became a member of the global business community
Tuesday when its shares began trading in Europe and the United
States.
	   A balcony overlooking the main trading floor of the New York
Stock Exchange was decorated for the day with the red grille of a
Jeep Cherokee and a silver grille of a Mercedes-Benz E-class.
	   Horns honked and the headlights flashed just before co-chairmen
Robert J. Eaton of the former Chrysler Corp. and Juergen Schrempp
of the former Daimler-Benz AG rang the bell to open the day's
trading on the NYSE.
	   DaimlerChrysler shares, trading under the symbol DCX, were down
dlrs 1.50 at dlrs 82.81 1/4 in late morning trading. On the
Frankfurt, Germany, exchange, DaimlerChrysler shares edged up on
their first official day of trading.
	   Celebrations were planned at DaimlerChrysler plants and offices
worldwide.
	   But when the ``Day One'' hoopla is over, ``Job One'' will
remain: the daunting task of truly melding the corporate cultures
of two distinctly different German and American corporations into
one international transportation powerhouse.
	   ``From the very beginning, that has been their major
challenge,'' said David Cole, director of the University of
Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. ``How
do you bring them together and get them to function on the same
team?
	   ``I think it's doable, but it's going to be very challenging.''
	   DaimlerChrysler executives insist a new culture will emerge in
the months ahead, one that they hope will blend the entrepreneurial
spirit and creativity of Chrysler. with the topflight engineering
and focus on quality that built Daimler.
	   But some in the industry wonder how open Daimler's methodical,
top-down culture will be to the looser team approach that is
credited with turning Chrysler into the most profitable U.S.
automaker just a few years after it flirted with bankruptcy.
	   Robert Lutz, who retired as Chrysler's vice chairman in June
after playing a key role in the company's turnaround, said the
supposed culture clash has been overstated.
	   ``Anytime you blend two large organizations, even if they're the
same nationality, you will have some problems,'' he said Monday.
	   The merger's architects, Eaton and Schrempp, have portrayed the
creation of the new German company as a marriage of equals. While
DaimlerChrysler will be incorporated in Germany, it will have dual
headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, and Auburn Hills, Michigan. Its
leadership will be divided almost equally between Germans and
Americans.
	   Still, turf battles are inevitable in any such marriage. How
many former Chrysler executives, rich with Chrysler stock options
that can now be cashed in because of the merger, will opt to retire
early or go elsewhere if they feel underutilized or slighted?
	   DaimlerChrysler executives acknowledge the merger won't be easy.
Their own study of transnational mergers suggests that 70 percent
failed to achieve the kind of success that was anticipated. And
there is no precedent for a German-American merger on this scale.
	   ``We're breaking new ground here,'' said Thomas T. Stallkamp,
president of DaimlerChrysler Corp., the U.S. arm. ``There is no
model for this. That's both good and somewhat frustrating.''
	   DaimlerChrysler has set a goal of cutting dlrs 1.5 billion in
costs in the new company's first year.That savings is expected to
come in large part from combining procurement, logistics and
overhead.
	   There's little overlap of products and markets, and management
has decided not to blend product lines for fear of diluting the
brands (you won't find Mercedes-Benz cars in Plymouth showrooms,
for example). That means there is less opportunity for savings than
there might be with two companies that have more redundant vehicles
and operations.
	   But the stock transaction, valued at dlrs 32.8 billion based on
the companies' share prices when the deal closed, has been embraced
by industry analysts precisely because there's so little overlap.
Gary Lapidus of Sanford C. Bernstein and Co. says the companies
complement each other.
	   ``The halo of the Mercedes brand and Daimler's engineering
capability will help Chrysler improve its tarnished reputation on
quality,'' he wrote in a recent report to investors. ``Chrysler's
lean management and unique business processes can help
Mercedes-Benz re-engineer its way to a more competitive cost
structure.''
	   Most analysts expect DaimlerChrysler to trigger a wave of more
mergers as the industry continues to consolidate.
	   Michael Robinet of CSM Forecasting Inc., an industry consulting
firm, said Peugeot and Renault of France ``are ripe for some sort
of joint venture or merger,'' and Japan's financially weak Nissan
and Mitsubishi may be forced to find a stronger partner.
	   If their merger's successful, DaimlerChrysler may try to gain a
bigger presence in Asia, Robinet said. ``This merger begs another
merger. Two to three years down the road it will set the stage for
DaimlerChrysler to merge with a Japanese partner.''
	   Lapidus predicts the current 25 major automakers eventually will
consolidate down to eight to 12 global companies. Without their
merger, neither Daimler-Benz nor Chrysler would have survived as
independent automakers, he says.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian negotiator in
Kosovo suggested Tuesday for the first time that his side might
settle for less than independence for the Serbian province.
	   But the comments by Fehmi Agani, the head of the Albanian
negotiating team, do not necessarily mean all Kosovo Albanian
factions are ready to compromise and accept some form of autonomy.
	   Ethnic Albanian guerrillas, who met the top U.S. envoy for
Kosovo on Tuesday, have not indicated they would accept anything
less than the independence they have been fighting for.
	   Agani told The Associated Press his side had proposed giving the
province the same status as Yugoslavia's two republics _ Serbia and
Montenegro.
	   ``A period of three to five years would be enough to see whether
such a union could function,'' said Agani, who normally expresses
views of moderate Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. ``If it
could, we would want to stay in it. If not I don't see why we would
stay.''
	   Agani's comments were the first time an ethnic Albanian leader
has openly accepted the idea of autonomy, though even he indicated
peaceful coexistence probably wasn't possible.
	   Agani confirmed Tuesday that his delegation would not attend
direct talks called for by Serbian President Milan Milutinovic.
	   The ethnic Albanians refuse to talk without U.S. and European
mediation, saying only foreign countries could guarantee that an
eventual agreement would be implemented by the Serbian government.
	   The Serbian government says the troubles in Kosovo, where
hundreds of people have died and tens of thousands were left
homeless in its crackdown against secessionists, are Serbia's
internal matter and should not involve foreign mediators.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has been shuttling between
Belgrade and Pristina in an effort to find a compromise peace plan,
met representatives of the ethnic Albanians' rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army Tuesday.
	   The meeting in the village of Dragobilje, 50 kilometers (30
miles) southwest of Pristina, was Hill's second with KLA
representatives since Nov. 6.
	   Adem Demaci, a guerrilla spokesman, praised Hill's decision to
include the KLA.
	   ``Rugova can sign anything, but there could be no deal without
KLA consent,'' Demaci said.

Portuguese lawmaker wants former Indonesian leader Suharto
</HEADLINE>
extradited &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The Attorney-General is examining a
lawmaker's call on the Portuguese authorities to seek the
extradition of former Indonesian President Suharto for human rights
abuses in East Timor, an official said Tuesday.
	   Nuno Correia da Silva of the rightist Popular Party wrote a
letter arguing that Suharto should be tried in Portugal for crimes
allegedly committed in East Timor _ a former Portuguese territory
that Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year.
	   ``We're looking at whether it's possible in Portuguese law,''
said Sara Pina, a spokeswoman for the Attorney-General.
	   Human rights groups have accused Indonesian troops of widespread
abuses in East Timor, 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of
Jakarta.
	   As well as noting that the United Nations regards Portugal as
the legitimate administrative power in East Timor, Correia da Silva
argued that his bid to see Suharto extradited was strengthened by
current attempts to extradite former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet to Spain.
	   He said Pinochet's detention in London on Oct. 16, as a first
step to possible extradition to Spain, had opened a new era in
international law where, ``there are no borders against the law nor
against the legitimacy of seeing justice done.''
	   Pina said there were differences between Portuguese and Spanish
law which had to be analyzed.
	   Pinochet was detained at the request of a Spanish judge who
charges the former dictator with genocide, torture and terrorism
committed during his 1973-1990 regime. The Spanish government
presented a formal extradition request last week.
	   The English High Court quashed the original arrest warrant
against Pinochet on the grounds that he is immune from prosecution
as a former chief of state. The Law Lords are currently considering
an appeal.
	   Suharto stood down as Indonesia's president last May after 32
years in power.

For Russians, new space station can't replace the beloved Mir

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After years of cosmic misfortune, could there
actually be a flash of good news coming from Russia's sputtering
space program?
	   On Friday, Russia plans to launch the first leg of the biggest
space project ever _ the International Space Station, which is
designed to serve as man's home away from the home planet for the
next two decades.
	   The new station should be a godsend for the impoverished
Russians, masters of long-term space flight. Russia gets to play a
central role in the premier manned space venture at the dawn of the
21st century, while most of the money comes from the 15 other
participating nations _ the United States, Canada, Japan and 12
European states.
	   Yet Russia's beleaguered space professionals, who have endured
deep funding cuts, failed rocket launches and several near
disasters on the Mir, can't seem to shake that hangdog look.
	   They remain hopelessly enthralled with the Mir, that smelly,
leaky, fire-singed bucket-of-bolts that has made 70,000 loops
around the Earth over the past 12 years.
	   And when the new station goes up, their venerated Mir is
supposed to come down.
	   ``There was euphoria when the Mir was launched,'' said Viktor
Blagov, the deputy flight controller at Russia's Mission Control
ever since the Mir was sent up in 1986. ``We don't have that same
feeling now. Nobody in Russia wants to see the Mir de-orbited.''
	   Russia can no longer afford a space station, let alone two. And
NASA says the price for participating in the new station is to
discard the Mir, which is supposed to vanish into the Pacific Ocean
around the middle of next year if all goes as planned.
	   Plans aren't etched in stone, however. An aide to President
Boris Yeltsin, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, raised the possibility on
Sunday that the Mir might stay in orbit until the end of 1999 or
early in 2000, possibility even longer.
	   The Russians insist they are fully committed to the deal. But
the new station can only replace the Mir in orbit, not in their
hearts.
	   ``The Mir is old, but it could stay up for five more years,''
said cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyov, who must surely know as much about
the station as anyone. A veteran of five Mir missions, his most
recent sojourn ended in February after he performed several
spacewalks to patch up some of the station's most serious problems.
	   Russia's emotional attachment to the Mir may seem odd to
outsiders, who consider it the orbital equivalent of a rusting
jalopy. But through Russian eyes, the Mir has been an unequaled
success.
	   Expected to last just five years, it has demonstrated the
feasibility of long-term human habitation in space, taught crews
how to improvise during extended journeys, and served as the model
for many aspects of the new space station.
	   When the Mir is gone, the Russians will be without a major space
project of their own for the first time in decades. And playing
second fiddle to the Americans won't come easy to a country that
put the first satellite in orbit and the first man in space.
	   For both Americans and Russians, this transition from the space
race to a celestial embrace requires all sorts of compromises their
space agencies have never had to make before.
	   The Mir and the U.S. space shuttle have both handled
international crews, and while these efforts were successes, they
also highlighted national differences over what is safe and what
isn't.
	   When the Mir suffered a string of accidents last year, the
Americans expressed skepticism about its safety and debated the
wisdom of sending up another astronaut.
	   The Russians, meanwhile, noted the Mir had been afflicted by
more than 1,500 breakdowns during its lifetime and said the latest
problems, like earlier ones, could be fixed without endangering the
crew.
	   No single country will be completely in charge of the new
station, making it a mini-United Nations in orbit that will require
equal measures of diplomacy in space and on the ground.
	   A few examples:
	   _The cash-strapped Russians have repeatedly missed deadlines on
building the key service module, which will house the first crew.
Washington keeps putting up extra money, but some U.S. congressmen
are agitated over Russia's poky pace, which has put the space
station a year behind schedule.
	   _The Russians have the most experienced space fliers, but less
experienced Americans will command the crews. The Russians have
agreed, reluctantly.
	   _There will be two mission control centers _ the main one in
Houston, a backup in Moscow. But the Russians have been pushing for
more control over their equipment and their cosmonauts.
	   The new station is essentially a bigger, better Mir, but it
won't be crossing any space frontiers. Like Mir, it will endlessly
circle the Earth, and critics joke that its mission is to boldly go
where man has gone so many times before.
	   Friday's liftoff from Baikonur in the former Soviet republic of
Kazakstan will send up an unmanned propulsion component. The space
shuttle Endeavor is to carry the Americans' first segment _ a
connecting passageway _ into space Dec. 3.
	   The first crews won't board the station until 2000, after
Russia's behind-schedule service module is in place.
	    &UR; Some think ... PICKUP 27th graf.

Estranged rebel attempts to assassinate Sudanese rebel chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ An estranged Sudanese rebel general tried
to assassinate rebel chief John Garang in a weekend gunbattle in
the Kenyan capital Nairobi, the rebel group and a newspaper said
Tuesday.
	   Both Garang, who is chief of the Sudan People's Liberation Army,
and Maj.-Gen. Kerubino Kwanyin Bol, a rebel leader who had defected
to the government in April 1997 and rejoined the rebels in January,
have homes in Nairobi.
	   The friction underscored rivalries in the Sudanese rebel
movement, which has been fighting a 15-year civil war against the
government in Khartoum for control of south Sudan. The war has left
more than 1.5 million Sudanese dead, mired any possible development
and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes.
	   The SPLA said in a statement that Kerubino, backed by the
Sudanese government, had organized a hit squad of 20 men to
assassinate Garang and a number of other senior rebel officials.
	   It said the squad arrived at Garang's residence Sunday to kill
him, but Kenyan police chased them off.
	   However, in a conflicting account, the private Kenya Television
Network said Kerubino said in an interview Tuesday that the
face-off took place at a local police station, and not at Garang's
residence.
	   Kerubino claimed that Garang and several of his soldiers arrived
at the police station armed and ordered the police officers to hand
him over to Garang's men.
	   ``From there I would be killed or put in prison,'' Kerubino said
on KTN. He did not say when this took place or how he evaded
capture.
	   A report in the independent Daily Nation newspaper said the
incident took place Saturday at Garang's home, and that an ensuing
30-minute gun battle left one of Garang's men dead, before Kenyan
police arrived and chase the assailants away.
	   The newspaper cited an informed source as saying eight
supporters of Kerubino raided Garang's home with the intention of
assassinating him and taking over control of the SPLA.
	   A police spokesman contacted Tuesday refused to comment, and
said all queries should be addressed to the Foreign Ministry, which
also declined comment.
	   An official at the Zambian High Commission in Nairobi confirmed
to The AP that following the gunbattle, Kerubino and three of his
supporters sought refuge at the diplomatic mission, but were
eventually asked to leave.
	   The SPLA statement said the rebel organization ``condemns this
callous and uncivilized behavior and acts of terrorism that is
being extended, practiced and exercised in a friendly and
neighboring country that is a haven to our refugees and a route for
humanitarian assistance to the people of New Sudan.''
	   ``We cannot turn the streets of Nairobi into scenes of
terrorism.''
	   Last week, Kerubino told reporters that SPLA officials had
confiscated his car and were harrassing him.
	   The SPLA responded Tuesday saying it was ``a complete
fabrication.'' It said Kenyan police had searched Kerubino's home
for guns and a long-range communication radio that was interfering
with police work and therefore arrested him.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP)- Special police units were guarding the
stadium where Albania was scheduled to play Greece on Wednesday in
the first international soccer game to take place in Albania since
1996.
	   ``Special police units have been posted in and around the
stadium since Sunday,''Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga
said Tuesday.
	   He said that there will be tight control of the fans on
Wednesday before they enter the stadium.
	   Albania's general police director Veton Gjoliku was put in
charge of the police operations to secure the stadium, said Bizhga.
	   The last international game played at Tirana's Qemal Stafa
stadium was in November 1996 against Armenia.

Hat-trick hero knighted by Queen

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Geoff Hurst, the only player to score three goals
in a World Cup final, went to Buckingham Palace on Tuesday to
receive a knighthood for services to English soccer.
	   Queen Elizabeth II knighted Hurst, 32 years after she presented
him with his World Cup winners' medal at Wembley following the 4-2
victory over Germany in the final.
	   ``Receiving a knighthood is a wondering thing to happen and it
was almost like full circle today because it was the Queen who
presented the England team with the trophy at Wembley in 1966,''
Hurst said.
	   Hurst, 56, is a leading official in England's bid to host the
2006 World Cup.
	   His 1966 World Cup team-mate, Bobby Charlton, and manager Alf
Ramsey also have been knighted.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Some 4,500 Kurds rallied Tuesday to protest
Italy's arrest of a Kurdish rebel leader who is also wanted in
Germany on terrorism charges.
	   Gathering in front of the Interior Ministry in Bonn, the
protesters demanded that the European Union _ both Italy and
Germany are members _ reject Turkey's demand to extradite Abdullah
Ocalan for trial.
	   Police said there were no incidents.
	   Meanwhile, about 60 members of Germany's large Kurdish community
said they are continuing a hunger strike in Bonn begun last weekend
to protest Ocalan's arrest.
	   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said Tuesday in Rome that
Germany would not seek Ocalan's extradition.

`Outrageous,' say tourists shut out of Orsay Museum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo PAR112 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Outrageous! Unthinkable! Unfair! That's what
tourists are saying about a week-old strike by Orsay museum
employees that's kept thousands away from one of the world's
renowned collections of 19th-century art.
	   ``It's totally outrageous that cashiers and guards have the
power to completely shut down a prestigious museum like Orsay, when
what's in there belongs to everyone,'' said Chris Halford, a
43-year-old computer engineer. He will return home to Birmingham,
England without having set foot in the museum.
	   ``At the end of the day, it's the tourists who are punished,''
he said. ``Why victimize the people?''
	   Disgruntled employees have demanded a one-time bonus of 1,600
francs (dlrs 280) to compensate for what they call
``inconveniences'' caused by huge crowds flocking to a temporary
exhibit of works by Jean-Francois Millet and Vincent Van Gogh.
	   ``I'll pay it to them right now if that will get me in,''
Halford said.
	   The workers, who met last week with government officials without
reaching an accord, say visitors are forced to wait in line up to
three hours and often display rude and abusive behavior.
	   ``That's just a pretext!'' said Jeanne-Marie Malauzat, an art
history professor shut out Tuesday, along with her American
students from Alma, Michigan.
	   ``Employees are just trying to cash in on the success of the
show,'' she said.
	   Mrs. Malauzat's students were more sympathetic to the strikers,
applauding them for banding together to make a statement.
	   ``This wouldn't ever happen in the US,'' said Karima Ridgley,
21, from Iowa City, Iowa. ``And the French do it with such panache
and frequency.''
	   Frequency is right.
	   This fall, high school students took to the streets demanding
more teachers and better facilities, while several major
attractions including the Eiffel Tower and the new National Library
also were closed by striking workers. Constant transport strikes
affect cities all over France.
	   Tourists at Orsay were caught by surprise Tuesday.
	   The words ``En Greve'' (On Strike) were plastered over the main
entrance in giant letters. A single sheet of white paper was
posted, telling visitors _ in French only _ that it was
``impossible'' to view the show, and explaining how to get
reimbursed.
	   ``I don't speak French,'' said Pat Hennessy, 55, a partner at
Deloitte and Touche from Florham Park, N. J. ``Then I saw the word
`impossible,' and I knew it meant bad news.''
	   Workers are scheduled to vote Wednesday whether to extend their
action.
	   The strike was a costly inconvenience for Maryse Pradet-Simon,
who came by train from her home in Lyon especially for the
Millet-Van Gogh show.
	   ``I booked my ticket in advance, bought a train ticket and took
off two days from work,'' she said angrily. ``Now what am I
supposed to do?''

Griqualand brings West Indies to draw

 &UR; EDS: CLARIFIES in lede and 2nd graf that match was draw, and
changes points to runs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIMBERLEY, South Africa (AP) _ Griqualand West broke a
hundred-year-old record on Tuesday to confound West Indies with a
massive 435 runs in their second innings for a draw.
	   Play was called off at 4:30 p.m. local time (1430 gmt) after
Griqualand more than doubled the runs it needed to force West
Indies to bat a second innings.
	   Griqualand West scored 271 in first innings, while West Indies
held 466.
	   The four-day match ended on Tuesday, part of West Indies' run-up
to a Test series against South Africa that begins Nov. 26.
	   Inspired by a 22-ball 50 by veteran Pat Symcox, tailenders
Finley Brooker and Wendell Bossenger dug in their heels to set a
new Griqua eighth-wicket partnership record of 148.
	   The previous mark of 129 was recorded against Eastern Province
in the early 1890s.
	   Assuming the match would not drag out into the day, Qriqualand's
general manager Brian Kidson reportedly decided not to order lunch
for the players.
	   At the wicket for 28 minutes, the 38-year-old Symcox was
particularly severe on Shivnarine Chanderpaul, carting two overs
from the part-time legspinner for 43 runs.
	   Symcox's performance overshadowed a defiant sixth-wicket
partnership of 94 between overnight pairing Piet Barnard and
Brooker, which made it all possible.
	   Barnard batted for 192 minutes for his 76 and together with
Brooker had taken his side to within two runs of avoiding an
innings defeat.

French goalscoring hero Papin announces retirement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details throughout, changes spelling to
`Emily'

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Jean-Pierre Papin, one of France's all-time great
strikers, ended his playing career Tuesday, saying he wanted to
spend more time with his family.
	   ``I am going to grant myself a long break devoted to my family,
especially my daughter Emily,'' who is disabled, Papin said at a
news conference.
	   The 35-year-old scored 326 goals in 584 matches for eight clubs
and the French national team.
	   Papin, who is retiring completely from playing, said he would
coach the amateur team of Arcachon in south west France.
	   In 54 matches for France, including 11 as captain, Papin scored
30 goals _ a record bettered only by Michel Platini _ and played in
the 1986 World Cup finals and 1992 European Championships.
	   Papin made his last appearance for the national team in 1995.
	   Papin shot to fame in 1986 after signing for Marseille, where he
scored 181 goals in 279 games, won four championship medals and was
top French goalscorer for five seasons.
	   His goals helped Marseille reach the 1991 European Cup final,
which it lost to Red Star Belgrade in Bari, Italy.
	   ``If I had one regret, it would be that I never won the European
Cup with Marseille. I have replayed that final in Bari so many
times,'' Papin told French sports daily L'Equipe.
	   After transferring to AC Milan in 1992, Papin won a European Cup
medal in 1994, though he didn't play in the final against his
former club Marseille.
	   Papin also played for Bayern Munich, helping the German club win
the UEFA Cup in 1996, before moving back to France.
	   After a spell at Bordeaux, Papin moved to French second division
club Guingamp in pre-season, but struggled to hold down a place.
	   Papin, who also played for Vichy, Valenciennes and Bruges, said
that he is a very different person from the ``temperamental, naive
and inexperienced,'' youngster that signed for Marseille.
	   ``I thought that I knew alot of things about which I knew
nothing,'' he said.
	   ``I have changed a lot, that is clear. I have been divorced, had
setbacks, injuries and put confidence in people that I later
regretted,'' he told L'Equipe.
	   ``But what changed me above all was Emily. She changed the
center of gravity of my life away from soccer,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India _ Nearly 10,000 Indian soldiers swooped on an
island on India's western stretch not far from Pakistan Tuesday in
a land-and-sea assault, the largest Indian military exercise in a
decade, officials said.
	   The exercise, which brought together the Army, Navy, Air Force
and the marine Coast Guards in a mighty display of military muscle,
was conducted ``somewhere on the western coast,'' domestic news
agencies reported.
	   Defense Ministry spokesman Swagat Ghosh confirmed Tuesday's
exercises, but gave no details or the location of the exercises.
	   At least 26 ships, 26 naval aircraft, 15 Air Force jets and
helicopters, a battalion of T-72 tanks and two submarines took part
in the exercises, the United News of India said.
	   India had announced in October it would hold the military
maneuvers, including in the Thar desert bordering arch rival
Pakistan. Islamabad was informed of the plans and ``these can't be
called unusual or large-scale,'' Ghosh had then said.
	   Military sources said the exercises would continue through
December.
	   Tuesday, a fleet of Sea-Harriers roared over the island, backed
by Air Force Jaguars and Mig-21s. The air attack was followed by an
amphibian commando assault on mock enemy territory as soldiers
inched and slithered toward the island backed by lethal weaponry,
UNI reported.
	   Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars in 1948, 1965
and 1971, had said the maneuvers were provocative and soured the
atmosphere for the peace talks.
	   Officials from the two hostile South Asian neighbors held peace
talks for the first time in a year in October and held a fresh
round this month in New Delhi but reported little progress.
	   The exercises are the biggest Indian military maneuvers since
1987, which brought the two countries to the brink of a fourth
confrontation.
	   Two of the three past conflagrations between India and Pakistan
were over the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir, divided between
the two countries when the British gave South Asia its
independence.
	   International pressure mounted on the two neighbors to talk
after they conducted nuclear tests in May that led to widespread
international condemnation and economic sanctions.
	   In the weeks after the tests, India and Pakistan escalated
routine border clashes to heavy artillery barrages that killed more
than 120 people on both sides of the frontier.

 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Satellite operators reported no immediate
problems Tuesday as the Earth passed through the tail of a comet
that peppered the atmosphere with tiny bits of space junk zipping
along at 155,000 mph (250,000 kph).
	   While people around the world watched the beginning of the best
meteor storm light show in three decades, the U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and private satellite
companies rotated their high-tech machinery to face away from the
approaching debris.
	   The Hubble telescope was turned away from the storm to protect
lens surfaces. And the crew of Russia's Mir space station planned
to wait out the worst of the storm in their emergency escape
vehicle.
	   Most military satellites are built to withstand attack and so
have better protection from the tiny meteors. NASA planned to
reposition six of its 22 satellites to present a smaller target.
Others were to be powered down for the worst part of the storm.
	   The particles from the tail of Comet Tempel-Tuttle move at 43
miles (69 kilometers) per second. Even a small grain can have the
destructive force of a .22-caliber bullet shot at one of the
world's 600-plus satellites, experts say.
	   The debris particles, most no bigger than a grain of sand, can
bore holes in solar panels, damage lenses, blast away mirror
coatings or cause harmful electrical charges.
	   That created a threat to communications, satellite TV broadcasts
and military spying.
	   Aerospace Corp. had no reports of trouble as of early this
morning, said company spokesman Greg Hughes, who was on call
overnight in case of emergency.
	   An office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
California, that was to orchestrate troubleshooting efforts
remained unstaffed during the night.
	   The likelihood of a direct hit was small.
	   ``The chances of any one satellite getting smacked by a particle
is probably less than one in one thousand, but on the other hand,
some of these satellites are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,
so you do take whatever precautions you can,'' said Don Yeomans, a
senior research scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Schroeder: No additional German aid for Moscow

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder met his
predecessor's good friend Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday and pledged to
uphold close relations between Germany and Moscow _ but didn't
offer any new money.
	   Schroeder, on his first visit to Russia as German leader, called
the Russian government's economic rescue plan a ``good start''
toward solving the country's economic troubles.
	   Yeltsin looked fit and spoke distinctly at the start of the
meeting after weeks of renewed speculation about the state of his
health. He curtailed meetings last week with the visiting Japanese
prime minister, prompting new speculation that he was seriously
ill.
	   Speaking at a news conference after meeting Yeltsin in the
Kremlin, Schroeder said the Russian president was ``active and
well-informed.''
	   Yeltsin expressed hope that Russia and Germany ``will enter the
next century with their relations developing at the same pace as
now.''
	   ``I'm sure they will,'' Schroeder responded.
	   Close ties between Yeltsin and Schroeder's predecessor, Helmut
Kohl, helped secure significant German investment and aid but also
drew criticism from those who blame Yeltsin for many of Russia's
problems.
	   Schroeder insisted that the relationship between Germany and
Russia must not rely too much on personal ties.
	   ``I don't think I like the sauna very much,'' he said, referring
to Yeltsin's and Kohl's joint visits to Russian-style bath houses.
	   ``Russia and Germany will continue to maintain special
relations, (but) the style of these relations will change,''
Schroeder said in a speech to students at Russia's International
Relations Institute, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   He said Germany will not give Russia any emergency financial aid
outside the money it's providing through international lenders.
	   ``People in Russia fully realize the contribution Germany has
made,'' Schroeder said Tuesday. ``I think Russians duly assess it
and realize that our opportunities are limited.''
	   The cash-strapped Russian government desperately needs foreign
aid to pay off its huge debts, but the IMF and other lenders have
stopped releasing loans, saying they want Moscow to start
implementing a sound economic plan first.
	   While saying that Russia's economic program ``should be
augmented so that it meets conditions set by the IMF,'' Schroeder
stopped short of saying Germany would recommend that the IMF
release the money.
	   Germany is a key member of the IMF, the World Bank and the
European Union, all of which have provided aid to Russia.
	   Schroeder also met with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
speakers of both parliament houses and politicians.
	   The talks with Russian officials focused on cooperation in
aerospace industry and improving conditions for foreign investors
in Russia, Schroeder said.

European Parliament pays tribute to protectors of Jews in WWII
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A Portuguese diplomat and a Bulgarian
politician who defied their governments to save thousands of Jews
from the Nazis during World War II received a posthumous tribute
Tuesday from the European Parliament.
	   ``There were some brave men and women, the just, who risked
their lives, their careers and confronted barbarism any way they
could ... Today we pay homage to two of these heroes,'' said
European Parliament President Jose-Maria Gil-Robles, opening the
ceremony in Strasbourg, France.
	   Aristides de Sousa Mendes was Portuguese consul general in
Bordeaux, France, when the Germans invaded in 1940. He ignored
government orders and issued visas to an estimated 10,000 Jews and
20,000 other refugees fleeing the Nazi advance.
	   As a result, he was called back to Lisbon, where he was vilified
by dictator Antonio Salazar. Dismissed from the diplomatic service,
denied a pension and barred from practicing law, Sousa Mendes died
in poverty in 1954.
	   Dimitar Peshev played a key role in saving the 48,000 Jews
living in Bulgaria in 1943. As deputy chairman of Bulgarian
parliament, he vehemently opposed plans of the pro-fascist
government to deport the entire Jewish community to the Auschwitz
death camp.
	   After the communists took over in 1944, Peshev was sentenced to
15 years in prison for collaborating with the Nazis. He was
released after one year and died in 1973.
	   The tribute to Sousa Mendes and Peshev was attended by
Portugal's foreign minister Jaime Gama, speaker of the Bulgarian
parliament Yordan Sokolov, and Israel's ambassador to the European
Union, Harry Kney-Tal.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Struggling to find a peace formula
backed by all Kosovo factions, a special U.S. envoy discussed a
plan Tuesday with ethnic Albanian guerrillas whose support is
crucial for any future resolution in the Serbian province.
	   Christopher Hill's second meeting with the rebels this month
came as a top ethnic Albanian negotiator in U.S.-mediated talks
with the Serbian government for the first time suggested that his
side could settle for less than independence for Kosovo.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the ethnic Albanian negotiating team, told
The Associated Press that his team had proposed that the
Albanian-majority province separate from Kosovo, but remain part of
Yugoslavia with a status equal to that of the republics of Serbia
and Montenegro.
	   ``A period of three to five years would be enough to see whether
such a union could function,'' said Agani, a top aide to the
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. ``If it could, we would want to
stay in it. If not, I don't see why we would stay.''
	   He said the offer was ``a compromise solution'' but acknowledged
it had already been rejected by the Serbian government.
	   Serbia insists Kosovo remain within its borders while most of
the majority ethnic Albanians want secession. The Albanians
themselves are divided over how tough their policies should be.
	   Authorities have previously ruled out republic status for
Kosovo, which is basically what Agani appeared to be suggesting.
	   Hill, who has drafted a peace plan for Kosovo, met the
representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army for two hours in
ethnic Albanian village of Dragobilje, about 50 kilometers (30
miles) southwest of Pristina. The talks were held in a house, with
KLA fighters providing security.
	   Hill made no comment, but Jakup Krasniqi, a KLA official who
attended the talks, said the guerrillas voiced complaints about the
plan and would send their final response within 10 days.
	   Rebel backing is crucial for any agreement on Kosovo. But the
KLA, which fought Serb forces for months, has in the past ruled out
any deal that falls short of independence. They have also
criticized Rugova for his readiness to compromise.
	   Adem Demaci, a guerrilla spokesman, said the KLA would have the
final say on any deal.
	   ``Rugova can sign anything, but there could be no deal without
KLA consent,'' Demaci told reporters in Pristina.
	   Meanwhile Serbian president Milan Milutinovic pressed ahead with
a plan to hold direct talks with ethnic Albanian politicians,
despite their refusal to appear at the meeting.
	   The ethnic Albanians refuse to talk without U.S. and European
mediation, saying only foreign countries could guarantee that the
Serbian government would implement any agreement.
	   They have turned down 16 Serb invitations in the past six
months.
	   The Serbian government says the troubles in Kosovo, where
hundreds of people have died and tens of thousands were left
homeless in the authorities' crackdown against secessionists, are
Serbia's internal matter and should not involve foreign mediators.

Legislator wants U.S. Virgin Islands to step into banana dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NORBERTO SANTANA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A U.S. Virgin
Islands lawmaker wants the territory to intervene in a dispute over
Caribbean banana exports, warning a blow to the industry could
encourage illegal immigration.
	   Sen. David Jones said Monday he is proposing a task force to
lobby U.S. officials for a negotiated agreement on sales of bananas
by Caribbean countries to the European Union.
	   The United States claims trade perks granted to Caribbean
countries constitute unfair trade practices, and it is threatening
to retaliate with economic sanctions beginning Feb. 1. Jamaica,
Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, Grenada, and
Belize say the threats endanger their small economies.
	   ``We need to assure that we don't have an adverse (immigration)
impact from those affected neighboring countries,'' Jones said. ``
Many people have family ties here and it's natural they would
come.''
	   The European Union rewrote the trade benefits after the World
Trade Organization ruled last year that they were unfair, but U.S.
officials say they remain unsatisfied.
	   Edison James, the prime minister of Dominica, asked Virgin
Islands officials to help during a recent visit to the territory.
	   Jones, who was born in Dominica, represents St. Croix in the
territory's legislature. He said he would file a bill when the
legislature convenes in January authorizing a task force to lobby
in Washington.
	   Immigration to the U.S. Virgin Islands from the eastern
Caribbean has risen in recent years. About one-quarter of Virgin
Islands residents trace their roots to neighboring islands, and
four constitutional conventions have deadlocked on the legal
definition of a ``native Virgin Islander.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors returned to Iraq on
Tuesday, saying they would get back to work as soon as possible to
test Iraq's pledge to cooperate in the search for its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   ``We are back. We are ready to work immediately,'' senior
weapons inspector Jaakko Ylitalo told reporters after his C-130
transport plane landed at the Habaniya military air base outside
Baghdad about 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT).
	   Ylitalo was among 86 inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency who arrived from the
Gulf state of Bahrain, where they were evacuated last week when
U.S. air strikes on Iraq seemed likely.
	   At the air base, Ylitalo asked an Iraqi official if the Iraqis
had prepared for the resumption of UNSCOM's work.
	   ``Everything will be sorted out as soon as possible,'' the
unidentified official told Ylitalo.
	   Asked by reporters if Iraqi officials were helpful, Ylitalo
said: ``We have no problems.''
	   With the threat of American and British air strikes on Iraq over
for now, about 150 U.N. relief workers also returned to Baghdad
from the Jordanian capital of Amman, where they were sent at the
height of the crisis.
	   The arms inspectors have been working for more than seven years
to unearth Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles. Their work has been frequently blocked by Iraq. But the
latest threat of attack by U.S. and British forces produced a
renewed promise to cooperate.
	   While U.S. President Bill Clinton has expressed skepticism that
Iraq would cooperate, a top aide to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
insisted Tuesday he anticipated no problems with the renewed
inspections.
	   Gen. Amer al-Saadi, scientific adviser to Saddam, said in a
Cable News Network interview that all would go smoothly if an
accord between Iraq and the United Nations, which ended the last
confrontation in February, was followed.
	   ``All that is resolved through the memorandum of understanding,
what is exactly UNSCOM'S mandate, and the inspector's mandate, and
what we should so, and we will stick to that,'' he said when asked
about possible confrontations.
	   Al-Saadi said Iraq would deal with UNSCOM chief Richard Butler _
whom it has demanded be fired.
	   When asked about an arms document that Iraq has refused to turn
over to inspectors, he said Iraq wanted first to discuss the
relevant parts with the inspectors. He declined to say that Iraq
would hand it over.
	   He said Iraq would be patient about how long it will take to
begin a comprehensive review on the status of weapon programs that
Iraq wants. But when asked if it would wait months, he replied,
``Naturally there are limits.''
	   After landing Tuesday, the inspectors went from Habaniya air
base to their headquarters in Baghdad, 70 kilometers (44 miles)
from Habaniya air base, aboard buses.
	   Caroline Cross, the spokeswoman for the inspectors in Iraq, told
reporters that Iraq's disarmament activities would start in earnest
Wednesday.
	   She said UNSCOM was looking forward to ``a productive and
professional relationship'' with the Iraqi government. First, she
said, the inspectors will ``get all the computers on line, making
sure the camera system is working. That is our first priority.''
	   From their headquarters the inspectors can monitor about 120
remote control cameras at suspected Iraqi weapons sites. They also
carry out both announced and spot visits.
	   Before the inspectors left Bahrain, Ms. Cross said they would
quickly test Iraq's pledge of cooperation.
	   ``The Iraqi authorities have promised cooperation. Obviously the
next few days are going to be very important,'' she said.
	   Eighty 80 UNSCOM arms experts and six inspectors from the
International Atomic Energy Agency _ which is studying Iraq's
nuclear weapons program _ returned to the Iraqi capital.
	   The threat of military action was averted Sunday when U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced the United States had accepted the
Iraqi government's pledge a day earlier to lift its three-month ban
on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Once inspectors report they are able to work effectively, the
Security Council will conduct a review of Iraq's efforts to
eliminate its dangerous weapons. The Iraqi government wants the
review to lead quickly to the lifting of U.N. sanctions _ a move
both the United States and Britain have resisted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated
Iraq's economy.
	   The council has said they will not be lifted until UNSCOM and
the Vienna-headquartered nuclear agency certify that Iraq has
eliminated its lethal weaponry.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The world's newest automaker, DaimlerChrysler
AG, officially became a member of the global business community
Tuesday when its shares began trading in Europe and the United
States.
	   A balcony overlooking the main trading floor of the New York
Stock Exchange was decorated for the day with the red grille of a
Jeep Grand Cherokee and a silver grille of a Mercedes-Benz E-class.
	   Horns honked and the headlights flashed just before co-chairmen
Robert J. Eaton of the former Chrysler Corp. and Juergen Schrempp
of the former Daimler-Benz AG rang the bell to open the day's
trading on the NYSE.
	   DaimlerChrysler shares, trading under the symbol DCX, were down
dlrs 1.12 1/2 at dlrs 83.18 3/4 in early afternoon trading. On the
Frankfurt, Germany, exchange, DaimlerChrysler shares edged up on
their first official day of trading.
	   Schrempp, who will take full control of the company within three
years, said it was an emotional day for him. Eaton declared it
``the beginning of a new era.''
	   ``This is a historic day for the entire auto industry,'' he
said. ``There is no blueprint for what we are doing today.''
	   Celebrations were held at DaimlerChrysler plants and offices
worldwide.

Premier: asylum-seeking Kurdish leader must renounce terrorism

	   ROME (AP) _ Kurds marched through Rome in a 10,000-strong
protest Tuesday to demand asylum for their captured rebel leader _
a demand Italy's premier said would be denied unless Abdullah
Ocalan has truly renounced terrorism.
	   The march was the largest yet in days of growing protests since
Italian police arrested Ocalan on his arrival at Rome's airport
Thursday.
	   Kurds are streaming into Rome and launching rallies and hunger
strikes across Europe in opposition to Turkey's request he be
extradited for trial. More than 4,000 protested Tuesday outside the
Interior Ministry in Bonn, Germany.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which is
fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey. The
14-year-old conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Supporters marched past the Colosseum and into Piazza Venezia on
Tuesday, waving red flags and making the streets of downtown Rome
ring with their cries.
	   Kneeling in the piazza, they chanted, ``We love you, Ocalan. We
are with you, Ocalan. We will die for you, Ocalan.''
	   ``We want to show the world that PKK is not a terrorist
organization. It is a people's organization,'' said Mustafa
Rizgari, who flew from Copenhagen with about 40 other Kurds to show
solidarity with the rebel leader.
	   ``If a million people love him, how can he be a terrorist?''
Rizgari asked.
	   Premier Massimo D'Alema told Parliament's lower house Tuesday
that Ocalan has ``rejected all terrorist actions'' in a statement
issued Monday. ``Now it's a matter of seeing whether he sticks to
it.''
	   ``Our country doesn't intend to be a host for terrorist
activities,'' D'Alema told lawmakers.
	   Turkey, one of Italy's NATO allies and a strong trading partner,
is pushing hard for the extradition.
	   However, extradition appears unlikely because Ocalan is on trial
in absentia for capital crimes in Turkey. Italy's courts have
consistently forbidden extraditing suspects to a country where they
could be executed.
	   ``This is not an act of hostility toward Turkey, but one of
respect for our own laws, history and values,'' said D'Alema, a day
after a gloves-off warning to Turkey that Italy wouldn't give in to
``threats, pressure,'' or ``blackmail.''
	   In his statement, Ocalan said he wanted to work for a peaceful
solution to the bitter Kurdish conflict.
	   Syria recently expelled Ocalan from his longtime haven under
pressure from Turkey. Ocalan then sought asylum in Russia, but was
rebuffed. From Moscow, he flew to Rome, where he wound up in police
custody.
	   Ocalan is believed held in a military hospital in Rome.
Supporters are camped out outside by the hundreds.
	   The Kurdish cause enjoys considerable sympathy in Europe. The
so-called Kurdish parliament-in-exile met recently in Rome, which
may have encouraged Ocalan to seek asylum in Italy, D'Alema said.
	   In Turkey, however, many Turks are incensed at what they see as
Italy's harboring of a terrorist.
	   In Ankara on Tuesday, hundreds of Turks demonstrated outside the
Italian Embassy, burning an Italian flag.
	   ``If he's not handed over, we'll walk to Italy, we'll annex
Italy, we'll turn Italy upside down!'' one demonstrator screamed
into a loudspeaker.
	   Turkish police detained 72 people in Istanbul following clashes
between Ocalan supporters and passers-by. Another 100 people were
detained at a pro-Ocalan demonstration in the southern city of
Mersin, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Turkey is so eager to get Ocalan back that it has taken steps
toward abolishing capital punishment.
	   Germany also has an outstanding warrant for him issued in 1990
on terrorism-related charges. But Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
said Tuesday in Rome that Germany would not ask for his
extradition. Ocalan now is ``a matter for Italy,'' he said.

Church leader: clones worse than `Frankenstein'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Advances in cloning research could lead to
horrors that would surpass even Nazi atrocities and fictional
creatures, the leader of Greece's Orthodox Church warned Tuesday.
	   ``This will create a race of human copies, just as the Nazis and
the Soviets tried to do,'' Archbishop Christodoulos said at the
opening of a medical conference in Athens.
	   ``Frankenstein and Mengele would pale by comparison,'' said
Christodoulos, referring to the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, who
hunted as a war criminal for his murderous research.
	   Christodoulos acknowledged that genetic research had many
benefits, but he stressed the need for stricter controls.

Late centuries helps Griqualand to draw with West Indies

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Griqualand turning match around; Stands as 2nd

<TEXT>
	   KIMBERLEY, South Africa (AP) _ Griqualand West broke a
century-old club record during a second-innings of 435 and forced a
draw with the West Indies in their four-day tour match Tuesday.
	   Play was halted and stumps were drawn at 4:30 p.m. after
Griqualand scored more than doubled the runs necessary to force the
West Indies into bat a second time.
	   Griqualand West added the 435 to their first-innings of 271. The
West Indies, preparing for the start of its first test on Nov. 26.
reached 466 all out in its first innings.
	   Inspired by Pay Symcox's half century off 22 balls, tailenders
Finley Brooker and Wendell Bossenger combined for an eighth-wicket
partnership of 148, breaking the previous record of 129 set against
Eastern Province in the early 1890s.
	   Brooker reached 111 before being run out and Bossenger added
102.
	   Symcox's 50 came in only 28 minutes, hitting for 43 runs against
legspinner Shivnarine Chanderpaul in only two overs.
	   That followed a defiant sixth-wicket partnership of 94 between
overnight pairing Piet Barnard and Brooker.
	   Barnard batted for 192 minutes for 76 and together with Brooker
had taken his side to within two runs of avoiding an innings
defeat.

Mexico's election board votes to probe 1994 finances
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's federal elections agency has agreed
to discuss complaints against the governing party's campaign
finances in the 1994 presidential race, prompting a walkout by
party representatives.
	   Representatives of the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, walked out after the Monday vote, charging that it
was illegal to raise the issue.
	   An investigation could focus attention on charges the PRI
overspent and used illegal campaign contributions in 1994 at a
moment when Mexico's parties are gearing up for the 2000
presidential election.
	   Counselors of the Federal Electoral Institute voted 7-1 to
consider the complaints raised by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador,
national leader of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party.
	   Lopez Obrador charged that President Ernesto Zedillo's 1994
campaign received dlrs 4 million from banker Carlos Cabal Peniche _
arrested in Australia last week on charges he misused some dlrs 700
million.
	   The PRD claims that the donation was absorbed into a federal
bank protection fund whose liabilities _ totaling some dlrs 55
billion _ would be covered by the national debt under a government
proposal.
	   ``President Zedillo has to explain why he received financing
from Cabal in his campaign in 1994,'' Lopez Obrador said. ``Let him
say if it is true or not that Cabal financed the PRI in 1994.''
	   The PRI's representative, Enrique Ibarra, said he would
indefinitely boycott the institute's sessions, arguing that the
proposal for an investigation was not part of the agenda.
	   The PRI has denied any wrongdoing in its 1994 campaign and says
the matter should be a dead issue because officials had earlier
accepted its campaign spending reports.
	   ``We are not hiding anything,'' Ibarra said. ``We have reported
on everything and for us this is a closed issue and we are fighting
it legally.''

French Finance Minister says growth with be 2.7 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said
Tuesday that France's growth rate for 1999 would be 2.7 percent,
above the prediction made by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.
	   In its semi-annual report made public Tuesday, the OECD reduced
its earlier prevision for French growth from 2.8 percent to 2.4
percent.
	   Strauss-Kahn said the OECD figure did not taken into account the
evolution of domestic demand and said France's 1999 growth rate
would be 2.7 percent.
	   The OECD based its revision of the 1999 growth rate on what it
said was a slowing down in consumption.

At least 21 people killed in battles between rival clans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least 21 people were killed and
nearly 40 others wounded in two days of heavy fighting between
rival groups of the same clan in southwestern Somalia, witnesses
said Tuesday.
	   Officials, reached on VHF radio, said heavy fighting erupted
Sunday between two groups belonging to the Rahanwein clan in the
district of Sakow in middle Jubba region, about 380 kilometers (238
miles) southwest of the capital Mogadishu.
	   The battles, being waged with assault rifles and
rocket-propelled grenades, broke out Sunday over employment with a
Swedish relief agency operating to develop water supply and health
services in the area.
	   The officials said Moallimweyneh clansmen accused rival Geladleh
clansmen of depriving them equal employment opportunity with the
aid agency.
	   The two groups are both indigenous to the Sakow area, which has
been one of the few regions of Somalia to remain quiet over seven
years of civil war and clan fighting that has left Somalia without
a central government since the ouster of President Mohamed Siad
Barre in 1991.
	   In the first round of the fighting in the town, six militiamen
and several civilian were killed. Since then, command over the town
of Sakow has changed hands twice, and the fighting has spread into
the surrounding villages, chasing villagers from their homes.
	   Two elders in Mogadishu, Sheikh Qasim Ibrahim Nur and Abdow
Kushub, representing the warring sides, jointly told reporters
Tuesday they were delegation to the region to a truce.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two years after the city of Paris was accused of
holding real estate seized from Jews during World War II, an
exhaustive probe shows there were only a handful of such seizures,
and the owners or heirs were paid back, the mayor said Tuesday.
	   The report presented by Mayor Jean Tiberi was yet another effort
by French officials to show they are actively investigating wartime
abuses by the collaborationist Vichy regime.
	   Only last week, the Foreign Ministry published a catalog of
missing Dutch and Flemish paintings looted by the Nazis from a
Jewish family, in an effort to trace the works.
	   That came after a wave of criticism last year when hundreds of
Nazi-looted art works were revealed to be still hanging in French
museums, their ownership yet untraced.
	   The report released Tuesday was the culmination of two years of
research, overseen by a commission of historians, lawyers,
archivists and representatives of the Jewish community.
	   It was looking into charges that hundreds of buildings and
apartments _ notably in the Marais, the historic Jewish quarter of
Paris _ might have been seized from Jews by wartime French
authorities, and their heirs never compensated.
	   When the charges hit the press in November 1996, largely due to
publication of a book, ``Private Domain,'' by journalist Brigitte
Vital-Durand, Tiberi halted sales of any apartments that could be
suspect.
	   But commission president Noel Chahid-Nourai told a news
conference his group had found ``no systematic policy,'' but only
``a few isolated cases'' of uncompensated seizures from Jewish
owners.
	   Specifically, the report says, out of 3,694 city acquisitions
during the war, 49 were definitely from Jewish owners, and only
seven cases are considered suspect.
	   In two of those, property was seized outright, and in five
cases, owners were paid _ but at discriminatory prices, meaning
more than 20 percent less than would have been paid to a non-Jew.
	   These wrongs were compensated after the war, the report says.
	   But in some 50 cases, it wasn't possible to trace whether
payment actually ever reached the owners or their heirs _ if they
left any. The money was put into accounts in their names, and the
state authority in charge of those deposits is now looking into its
records.
	   There is no way of knowing how many of those 50 or so cases
involve Jews.
	   Author Vital-Durand, who began the controversy, said the key
next step is to try to find those who still deserve money.
	   In an interview, she added that the real victims weren't dealt
with in the report: not the wealthy owners, but ``their poor
tenants, who were pushed into the streets and never relocated.''
	   The majority of Parisian Jews _ about 25,000 _ lived in the
Marais at the time of the war. But only 5,000 were left at the end.
	   Of the 75,000 Jews delivered to the Nazis by Vichy authorities,
only 2,500 returned after the war. Many families were completely
destroyed, leaving no heirs.

Tight security measures for Albania-Greece qualifier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Special police guarded the stadium
Tuesday where Albania was to play Greece on Wednesday in a European
Championship qualifier, the first international match to take place
in Albania since 1996.
	   ``Special police units have been posted in and around the
stadium since Sunday,'' Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga
said Tuesday.
	   He said that there will be close scrutiny of the fans on
Wednesday before they enter the stadium.
	   Albania's general police director Veton Gjoliku has been put in
charge of the police operations to secure the stadium, Bizhga said.
	   The last international game played at Tirana's Qemal Stafa
stadium was a 1-1 draw against Armenia in a World Cup qualifier on
Nov. 9, 1996.
	   In 1997, all sport activities were halted due to chaos and
lawlessness reigning in the country following the collapse of dodgy
investment schemes.
	   Despite efforts of the new government to reestablish public
order, crime remains high, and there are daily reports of
casualties, robberies and people held at gunpoint.
	   The Greek team was escorted Monday by police to the stadium for
training, while the Albanian team trained at a basketball court for
lack of other soccer fields.
	   Albanian players have been promised dlrs 4,000 each if they win,
which is the highest premium players have ever been paid.

Israel honors negotiators with Swiss banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Risking Swiss displeasure, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu awarded several Americans and one
Israeli Tuesday for their worked in getting Swiss banks to open the
dormant accounts of victims of the Nazi Holocaust.
	   In response, the Swiss government was considering canceling
Netanyahu's visit next week's to Switzerland, because of the
outspoken criticisms lobbed at their country by some of Tuesday's
recipients.
	   Those honored included Edgar Bronfman, President of the World
Jewish Congress, former U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato, U.S. Under
Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat and New York City Comptroller
Alan Hevesi who threatened Swiss banks with economic sanctions when
it appeared negotiations over settling the accounts were breaking
down.
	   D'Amato was unable to attend due to illness and will receive the
award later. Eizenstat was in Brazil but addressed the gathering by
telephone.
	   The awards were in recognition of the recipients' role in
negotiating the dlrs. 1.2 billion settlement which the Swiss banks
agreed in August to pay to Holocaust survivors and their heirs.
	   The Swiss foreign ministry will take a decision Wednesday on
whether Netanyahu's visit will take place, a spokeswoman in Bern
said. The ministry is awaiting a detailed report from the Swiss
embassy in Tel Aviv on Tuesday's ceremony, said spokeswoman Yasmine
Chatila.
	   Bronfman said he thought the Swiss government was being foolish
about the affair. ``I think they've been foolish all along. We
never did want to blame anybody. I think they have taken this too
far and made it much too personal,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   Hevesi said some of the Swiss bankers and government officials
agreed to the settlement not because it was right but because
American economic sanctions would have cost them much more.
	   ``There are some people in Switzerland, including in the
government, who were not too happy that we sought justice for
Holocaust heirs and survivors,'' Hevesi said.
	   But Netanyahu acknowledged the efforts of the Swiss government
in its handling of the affair.
	   ``I think Switzerland has shown important leadership and
President Cotti has been responsible, as has been the Swiss
government,'' Netanyahu said. ``It has in many ways shown the way
for other European countries to confront responsibly, in a serious
way the problems of the past.''
	   All the speakers stressed that the campaign for the restitution
of Jewish property plundered by the Nazis during World War II is
just beginning, and for most of the Holocaust survivors it has come
too late.
	   Netanyahu's Diaspora Affairs Adviser Bobby Brown, who also
received the award, said the agreement with the Swiss has also
placed the issue of unclaimed life insurance policies on the table.
	   Eizenstat said restitution is vitally important for Jewish
Holocaust survivors in the former communist countries of eastern
Europe, who never received compensation of any kind.
	   ``It will help these reemerging Jewish communities which have
survived the twin tragedies of Nazism and communism - rebuild their
shattered communities,'' he said.

Ultra-Orthodox rabbis sign religious ruling against peace accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The spiritual leaders of a powerful religious
block in government signed a decree Tuesday prohibiting Israel from
carrying out a West Bank troop withdrawal it committed to in the
latest Mideast peace accord.
	   ``The borders of our Holy Land were established by God and
Israel cannot make any concessions on these borders,'' nine rabbis
affiliated with the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism coalition
wrote in a statement.
	   Religious Jews believe the West Bank, which Israel captured from
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast War, is part of the biblical land
promised to the Jews by God.
	   Under the latest peace accord signed last month in Washington,
Israel agreed to withdraw its troops from 13 percent of the West
Bank, area where the Palestinians hope to set up a future state.
	   The decree has no formal or legal binding whatsoever but
reflects the growing opposition to the accord from Israel's
religious community, which wields considerable power in Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.
	   The rabbis called upon the ultra-Orthodox community to oppose
the peace accord and participate in a prayer rally against it.
	   ``It should not be done,'' said Menachem Porush, chairman of
Agudat Yisrael, one of the parties that make up the UTJ coalition.
	   The decree charged that land handed over to the Palestinians
would be used as launching pads for terrorists and threaten Jewish
lives.
	   The ruling was handed down as Israeli lawmakers met to continue
debate and vote on the accord which was expected to pass late
Tuesday. Porush said the ruling did not necessarily mean that UTJ's
four lawmakers would vote against the agreement during the
parliamentary vote.

Church leader: clones worse than `Frankenstein'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; CORRECTS conference infomation in 2nd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Advances in cloning research could lead to
horrors that would surpass even Nazi atrocities and fictional
creatures, the leader of Greece's Orthodox Church warned Tuesday.
	   ``This will create a race of human copies, just as the Nazis and
the Soviets tried to do,'' Archbishop Christodoulos said at end of
the 21st conference of Greek surgeons in Athens.
	   ``Frankenstein and Mengele would pale by comparison,'' said
Christodoulos, referring to the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, who
hunted as a war criminal for his murderous research.
	   Christodoulos acknowledged that genetic research had many
benefits, but he stressed the need for stricter controls.

Ukraine presents optimistic 1999 budget amid growing debt problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Cabinet presented a 1999 budget
Tuesday that foresees the country's first-ever economic growth, but
the finance minister warned that the worsening state of government
finances means it will still be a tough year.
	   ``Despite some positive changes, the 1999 budget will have to be
implemented in extremely difficult conditions,'' Finance Minister
Ihor Mitiukov said.
	   Mitiukov spoke in parliament during presentation of the
government's 1999 budget draft, which lawmakers are scheduled to
vote on in two weeks.
	   The draft is expected to face strong criticism in parliament,
dominated by centrist and leftist opposition members who favor more
state subsidies to ease Ukraine's social tensions.
	   Mitiukov said the government plans to raise 23.1 billion hryvna
(dlrs 6.74 billion at the current exchange rate) in budget revenues
next year, allowing a deficit of no more than 700 million hryvna
(dlrs 204 million) _ or 0.6 percent of projected gross domestic
product.
	   The budget projects that the economy will grow by 1 percent next
year, the first growth since Ukraine won independence with the 1991
Soviet collapse. It says inflation will hit 7.8 percent, down from
nearly 13 percent so far in 1998, and the national hryvna currency
will fall by no more than 16 percent against the dollar. It
currently trades at 3.42 to the dollar.
	   ``It's a budget of state catastrophe,'' centrist opposition
legislator Julia Tymoshenko, who heads parliament's influential
budget committee, said Tuesday. ``It's good only as a manual for
mass destruction, because it would not allow anyone to survive.''
	   She urged fellow lawmakers to revise the document.
	   Ukraine has experienced a steady economic decline since the 1991
Soviet collapse and the government has been chronically short of
cash because of poor tax collection and lack of reforms needed to
boost economic activity.
	   The country's economy, which showed signs of growth in the first
half of 1998, was hit by the economic crisis in neighboring Russia
and is expected to shrink by 1.5 percent this year, Economics
Minister Vasyl Rohovy told the legislators.
	   Budget revenues in the first nine months of 1998 were just 50.8
percent of the annual target, while companies' tax debt has
skyrocketed to 9.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.68 billion) as of Nov. 1,
according to Mitiukov.
	   The government has also accumulated a foreign debt of dlrs 10.9
billion, and was compelled to channel many of its budget revenues
to debt payments this year.
	   Mitiukov said Ukraine has to pay dlrs 2.6 billion to foreign
creditors in 1999, which forced the government to cut projected
spending for many government programs, except health, education and
social welfare payments.
	   He added that the government hopes to attract dlrs 834 million
in foreign credits in 1999, of which dlrs 183.8 million is to be
spent on financing the budget deficit.

Alleged Yugoslav hit-man denies accusation of political killing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Vinko Sindicic, alleged of working as a
secret agent for the former Yugoslavia, denied charges Tuesday of
assassinating a Croat dissident emigre.
	   Sindicic pleaded not guilty before investigative judge Vera
Polak-Presecki, defying advice from his state-appointed attorney to
use his to right not to enter a plea.
	   The 55 year-old suspect arrived from Scotland Monday, to face
trial for the 1976 political killing of Bruno Busic in Paris. Busic
was a popular dissident writer, striving for Croat unity in a
struggle for independence from the former Yugoslav federation.
	   Croatia applied for Sindicic's extradition from Scotland in
1993, two years after it gained independence from the former
Yugoslavia.
	   Until his arrival late Monday, Sindicic had been serving time in
Scotland Yard prison after a local court sentenced him to 15 years
for the attempted murder of Nikola Stedul in 1989.
	   Stedul, now 60, left Yugoslavia as a young man to avoid military
service and settled in Scotland in 1975. At the time of the attack
he was president of the Croatian Movement for Statehood, which
sought to remove Croatia from the then Yugoslav republic.
	   Stedul took eight shots to the head and body from a silenced
pistol outside his home but survived the attempt at his life.
	   ``In a four-hour testimony, Vinko Sindicic maintained innocence
from assassinating Bruno Busic or any other Croatian political
emigre,'' state-run HINA quoted his attorney, Zdenko Haramija, as
saying.
	   According to Haramija, Sindicic was in Paris at the time of the
murder, but he was sitting in a bar and had nothing to do with the
charges raised against him.
	   Haramija added that Sindicic was never employed by UDBA _ the
notorious intelligence agency of former Yugoslavia rumored to be
behind at least 80 political killings of Croat emigres in foreign
countries since 1996.
	   The case is to be continued next week.

FIFA will use only female referees for women's World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Only female referees will be used at
the women's World Cup finals in the United States next year,
soccer's governing body FIFA announced Tuesday.
	   And for their male counterparts, more emphasis will be placed on
psychological well-being as well as physical fitness in the future,
FIFA's Referees Committee agreed.
	   FIFA President Sepp Blatter proposed that a coach of the same
nationality should accompany referees to international tournaments
to protect them ``from external pressures and to give them
technical, psychological and administrative support before, during
and after the game.''
	   This will involve tasks ranging from dealing with local
officials to hailing cabs, according to spokesman Andreas Herren.
	   The idea will be discussed further prior to the preliminaries of
the 2002 World Cup. This is likely to involve more than 700
matches.
	   At its meeting at FIFA's Zurich headquarters, the committee also
discussed a proposal to clamp down on fake injuries. If a player
pretends to have been fouled, the referee should interrupt the
game, award an indirect free kick to the opposing team and caution
the guilty player.
	   The idea will be raised again at a meeting of the rule-making
International Football Association Board in Britain in February
1999.
	   The committee said it was generally satisfied with the quality
of performance in this summer's World Cup finals.
	   Prior to the women's World Cup finals next June 19 to July 10,
the 15 female referees and 16 assistants will attend a workshop
similar to the one before this year's World Cup finals, FIFA said.

Russia's Lebed cuts short visit to Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with controversy over nuclear waste, new quote. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russian political leader Alexander Lebed
cut short a visit to Germany on Tuesday, citing Russia's financial
crisis.
	   But Russian media speculated that the real reason for his abrupt
return was a dispute over nuclear waste shipments to Krasnoyarsk
region, where Lebed is governor.
	   Lebed, seen as a potential candidate to succeed President Boris
Yeltsin, had been scheduled to meet Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer and business executives during a one-day trip to Bonn.
	   He was also supposed to give a speech about the crisis facing
Russia's regions.
	   The Itar-Tass news agency quoted him as saying that his abrupt
departure was prompted by Tuesday's expiration of Russia's 90-day
moratorium on repayment of foreign debts, and that business in his
area was at stake.
	   The agency also reported that Lebed's deputy Alexandra Kulenkova
on Tuesday ordered a ban on nuclear waste shipments from a
Ukrainian power plant, saying the region was poorly paid for
accepting the waste.
	   Russia's NTV television station speculated Lebed returned to
Moscow because the order overstepped his powers and he would have
to defend it before the federal government.
	   ``There may be an urgent need to defend the interests of the
region on the federal level,'' Lebed said before leaving Germany.
He refused to elaborate.
	   The German Society for Foreign Affairs, which had invited Lebed,
said he left Bonn ``head over heels.''
	   There was no official comment from the foreign ministry.
	   Lebed, a former army general, founded his own political party
last year after a failed bid for the presidency in 1996.
	   He was elected governor of Krasnoyarsk, a vast region in
Siberia, this year in what was widely seen as a preparatory bid for
the 2000 presidential elections.
	   He is credited with negotiating the truce ending the war in
breakaway Chechnya while serving as Russia's national security
chief.

	   According to Haramija, Sindicic was in Paris at the time of the
murder, but he was sitting in a bar and had nothing to do with the
charges raised against him.
	   Haramija added that Sindicic was never employed by UDBA _ the
notorious intelligence agency of former Yugoslavia rumored to be
behind at least 80 political killings of Croat emigres in foreign
countries since 1969.
	   The case is to be continued next week.

Portugal looking into calling for extradition of Suharto
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The attorney general's office said
Tuesday that it is examining a Portuguese lawmaker's request to
seek the extradition of former Indonesian President Suharto.
	   The lawmaker, Nuno Correia da Silva, argued in a letter that
Suharto should be extradited for alleged human rights abuses
committed in East Timor _ a former Portuguese territory that
Indonesia invaded in late 1975 and annexed weeks later.
	   ``We're looking at whether it's possible in Portuguese law,''
said Sara Pina, a spokeswoman for the attorney general.
	   Human rights groups have accused Indonesian troops of widespread
abuses in East Timor, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) east of
Jakarta.
	   Correia da Silva argued that his bid to see Suharto extradited
was strengthened by current attempts to extradite former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet to Spain on charges that include
genocide.
	   Pinochet is in London awaiting a House of Lords panel decision
on whether to extradite him. The English High Court quashed the
original arrest warrant against Pinochet on the grounds that he is
immune from prosecution as a former chief of state.
	   Correia da Silva, of Portugal's rightist Popular Party, said his
case to extradite Suharto could be strengthened because the United
Nations still regards Portugal as the legitimate administrative
power in East Timor.
	   Suharto resigned from his post as Indonesia's president in May,
after 32 years in power.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two days of back-and-forth threats and sharp
rhetoric came to a close Tuesday after Israel welcomed a verbal
commitment by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to disavow violence
and forge ahead through peaceful means.
	   The crisis over inflammatory remarks made by Arafat over the
week-end was the latest in a series of flare-ups to plague the
U.S.-brokered land-for-peace accord signed last month in
Washington.
	   Several hurdles still remained however before Israel would start
carrying out a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of West Bank
territory. One day after the pullback was to begin, Israeli
legislators were still debating the Mideast accord. Lawmakers were
getting their first look at withdrawal maps and were to vote late
Tuesday on the deal.
	   Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended plans for
the redeployment and demanded a retraction from Arafat after the
Palestinian leader repeatedly said he would announce statehood in
May and alluded to armed conflict as a means to gain independence.
	   On Tuesday, Arafat opened a news conference by reading a
softened statement directed at the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis. Peace is a strategic choice of the Palestinians,'' Arafat
said. ``We stress that concerning any differences in final status
negotiations, we want to solve these issues by peaceful means,
through negotiations, and not in any other way.''
	   Although Arafat did not entirely drop the possibility of
declaring independence in May, when the current peace accords
expire, his call to solve final status issues including permanent
borders, was viewed as a back-down.
	   Israel termed the remarks ``positive'' and Netanyahu's adviser
David Bar-Illan said the prime minister ``considers this a
retraction.''
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet would still have to review whether the
Palestinians have lived up to their obligations before going ahead
with the pullback from an initial 2 percent. The Cabinet was to
meet Wednesday but the prime minister's office announced the
meeting had been pushed back to Thursday to give more time to the
Palestinians.
	   A statement said that by Thursday, Israel expects the
Palestinians to have jailed 10 of 30 named fugitives, publish a
statement against incitement and a plan to confiscate illegal
weapons. Sections of the Palestinian charter which call for
Israel's destruction are to be amended by the PLO central
committee.
	   According to the peace accord, the larger Palestine National
Council is also expected to address those clauses when it convenes
in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton in Gaza in December.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinians have
met all their commitments so far, such as resuming security
cooperation with Israel. Later this week, the Palestinians plan to
announce the legal framework for confiscating illegal weapons and
on Nov. 23, a committee reviewing cases of incitement will meet for
the first time, Erekat said.
	   Negotiators from both sides met Tuesday to discuss
implementation in several other areas including the release of 250
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails by Friday.
	   Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was to meet
with Arafat's deputy and the speaker of the Palestinian legislature
to resume negotiations on a permanent peace agreement after a
suspension of 18 months.
	   The armed forces chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said
most of the land changing hands in the first pullback would be in
the northern West Bank, around the Palestinian town of Jenin.
Palestinian officials seemed encouraged by the movement.
	   ``The agreement will be implemented at the end of this week,''
said Hassan Asfour.

Items on Flo; Van Hooijdonk, Shearer, Carbonari
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chelsea has offered Norwegian striker Tore Andre
Flo an extension to his contract even though he has started only
one game this season.
	   The west London club, which has a system of rotating its players
so that no one gets totally left out, believes the lanky
25-year-old striker is such a valuable member of the team that it
has offered to add 18 months to his 3 1/2-year contract.
	   ``They want me to stay at the club and it is true that we have
begun talking about that,'' Flo said. ``We have discussed a new
contract but I haven't agreed anything with them yet.''
 &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Nottingham Forest hopes that spies
from Italian club Juventus were impressed by Pierre van Hooijdonk's
goal Monday night, even though his team-mates didn't join in the
celebrations.
	   The tall Dutch striker celebrated by himself after his near post
header in the 2-2 tie with Derby. That was because he'd been on a
3-month strike after criticizing the club and the other players,
saying they weren't capable of keeping Forest in the Premier
League.
	   Monday's goal was Van Hooijdonk's first since his return and
Forest manager Dave Bassett, who would be glad to offload the Dutch
striker at the right price, noted that Juventus had someone at the
game.
	   ``I don't know if they were watching Pierre or not but there was
certainly a Juventus representative in the stadium,'' Bassett said.
 &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Newcastle striker Alan Shearer hopes
to be back in action sooner than expected despite missing England's
game against the Czech Republic on Wednesday with a hamstring
problem.
	   Scorer of eight goals this season, Shearer limped out of
Newcastle's 1-1 tie with Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday and club
officials feared the England captain would be out for several
weeks.
	   But a scan revealed that the injury was less serious than they
had thought and Shearer hopes to be back in action for the Nov. 28
game against Wimbledon.
 &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   DERBY, England (AP) _ Derby manager Jim Smith was delighted with
Horacio Carbonari's first goal for the club Monday. Now he wants
the fans to appreciate the Argentinian's skills as a central
defender.
	   The center-back, who is Derby's record signing at 2.7 million
pounds (dlrs 4.5 million), scored the team's late equalizer in a
2-2 tie with Nottingham Forest. But he has come under fire from the
Derby fans for his performances as a defender.
	   Smith knows Carbonari will come through.
	   ``His first game for the club was excellent against Blackburn
but he injured his knee and he was out for six weeks,'' the County
manager said.
	   ``We then rushed him back again and he was unfortunate we lost
the games he played in and people said it was his fault. He got
down with himself after those results but now he's playing with the
confidence and ability we thought he'd got.
	   ``He's a young man and he's 16 hours away from home,'' Smith
said. ``It's not as if he can go back to see his family at weekends
and he's been living in hotels.''

Solana: Europe, U.S. should cooperate more in defense technology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana on
Tuesday urged Europe and the United States to cooperate more
closely in developing defense-related technology.
	   ``A transatlantic partnership in security needs to be
underpinned by a partnership in technology and industry,'' Solana
told a meeting here.
	   He said ``a new transatlantic dialogue in the area of defense,
trade and industry would be most useful for us to keep in mind the
importance of ensuring that our military forces remain
inter-operable and our defense industrial bases complementary as
well as efficient.''
	   Solana was speaking at the 44th general assembly of the Atlantic
Treaty Association on the theme of ``The New Security Frontiers.''
	   At a meeting in Rome earlier Tuesday, NATO's European allies
pledged to cooperate more in military procurement to end costly
duplication in arms-making and also narrow the large gap in
research and development spending with the United States.
	   Referring to Russia as one of NATO's strategic partners, Solana
said Moscow's ``weight and importance must rest on its ability to
contribute to common solutions, not on its ability to deny them'' _
an apparent reference to differences over how to tackle the Kosovo
crisis.
	   However, Solana stressed that the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint
Council had continued to function through the debate on how to stop
the fighting in the Serb-ruled Yugoslavian province.
	   ``This bodes well for the future,'' he said.

Samller engines for IRL

	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ The Indy Racing League will use smaller
engines through the 2004 racing season, but offered no breakthrough
in its rift with the rival and more establish Indy-car series of
Championship Auto Racing Teams.
	   Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George, who founded
the IRL three years ago, and Leo Mehl, executive director of the
new racing series, announced the new regulations Tuesday said the
smaller engines will enhance safety.
	   ``These rules will ensure stability for IRL participants while
maintaining the principles of the league,'' Mehl said.
	   Two obstacles appear to be keeping the sides apart: the IRL's
use of normally aspirated engines, as opposed to the turbocharged
engines used in CART, and IRL's insistence that its teams be
allowed to buy and work on their own engines. CART requires teams
to lease the engines from the manufacturers.
	   The IRL did not change its stance on either issue.
	   ``We've got a series and we want additional competitors, but
we're going to stay with the principles developed by our founder,
Tony George,'' Mehl said.
	   Most of the well-known racing names remained aligned with CART,
keeping such drivers as Al Unser Jr., Michael Andretti and Bobby
Rahal away from the world's most famous race.
	   The IRL this year dropped one of its controversial rules that
reserved 25 of the 33 starting spots in the Indianapolis 500 to its
own drivers _ one of the reasons for the CART boycott of Indy 500.
	   The IRL's 11-race 1999 season begins Jan. 24 with the Indy 200
at Walt Disney World Speedway in Florida. The new rules take effect
with the 2000 season.
	   The only major change includes a reduction from the 4-liter
engines to a 3.5 liters to slow the cars.
	   Most of the current specifications remain the same. The IRL
owners will be able to update the current engines in use in 1999 to
the new engines at a cost of dlrs 10,000.
	   Mehl also said General Motors, which manufactures the Aurora
engines used by the IRL, has extended its agreement that would have
expired at the end of the 1999 season two more years. Nissan, which

the new specifications, Mehl said.
	   ``I would imagine that other manufacturers would be interested
in our series. We've had numerous discussions. Nobody is going to
manufacture an engine for just one race,'' Mehl said.
	   The IRL will insist any additional manufacturers that enter the
series make their engines and parts available to all teams.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More than 100 people, mostly in their
mid-teens, were arrested Tuesday in clashes with police during
events marking the 25th anniversary of a student uprising against
military rulers.
	   Chanting ``Americans are murders'' and ``down with
imperialism,'' about 10,000 people took part in a march from the
Athens Polytechnic University, site of the revolt, to the United
States embassy, where they burned an American flag before
dispersing peacefully.
	   They were surrounded by more than 5,000 police officers who were
tasked with preventing riots and acts of vandalism from
self-proclaimed anarchist groups seeking confrontations with
police. Every year, the commemoration of the 1973 Athens
Polytechnic revolt is marred by such incidents.
	   Another 5,000 people staged a peaceful march on the United
States consulate in the northern port city of Salonica, while about
4,000 Greek Cypriots staged a rally to the American embassy on the
island of Cyprus.
	   At least 23 people died and hundreds were wounded in the revolt
when the army stormed the campus on Nov. 17, 1973. The actual death
toll has never been firmly established, but it is thought to be
considerably higher.
	   The revolt is credited with helping bring the downfall of
1967-74 military rule. The junta is also blamed for instigating a
1974 coup on Cyprus, which led to Turkey invading and occupying the
northern third of the island.
	   Authorities were also worried about 200 arson attacks this year
that have been carried out by shadowy organizations widely believed
to be linked to the Polytechnic demonstrators.
	   Two cars were firebombed early Tuesday in separate attacks. No
one was hurt.
	   The atmosphere has been further charged by a string of police
scandals and recent government education reforms that have led to
school occupations and teachers' demonstrations.
	   On Monday, Premier Costas Simitis was pelted with eggs and
oranges during a visit to the Polytechnic to lay a wreath at the
memorial.
	   Greece's constitution bans police form entering the grounds of
Athens Polytechnic or other universities except with the permission
of the academic senate.
	   Students and the Communist-led construction workers union
guarded the grounds of the Polytechnic in central Athens.
	   The commemorations for the revolt ends each year with a march to
the U.S. embassy to protest Washington's widely perceived support
of the dictatorship.
	   In January, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns issued a public
apology for Washington's role during the junta. ``I wish my own
country had stood more firmly on the side of democracy and freedom
during those years,'' said Burns.
	   Greece's deadliest terrorist group, November 17, takes its name
from the day the student uprising was crushed. Four Americans and
one U.S. embassy employee have been among the 22 people killed by
the group.

	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least 21 people were killed and
nearly 40 others wounded in two days of heavy fighting between
rival groups of the same clan in southwestern Somalia, witnesses
said Tuesday.
	   Officials, reached on VHF radio, said heavy fighting erupted
Sunday between two groups belonging to the Rahanwein clan in the
district of Sakow in middle Jubba region, about 380 kilometers (240
miles) southwest of the capital Mogadishu.
	   The battles, being waged with assault rifles and
rocket-propelled grenades, broke out Sunday over employment with a
Swedish relief agency developing water supply and health services
in the area.
	   The officials said Moallimweyneh clansmen accused rival Geladleh
clansmen of depriving them of equal employment opportunity within
the aid agency.
	   The two groups are both from the Sakow area, one of the few
regions of Somalia to remain quiet during seven years of civil war
and clan fighting that left Somalia without a central government
since 1991.
	   In the first round of the fighting in the town, six militiamen
and several civilians were killed. Since then, command over the
town of Sakow has changed hands twice, and the fighting has spread
to surrounding villages, forcing residents to flee.
	   Two elders in Mogadishu, Sheikh Qasim Ibrahim Nur and Abdow
Kushub, representing the warring sides, jointly told reporters
Tuesday they were sending a delegation to the region to broker a
truce.

	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least 21 people were killed and

Namibians flow into Botswana amid government crackdown

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ An estimated 1,000 members of the San
ethnic group have fled northwestern Namibia into Botswana amid a
government crackdown on suspected secessionists, local media and
aid workers said Tuesday.
	   Rights workers say the movement of people is part of growing
unrest in the region where Angola, Zambia and Namibia meet. The
refugee presence has contributed to tensions between Botswana and
Namibia, two fairly stable African countries. The unrest also comes
at a time when Namibia is under pressure at home for contributing
troops to Congo's war effort against a rebel movement.
	   ``The (San) people are dead scared. We can't say why for sure,
but they are very, very afraid,'' said Madgalena Boemann, a
spokeswoman for the Working Group of the Indigenous Minorities in
Southern Africa (WIMSA).
	   The group is an umbrella organization that deals with
development issues and legal rights of the San, also known as
Bushmen, throughout southern Africa, where they lead a largely
marginal existence.
	   The San have been fleeing to Botswana over the last ten days.
	   They followed another 450 Namibians who crossed into northern
Botswana in recent weeks. Among that group is the former president
of Namibia's official opposition, Mishake Muyongo. They have been
detained in the northern Botswana border town of Kasane.
	   Namibian President Sam Nujoma has called the group
``terrorists'' and demanded they be sent back. U.N. refugee
officials in Botswana have recommended that the Namibians not be
handed over for fear of persecution.
	   Botswana has appealed to the International Red Cross and the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for help in coping
with the influx, a Botswanan government spokesman, Andrew Sisinye,
said Tuesday.
	   ``We are hoping ... that the people will return voluntarily,''
he said.
	   Field workers for the indigenous peoples' group said the San
village of Chetto, home to nearly 700 people, has been nearly
deserted, along with other villages.
	   The San who fled were members of the 6,000-strong Kxoe
(pronounced Quay) offshoot, a group of the San people who have been
repeatedly denied official recognition by the Namibian government,
Boemann said.
	   She said they may have fled because of a rumor that security
forces operating in the area were targeting them.
	   The security forces have been sweeping through the area to
arrest would-be secessionists.
	   Many of the Kxoe people had been recruited by apartheid-era
South African security forces during its occupation of Namibia.
Nujoma and his now-ruling South West Africa People's Organization
(SWAPO) fought the South Africans during the 1980s liberation
struggle.
	   Phil ya Nangoloh, director of the National Society for Human
Rights in Namibia, said there was a broad-based secessionist
movement brewing among the siLozi-speaking populations concentrated
in southwestern Zambia, Namibia's Caprivi Strip and Angola's
remote, southeastern Cuando Cubango province.
	   The flight of the siLozi speakers, who started leaving the area
three weeks ago, appears to be politically motivated, while the SAN
have been caught up and intimidated by the turmoil.
	   He said the secessionist movement had its roots in ambitions to
establish a siLozi-speaking kingdom in the area. When the British
government granted independence to Zambia in 1964, it also
acknowledged the historic claim to autonomy of the siLozi-speaking
group that is spread across the borders in the tri-nation region.
	   But as with many ethnic groups around the world divided by
national boundaries, the kingdom has never been realized.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ German President Roman Herzog and Crown
Prince Hassan discussed Middle East peacemaking and European
assistance to the region's economic development in a 1 1/2-hour
meeting Tuesday.
	   Hassan told reporters that he had ``constructive and useful''
talks with Herzog, saying the session focused on the future of the
region after a final settlement of the decades-old Middle East
conflict.
	   Standing next to Hassan, Herzog said Germany was considering
additional economic aid to cash-strapped Jordan but declined to
disclose the amount. Government officials have said they expected
German help with several water and infrastructure projects.
	   Germany is one of the main European donors to Jordan. It has
contributed more than dlrs 500 million on various water and
education projects since 1990.
	   Prince Hassan is acting as regent for his brother King Hussein,
who is being treated for cancer in the United States.
	   Herzog is here on the third leg of a Middle East tour that has
taken him to Israel and the Palestinian territories to look
firsthand at the Arab-Israeli conflict. The German president has
largely a ceremonial role.
	   Herzog, accompanied by his wife, Christiane, was greeted by the
crown prince and his Pakistani-wife, Princess Sarvath, after
crossing a rickety bridge across the Jordan River from the West
Bank earlier in the day.
	   He was scheduled to visit several German-financed projects in
Jordan and tour historic and biblical sites before he returns home
Thursday.

U.N. weapons inspectors arrive in Iraq

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors returned Tuesday to
Iraq, saying they would get to work as soon as possible to test
Iraq's pledge to cooperate in the search for its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The arms inspectors have been working for more than seven years
to unearth Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles, but Iraq has frequently blocked their work. The latest
threat of attack by U.S. and British forces produced a renewed
promise to cooperate.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the inspectors, said that
disarmament activities would start Wednesday in earnest.
	   ``We are back. We are ready to work immediately,'' senior
weapons inspector Jaakko Ylitalo told reporters after his C-130
transport plane landed Tuesday morning at the Habaniya military air
base outside Baghdad.
	   Ylitalo was among 86 inspectors from the U.N. team and the
International Atomic Energy Agency who arrived from the Gulf state
of Bahrain, where they were evacuated last week from Iraq when U.S.
airstrikes seemed likely.
	   At the airbase, an Iraqi official told Ylitalo that Iraq had
prepared for the resumption of their work.
	   The threat of military action was averted Sunday when U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced the United States had accepted the
Iraqi government's pledge a day earlier to lift its three-month ban
on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   While U.S. President Bill Clinton has expressed skepticism that
Iraq would cooperate, a top aide to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
insisted Tuesday he anticipated no problems with the renewed
inspections.
	   Gen. Amer al-Saadi, scientific adviser to Saddam, said in a
Cable News Network interview that all would go smoothly if an
accord between Iraq and the United Nations, which ended the last
confrontation in February, was followed.
	   ``All that is resolved through the memorandum of understanding,
what is exactly UNSCOM'S mandate, and the inspector's mandate, and
what we should so, and we will stick to that,'' he said when asked
about possible confrontations.
	   Al-Saadi said Iraq would deal with UNSCOM chief Richard Butler _
whose firing it has demanded.
	   When asked about an arms document that Iraq has refused to turn
over to inspectors, he said Iraq wanted first to discuss the
relevant parts with the inspectors. He did not say that Iraq would
hand it over.
	   He said Iraq would be patient about how long it will take to
begin a comprehensive review on the status of weapon programs that
Iraq wants. But when asked if it would wait months, he replied,
``Naturally there are limits.''
	   With the threat of American and British airstrikes on Iraq over
for now, about 150 U.N. relief workers also returned to Baghdad
from the Jordanian capital of Amman, where they were sent at the
height of the crisis.
	   Once inspectors report they are able to work effectively, the
U.N. Security Council will conduct a review of Iraq's efforts to
eliminate its dangerous weapons. The Iraqi government wants the
review to lead quickly to the lifting of U.N. sanctions _ a move
both the United States and Britain have resisted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have devastated
Iraq's economy. The council has said they will not be lifted until
UNSCOM and the Vienna-base nuclear agency certify that Iraq has
eliminated its lethal weaponry.
	   Cross said UNSCOM was looking forward to ``a productive and
professional relationship'' with the Iraqi government.
	   Before the inspectors left Bahrain, Ms. Cross said they would
quickly test Iraq's pledge of cooperation.
	   ``The Iraqi authorities have promised cooperation. Obviously the
next few days are going to be very important,'' she said.

Judge orders Pinochet to appear in court if immunity overruled

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A judge Tuesday ordered Gen. Augusto Pinochet, now
fit enough to leave a hospital, to appear before a London court on
Dec. 2 _ unless the former Chilean dictator wins a legal battle for
immunity from arrest.
	   Pinochet has not been seen in public since his Oct. 16 arrest on
a Spanish warrant seeking his extradition to face charges of
genocide, murder and torture during his 1973-1990 rule.
	   A Chilean reporter who visited the 82-year-old general in the
north London hospital where he is recuperating from back surgery
said Tuesday that he looked well and walked with the help of a
cane.
	   ``He told me, 'The only thing I lament is that this is lasting
so long and they don't tell when it is going to end','' reporter
Claudio Sanchez said on TV Channel 13, broadcast in the Chilean
capital, Santiago.
	   During an extradition hearing Tuesday, Alun Jones _ a lawyer for
Spanish prosecutors seeking to overturn a High Court ruling that
Pinochet has immunity from arrest _ said that ``information we have
is that he is fit enough to be discharged from the hospital.''
	   Pinochet's lawyers did not dispute that.
	   In a separate hearing later, Judge Andrew Collins altered
Pinochet's bail conditions, saying he now can now leave the
Grovelands Priory hospital, provided the Spanish government and the
London police chief agree. He still has to be under police guard.
	   There was no immediate word on whether Pinochet would be moved.
	   Britain's Home Secretary Jack Straw also has to decide by Dec. 2
whether extradition proceedings can go ahead.
	   The court appearance and the extradition will fall away if the
House of Lords, Britain's highest court, upholds the ruling that
Pinochet has immunity from arrest under British laws covering
treatment of foreign former heads of state.
	   The five-judge tribunal in the Lords have not yet said when it
will announce its ruling.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of secret police after Pinochet ousted
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist. But his lawyers argue that
English law on immunity is so sweeping that it would have covered
Adolf Hitler.
	   Even if he loses in the Lords, Pinochet also could leave Britain
if Home Secretary Straw blocks the extradition proceedings.
	   Under Britain's 1989 Extradition Act, people whose extradition
is sought usually have to appear in the Bow Street court within
days. Pinochet, however, remained in the hospital.
	   But Bow Street Magistrate Graham Parkinson, who handles
extradition proceedings, said Tuesday he now wanted Pinochet to be
brought to the court.
	   ``Some people are more well-known than others,'' he said. ``That
does not mean the court should treat them in a different way.''

British Aerospace in cooperation with Polish military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ British Aerospace signed a contract with a
Polish parts supplier for its military planes and also offered a
wider plan for modernizing the country's aerospace industry.
	   European companies and U.S. giant Boeing are competing to help
Poland overhaul its defense industry and supply its air force with
new fighter planes to bring it up to NATO standards.
	   The deal with the PZL Mielec plant to make parts for British
Aerospace's Hawk plane is expected to be the beginning of wider
cooperation.
	   ``It is a small start from which we expect more to develop,''
said BAe representative John Neilson. Terms of the contract were
not announced. The Hawk is produced both in training versions and
as a light jetfighter.
	   British Aerospace representatives held talks Monday and Tuesday
with Polish officials on a British-Swedish-German offer of
cooperation with Polish military aircraft producers.
	   The plan also includes leasing Hawks to Poland, modernizing the
country's Soviet-built MiG planes and training Polish military
pilots in Britain's Royal Air Force.
	   The need to modernize Poland's air force was highlighted by a
recent fatal crash of a Polish-built Iskra, the third this year.
The plane is the air force's main training plane.
	   Poland and two other former Soviet satellites _ Hungary and the
Czech Republic _ will join NATO next year to form a new eastern
front for the Western military alliance.

Court case to oust Jehovah's Witnesses in Moscow resumes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A civil trial to ban Jehovah's Witnesses from
operating in Moscow resumed Tuesday, the first time prosecutors
have applied Russia's controversial religion law in court to try to
disband religious groups.
	   In the case, which opened in September but was delayed until
Tuesday, prosecutors argued that the Jehovah's Witnesses destroy
families, foster hatred and drive their members to insanity and
suicide.
	   They say the group should be dissolved in Russia and its
activities banned under a religion law passed last year that gives
the government the right to disband any religious group it thinks
is inciting hatred or intolerant behavior.
	   Western leaders say the law, designed to strengthen the Russian
Orthodox Church and restrict foreign religions and cults that many
Russians consider dangerous, contradicts Russia's constitutional
right to freedom of religion.
	   If banned in Russia, the Jehovah's Witnesses would no longer
have the right to express their beliefs publicly, hold worship
services, rent property, or distribute literature.
	   In Tuesday's trial, prosecutors tried to establish that the
Jehovah's Witnesses are intolerant because they claim theirs is the
one true religion.
	   They also said the group destroys families because the Jehovah's
Witness practice of not celebrating national holidays creates rifts
between family members, and their general refusal of blood
transfusions threatens lives.
	   Defense lawyers countered that Jehovah's Witnesses are not
forced into the religion, and stressed that the case violates the
Russian Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.
	   ``This should be a warning to all religious minorities in Moscow
and in Russia,'' said John Burns, a defense lawyer who specializes
in international human rights. ``History shows that in Nazi
Germany, Jehovah's Witnesses were among the first to be put in
concentration camps by persecutors, and people here are looking at
perhaps the early stages of a Nazi Germany state.''
	   Jehovah's Witnesses claim to be the fifth-largest Christian
group in Russia, with about 10,000 members in Moscow and more than
250,000 across the country.
	   Russian prosecutors have conducted four separate criminal
investigations into the Jehovah's Witnesses but all were dismissed
for lack of evidence, said Judah Schroeder, spokesman for the
Jehovah's Witnesses headquarters in New York. He said Tuesday's
trial was the first time the religion law has been tested in court.
	   Burns said he was discouraged by what he called the judge's
favoritism toward the prosecution. The judge refused to grant a
number of motions to the defense, including one to call foreign
witnesses to establish that the Jehovah's Witnesses are not a cult.
	   Russia's Orthodox Church said Tuesday it ``considers Jehovah's
Witnesses a sect and does not welcome their activity on Russian
territory,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russian officials promised the West that they would implement
the law leniently, and have not kicked out all religious groups
that haven't been in Russia for more than 15 years, as the law
requires.
	   Still, they have denied return visas to missionaries and pastors
under the law.

Spurs defender leads England against Czechs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEMBLEY, England (AP) _ With Alan Shearer, Paul Ince and Tony
Adams absent from the squad, Sol Campbell will be England's captain
when the team faces the Czech Republic in Wednesday's friendly
game.
	   The 24-year-old Tottenham center-back will lead England for the
second time having been captain when England played Belgium in a
pre-World Cup game in Morocco in June.
	   ``Sol leads by example and the players respond to him,'' said
England coach Glenn Hoddle. ``He did a good job when he led the
team in Morocco but Wembley will be different.
	   ``It is another part of his international experience. I'm sure
it will be a proud occasion for him and rightly so. Some time in
the future, he could be earmarked for the job full-time.
	   ``The crowd respond to Sol too. I'm sure they will get behind
him and the team.''

Sudan revives request for U.N. investigation of U.S. bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Sudan has revived its request for a U.N.
investigation into the U.S. attack on a Khartoum factory in the
face of Washington's failure to prove the plant made chemical
weapons, the Sudanese foreign minister said Tuesday.
	   World leaders by now should be satisfied that the U.S.
allegations were baseless, Mustafa Osman Ismail told reporters on
an unprecedented top-level trip to build relations and business
between European nations and internationally isolated Sudan.
	   ``They are insisting on sending an investigating team to Iraq,
and insisting on not sending an investigating team to Sudan,''
Ismail said. ``It is quite clear that in all the allegations it has
against Sudan, it has no proof.''
	   The United States destroyed the Khartoum factory in August after
bombings at two U.S. embassies in Africa, saying the plant made
chemical arms and had links to Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden.
	   A simultaneous attack hit an Afghanistan site that Washington
said was a terrorist camp funded by the Saudi tycoon.
	   Sudan insisted the plant made only pharmaceuticals.
	   On Monday, Sudan notified the Security Council that U.S.-Sudan
efforts to resolve their dispute about the nature of the plant had
failed, Ismail said.
	   Sudan renewed its request for a U.N. investigating team, he
said. There was no immediate word on the United Nations' response.
	   The United States considers Sudan a sponsor of terrorism and has
imposed trade and other economic sanctions.
	   Ismail's trip is the highest-level mission to Europe by Sudan's
northern-based, Islamic-dominated government, which is fighting
rebels in the Christian and animist south. Ismail is trying to
build European ties and raise investment for Sudan, saying the
government is making a quick transition to a more open economy.
	   His next stop is Germany.

IMF considers loan to Belarus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund said
Tuesday it may provide dlrs 100 million in loans to Belarus next
year if the country begins reforming its Soviet-style economy.
	   The Belarusian government agreed to some IMF demands during two
weeks of negotiations in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, Yulia
Lyskova, an aide to the chief of the IMF mission in Belarus, said
Tuesday. The talks ended Tuesday.
	   If the government delivers on these promises and agrees to meet
the rest of the IMF demands during the next round of talks planned
for December, ``it would be possible to discuss the credit of about
dlrs 100 million,'' Lyskova told The Associated Press.
	   The money would be released in February or March, she said.
	   The announcement comes two weeks after a delegation from the
World Bank left Belarus saying no aid will be provided until the
country begins economic reforms.
	   Belarus has one of the most unreformed economies in the former
Soviet Union, with most enterprises still under state control. It
was rocked by an economic crisis this spring, with a dramatic slump
in its currency prompting the government to order strict price
controls.
	   The current economic troubles in Russia _ traditionally the main
customer for Belarusian goods _ has made Belarus' situation even
worse.
	   Pyotr Prokopovich, head of Belarus' National Bank, praised the
results of the IMF talks.
	   ``We have reached many constructive decisions and we hope that
the IMF mission will continue its work in December,'' Prokopovich
said.
	   The World Bank has repeatedly criticized Belarus for making
virtually no changes to its economy since the 1991 Soviet collapse,
and refusing to abide by an agreement to introduce a single
exchange rate.
	   Belarus uses five different exchange rates for conversions
between its ruble and the U.S. dollar. World Bank officials have
said the lack of a single, objective rate has prevented the
accumulation of hard-currency reserves and inaccurately reflected
the country's health in trade and production.

Court grants delay of Trinidadian hangings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ An appeals court has ruled that
nine men scheduled to be hanged this week in Trinidad and Tobago
may live to complain about prison conditions to the British Privy
Council.
	   Ten other prisoners are also included in the decision by the
Trinidadian Court of Appeals on Monday. The convicts argue their
death sentences should be overturned because they have already
suffered inhumanely in prisons while on death row.
	   On Monday, Trinidad's Court of Appeal let stand a stay of
execution until the court hears further arguments about prison
conditions on Nov. 26.
	   ``It seems clear that our duty is to preserve the lives of these
men until one can have the advantage of the judgment of the Privy
Council,'' said Chief Justice Michael de la Bastide. The Privy
Council serves as the supreme court for most former British
colonies in the Caribbean.
	   The ruling comes as Britain pressures its former colonies to
eliminate the death penalty. In response, Caribbean countries
including Trinidad and Tobago are planning to create a new supreme
court.
	   They claim the death penalty is needed to curb crime brought by
drug trafficking through the Caribbean.
	   The nine men were to be executed Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
for the 1994 drug-related murder of a family in southern Trinidad.
	   In a response to the stay of execution, prosecutors argued in
documents that the motion was ``frivolous and vexatious.''
	   Monday evening, attorney general Ramesh Maharaj said the
government ``has no alternative but to await any decision of the
Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.''
	   More than 100 convicted killers are on Trinidad's death row, but
there has only been one execution in the last five years.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Europe's top soccer clubs on Tuesday
endorsed plans for a new 32-team Champions' League designed to
counter a breakaway Super League proposed by Media Partners, news
reports said.
	   The accord was reached at a meeting of 14 teams at a Madrid
hotel, including Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Ajax and
Manchester United, the state-owned news agency Efe said.
	   The collective, dubbed the G-14, said it accepted UEFA's
proposal to expand the Champions' League from 24 to 32 teams, and
urged European football's governing body to implement the new
format starting next season.
	   They also formed a subgroup of five teams _ Real Madrid, AC
Milan, Bayern Munich, Olympique Marseille and Oporto _ to discuss
the new format with UEFA. UEFA's executive committee is expected to
give the reforms a final approval at a meeting in Jerusalem on
December 10.
	   Real Madrid Chairman Lorenzo Sanz, who was voted president of
the G-14, said the group wanted ``to work with UEFA. Our objective
is not to destroy but to help,'' Efe quoted him as saying.
	   Stressing the lobbying power of the group, Sanz added, ``It
should not be forgotten that collectively we hold 70 titles and we
generate almost all the television rights.''
	   The G-14, due to meet again in Madrid on Dec. 18, called on UEFA
to renegotiate television contracts in accordance with the new
format.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Tuesday reiterated his opposition
to a Super League. ``Such a project is not possible,'' he said,
promising that his organization would work with UEFA to protect the
Champions League.
	   ``The prospect may be appealing in itself, especially with large
financial rewards on offer, but we should not fail to understand
that the organization of football solely for the profit motive, by
unqualified sporting entities, would provoke anarchy in our
sport,'' he added.
	   Meanwhile, the G-14 teams meeting in Madrid, whose lineups are
studded with international stars, also called for a greater say in
whether to allow players to put aside their club duties when called
up by their national squad, Efe reported.
	   The group also complained about the current use of sanctions
against clubs, rejecting outright the UEFA ban on Fiorentina after
an object thrown from the terraces hit an official on the field.
	   ``Fiorentina should not be excluded from European soccer because
of a vandal,'' Milan's deputy chairman Adriano Galliani told Efe.
	   ``One thing is what happens on the field and another what
happens on the terraces,'' he added.

French Finance Minister says growth will be 2.7 percent

	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said
Tuesday that France's growth rate for 1999 would be 2.7 percent,
above the prediction made by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.
	   In its semi-annual report made public Tuesday, the OECD reduced
its earlier prevision for French growth from 2.8 percent to 2.4
percent.
	   Strauss-Kahn said the OECD figure did not taken into account the
evolution of domestic demand and said France's 1999 growth rate
would be 2.7 percent.
	   The OECD based its revision of the 1999 growth rate on what it
said was a slowing down in consumption.

Premier: asylum-seeking Kurdish leader must renounce terrorism

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Kurds marched through Rome in a 10,000-strong
protest Tuesday to demand asylum for their captured rebel leader _
a demand Italy's premier said would be denied unless Abdullah
Ocalan has truly renounced terrorism.
	   The march was the largest yet in days of growing protests since
Italian police arrested Ocalan on his arrival at Rome's airport
Thursday.
	   Kurds are streaming into Rome and launching rallies and hunger
strikes across Europe in opposition to Turkey's request he be
extradited for trial. More than 4,000 protested Tuesday outside the
Interior Ministry in Bonn, Germany. In Moscow, two Kurds were
hospitalized after setting themselves on fire outside Parliament.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which is
fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey. The
14-year-old conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Supporters marched past the Colosseum and into Piazza Venezia on
Tuesday, waving red flags and making the streets of downtown Rome
ring with their cries.
	   Kneeling in the piazza, they chanted, ``We love you, Ocalan. We
are with you, Ocalan. We will die for you, Ocalan.''
	   ``We want to show the world that PKK is not a terrorist
organization. It is a people's organization,'' said Mustafa
Rizgari, who flew from Copenhagen with about 40 other Kurds to show
solidarity with the rebel leader.
	   ``If a million people love him, how can he be a terrorist?''
Rizgari asked.
	   Premier Massimo D'Alema told Parliament's lower house Tuesday
that Ocalan has ``rejected all terrorist actions'' in a statement
issued Monday. ``Now it's a matter of seeing whether he sticks to
it.''
	   ``Our country doesn't intend to be a host for terrorist
activities,'' D'Alema told lawmakers.
	   Turkey, one of Italy's NATO allies and a strong trading partner,
is pushing hard for the extradition.
	   However, extradition appears unlikely because Ocalan is on trial
in absentia for capital crimes in Turkey. Italy's courts have
consistently forbidden extraditing suspects to a country where they
could be executed.
	   ``This is not an act of hostility toward Turkey, but one of
respect for our own laws, history and values,'' said D'Alema, a day
after a gloves-off warning to Turkey that Italy wouldn't give in to
``threats, pressure,'' or ``blackmail.''
	   In his statement, Ocalan said he wanted to work for a peaceful
solution to the bitter Kurdish conflict.
	   Syria recently expelled Ocalan from his longtime haven under
pressure from Turkey. Ocalan then sought asylum in Russia, but was
rebuffed. From Moscow, he flew to Rome, where he wound up in police
custody.
	   Ocalan is believed held in a military hospital in Rome.
Supporters are camped out outside by the hundreds.
	   The Kurdish cause enjoys considerable sympathy in Europe. The
so-called Kurdish parliament-in-exile met recently in Rome, which
may have encouraged Ocalan to seek asylum in Italy, D'Alema said.
	   In Turkey, however, many Turks are incensed at what they see as
Italy's harboring of a terrorist.
	   In Ankara on Tuesday, hundreds of Turks demonstrated outside the
Italian Embassy, burning an Italian flag.
	   ``If he's not handed over, we'll walk to Italy, we'll annex
Italy, we'll turn Italy upside down!'' one demonstrator screamed
into a loudspeaker.
	   Turkish police detained 72 people in Istanbul following clashes
between Ocalan supporters and passers-by. Another 100 people were
detained at a pro-Ocalan demonstration in the southern city of
Mersin, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Turkey is so eager to get Ocalan back that it has taken steps
toward abolishing capital punishment.
	   Germany also has an outstanding warrant for him issued in 1990
on terrorism-related charges. But Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
said Tuesday in Rome that Germany would not ask for his
extradition. Ocalan now is ``a matter for Italy,'' he said.

Angolan government evasive about reports that army attacking rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A senior official Tuesday refused to
comment on reports that the army had surrounded strongholds of the
former rebel group UNITA, but hinted that government forces were
poised to mount an attack.
	   ``The tension has been going on for a long time,'' government
spokesman Higino Carneiro told reporters, referring to government
claims that UNITA has a 30,000-strong guerilla army hidden in the
jungle.
	   ``If there are troops under (UNITA leader Jonas) Savimbi's
orders, then obviously the government has to take a firm stance ...
That means using the armed forces,'' Carneiro said.
	   The tension reflected a sharp increase in hostile accusations in
recent weeks between the former foes, who signed a United
Nations-brokered peace deal in 1994 to end their two-decade civil
war.
	   The two sides reportedly have engaged in skirmishes in remote
areas of the country in recent months.
	   Government forces have encircled the area around the central
highland towns of Andulo and Bailundo, where the UNITA leadership
lives, according to a report Tuesday by Voice of America radio.
	   Witnesses reported fighting and government casualties, the radio
said.
	   VOA cited unidentified government sources as saying the plan was
to capture or kill the UNITA leadership.
	   UNITA spokesman Marcial Dachala, contacted by satellite
telephone, told The Associated Press he was speaking from Bailundo
and that he was ``not worried.''
	   But it was not possible to confirm that he was in the town, and
he declined to give straight answers to repeated questions about
the military situation in the area.
	   He said UNITA remained committed to a peaceful solution to
Angola's problems.
	   Carneiro was speaking after a routine meeting with the U.N.
envoy to Angola Issa Diallo to discuss the delayed implementation
of the peace accord.
	   Carneiro said the regular meetings had become ``a farce. They
don't get us anywhere.''
	   He also chided the international community for not taking a
tougher stance against UNITA, which is under U.N. sanctions for
refusing to handover the areas it controls to the government and
keeping an armed force.
	   UNITA has accused the government of human rights abuses against
its supporters in areas already handed over.
	   Diallo told reporters there was ``a great crisis'' in the peace
process, but insisted that ``the worst can be prevented.''
	   A 1991 peace deal collapsed the following year when UNITA _ the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ refused to
accept its defeat in the vast southwest African nation's first
democratic elections.
	   Civil war broke out after the country's 1975 independence from
Portugal. About 500,000 people are thought to have died in the
fighting.

 &UR; Arafat defuses crisis with Israel by disavowing violence

Cabinet pushed back to Thursday; comments; Changes byline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two days of back-and-forth threats and sharp
rhetoric came to a close Tuesday after Israel welcomed a verbal
commitment by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to disavow violence
and forge ahead through peaceful means.
	   The crisis over inflammatory remarks made by Arafat over the
weekend was the latest flare-up to plague the U.S.-brokered
land-for-peace accord signed last month in Washington.
	   Several hurdles still remained however before Israel would start
carrying out a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of West Bank
territory. One day after the pullback was to begin, Israeli
legislators were still debating the Mideast accord. Lawmakers were
getting their first look at withdrawal maps and were to vote late
Tuesday on the deal.
	   Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended plans for
the redeployment and demanded a retraction from Arafat after the
Palestinian leader repeatedly said he would announce statehood in
May and alluded to armed conflict as a means to gain independence.
	   On Tuesday, Arafat opened a news conference by reading a
softened statement directed at the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis. Peace is a strategic choice of the Palestinians,'' Arafat
said. ``We stress that concerning any differences in final status
negotiations, we want to solve these issues by peaceful means,
through negotiations, and not in any other way.''
	   Although Arafat did not entirely drop the possibility of
declaring independence in May, when the current peace accords
expire, his call to solve final status issues including permanent
borders, was viewed as a backing down.
	   Israel termed the remarks ``positive'' and Netanyahu's adviser
David Bar-Illan said the prime minister ``considers this a
retraction.''
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet would still have to review whether the
Palestinians have lived up to their obligations before going ahead
with the pullback from an initial 2 percent. The Cabinet was to
meet Wednesday but the prime minister's office announced the
meeting had been pushed back to Thursday to give more time to the
Palestinians.
	   A statement said that by Thursday, Israel expects the
Palestinians to have jailed 10 of 30 named fugitives, publish a
statement against incitement and a plan to confiscate illegal
weapons. Sections of the Palestinian charter which call for
Israel's destruction are to be amended by the PLO central
committee.
	   According to the peace accord, the larger Palestine National
Council is also expected to address those clauses when it convenes
in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton in Gaza in December.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinians have
met all their commitments so far, such as resuming security
cooperation with Israel. Later this week, the Palestinians plan to
announce the legal framework for confiscating illegal weapons and
on Nov. 23, a committee reviewing cases of incitement will meet for
the first time, Erekat said.
	   Negotiators from both sides met Tuesday to discuss
implementation in several other areas including the release of 250
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails by Friday.
	   On Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was to meet
with Arafat's deputy and the speaker of the Palestinian legislature
to resume negotiations on a permanent peace agreement after a
suspension of 18 months.
	   The armed forces chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said
most of the land changing hands in the first pullback would be in
the northern West Bank, around the Palestinian town of Jenin.
Palestinian officials seemed encouraged by the movement.
	   ``The agreement will be implemented at the end of this week,''
said Hassan Asfour.

Estranged rebel attempts to assassinate Sudanese rebel chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ An estranged Sudanese rebel general tried
to assassinate rebel chief John Garang in a weekend gunbattle in
the Kenyan capital Nairobi, the rebel group and a newspaper said
Tuesday.
	   Both Garang, who is chief of the Sudan People's Liberation Army,
and Maj.-Gen. Kerubino Kwanyin Bol, a rebel leader who had defected
to the government in April 1997 and rejoined the rebels in January,
have homes in Nairobi.
	   The friction underscored rivalries in the Sudanese rebel
movement, which has been fighting a 15-year civil war against the
government in Khartoum for control of south Sudan. The war has left
more than 1.5 million Sudanese dead, mired any possible development
and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes.
	   The SPLA said in a statement that Kerubino, backed by the
Sudanese government, had organized a hit squad of 20 men to
assassinate Garang and a number of other senior rebel officials.
	   It said the squad arrived at Garang's residence Sunday to kill
him, but Kenyan police chased them off.
	   However, in a conflicting account, the private Kenya Television
Network said Kerubino said in an interview Tuesday that the
face-off took place at a local police station, and not at Garang's
residence.
	   Kerubino claimed that Garang and several of his soldiers arrived
at the police station armed and ordered the police officers to hand
him over to Garang's men.
	   ``From there I would be killed or put in prison,'' Kerubino said
on KTN. He did not say when this took place or how he evaded
capture.
	   A report in the independent Daily Nation newspaper said the
incident took place Saturday at Garang's home, and that an ensuing
30-minute gun battle left one of Garang's men dead, before Kenyan
police arrived and chase the assailants away.
	   The newspaper cited an informed source as saying eight
supporters of Kerubino raided Garang's home with the intention of
assassinating him and taking over control of the SPLA.
	   A police spokesman contacted Tuesday refused to comment, and
said all queries should be addressed to the Foreign Ministry, which
also declined comment.
	   An official at the Zambian High Commission in Nairobi confirmed
to The AP that following the gunbattle, Kerubino and three of his
supporters sought refuge at the diplomatic mission, but were
eventually asked to leave.
	   The SPLA statement said the rebel organization ``condemns this
callous and uncivilized behavior and acts of terrorism that is
being extended, practiced and exercised in a friendly and
neighboring country that is a haven to our refugees and a route for
humanitarian assistance to the people of New Sudan.''
	   ``We cannot turn the streets of Nairobi into scenes of
terrorism.''
	   Last week, Kerubino told reporters that SPLA officials had
confiscated his car and were harrassing him.
	   The SPLA responded Tuesday saying it was ``a complete
fabrication.'' It said Kenyan police had searched Kerubino's home
for guns and a long-range communication radio that was interfering
with police work and therefore arrested him.

Illegal tap into oil pipeline causes spill in Siberia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An illegal tap siphoning oil out of a pipeline
carrying low-grade oil has caused an oil spill in Siberia,
officials said Tuesday.
	   Thieves tapped into the pipeline carrying oil from a refinery in
the Siberian city of Omsk to western Russia, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported, citing the Uraltransnefteprovod company, which
operates the pipeline.
	   The illegal tap caused a valve on the highly pressurized
pipeline to burst, sending fuel gushing out into a ``quickly
growing oil lake,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   It did not specify the size of the spill, or its exact location.
	   This is the eighth illegal tap into the pipeline this year,
officials said. A criminal investigation has been launched into
those cases, but no suspects have been caught, said local
administration chief Mikhail Gorin, according to ITAR-Tass.

Yugos, Albanians at home again; Del Piero, Owen, Bergkamp missing
</HEADLINE>
through injury
 &UR; Eds: ADDS extra exhibition games &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Yugoslavia and Albania are glad to be playing at
home again. Alessandro Del Piero, Michael Owen and Dennis Bergkamp
are unhappy they're not playing at all.
	   Wednesday is Europe's final big night of international soccer
for 1998, with Yugoslavia and Albania playing on home soil again
after months of political strife and postponements.
	   With security problems finally out of the way, Yugoslavia and
Albania have been given the go-ahead to play their Euro 2000
qualifying games against Ireland and Greece in Belgrade and Tirana.
	   Other qualifying games Wednesday are: Northern Ireland vs.
Moldova, Malta vs. Macedonia and San Marino vs. Cyprus.
	   But the most eye-catching games of the night are friendlies _
Italy vs. Spain, Germany vs. the Netherlands, England vs. the Czech
Republic and Brazil vs. Russia.
	   Some of the big names are out with injuries, though, including
Del Piero, Owen, Bergkamp, Alan Shearer, Edgar Davids and Ronald de
Boer.
	   The threat of NATO air strikes on military targets in Yugoslavia
over the conflict in Kosovo forced UEFA to postpone the national
team's Oct. 10 Group 8 game against the Irish in Belgrade. When
tensions eased, the game was given the go-ahead for Wednesday.
	   The Yugoslavs are playing their first qualifying game of the
competition, while the Irish already have a maximum six points from
victories over Croatia and Malta. In the same group, Macedonia is
strongly favored to win at point-less Malta.
	   Due to civil unrest, Albania has not played a home game since
November of 1996. The Greek team preparing for Wednesday's Group 2
game at Tirana's Qemal Stafa had a police escort during its
training session.
	   With only one point from two away games, the Albanians are last
in the group. The Greeks bid to replace Latvia as group leader by
winning in Tirana.
	   A 5-0 Northern Ireland victory over Moldova would lift Lawrie
McMenemy's team from fourth to top of Group 3 because Finland,
Turkey and Germany aren't involved in qualifying games.
	   San Marino has little hope of its first ever European
Championship victory when it hosts a Cypriot team that downed
favored Spain 3-2 in Group 6.
	   Although no Euro 2000 points are at stake, the games at
Gelsenkirchen, Salerno and Wembley are valuable in terms of
prestige.
	   The Germans, Dutch, Italians and Spaniards have relatively new
coaches, while England's Glenn Hoddle has been under fire after
some poor Euro 2000 performances.
	   German coach Erich Ribbeck has recalled 37-year-old Lothar
Matthaeus to the position of libero and 31-year-old Andreas Moeller
to midfield. Christian Woerns, who completed a two-game suspension
after his World Cup expulsion against Croatia, is back in defense.
	   Matthaeus, who made his international debut against the Dutch in
1980, believes he still has a role to play in the national team.
	   ``I hope I can show the fans that the so-called `old man' can
still do his job,'' he said.
	   Frank Rijkaard, who took over as Dutch coach after the World
Cup, is unable to call up injured stars Bergkamp, Davids, Aron
Winter and Ronald de Boer. PSV Eindhoven striker Ruud van
Nistelrooy and midfielder Dries Boussatta of AZ Alkmaar will make
their debuts.
	   The game in Gelsenkirchen will go ahead amid strong security
because Germany-Netherlands games often attract serious fan
violence.
	   Coincidentally, Italy's game against Spain is taking place at
the same stadium where a match official was hit by a home-made bomb
thrown by a fan during the UEFA Cup game between Fiorentina and
Grasshoppers of Zurich two weeks ago. UEFA kicked Fiorentina out of
the competition and awarded the game to Grasshoppers.
	   Italian coach Dino Zoff likely will field Francesco Totti and
Filippo Inzaghi together for the first time in attack because
injuries have robbed him of Del Piero, Pierluigi Casiraghi and
Nicola Ventola.
	   ``We have many good players so we can do without those who are
injured,'' said Zoff, who replaced Cesare Maldini after Italy's
World Cup flop.
	   Spanish coach Jose Antonio Camacho has broken with tradition and
chosen only one player each from powerhouses Real Madrid (striker
Raul Gonzalez) and Barcelona (defender Sergi Barjuan).
	   Along with Valencia goalkeeper Santiago Canizares, they were the
only players on Spain's World Cup squad in France.
	   With Shearer, Owen and Paul Scholes all ruled out through
injury, England coach Hoddle may have to call on an aging
strikeforce of 34-year-old Ian Wright and 31-year-old Dion Dublin
against the Czechs at Wembley.
	   Hoddle badly needs a good performance and result against the
Czechs after a dismal run. After losing to Sweden, the English were
held 0-0 at home by Bulgaria and looked far from convincing in a
3-0 victory over Luxembourg.
	   The Czechs will be without AS Roma midfielder Pavel Nedved, who
is suffering from a knee injury. But the squad contains seven of
the team who played in the Euro '96 final against Germany at
Wembley.
	   In other exhibition games Wednesday, Egypt hosts Norway, Belgium
welcomes neighbor Luxembourg, Portugal faces Israel and Hungary
meets Switzerland.

Government receives NATO's request for troop deployment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ NATO requested Tuesday Macedonia's
permission to deploy a rapid reaction force on its territory to to
assist peace monitors in neighboring Serbia's Kosovo province, the
Macedonian Foreign Ministry said.
	   The requested was made to Jovan Tegovski, the Macedonian
ambassador at NATO headquarters in Brussels, who was summoned home
for an official government response expected on Wednesday. Most
likely it will be positive.
	   Last Friday, NATO approved plans for a rapid reaction force,
1,200-1,800-strong, to be deployed to rescue unarmed international
verifiers in Kosovo should they come under attack or in a
threatening situation.
	   The Foreign Ministry said NATO's request was ``crucial'' and the
answer to it would determine the country's ``future integration
into European and Western structures, peace in Kosovo and the
stability of the region.''
	   The 2,000-strong Kosovo Verification Mission is currently being
assembled dby the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
	   Its chief duty is to verify that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic complies with a U.S.-brokered, Oct. 12 peace agreement on
the strife-torn Serbian province.
	   Hundreds of people have died and hundreds of thousands displaced
in eight month of bloody conflict between ethnic Albanians, who
make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, and Serb police and
military forces.
	   Kosovo is the southern province of Serbia, the dominant republic
of Yugoslavia. It borders Macedonia to the north.
	   NATO's request came ahead of an imminent change of government in
Macedonia, following last month's parliamentary elections in which
a conservative center-right coalition ousted incumbent
ex-Communists.
	   Both the outgoing and the incoming governments place importance
on having good relations with both NATO and Yugoslavia _ a delicate
balancing act, considering Western condemnation of Serbia's harsh
crackdown on Kosovo's Albanians.
	   Government spokesman Ljuben Paunovski said Tuesday Macedonia's
willingness to allow NATO deployment on its soil was a sign of the
country's ``cooperative approach'' to the Kosovo crisis.
	   On Sunday, Yugoslav authorities warned Macedonia against
allowing NATO troop deployment on its territory.
	   Macedonia was the only former Yugoslavia republic which seceded
without bloodshed from the six-republic federation in 1991.

Peru's Fujimori says he won't free imprisoned American
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori said Peru will not
free a U.S. woman serving a life sentence for terrorism, even if an
international court rules it should, a leading newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   New York-native Lori Berenson, 29, was convicted by a military
judge in 1996 of helping leftist rebels plan an assault on Peru's
Congress that the authorities thwarted.
	   The Washington-based Inter-American Human Rights Commission is
reviewing her case, and if it finds that her rights were violated,
it will send the case to the Inter-American Human Rights Court,
which could order Peru to release her.
	   ``There will be no rulings freeing terrorists such as ... Lori
Berenson,'' Fujimori was quoted as saying in Peru's largest
newspaper, El Comercio, in comments Monday at the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum in Malaysia.
	   ``This is bad news,'' said Lori's mother, Rhoda Berenson, in a
telephone interview from her New York home. ``It confirms the fact
that Peru continues ignoring international standards of human
rights.''
	   Berenson's parents argue that their daughter is innocent and did
not receive a fair trial by the secretive military court.
	   Military courts have been used to imprison thousands of
suspected rebels during Peru's bloody war against leftist
insurgents.
	   Berenson, a former Massachusetts Institute of Technology
student, suffers from numerous health problems aggravated by three
years in the frigid Yanamayo prison, 12,700 feet (3,900 meters)
high in Peru's Andes mountains. She was transferred on Oct. 7 to
the lower-lying Socabaya prison, 465 miles (750 kilometers)
southeast of Lima, for medical tests.

 &UR; With Meteor Storm &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Satellite operators were relieved to have a
quiet night as the Earth passed Tuesday through the tail of a comet
that peppered the atmosphere with tiny bits of space junk zipping
along at 155,000 mph (250,000 kph).
	   ``We've got good news so far. We have no reports of satellite
damage,'' Greg Hughes of Aerospace Corp., which tracks hundreds of
military communications satellites, said Tuesday morning.
	   He cautioned, however, that ``we have about 24 hours more of
this thing.''
	   Frank O'Donnell, a spokesman for the U.S. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
said ``it looks like it was a pretty clean pass'' and there was no
sign of any satellite damage.
	   The most intense meteor storm Earth has experienced in three
decades comes as the planet passes through the long tail of the
Comet Tempel-Tuttle. Experts had said the chances were small of a
satellite actually being damaged, but operators worked to reduce
the risk anyway.
	   They sent signals up to turn solar panels edgewise to the storm
and, in come cases, maneuvered satellites into safer orbits to
reduce the chance of damaging blows that could disrupt
communications and navigation services for millions of people.
	   The debris particles, most no bigger than a grain of sand, can
bore holes in solar panels, damage lenses, blast away mirror
coatings or cause harmful electrical charges.
	   ``The chances of any one satellite getting smacked by a particle
is probably less than one in one thousand, but on the other hand,
some of these satellites are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,
so you do take whatever precautions you can,'' said Don Yeomans, a
senior research scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
	   The Hubble telescope was turned away from the storm to protect
lens surfaces. And the crew of Russia's Mir space station planned
to wait out the worst of the storm in their emergency escape
vehicle.
	   Most military satellites are built to withstand attack and so
have better protection from the tiny meteors. NASA planned to
reposition six of its 22 satellites to present a smaller target.
Others were to be powered down for the worst part of the storm.

Cigarette smoking on rise at colleges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Cigarette smoking is on the rise among U.S.
college students, jumping 28 percent in four years and causing
health advocates to warn the nation may face more tobacco-caused
disease.
	   ``The rise in this group is really an alarming sign,'' said
Henry Wechsler of Harvard University, whose study appears in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
	   Wechsler's findings aren't a surprise _ smoking already had
risen among teen-agers by 32 percent in the 1990s. So once those
teens hit college, the rates among college students were sure to
rise, too.
	   But the findings show that health officials must target college
students to try to get them to quit, said Dr. Donald Sharp of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
	   Until now, college students largely have been ignored by
anti-tobacco programs. Historically, they were far less likely to
smoke than less educated Americans, plus most smokers begin before
they reach age 18. So health workers had focused more on persuading
children never to try cigarettes and helping older smokers quit,
Sharp said.
	   ``Because of the highly addictive nature of nicotine, very few
of those kids who became regular smokers in middle school and high
school quit'' by college, he said. ``They will suffer a much higher
rate of smoking-related illness and death as a result unless
effective cessation can be provided to that group.''
	   Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease
and death. The government says it kills more than 400,000 Americans
a year. Smoking causes a host of health problems, from lung cancer
and heart disease to impotence.

appointed, accusation of deputy premier, minister's husband
resigning &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serbian government minister
resigned Tuesday in protest of her ultranationalist party leader's
``dictatorship'' and his handling of the Kosovo crisis, media
reported.
	   Rada Trajkovic, the minister for family affairs, told reporters
she was stepping down because of a long-lasting dispute with her
party leader Vojislav Seselj, of the ultranationalist Serbian
Radical Party.
	   Later Tuesday, the Serbian parliament, ignoring the resignation
and acting on a motion from the Radical party, stripped Trajkovic
of her duties and appointed another Radical party deputy as her
replacement.
	   Speaking before parliament, Seselj claimed Trajkovic misused her
office for personal gains _ an accusation vehemently denied by
Trajkovic's husband, also a deputy of the Radical party.
	   Following the statement, Trajkovic's husband resigned from the
Radical party and accused Seselj of ``totalitarianism.''
	   It was not clear whether Trajkovic had resigned from the party
herself, nor whether her husband had relinquished his assembly
seat.

Top European clubs back expanded Champions' League
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from group president Sanz, other requests of
group &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Europe's top soccer clubs on Tuesday
endorsed plans for a new 32-team Champions' League designed to
counter a breakaway Super League proposed by Media Partners, news
reports said.
	   The accord was reached at a meeting of 14 teams at a Madrid
hotel, including Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Ajax and
Manchester United, the state-owned news agency Efe said.
	   The collective, dubbed the G-14, said it accepted UEFA's
proposal to expand the Champions' League from 24 to 32 teams, and
urged European football's governing body to implement the new
format starting next season.
	   They also formed a subgroup of five teams _ Real Madrid, AC
Milan, Bayern Munich, Olympique Marseille and Oporto _ to discuss
the new format with UEFA. UEFA's executive committee is expected to
give the reforms a final approval at a meeting in Jerusalem on Dec.
10.
	   Real Madrid Chairman Lorenzo Sanz, who was voted president of
the G-14, said the group wanted ``to work with UEFA. Our objective
is not to destroy but to help,'' Efe quoted him as saying.
	   Stressing the lobbying power of the group, Sanz added, ``It
should not be forgotten that collectively we hold 70 titles and we
generate almost all the television rights.''
	   The G-14, due to meet again in Madrid on Dec. 18, called on UEFA
to renegotiate television contracts in accordance with the new
format.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Tuesday reiterated his opposition
to a Super League.
	   ``Such a project is not possible,'' he said, promising that his
organization would work with UEFA to protect the Champions League.
	   ``The prospect may be appealing in itself, especially with large
financial rewards on offer, but we should not fail to understand
that the organization of football solely for the profit motive, by
unqualified sporting entities, would provoke anarchy in our
sport.''
	   Meanwhile, the G-14 teams meeting in Madrid, whose lineups are
studded with international stars, also called for a greater say in
whether to allow players to put aside their club duties when called
up by their national squad, Efe reported.
	   The group also complained about the current use of sanctions
against clubs, rejecting outright the UEFA ban on Fiorentina after
a bomb-like device thrown from the terraces injured an official on
the field.
	   ``Fiorentina should not be excluded from European soccer because
of a vandal,'' Milan's deputy chairman Adriano Galliani told Efe.
``One thing is what happens on the field and another what happens
on the terraces.''

Brazil to use mix of veterans, youth against Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil will deploy a mix of
veteran players and new faces when it squares off against Russia
Wednesday, its third match under coach Wanderley Luxemburgo.
	   Fresh from a 5-1 thrashing of Ecuador in Washington, the match
against Russia will be played at the Castelao stadium in Fortaleza,
2,180 kilometers (1,351 miles) northeast of Rio de Janeiro.
	   The game is Brazil's final match before qualifying games begin.
It is also Luxemburgo's last chance to tinker with a squad many in
Brazil feel resembles Mario Zagallo's team, which lost the
championship game to France in July _ both have a killer attack but
have shown gaping holes in the defense.
	   Back from the World Cup team are Cafu, Denilson, Flavio
Conceicao and Rivaldo, but the attack is now led by newcomers
Amoroso and Elber.
	   Amoroso, who plays for Italy's Udinese, hadn't been called for
the national team since 1995. Bayern Munich striker Elber went from
being a virtual unknown in his own country to a national hero after
scoring three of Brazil's five goals against Ecuador.
	   The most notable name missing from the current lineup is
Ronaldo, who still hasn't returned to form since his disappointing
showing at the World Cup final.
	   ``I have spoken with him (Ronaldo) and I am worried about his
situation,'' Luxemburgo was quoted in the Rio sports daily Lance.
``I won't say what we talked about and anyone who wants to know
about his physical condition should talk to Inter.''
	   With regard to the holes in the Brazilian defense, Luxemburgo
said he was optimistic that it would improve.
	   Nonetheless, Luxemburgo told Lance that he would deploy
essentially the same defensive scheme he used against Ecuador, but
only because he didn't have enough training time to work out
another.
	   Russia is not expected to present too much of a challenge to
Brazil, since its lineup is made up exclusively of home-based
players.
	   Also stars such as Oleg Teryokhin, who is out injured, Ruslan
Nigmatullin and Igor Chugainov, who have had disagreements with
Russian coach Anatoly Bishovets, are missing from the roster.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Probable starting lineups &QC; 
	   Brazil: Rogerio, Cafu, Cesar, Antonio Carlos, Serginho, Vampeta,
Flavio Conceicao, Rivaldo, Denilson, Amoroso and Elber.
	   Russia: Andrei Novosadov, Ramiz Mamedov, Andrei Kondrashov,
Andrei Solomatin, Yevgeny Varlamov, Oleg Kornaukhov, Sergei
Filippenkov, Sergei Semak, Sergei Nekrasov, Valeri Yesipov and
Alexei Smertin.

OECD says Japan's failure to reform banks risk to world growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Japan's failure to reform its banking system
represents the greatest risk to world economic growth over the next
two years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said Tuesday.
	   The global economy still faces problems even if Japan acts
quickly, the OECD said in its semi-annual world economic outlook
that was released Tuesday.
	   The OECD report said growth in its member countries will slow
from 2.2 percent this year to 1.7 percent in 1999 and that open
trade policies and easier monetary policy in the United States and
Europe are necessary to prevent an even greater downturn.
	   Growth is expected to recover in 2000, reaching around 2.3
percent. The prospects for world trade are good, with growth
expected at 5.3 percent next year, 6.1 percent in 2000, up from 4.6
percent this year.
	   ``The major risk to the outlook for OECD countries now concerns
the possibility that banks in Japan could fail to take full
advantage of recent legislation designed to facilitate their
restructuring,'' the OECD said.
	   A lack of bank reform could be a catalyst for a new vicious
cycle in the global economy, in which weak demand in Japan
prevented a sustained economic recovery there.
	   A weaker yen and further weakening in Japan's banking system
would damage other countries in Asia and could lead to ``important
spillovers to North America and Europe,'' the OECD said.
	   The worst-case scenario outlined by the OECD would be a policy
failure in Japan accompanied by a shock in emerging markets, a
collapse in U.S. and European equity markets, sharp falls in
currencies, all of which could lead to a recession.

FIFA postpones competition; France agrees to take part
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA has rescheduled the
Confederations' Cup from January to July-August and says that, this
time, World Cup France will definitely take part.
	   The new schedule, however, starts only 10 days after the
conclusion of the Copa America, comes in the middle of the league
season of another participating country _ the United States, and
will run concurrently with the Pan American Games.
	   France withdrew from the competition in Mexico when it was
originally set for Jan. 8-20 _ in the middle of the European soccer
season. But FIFA's organizing committee announced Tuesday that the
World Cup holder had confirmed it would take part in a July 28-Aug.
8 event which would not clash with anything major on the European
calendar.
	   ``The rescheduling was agreed because of difficulties involved
in the release of players for certain of the eight competing
countries,'' FIFA said in a statement.
	   ``The new dates have been formally confirmed by all the
competing teams, including the world champions, France, as the
European representatives.
	   ``The French Football Federation has notified FIFA that, unlike
the original January period, it will be able to field a strong team
in July-August.''
	   However, the Copa America is scheduled for June 29-July 18, and
the American Major League Soccer season is set for April to
November. The Pan American Games also are scheduled for the same
time, July 23-Aug. 8 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in Canada, eliminating
the possibility of any of the Western Hemisphere teams from sending

Alleged Quebec bike-gang chief on trial for prison guards' murder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ A reputed Hells Angel leader believed to be a
key figure in North America's bloodiest ongoing motorcycle gang war
went on trial Tuesday, accused of ordering the killing of two
prison guards.
	   The trial of Maurice ``Mom'' Boucher got under way before a
sequestered 12-member jury _ the first time this decade the
precaution has been ordered for a Montreal jury.
	   More than 60 people have been killed since 1994 in bombings and
shootings linked to a power struggle between the Hells Angels and
the rival Rock Machine gang for control of Quebec's illegal drug
trade.
	   Most of the victims have been gang members or hangers-on, but an
11-year-old boy was killed by a biker bomb three years ago, and
last year two prison guards were shot dead, allegedly on Boucher's
orders.
	   Diane Lavigne, 42, was shot by a passing motorcyclist as she
drove home from work in June 1997. Pierre Rondeau, 49, died in a
hail of bullets from two gunmen three months later as he drove a
prison bus.
	   The key prosecution witness is Stephane Gagne, a former Hells
Angel sentenced to 25 years in prison after admitting to shooting
Lavigne. He is expected to testify that the burly, bespectacled
Boucher ordered the killings to send a message to guards not to
interfere with gang activities in prison.
	   Other former gang members also are scheduled to testify during
the trial, which is expected to give the public an unusual inside
view of the gang's operations.
	   The jurors were selected Monday and Tuesday out of a pool of 250
candidates, more than half of whom asked to be excused. One woman,
whose initial request to be excused for health reasons was denied,
burst into a screaming fit when another woman was excused to care
for her pets.
	   The presiding judge, Jean-Guy Boilard, had announced earlier
that the jurors would be sequestered in a hotel throughout the
trial, expected to last four weeks, to shield them from outside
influences and help protect their anonymity.
	   Rules for the jurors include no direct contact with their
families, watching TV only in a group and reading newspapers purged
of any reports on the trial.
	   Boilard ordered sequestration in part because of a
court-commissioned survey of 2,000 prospective jurors last month,
in which 82 percent of the respondents said they would be afraid to
serve as jurors in the trial of an alleged organized crime leader.
	   During preliminary court appearances, the 45-year-old Boucher
was kept in an enclosure of bulletproof glass, and virtually
everyone entering the courtroom was searched.
	   While awaiting trial, Boucher stayed in a women's prison, in an
otherwise empty wing that underwent several hundred thousand
dollars worth of security improvements, in order to keep him away
from other gang members in men's prisons.
	   Police say the Hells Angels have been active in Quebec for 20
years and have affiliates in every Canadian province except
Ontario, Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island.

<TEXT>
	   KADENA AIR BASE, Okinawa (AP) _ Meteors rained down on Asia in
blazes of red and white as the biggest meteor storm in decades
reached its climax just before dawn Wednesday.
	   From the top of the highest mountain in Thailand to the
neon-drenched streets of Tokyo, Asians turned their eyes to the
constellation Leo for the climax of the storm, which peaks every 33
years.
	   And wherever weather permitted, they were treated to a glorious
show of nature.
	   ``It's wonderful,'' said Toshiaki Kogai, one of hundreds of
Japanese who watched the storm from a park just south of Tokyo. ``I
never imagined it would be like this.''
	   In Tokyo and many other Japanese cities, public offices and
private businesses heeded a government plea to turn down their
lights to enhance viewing.
	   Though the night remained bright in the capital area, meteors
could be seen streaking across the skies every two or three minutes
at the peak of the storm.
	   Some appeared to fizzle as they fell. Others looked like moving
dots.
	   Each brought many a wish.
	   ``I only wish I could think up wishes faster,'' said Ikue Oe, a
housewife out watching the storm with her husband in the Tokyo
suburb of Yokohama.
	   The spectacle was eagerly met across the continent.
	   In northern Thailand, tens of thousands of tourists swarmed to
Doi Inthanon, the Southeast Asian country's highest peak at 2,565
meters (8,464 feet), and Doi Suthep, another mountain with a famed
Buddhist temple on top.
	   Clouds and lightning hindered the viewing as the storm wore on,
however.
	   To hedge its bets against clouds, NASA sent up two research
planes brimming with scientific sensors from this U.S. Air Force
base on this southern Japan island.
	   NASA saw this year's storm as a rare opportunity to study the
composition of both comets and meteoroids _ and perhaps learn
something about the origin of life on Earth in the process.
	   ``We have a very unique opportunity here to get some information
about the way life may have arisen,'' said NASA astrobiology
specialist Gregg Schmidt.
	   Some scientists believe the elements necessary for life on Earth
may have been brought here by comets or meteorites. Astrobiology is
the study of life on earth and its connection with the cosmos. It's
a reletively new science, and officials said this was NASA's first
major astrobiology mission.
	   Though Asia was best positioned for viewing the climax of the
storm, the Leonids were seen _ but not necessarily recognized _
elsewhere.
	   Rescuers in Norway were swamped with calls from concerned
Norwegians who spotted what they thought were red distress rockets
fired from ships in trouble off the southern coast.
	   ``The meteors really changed color, and sometimes they were
bright red, so I can understand that people associated them with
distress rockets,'' said rescue leader Ben Vikoeren.
	   The shower is caused by the earth's passage through the long
tail of the Comet Temple-Tuttel. It is called the Leonid shower
because the meteors appear to come from the direction of the
constellation Leo.
	   Though the Leonids occur every November, they are usually not
particularly spectacular. But every 33 years the comet speeds
through the inner solar system and sheds swarms of particles as it
nears the sun.
	   NASA scientist Schmidt said the Leonid storm in 1833, for
example, packed as many as 10,000 meteors per hour.
	   ``The 1833 Leonid shower started a religious revival based on
what people saw,'' he said.
	   This year's storm wasn't nearly as intense, but it did generate
some very pragmatic concerns.
	   Many of the world's 600-plus satellites were maneuvered to
reduce the possibility of damage from the speeding grit, which can
poke holes in solar panels, pit lenses, blast away mirror coatings
or cause damaging electromagnetic pulses.
	   Russian space authorities said the crew of the Mir space station
was prepared for a too-close encounter and would enter the Soyuz
escape capsule when the shower hit its peak.
	   But Air Force Capt. Steve Butow, a senior member of the NASA
Leonid project, said there probably wasn't much cause for concern
for airplanes or people on the ground.
	   ``Most of the stuff that's making the trails in the sky are
probably no larger than the size of a small marble at the
maximum,'' he said. ``These things will abort at about 100
kilometers (60 miles). So no Armageddon tonight.''

Soviet chess grandmaster Yefim Geller dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yefim Geller, a chess grandmaster who helped found
a renowned Soviet chess school, died Tuesday, the Interfax news
agency reported. He was 73.
	   The report did not give the cause of death or say where he died.
	   Geller was world grandmaster in 1952 and Soviet chess champion
in 1955 and 1979. He helped found the Soviet Union's main chess
school, Interfax said.
	   Chess has played a significant role in Russia since the 19th
century and Russian chess players have dominated world play for
decades. Chess is a staple of many school curriculums, and TV
sports reports routinely give chess results.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ They came, many of them soaked in a
downpour, on crutches, tapping white canes and leaning on friends'
shoulders.
	   After a 13-week wait, dozens of Kenyans received compensation
Tuesday for brutal injuries they suffered in the terrorist bombing
of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya.
	   No one _ not the victims, nor the officials handing out the
checks _ pretended it was enough.
	   ``This money today is just enough to say, sorry,'' said Susan
Mutungi of the Kenya Red Cross Society.
	   Pius Maina, whose eyes were gouged out by flying glass, agreed.
In his hand was a rain-speckled check he could not see for 300,000
Kenyan shillings (dlrs 5,000), more money than the 64-year-old ever
had before.
	   ``This is too little, in fact,'' Maina said. ``But it can
help.''
	   He's given up farming because he can no longer tend his crops,
and plans to use his money to build small rental houses on his
property. He still has two children to put through school, feed and
clothe.
	   ``I have a lot of difficulties,'' said Maina, who was in a bus
outside the embassy when the blast went off.
	   He was one of 49 people who crouched beneath dripping trees and
slid through mud at downtown Nairobi's Uhuru Park to collect checks
from 242 million Kenyan shillings (dlrs 4 million) in donations to
the National Disaster Emergency Fund Committee.
	   The panel of businessmen, social workers and government
officials is reviewing 2,514 compensation claims ranging from
300,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 5,000) for those who were blinded or
lost limbs, to 30,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 500) for those who
were badly cut and bruised.
	   A total of 213 people were killed Aug. 7, including a dozen
Americans, and more than 5,400 people were injured, mostly
passersby sliced by flying glass. A near-simultaneous attack on the
U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania killed 11 people, all
Africans.
	   U.S. authorities believe Osama bin Laden, Saudi exile and
militant Muslim, masterminded the bombings. On Nov. 4, a 238-count
indictment opened in New York City charged bin Laden and a cohort
with murder and conspiracy. Three alleged co-conspirators are
already jailed in New York.
	   So far, the committee has paid 194 death claims.
	   Originally, families received 150,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs
2,500) each for compensation and burials. That figure will be
supplemented to 400,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 6,700), said Robert
Shaw, fund spokesman.

FIFA postpones competition; France agrees to take part

 &UR; EDS: UDPATES with comment from US federation, new grafs 8-9. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA has rescheduled the
Confederations' Cup from January to July-August and says that, this
time, World Cup champion France definitely will take part.
	   The new schedule, however, starts only 10 days after the
conclusion of the Copa America, comes in the middle of the league
season of another participating country _ the United States, and
will run concurrently with the Pan American Games.
	   France withdrew from the competition in Mexico when it was
originally set for Jan. 8-20 _ in the middle of the European soccer
season. But FIFA's organizing committee announced Tuesday that the
World Cup holder had confirmed it would take part in a July 28-Aug.
8 event which would not clash with anything major on the European
calendar.
	   ``The rescheduling was agreed because of difficulties involved
in the release of players for certain of the eight competing
countries,'' FIFA said in a statement.
	   ``The new dates have been formally confirmed by all the
competing teams, including the world champions, France, as the
European representatives.
	   ``The French Football Federation has notified FIFA that, unlike
the original January period, it will be able to field a strong team
in July-August.''
	   However, the Copa America is scheduled for June 29-July 18, and
the American Major League Soccer season is set for April to
November. The Pan American Games also are scheduled for the same
time, July 23-Aug. 8 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in Canada, eliminating
the possibility of any of the Western Hemisphere teams from sending
or utilizing members of their under-23 squads.
	   ``We have had no discussions contrary to our participation,''
U.S. Soccer Federation spokesman Jim Moorehouse said. ``But this
rescheduling does create a conflict with the MLS schedule and at
the same time we have not had converation with MLS about taking
players from MLS.
	   ``We've been waiting to hear this final decision from FIFA to
begin proceeding with our participation.''
	   France is in the same group as Brazil, the team it defeated in
the World Cup final, the United States and New Zealand. The other
group is host Mexico, Bolivia, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
	   The matches will be played in the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City
and the Jalisco Stadium in Guadalajara.

Turkish president arrives amid tight security
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Demirel's comments on EU membership,
Ocalan; ADDS byline and EDITS. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
reiterated Tuesday his country's request for becoming a candidate
for European Union membership.
	   On the first day of a three-day visit, Demirel also alluded to
Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the separatist Kurdish underground
Workers Party PKK, as a ``test case'' for the international legal
system and border-crossing cooperation against terrorism.
	   ``Turkey should be unequivocally identified as a candidate'' for
EU membership, ``we expect treatment equal'' to the other EU
admission candidates, Demirel said in a speech to the Austrian
Society for Foreign Policy and International Relations.
	   At the same time Turkey should be given the perspective of a
time frame, and, like other candidates, of the necessary funds for
the requisite restructuring, he demanded.
	   Judging by economic data, Turkey is ahead of most other states
that have applied for EU membership in Brussels, Demirel declared.
He cited this as a reason Turks considered the decision not to
invite their country for membership talks an ``injustice.''
	   Demirel said the Turkish government expected the next EU summit
in Vienna in December to ``confirm its candidate status'' and the
clarification of all ``ambiguities.''
	   He spoke as some 10,000 Kurds marched through Rome to underscore
their demand for Italy to grant asylum for Ocalan, their leader,
who is under arrest in Italy.
	   About 750 Kurds demonstrated in downtown Vienna against Demirel,
police said.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which is
fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey. The
14-year-old conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   In Vienna, Demirel said Turkey had suffered for 15 long years
``under bloody separatist terrorism,'' which, he said, had been
supported until recently by neighboring Syria.
	   Only when Turkey made clear to the world its readiness to seize
``the right to self-defense against indirect aggression'' against
its territory, ``the chief of the terrorist organization'' hasd to
flee the country and is now in Italy, the Turkish president said
without mentioning Ocalan by name.
	   A topic related to Turkey's EU membership bid and raised by his
Austrian hosts was Cyprus, among six countries with whom the EU
started formal membership talks on Nov. 10.
	   In a rare joint statement, the Netherlands, Germany and France
said the inability of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reconcile their
differences weighed heavily on their island's membership chances.
	   Austrian police took special measures to ensure the safety of
the Turkish visitor. About 1,000 officers were assigned to protect
Demirel while in Austria.
	   ``The political situation requires comprehensive security
measures,'' the Austria Press Agency quoted Walter Zehetmayr, a
senior police officer, as saying with reference to the Ocalan case.
	   Demirel, who was accompanied by five Cabinet members and a large
trade delegation, is the first head of state of the Turkish
Republic to visit Austria, APA said.

FIFA will use only female referees for women's World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Only female referees will be used at
the women's World Cup finals in the United States next year, FIFA
announced Tuesday.
	   And for their male counterparts, more emphasis will be placed on
psychological well-being as well as physical fitness in the future,
FIFA's Referees Committee agreed.
	   FIFA President Sepp Blatter proposed that a coach of the same
nationality should accompany referees to international tournaments
to protect them ``from external pressures and to give them
technical, psychological and administrative support before, during
and after the game.''
	   This will involve tasks ranging from dealing with local
officials to hailing cabs, according to spokesman Andreas Herren.
	   The idea will be discussed further prior to the preliminaries of
the 2002 World Cup. World Cup qualifying is likely to involve more
than 700 matches.
	   At its meeting at FIFA's Zurich headquarters, the committee also
discussed a proposal to clamp down on fake injuries. If a player
pretends to have been fouled, the referee should interrupt the
game, award an indirect free kick to the opposing team and caution
the guilty player.
	   The idea will be raised again at a meeting of the rule-making
International Football Association Board in Britain in February
1999.
	   The committee said it was generally satisfied with the quality
of performance in this summer's World Cup finals.
	   Prior to the women's World Cup finals next June 19 to July 10,
the 15 female referees and 16 assistants will attend a workshop
similar to the one before this year's World Cup finals, FIFA said.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors spent their first
hours back in Iraq Tuesday checking their computers and
remote-control camera system.
	   ``We found everything in order,'' the inspectors' spokeswoman,
Caroline Cross, told The Associated Press. The inspectors's
priority was to ``get all the computers on line, making sure the
camera system is working.''
	   Ms. Cross said the first test of Iraq's pledge to cooperate with
the inspectors _ who have been blocked from working since August _
would come Wednesday when they go out in the field.
	   But she added the real challenge would be later when the U.N.
begins surprise inspections that have always caused contention with
Iraqi officials.
	   ``Obviously the next few days are going to be very important,''
she said.
	   Eighty-six inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, and the International Atomic Energy Agency returned Tuesday
following the government's decision Saturday to allow them to
resume work.
	   About 150 U.N. relief workers _ who were pulled out like the
inspectors for fear of a U.S attack on Iraq _ returned to Baghdad
on Monday and Tuesday to resume the supervision of the distribution
of food to Iraq's 22 million people.
	   The United States and Britain had threatened air strikes against
Iraq unless it reversed its restrictions on the inspectors. Iraq
backed down Saturday as air and missile attacks were about to be
unleashed.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before punishing economic sanctions on the
country can be lifted. Iraq insists the inspectors have ignored its
evidence that it has complied.
	   Cross told reporters that UNSCOM was looking forward to ``a
productive and professional relationship'' with the Iraqi
government.
	   On Wednesday, the inspectors are expected to visit declared arms
sites where the commission has already installed cameras and
sensors for long-term monitoring.
	   In contrast, the surprise visits are to not yet inspected sites
where U.N. arms exports suspect the government has been hiding
evidence of banned chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
	   While many in the West are suspicious Iraq will balk when the
inspections get serious, a scientific adviser to President Saddam
Hussein insisted Tuesday that he expected no trouble from the
renewed search for arms.
	   In an interview with the Cable News Network, Gen. Amer al-Saadi
said Iraq would cooperate fully as long as rules are followed that
are set out in the agreement signed between Iraq and the United
Nations to end their last confrontation in February.
	   ``All that is resolved through the memorandum of understanding,
what is exactly UNSCOM'S mandate, and the inspector's mandate, and
what we should do, and we will stick to that,'' he said.
	   But he also stuck to previous Iraqi positions that UNSCOM has
disputed, for example insisting Iraq never put deadly VX gas into
missiles because it did not have the capability.
	   He declined to say whether Iraq would hand over a contentious
document on its use of chemical weapons during the Iraq-Iran war,
saying it wanted to discuss with UNSCOM only details from the
document relative to its investigation.
	   He suggested UNSCOM was asking Iraq to prove that it did not
have weapons instead of the inspectors proving Iraq did have them.
	   ``How can we prove we don't have something if we don't have
it?'' he asked.
	   Once the inspectors report they are able to work effectively,
the U.N. Security Council will conduct a review of Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions. The Iraqi government wants the
review to lead quickly to the lifting of U.N. sanctions _ a move
both the United States and Britain have resisted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
have devastated Iraq's economy. They limit the sale of oil and
other trade.
	   Iraq banned the inspectors from working on Aug. 5 and then cut
off long-term monitoring of its weapons program on Oct. 31.

Police arrest more than 100 on anniversary of student revolt

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More than 100 people, mostly in their
mid-teens, were arrested Tuesday in clashes with police during
events marking the 25th anniversary of a student uprising against
military rulers.
	   Chanting ``Americans are murderers'' and ``down with
imperialism,'' about 10,000 people took part in a march from the
Athens Polytechnic University, site of the 1973 uprising, to the
United States embassy, where they burned an American flag before
dispersing peacefully.
	   They were surrounded by more than 5,000 police officers assigned
to prevent the rioting that has marked previous commemorations.
	   Another 5,000 people staged a peaceful march on the United
States consulate in the northern port city of Salonica, while about
4,000 Greek Cypriots staged a rally at the U.S. embassy in Cyprus.
	   At least 23 people died and hundreds were wounded in the revolt
when the army stormed the campus on Nov. 17, 1973.
	   The revolt is credited with helping bring the downfall of
1967-74 military rule. The junta is also blamed for instigating a
1974 coup on Cyprus, which led to Turkey invading and occupying the
northern third of the island.
	   Authorities were also worried about 200 arson attacks this year
that have been carried out by shadowy organizations widely believed
to be linked to the Polytechnic demonstrators.
	   Two cars were firebombed early Tuesday in separate attacks. No
one was hurt.
	   The commemorations for the revolt ends each year with a march to
the U.S. embassy to protest Washington's widely perceived support
of the dictatorship.
	   In January, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns issued a public
apology for Washington's role during the junta. ``I wish my own
country had stood more firmly on the side of democracy and freedom
during those years,'' said Burns.
	   Greece's deadliest terrorist group, November 17, takes its name
from the day the student uprising was crushed. Four Americans and
one U.S. embassy employee have been among the 22 people killed by
the group.

IMF considers loan to Belarus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last 2 grafs with Belarusian president promising
single exchange rate. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund said
Tuesday it may provide dlrs 100 million in loans to Belarus next
year if the country begins reforming its Soviet-style economy.
	   The Belarusian government agreed to some IMF demands during two
weeks of negotiations in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, Yulia
Lyskova, an aide to the chief of the IMF mission in Belarus, said
Tuesday. The talks ended Tuesday.
	   If the government delivers on these promises and agrees to meet
the rest of the IMF demands during the next round of talks planned
for December, ``it would be possible to discuss the credit of about
dlrs 100 million,'' Lyskova told The Associated Press.
	   The money would be released in February or March, she said.
	   The announcement comes two weeks after a delegation from the
World Bank left Belarus saying no aid will be provided until the
country begins economic reforms.
	   Belarus has one of the most unreformed economies in the former
Soviet Union, with most enterprises still under state control. It
was rocked by an economic crisis this spring, with a dramatic slump
in its currency prompting the government to order strict price
controls.
	   The current economic troubles in Russia _ traditionally the main
customer for Belarusian goods _ has made Belarus' situation even
worse.
	   Pyotr Prokopovich, head of Belarus' National Bank, praised the
results of the IMF talks.
	   ``We have reached many constructive decisions and we hope that
the IMF mission will continue its work in December,'' Prokopovich
said.
	   He also promised that Belarus would introduce a single exchange
rate next year, as opposed to the five different rates it currently
uses.
	   The World Bank has repeatedly criticized Belarus for refusing to
abide by an agreement to introduce a single rate. World Bank
officials have said the lack of a single, objective rate has
prevented the accumulation of hard-currency reserves and
inaccurately reflected the country's health in trade and
production.

Arafat defuses crisis with Israel by disavowing violence

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two days of back-and-forth threats and sharp
rhetoric came to a close Tuesday after Israel welcomed a verbal
commitment by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to disavow violence
and forge ahead through peaceful means.
	   The crisis over inflammatory remarks made by Arafat over the
week-end was the latest in a series of flare-ups to plague the
U.S.-brokered land-for-peace accord signed last month in
Washington.
	   Several hurdles still remained however before Israel would start
carrying out a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of West Bank
territory. One day after the pullback was to begin, Israeli
legislators were still debating the Mideast accord.
	   Lawmakers were getting their first look at withdrawal maps and
were to vote late Tuesday on the deal. Coming out of a map room in
the Knesset, right-wing lawmakers said they were shocked to see how
isolated some Jewish settlements would become after the first
pullout from 2 percent of the area. Others complained that the
government was hiding the truth from them by only posting a map for
the first phase of withdrawal.
	   ``This is a fraud,'' charged Michael Kleiner, a right-wing
legislator in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition.
	   After seeing the maps, Naomi Bloomenthal, a staunch member of
Netanyahu's Likud party sat with a group of fellow lawmakers and
looked close to tears. She told Israel TV it was one of the hardest
days of her life. She did not say how she would vote over the
accord.
	   Kleiner said two small Jewish settlements near the Palestinian
city of Jenin in the northern West Bank would become surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled areas when the first pullout phase takes
place. He said it would take Jewish children up to two hours to
reach schools in other communities because Palestinians control
would slice through Israel's current contiguous hold over that
area.
	   Monday, Netanyahu suspended plans for the redeployment and
demanded a retraction from Arafat after the Palestinian leader
repeatedly said he would announce statehood in May and alluded to
armed conflict as a means to gain independence.
	   On Tuesday, Arafat opened a news conference by reading a
softened statement directed at the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis. Peace is a strategic choice of the Palestinians,'' Arafat
said. ``We stress that concerning any differences in final status
negotiations, we want to solve these issues by peaceful means,
through negotiations, and not in any other way.''
	   Although Arafat did not entirely drop the possibility of
declaring independence in May, when the current peace accords
expire, his call to solve final status issues including permanent
borders, was viewed as a back-down.
	   Israel termed the remarks ``positive'' and Netanyahu's adviser
David Bar-Illan said the prime minister ``considers this a
retraction.''
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet would still have to review whether the
Palestinians have lived up to their obligations before going ahead
with the pullback from an initial 2 percent. The Cabinet was to
meet Wednesday but the prime minister's office announced the
meeting had been pushed back to Thursday to give more time to the
Palestinians.
	   A statement said that by Thursday, Israel expects the
Palestinians to have jailed 10 of 30 named fugitives, publish a
statement against incitement and a plan to confiscate illegal
weapons. Sections of the Palestinian charter which call for
Israel's destruction are to be amended by the PLO central
committee.
	   According to the peace accord, the larger Palestine National
Council is also expected to address those clauses when it convenes
in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton in Gaza in December.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinians have
met all their commitments so far, such as resuming security
cooperation with Israel. Later this week, the Palestinians plan to
announce the legal framework for confiscating illegal weapons and
on Nov. 23, a committee reviewing cases of incitement will meet for
the first time, Erekat said.
	   Negotiators from both sides met Tuesday to discuss
implementation in several other areas including the release of 250
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails by Friday.
	   Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was to meet
with Arafat's deputy and the speaker of the Palestinian legislature
to resume negotiations on a permanent peace agreement after a
suspension of 18 months. Palestinian officials seemed encouraged by
the movement.
	   ``The agreement will be implemented at the end of this week,''
said Hassan Asfour.

Families of cult deaths not satisfied by meeting with judge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) _ Shown pictures, videos and sketches, the
families of victims of 1995 murder-suicide by 16 members of a
doomsday cult said Tuesday they got everything but answers during a
meeting with a judge investigating the deaths.
	   ``We learned some details, it's interesting to know how things
happened, but we don't know anything more. There are many zones of
shadow,'' said former ski champion Jean Vuarnet, whose wife and son
perished just before Christmas three years ago.
	   Nine families and two associations were present for the meeting
in the French Alpine city of Grenoble with the state prosecutor to
learn more about the Dec. 23, 1995 deaths of the members of the
Swiss-based Order of the Solar Temple.
	   All of the victims, including three children, were found shot in
the head and sprawled in the snow in a forest clearing in
Saint-Pierre-des-Charennes, about 30 kilometers (18 miles)
southeast of Grenoble.
	   Jacques Barillin, a lawyer for three of the victims' families,
said they were hoping to learn more about the investigation to
identify the killers and their accomplices.
	   ``The families of the victims ... received technical details,
that's good, but it's not enough,'' said Barillin.
	   The state prosecutor had convened the families and the two
associations, who are civil parties to the case, to explain the
drama to them behind closed doors.
	   After the four-hour meeting, Barillin said there were still many
theories as to who actually killed the victims, people from the
outside or one of the victims who then committed suicide.
	   Two of the victims, included two police officers, both of whom
were cult members. One theory put forward by investigators is that
at least one shot the others in the head before burning them and
committing suicide.
	   The investigation is continuing and could last at least several
more months.
	   A total of 74 members of the Order of the Solar Temple have died
since 1994, including two senior members of the cult, in massacres
in Canada, Switzerland as well as France.
	   The Alpine massacre led French authorities to step up
investigations into cults, of which there are more than 150 with a
membership of some 300,000 people.

Britain restructures Territorial Army, cutting 22 percent of
</HEADLINE>
soldiers

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain announced a 22 percent cut in its army
reserve forces Tuesday in the biggest reshaping of Britain's
Territorial Army in its 80-year history.
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson said the cut, which would
save 70 million pounds (dlrs 115.5 million) a year, is part of a
move designed to restructure the reserve force for the next
century.
	   The force will be reduced from 54,000 to 42,200 to produce a
``tauter, stronger'' reserve force for the post-Cold War era,
Robertson said, adding the restructuring is more than just a
money-saving reshuffle.
	   While 87 of the country's 455 Territorial Army drill centers
will be closed down, and 11,800 soldiers cut from the ranks, those
who remain will be better trained and ready to be sent more often
to global trouble spots, the government said.
	   The reserves were originally structured as a back-up force
preparing to fight infantry battles on the plains of Europe.
	   ``Times change, threats change, we must reconfigure, not just
the regular, but the reserve, forces to be ready for the future,''
Robertson said. ``We need a modern TA that is more relevant, more
useable and more fully integrated into our armed forces, and our
defense plans.''
	   Under the restructuring plan, two squadrons will be created to
deal with possible nuclear, biological and chemical threats to
Britain and for the first time, the government said it will be
prepared to call out forces compulsorily if they were required in
crises such as the Gulf War.
	   Opposition Conservative defense spokesman John Maples has
attacked the cut in numbers, saying it could leave the force unable
to cope with national emergencies.

Anita Snow named AP's chief of bureau in Havana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Anita Snow, news editor for Mexico and Central
America for The Associated Press, has been named chief of the AP's
new Havana bureau.
	   Permission to reopen the bureau, closed since the AP was
expelled in 1969, was granted last week by the Cuban Foreign
Ministry. Her appointment was announced Tuesday by AP President
Louis D. Boccardi.
	   Snow has been among AP reporters making periodic reporting trips
to Cuba in the absence of resident status and has made five visits
this year alone. She was involved in planning the news
cooperative's coverage of Pope John Paul II's visit to the island
in January and was among AP staffers who covered the papal tour.
	   Snow, 39, has been based in Mexico City for five years, the last
nine months as news editor. In her current job, she has directed
AP's coverage of the destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch across
Central America. As a reporter, she has covered such major Latin
American stories as the return of Haiti's exiled President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the papal visit to Central America, the
Zapatista rebellion in the Mexican state of Chiapas and the siege
at the Japanese embassy in Peru.
	   Snow joined the AP in 1988 in Mexico City and moved to the Los
Angeles bureau the following year. In 1990 she transferred to AP
headquarters in New York, where she worked on the General Desk, the
AP's national editing desk, and on the International Desk.

Weapons inspectors will start work with routine monitoring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with weapons inspectors to start work with
routine monitoring, CHANGES headline and DELETES outdated material;
EDITS to tighten and conform. &QL; 
 &UR; With Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS _ U.N. weapons inspectors will resume work in
Iraq with routine monitoring and will not immediately launch
unannounced inspections, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday.
	   An 86-strong team from the U.N. Special Commission, which is
charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, flew
back to Baghdad Tuesday following the Iraqi government's agreement
to allow unconditional, unfettered inspections under the threat of
airstrikes.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the inspectors will begin
working on Wednesday but it will take time before they resume their
full range of activities, which include surprise inspections.
	   ``These personnel will be reopening their offices and they
should begin monitoring declared sites in Iraq by tomorrow
(Wednesday),'' Eckhard said. ``Monitoring of declared sites doesn't
include anything intrusive. That's their normal daily work.''
	   ``UNSCOM expects to get under way with the full range of their
activities shortly,'' Eckhard said.
	   By Tuesday afternoon, approximately 150 U.N. humanitarian relief
workers who also left Baghdad last week because of the threat of
U.S. airstrikes had also returned from Amman, Jordan, he said.
	   Another flight from Bahrain on Wednesday was to bring in the
last six Chilean crewmen who handle helicopter transport for
UNSCOM, Eckhard said.
	   The weapons inspectors prepared to resume their duties, while
the world waited for Baghdad's reaction: Will it really cooperate,
or will it remain defiant and raise fresh obstacles?
	   After the Iraqi government promised to rescind its ban on
dealing with UNSCOM, President Bill Clinton made clear exactly what
the United States expects Baghdad to do to prove it is cooperating
with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   But Iraq's U.N. ambassador said Baghdad is only bound by U.N.
agreements and resolutions, ``nothing more, nothing less.''
	   Iraqi ambassador Nizar Hamdoon also set down Iraq's marker for
resuming cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, which is charged with eliminating Baghdad's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   ``We have committed ourselves to cooperate with UNSCOM provided
the work will lead at some point to the end of the story,'' he
said.
	   The end of the story, as far as Iraq is concerned, is the end of
crippling economic sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait _ not necessarily the full disclosure of Iraq's weapons
programs that the U.N. Security Council has demanded.
	   The Iraqi government has maintained for years that it has fully
disclosed its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs and
the long-range missiles to deliver them.
	   Since the 1991 Gulf War, which drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait,
Baghdad has provoked new crises and confrontations with weapons
inspectors, including blocking inspections as it did Oct. 31,
sparking the current crisis.
	   As U.S. warplanes were about to attack Saturday morning, Saddam
Hussein's government made a last-minute pledge to allow
unconditional inspections.
	   Clinton spelled out exactly what the United States expects when
he announced Sunday that Washington would give Iraq the chance to
keep its promise of unconditional cooperation.
	   Iraq must resolve all outstanding issues raised by UNSCOM and
the International Atomic Energy Agency, give inspectors unfettered
access to all sites without restrictions, turn over all relevant
documents, accept all U.N. resolutions related to its weapons of
mass destruction and not interfere with the independence of the
inspectors, Clinton said.

 &UR; Study links very well done meat to breast cancer &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Women who eat beef and bacon cooked until very
well done have a four times greater risk of developing breast
cancer than those who eat rare or medium meat, a U.S. study says.
	   Yet experts said Tuesday there is still too much uncertainty to
recommend changes in cooking habits.
	   Undercooked meat can pose a proven and well-known health risk,
they noted.
	   ``We have found a link between well-done meat and breast cancer,
but we are still not sure of the cause,'' said Dr. Wei Zheng of the
University of North Carolina. ``This is just one study. It is too
early to jump to a final conclusion.''
	   Other researchers said Zheng's study, to be published Wednesday
in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, ``is intriguing,''
but not conclusive. They said more research is needed.
	   ``No single study should be the basis for changing public
policy,'' said Kathleen M. Egan, an epidemiologist at Harvard
University.
	   The links between diet and cancer are a hot subject of medical
research, but many scientists believe there are few definitive
answers yet. They recommend fruits and vegetables and avoiding
obesity but generally say no diet has been proven to prevent breast
cancer.
	   Cooking meat at a high temperature, either by frying or
grilling, has long been known to cause the production of a chemical
compound called heterocyclic amines _ previously shown to cause
cancer, Zheng noted.
	   ``Charred meat has a high level of these compounds,'' he said.
That is also true of fish and chicken cooked at high temperatures,
although the study did not examine those.
	   Zheng and colleagues based their findings on the meat-eating
habits of 273 women with breast cancer compared to 657 women
without cancer.
	   To determine their meat-eating habits, the women were shown
color photos of hamburger, bacon and beefsteak cooked to various
levels of doneness. The women then picked out the meat picture that
most closely matched their routine meat preparation and consumption
habits.
	   Many women had different preferences, depending on the type of
meat. To analyze that, Zheng said he created what he called a
``doneness score.''
	   Women who ate all three types of meat cooked either rare or
medium were given a score of 3. Those who preferred all three meats
cooked very well done were given scores of 9. When the preferences
varied, there were scores in between the two extremes. The vast
majority preferred bacon well done or very well done, while rare or
medium was the most popular choice for steak and hamburger.
	   Among women who preferred all meat very well done, with a
doneness scores of 9, there was a 462 percent greater chance of
having breast cancer when compared with women who ate rare or
medium meat.
	   For very well done hamburger and bacon, the risks were 50 to 70
percent greater. The risks were 220 percent greater for very well
done beefsteak, Zheng said.
	   The study was adjusted for other factors linked to breast
cancer, such as obesity, family history and whether the woman had
undergone hormone replacement therapy.

Ethiopian, Australian Jews turn to fellow Americans for help
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of Ethiopian Jews demonstrated Tuesday
against government plans to end immigration from Ethiopia and
called on visiting American Jews to help bring their relatives from
Africa.
	   Tuesday's protest was held outside the General Assembly, an
annual conference attended by some 3,000 North American Jewish
leaders, which is being held in Israel for the first time.
	   Monday, Jewish philanthropists at the conference and the Israeli
government unveiled plans to raise dlrs 300 million to bring Jewish
youth from around the world for an all-expenses-paid 10-day stay in
Israel.
	   Ethiopian activists however complained that Israel is keeping
some 8,000 of their relatives out of the country. The Israeli
government, which brought over thousands of Ethiopian Jews in two
dramatic airlifts, has said all of Ethiopia's Jews have been
brought to Israel.
	   Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, who heads a
ministerial committee on relations with the Diaspora said Tuesday
that many of the Ethiopians trying to immigrate were not Jewish.
	   ``The government of Israel says there are no Jews in Ethiopia
and we don't accept this,'' said Najga Alene, one of the protest
organizers who says he has two uncles in Ethiopia who are living in
very poor conditions.
	   Gail Hyman, a spokeswoman for the United Jewish Appeal, which
helped organize the conference, said that leaders of the GA had met
privately with Ethiopian representatives after the demonstration to
better understand their concerns. She said the issue of
immigrations should be left to the Israeli government.
	   Sharansky said the Israel would provide dlrs one million in 1999
and dlrs 20 million in the year 2000 for the Birthright Israel
project which aims to strengthen ties between Israel and World
Jewry.
	   All Jews between the ages of 15 and 26 from any country in the
world would be eligible for the free airfare, room, board and
educational seminars the program will provide, said Charles
Bronfman, co-chairman of the Seagram Company and one of the
financial backers of the project.
	   A group of Australian Jews also tried to win support from their
fellow Americans Tuesday in seeking the resignation of the current
American president of an international Jewish sports federation.
Four Australian athletes were killed and dozens injured when a
bridge constructed for the Maccabi Games in Israel collapsed
beneath them. Organizers of the games are among several facing
criminal negligence charges in an Israeli court.
	   At a press conference in Jerusalem Tuesday, representatives of
the Australian Jewish community asked American Jews to help secure
the resignation of Maccabi World Union officials and overhaul the
organization.
	   Hyman said the GA had not taken a stand on the Australian
request for support.
	   Meanwhile, a leading Israeli philanthropist who presided over
the GA said American Jews should reverse a traditional trend of
sending the bulk of fundraising money to Israel and instead spend
it on their own communities.
	   Dov Lautman, who heads the Israeli branch of the United Jewish
Appeal, the largest fundraising arm of American Jewry, said
American Jews must realize that Israel is no longer a poor country
in need of the intensive support it once received from Jews abroad.
	   ``We need to stop thinking of American Jews as those who give.
The vast majority of resources and the money that are raised there
should be used to strengthen the young generation there,'' Lautman
said in an interview with the Haaretz daily published Tuesday.
	   The UJA raises about dlrs 1.2 billion a year, about half of
which it sends to Israel.

events marking the 25th anniversary of a student uprising against
military rulers.
	   Chanting ``Americans are murderers'' and ``down with
imperialism,'' about 10,000 people took part in a march from the
Athens Polytechnic University, site of the revolt, to the United
States embassy, where they burned an American flag before
dispersing peacefully.
	   They were surrounded by more than 5,000 police officers who were
tasked with preventing riots and acts of vandalism from
self-proclaimed anarchist groups seeking confrontations with
police. Every year, the commemoration of the 1973 Athens
Polytechnic revolt is marred by such incidents.
	   Another 5,000 people staged a peaceful march on the United
States consulate in the northern port city of Salonica, while about
4,000 Greek Cypriots staged a rally to the American embassy on the
island of Cyprus.
	   At least 23 people died and hundreds were wounded in the revolt
when the army stormed the campus on Nov. 17, 1973. The actual death
toll has never been firmly established, but it is thought to be
considerably higher.
	   The revolt is credited with helping bring the downfall of
1967-74 military rule. The junta is also blamed for instigating a
1974 coup on Cyprus, which led to Turkey invading and occupying the
northern third of the island.
	   A makeshift bomb made of three camping gas canisters later
exploded outside an office belonging to the Greek Communist Party,
causing minor damages but no injuries. A previously unknown
anarchist group claimed responsibility for the blast, blaming
Communist Party members with helping police make the arrestes
during the march.
	   Students and the Communist-led construction workers union
guarded the grounds of the Polytechnic in central Athens.
	   Authorities had been worried about 200 arson attacks this year
that have been carried out by shadowy organizations widely believed
to be linked to the Polytechnic demonstrators.
	   Two cars were firebombed early Tuesday in separate attacks. No
one was hurt.
	   The atmosphere has been further charged by a string of police
scandals and recent government education reforms that have led to
school occupations and teachers' demonstrations.
	   On Monday, Premier Costas Simitis was pelted with eggs and
oranges during a visit to the Polytechnic to lay a wreath at the
memorial.
	   Greece's constitution bans police form entering the grounds of
Athens Polytechnic or other universities except with the permission
of the academic senate.
	   The commemorations for the revolt ends each year with a march to
the U.S. embassy to protest Washington's widely perceived support
of the dictatorship.
	   In January, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns issued a public
apology for Washington's role during the junta. ``I wish my own
country had stood more firmly on the side of democracy and freedom
during those years,'' said Burns.
	   Greece's deadliest terrorist group, November 17, takes its name
from the day the student uprising was crushed. Four Americans and
one U.S. embassy employee have been among the 22 people killed by
the group.

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA rescheduled the Confederations'
Cup from January to July-August on Tuesday and guaranteed the
participation of World Cup champion France. However, the new
calendar conflicts with the Copa America, Pan Am Games and U.S.
league season.
	   The new schedule starts only 10 days after the conclusion of the
Copa America, comes in the middle of the United States' Major
League Soccer season, and will run concurrently with the Pan
American Games.
	   France withdrew from the competition in Mexico when it was
originally set for Jan. 8-20 _ in the middle of the European soccer
season. But FIFA's organizing committee announced Tuesday that the
World Cup holder had confirmed it would take part in a July 28-Aug.
8 event which would not clash with anything major on the European
calendar.
	   ``The rescheduling was agreed because of difficulties involved
in the release of players for certain of the eight competing
countries,'' FIFA said in a statement.
	   ``The new dates have been formally confirmed by all the
competing teams, including the world champions, France, as the
European representatives.
	   ``The French Football Federation has notified FIFA that, unlike
the original January period, it will be able to field a strong team
in July-August.''
	   However, the Copa America _ which will include Brazil, Argentina
and Mexico _ is scheduled for June 29-July 18, and the American
Major League Soccer season is set for March 20-Nov. 14.
	   The Pan American Games also are scheduled for the same time,
July 23-Aug. 8 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in Canada, eliminating the
possibility of any of the Western Hemisphere teams from sending or
utilizing members of their under-23 squads.
	   ``We have had no discussions contrary to our participation,''
U.S. Soccer Federation spokesman Jim Moorhouse said. ``But this
rescheduling does create a conflict with the MLS schedule and at
the same time we have not had conversations with MLS about taking
players from MLS.
	   ``We've been waiting to hear this final decision from FIFA to
begin proceeding with our participation.''
	   France is in the same group as Brazil, the team it defeated in
the World Cup final, the United States and New Zealand. The other
group is host Mexico, Bolivia, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
	   The matches will be played in the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City
and the Jalisco Stadium in Guadalajara.

Record year for French wine exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Japan's economic crisis may be deep but wine
imports are soaring, making it one of the top overseas purchasers
in a record year for international sales of Bordeaux wine.
	   The Interprofessional Council of Bordeaux Wines announced
Tuesday that sales of wine were up 14 percent this year. The value
of the exports rose 26 percent over 1997 to 8.3 billion francs
(dlrs 1.5 billion).
	   Japanese imports increased a whopping 188 percent this year to
make the country the number one importer outside the European
Union.
	   Sales were down in South Korea and Thailand, but they were
traditionally small markets and were offset by the increase of
sales to Japan.
	   Exports of Bordeaux wines were also up to the United States,
which tallied a 22 percent rise, Canadian imports rose 23 percent
and Switzerland bought 12 percent more than last year.

Russia promises renewed help in search for Cold War prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Responding to a U.S. plea, Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov pledged Tuesday to revive a probe into whether
Soviet spy agencies plotted to seize U.S. prisoners from the Korean
War.
	   After five years of investigation, a U.S.-Russian panel on POWs
said last year it had failed to find evidence of such a plot, but
the memoirs of a late Russian military historian prompted the
United States to press for renewed study.
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore asked Primakov for help Tuesday
during a meeting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
Malaysia. Gore gave Primakov a letter asking him to open Russian
records in hopes of finding a final answer to a question that has
haunted many Americans for decades.
	   ``Primakov said he would do whatever he could to help,'' said a
senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity.
	   It remained unclear which archives Russia would open to
investigation. The previous probe included reviews of more than
10,000 documents and interviews with hundreds of Russians.
	   More than 8,000 Americans are missing from the 1950-1953 war, in
which Moscow sided with North Korea and the United States supported
the South. The war ended in a tense military standoff that
continues today, seven years after the end of the Cold War.
	   The families of some of the missing Americans say they may have
been taken to the former Soviet Union, and could still be alive.
Some Russians claim to have seen Americans in hospitals or prisons
over the years.
	   U.S. officials said Washington wanted to look into a claim by
Gen. Dmitry Volkogonov, a military historian whose memoirs
described a possible plan to obtain Americans for questioning.
Volkogonov, who died in December 1995, wrote that he had tried in
vain to confirm that such a plan existed.
	   A former KGB director has told U.S. officials he knew of no such
plan but it may have been discussed in KGB documents, said another
U.S. official at the APEC summit, also speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin has said there's no reason to
believe any Americans are alive and being held against their will
in Russia.
	   The U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on POW/MIAs, set up in 1992 to
determine the fate of missing servicemen from both nations, said
last July it had no information to contradict Yeltsin's statement.
	   However, the Americans still want to see additional classified
material.
	   ``Given the nature of the relationship between North Korea and
the Soviet Union, the Soviets must have gotten their hands on some
Americans,'' Malcolm Toon, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow and
co-chairman of the joint commission, said at the time.
	   ``It would be wrong to say we are satisfied with the results of
our investigation so far,'' Toon said.
	   The Russians are looking into the fate of Soviet troops missing
in Afghanistan.

Glavine wins NL Cy Young
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSH DUBOW &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Tom Glavine edged reliever Trevor Hoffman to win
his second National League Cy Young Award on Tuesday, the sixth
time in eight years an Atlanta Braves pitcher has earned the honor.
	   In the closest balloting for the award in 11 years, Hoffman
received the most first-place votes but fell 11 points short of
Glavine, who appeared on three more ballots.
	   The 32-year-old left-hander became the first Cy Young winner not
to receive the most first-place votes.
	   Glavine, who also won the award in 1991, led the league with 20
wins and was tied for third with a 2.47 ERA. Hoffman had perhaps
the most dominating season ever out of the bullpen, saving 53 games
in 54 chances.
	   Glavine received 11 first-place votes, 13 seconds, five thirds
and was left off three ballots for 99 points. Hoffman got 13
firsts, five seconds and eight thirds. The San Diego pitcher was
left off six ballots for 88 points.
	   The 32 voters from the Baseball Writers' Association of America
list the top three pitchers on their ballots.
	   The last time the NL Cy Young vote was this close was 1987, when
Steve Bedrosian beat Rick Sutcliffe by two votes and Rick Reuschel
by three.
	   The last time any BBWAA award winner failed to receive the most
first-place votes was in 1995 when Seattle Lou Piniella beat
Boston's Kevin Kennedy for AL Manager of the Year. It happened
three times in MVP voting.
	   Another Padres pitcher, Kevin Brown, was third with eight
firsts, eight seconds, 12 thirds for 76 points. Glavine's
teammates, John Smoltz and Greg Maddux, tied for fourth with 10
points each.
	   For much of the season Glavine wasn't even the best pitcher on
his staff.
	   Maddux had all but wrapped up the award at the All-Star break
with a 12-2 record and 1.54 ERA. But he struggled down the stretch,
going 6-7 with a 3.18 ERA. He finished 18-9 with a league-leading
2.22 ERA, but couldn't join Roger Clemens as the only five-time Cy
Young winners. Clemens won his fifth Monday.
	   Glavine's win returns the award to Atlanta. Montreal's Pedro
Martinez won last year, and Maddux won in 1992 for the Cubs, the
year before he signed with the Braves.
	   Smoltz, the 1996 winner, finished 17-3 with a 2.90 ERA in a
season in which he was twice on the disabled list with an inflamed
elbow.
	   Hoffman allowed less than a baserunner per inning and struck out
more than one batter per inning. He went 4-2 with a 1.48 ERA. Only
four NL relievers have won the award, none since Mark Davis with
San Diego in 1989.

Angolan government evasive about reports that army attacking rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A senior official Tuesday refused to
comment on reports that the army had surrounded strongholds of the
former rebel group UNITA, but hinted that government forces were
poised to mount an attack.
	   ``The tension has been going on for a long time,'' government
spokesman Higino Carneiro told reporters, referring to government
claims that UNITA has a 30,000-strong guerilla army hidden in the
jungle.
	   ``If there are troops under (UNITA leader Jonas) Savimbi's
orders, then obviously the government has to take a firm stance ...
That means using the armed forces,'' Carneiro said.
	   The tension reflected a sharp increase in hostile accusations in
recent weeks between the former foes, who signed a United
Nations-brokered peace deal in 1994 to end their two-decade civil
war.
	   The two sides reportedly have engaged in skirmishes in remote
areas of the country in recent months.
	   Government forces have encircled the area around the central
highland towns of Andulo and Bailundo, where the UNITA leadership
lives, according to a report Tuesday by Voice of America radio.
	   Witnesses reported fighting and government casualties, the radio
said.
	   VOA cited unidentified government sources as saying the plan was
to capture or kill the UNITA leadership.
	   UNITA spokesman Marcial Dachala, contacted by satellite
telephone, told The Associated Press he was speaking from Bailundo
and that he was ``not worried.''
	   But it was not possible to confirm that he was in the town, and
he declined to give straight answers to repeated questions about
the military situation in the area.
	   He said UNITA remained committed to a peaceful solution to
Angola's problems.
	   Carneiro was speaking after a routine meeting with the U.N.
envoy to Angola Issa Diallo to discuss the delayed implementation
of the peace accord.
	   Carneiro said the regular meetings had become ``a farce. They
don't get us anywhere.''
	   He also chided the international community for not taking a
tougher stance against UNITA, which is under U.N. sanctions for
refusing to handover the areas it controls to the government and
keeping an armed force.
	   UNITA has accused the government of human rights abuses against
its supporters in areas already handed over.
	   Diallo told reporters there was ``a great crisis'' in the peace
process, but insisted that ``the worst can be prevented.''
	   A 1991 peace deal collapsed the following year when UNITA _ the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ refused to
accept its defeat in the vast southwest African nation's first
democratic elections.
	   Civil war broke out after the country's 1975 independence from
Portugal. About 500,000 people are thought to have died in the
fighting.

Blackhawks trade Vopat to Flyers for Maneluk

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The struggling Chicago Blackhawks dealt
much-shopped center Roman Vopat to the Philadelphia Flyers for left
wing Mike Maneluk on Tuesday.
	   Vopat, a 22-year-old Czech native, started the season with the
Los Angeles Kings. He was traded to the Colorado Avalanche Oct. 29,
then sent to Chicago Nov. 10. He had no points in three games with
the Blackhawks, who were 4-10-3 going into Tuesday night's game. In
85 National Hockey League games, Vopat has six goals and 11
assists.
	   The trade came one day after Chicago acquired goalie Jocelyn
Thibault and defensemen Dave Manson and Brad Brown from the
Montreal Canadiens for goalie Jeff Hackett, defenseman Eric
Weinrich and minor league defenseman Alain Nasreddine.
	   Maneluk had two goals and six assists in 13 games for
Philadelphia this season. The former Canadian National Team member
had 68 points in the AHL last season.

Hot off the grill: the Foreman-Holmes show

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ George Foreman and Larry Holmes went through the
motions of grilling hamburgers for kids on Tuesday. But the two old
former heavyweight champions say there's no way they will just be
going through the motions Jan. 23.
	   ``Once that bell rings all we know is competing, winning,
fighting,'' said Foreman, who will fight Holmes in the Houston
Astrodome 13 days after he turns 50.
	   ``I'm not here for my health,'' said Holmes, who became 49 Nov.
3. ``I'm here to let you know I'm fighting a fight. My style would
have beaten George Foreman 20 years ago, and my style will beat him
this time.''
	   Foreman drew laughs when he said, ``I'll be two hundredahhhhh.''
He has not weighed less than 250 pounds (113 kilograms) since he
weighed 244 pounds (110 pounds) in 1988, the second year of his
comeback from a 10-year retirement.
	   ``I'm not going to run,'' Foreman said. ``I don't know how. I
don't even do road work.''
	   Pride is at stake in ``The Birthday Bash,'' which will be
carried on pay-per-view for dlrs 39.95. Pride, however, is not the
only thing getting these elderly pros into the ring. Foreman is
getting dlrs 10 million and Holmes dlrs 4 million.
	   Foreman and Holmes were in New York for a round of television
and radio interviews and for what was more a photo opportunity than
a news conference.
	   The two men donned chef's jackets and Holmes put on a tall hat
to pose as a hamburger griller for 30 children (ages 8-13) from the
Salvation Army's Bushwick Center in Brooklyn.
	   Fortunately for the kids, Foreman and Holmes, weren't grilling
for real because the cooks might have gotten into sampling their
own fare. The children were served lunch later.
	   Both men have said several times their boxing careers are over.
	   ``This is a fight surely to end all fights,'' Foreman said. Then
he smiled.
	   ``I ain't ever going to say never again,'' Holmes said. ``I'm
tired of lying to you guys.''
	   Then he said, ``I want to fight Mike Tyson (who knocked Holmes
out in 1988) right after I beat George Foreman. If he (Tyson) hurts
me, I can bite his ears off.''

hasn't been receiving any federal funds for months.
	   Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, a billionaire who plans to run for Russian
president, said in an interview on Russia's ORT television that he
has ordered officials in his republic of Kalmykia not to turn over
federal taxes they've already collected to the central government.
	   ``We are ready to consider becoming an associate member of the
Russian Federation, not violating the territorial integrity of
Russia and remaining within the borders of Russia, but removing the
budget of Kalmykia _ which isn't receiving any federal money now _
from the budget of Russia,'' he said.
	   He did not rule out Kalmykia eventually seceding from Russia
altogether, but he added, ``We want to be part of Russia. ... We're
not preparing to leave, but they are putting us in such a position
that we are ready to look at this option.''
	   Ilyumzhinov said Kalmykia, an impoverished republic on the
Caspian Sea about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) southeast of Moscow,
hasn't received money for months, including pay for federal
employees or cash for subsidized vaccinations for children.
	   Many of Russia's 89 regions have seized more control of their
finances since the country fell into its latest economic crisis in
August, freezing many federal subsidies and payments to government
facilities, including hospitals and schools. Some governors have
instituted controls on prices or imports.

<HEADLINE>
Top NBA draft pick may play overseas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The long National Basketball Association lockout
could prompt the top rookie to flee overseas.
	   Michael Olowokandi, the overall No. 1 draft pick in the NBA
draft last June, says he'll go to Europe to play professionally,
perhaps in Turkey, if the lockout lasts another couple of weeks.
	   ``If there's no resolution, I have to do something. If it means
going to Europe to take care of myself on financial terms and to
prove myself, then I don't have a problem doing that for one
season,'' Olowokandi said. ``Hopefully this lockout is going to end
soon, but you never know. It could extend into next season.''
	   The lockout moved into its 140th day on Tuesday with no end in
sight. Commissioner David Stern and union director Billy Hunter
have not spoken to each other in the 11 days since the last
negotiating session, and no collective bargaining talks are
scheduled.
	   The latest casualty of the lockout was the NBA Jam Session, an
interactive fan event scheduled during All-Star game festivities.
The league said vendors and sponsors could not set up in time. The
game is still scheduled for Feb. 14 in Philadelphia.
	   Olowokandi's agent, Bill Duffy, said he had preliminary talks
with Efes Pilsen, a club team in Istanbul, and would advise his
client to play overseas if he gets a dlrs 5 million offer.
	   ``If they cancel the season, or if the season doesn't start
until the latter part of December, then I'll go,'' Olowokandi said.
``It's not like I already have my bags packed, but it's a good
possibility.''
	   Olowokandi, a Nigerian citizen, is trying to get a British
passport so he can be excluded from a European league rule limiting
teams to two foreigners. Still, he would not need a British
passport to play for Efes Pilsen because that club does not
currently have any non-Europeans on its roster.
	   If Olowokandi were to sign overseas, he would be putting at risk
the dlrs 10 million he stands to earn from the Los Angeles Clippers
in the first three years of his rookie contract. Also, it would
mean Olowokandi would have to wait an additional year for free
agency or to be eligible for a lucrative extension to his NBA
contract.
	   Three other first-round picks from last June's draft are playing
in Europe.
	   Dirk Nowitzki, chosen ninth overall by Milwaukee before being
traded to Dallas, is playing for DJK Wurzburg in Germany. Radoslav
Nestrovic, picked 17th by Minnesota, is playing out the final
season of his contract for Kinder Bologna in Italy, and Vladimir
Stepania, chosen 27th by Seattle, is playing for Olympia Ljubljana
of Slovenia.
	   Six second-round picks also are playing professionally in
Europe: Ruben Patterson of Cincinnati (Lakers, 31st overall) is
with AEK Athens, DeMarco Johnson of UNC-Charlotte (Knicks, 38th) is
with Sony Milan in Italy, Andrew Betts of Long Beach State
(Hornets, 50th) is with Team System Bologna in Italy, Derrick Dial
of Eastern Michigan (Spurs, 52nd) is with Peristeri of the Greek
League, Ryan Bowen of Iowa (Nuggets 55th) is with Oyak Renault in
Turkey and Torraye Braggs of Xavier (Jazz, 57th) is with Caja
Cantabria of the Spanish League.
	   Four other second-round picks _ Corey Brewer (Oklahoma, chosen
51st by Miami), Greg Buckner (Clemson, 53rd by Dallas), J.R.
Henderson (UCLA, 56th by Vancouver) and Maceo Baston (Michigan,
58th by Chicago) are playing in the CBA.
	   Vlade Divac, who became a free agent after playing for the
Charlotte Hornets last season, has talked of joining Kinder Bologna
until the lockout ends. Portland Trail Blazers center Arvydas
Sabonis will join the Lithuanian national team for the remainer of
the lockout.

Russia criticizes calls for overthrowing Saddam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia on Tuesday criticized Washington's calls
for overthrowing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but said the
crisis must be resolved soon, once and for all.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the calls
``clash with the norms and principles of international law.''
	   ``The (U.N.) Security Council's resolutions must be carried out,
but one mustn't forget that they also state the need to respect
Iraq's sovereignty and political independence. The decision on what
government Iraq will have is a prerogative of the Iraqi people.''
	   Saddam has repeatedly banned U.N. weapons inspectors from his
country, then allowed them to return when the United States
threatened air strikes, then banned them again. The game has cost
Saddam little or no erosion of his power inside Iraq, and allowed
him to avoid meeting U.N. demands.
	   Now, U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright are openly calling for overthrowing Saddam and
pledging support to opposition groups in Iraq.
	   While the Russian Foreign Ministry statement criticized the U.S.
position, it also said the recent developments around Iraq ``have
demonstrated the need for the quickest settlement of the problem.''
	   ``Otherwise, dramatic splashes of tensions around Iraq will
again and again agitate the world community,'' it said.
	   Iraq owes Moscow billions of dollars from Soviet times, when the
Arab nation was a big arms buyer, and Russia wants the conflict
around Iraq resolved so it can begin collecting debts.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Women who eat beef and bacon cooked until very
well done have a four times greater risk of developing breast
cancer than those who eat rare or medium meat, a study says.
	   Yet experts said Tuesday there is still too much uncertainty to
recommend changes in cooking habits.
	   Undercooked meat can pose a proven and well-known health risk,
they noted.
	   ``We have found a link between well-done meat and breast cancer,
but we are still not sure of the cause,'' said Dr. Wei Zheng of the
University of South Carolina. ``This is just one study. It is too

IMF considers loan to Belarus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to add writethru designator &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last 2 grafs with Belarusian president promising
single exchange rate. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund said
Tuesday it may provide dlrs 100 million in loans to Belarus next
year if the country begins reforming its Soviet-style economy.
	   The Belarusian government agreed to some IMF demands during two
weeks of negotiations in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, Yulia
Lyskova, an aide to the chief of the IMF mission in Belarus, said
Tuesday. The talks ended Tuesday.
	   If the government delivers on these promises and agrees to meet
the rest of the IMF demands during the next round of talks planned
for December, ``it would be possible to discuss the credit of about
dlrs 100 million,'' Lyskova told The Associated Press.
	   The money would be released in February or March, she said.
	   The announcement comes two weeks after a delegation from the
World Bank left Belarus saying no aid will be provided until the
country begins economic reforms.
	   Belarus has one of the most unreformed economies in the former
Soviet Union, with most enterprises still under state control. It
was rocked by an economic crisis this spring, with a dramatic slump
in its currency prompting the government to order strict price
controls.
	   The current economic troubles in Russia _ traditionally the main
customer for Belarusian goods _ has made Belarus' situation even
worse.
	   Pyotr Prokopovich, head of Belarus' National Bank, praised the
results of the IMF talks.
	   ``We have reached many constructive decisions and we hope that
the IMF mission will continue its work in December,'' Prokopovich
said.
	   He also promised that Belarus would introduce a single exchange
rate next year, as opposed to the five different rates it currently
uses.
	   The World Bank has repeatedly criticized Belarus for refusing to
abide by an agreement to introduce a single rate. World Bank
officials have said the lack of a single, objective rate has
prevented the accumulation of hard-currency reserves and
inaccurately reflected the country's health in trade and
production.

The evaluation commission ends task in Helsinki
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIUS TURULA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ The sixteen-member IOC evaluation
commission Tuesday finished a three-day stay in Finland after
taking a close look on Helsinki's infrastructure and plans for the
Olympic winter games 2006.
	   Helsinki -- and its co-organizer Lillehammer in Norway -- were
the commission*s last stop. They have earlier visited the five
other candidates;Sion (Switzerland), Turin (Italy), Zakopane
(Poland), Poprad Tatry (Slovakia), and, in a joint bid Klagenfurt
in Austria, Planica in Slovakia and Tarvisio in Italy.
	   ``We are here not to compare Helsinki's bid to other cities'
bids. We are here to evaluate your bid only,'' said delegation
leader, IOC member Chiharu Igaya.
	   He indicated however that Finland's tradition for winter sports
was a positive factor in the bid.
	   ``You have a wonderful sport tradition in this country and you
have produced so many great winter sportsmen. The jumping venue in
Lahti was really something'', Igaya told a news conference.
	   Lahti, host of successful World Championhips and several World
Cup skiing events, will handle the crosscountry skiing, ski
jumping, biathlon and the freestyle skiing.
	   Lillehammer, the Olympic host in 1994, is slated to arrange the
alpine skiing, the sledding and luge events.
	   ``The challenge for the Helsinki bid will be the distance
between Lillehammer and Helsinki.'', Igaya said.
	   ``The distance between the Oslo airport and Lillehammer is only
110 kilometers, on a fairly good road. We have to convince the
doubtful that is no longer than it was in Albertville and Nagano,''
said Arne Myrvold, the Lillehammer representative in the Helsinki
2006 organizing committee.
	   The evaluation commission will meet at the IOC headquarters in
Lausanne December 8-9 to finish its report on the bids. It will be
made public in the end of January.
	   The voting for the host of the winter Olympics 2006 will be made
June 19 next year, during IOC:s session in South Korea.

Arafat defuses crisis with Israel by disavowing violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu speech to parliament before vote;
Left-wing legislator to abstain; press not allowed to see the maps;
vote expected by 22:00gmt &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two days of back-and-forth threats and sharp
rhetoric came to a close Tuesday after Israel welcomed a verbal
commitment by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to disavow violence
and forge ahead through peaceful means.
	   The crisis over inflammatory remarks made by Arafat over the
week-end was the latest in a series of flare-ups to plague the
U.S.-brokered land-for-peace accord signed last month in
Washington.
	   Several hurdles still remained however before Israel would start
carrying out a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of West Bank
territory. One day after the pullback was to begin, Israeli
legislators were still debating the Mideast accord.
	   Lawmakers were getting their first look at withdrawal maps and
were to vote late Tuesday on the deal. Coming out of a map room in
the Knesset, right-wing lawmakers said they were shocked to see how
isolated some Jewish settlements would become after the first
pullout from 2 percent of the area. Others complained that the
government was hiding the truth from them by only posting a map for
the first phase of withdrawal.
	   ``This is a fraud,'' charged Michael Kleiner, a right-wing
legislator in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition. The
public and the press were not allowed to view the maps.
	   After seeing the maps, Naomi Bloomenthal, a staunch member of
Netanyahu's Likud party sat with a group of fellow lawmakers and
looked close to tears. She told Israel TV it was one of the hardest
days of her life. She did not say how she would vote over the
accord.
	   Kleiner said two small Jewish settlements near the Palestinian
city of Jenin in the northern West Bank would become surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled areas when the first pullout phase takes
place. He said it would take Jewish children up to two hours to
reach schools in other communities because Palestinians control
would slice through Israel's current contiguous hold over that
area.
	   And Ephraim Sneh, a former general and member of the dovish
Labor party said after viewing the maps that he would abstain. Sneh
said territory had been carved up in a way which would complicate
future negotiations.
	   Addressing the Knesset, Netanyahu said maps would be shown to
the parliament before each pullback. He called on ministers to
support the peace accord.
	   ``I hope that what comes out today is a wide agreement on the
Wye accord and the desire to see it carried out. I think this is
the only way to achieve peace,'' Netanyahu said.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Twelve workers were killed and three
injured when an elevator at a building site plunged 20 floors into
a basement Tuesday, police said.
	   Ten Syrian and two Lebanese laborers were killed instantly after
the elevator's cables snapped, sending it crashing from the 19th
floor. Two Syrians and an Egyptian were seriously injured and taken
to a hospital.
	   The accident occurred because the workers had crowded into an
elevator designed to carry a maximum of five people, said a police
official, speaking under customary condition of anonymity.
	   Lebanon, with a population of 3.2 million, plays host to many
foreign laborers, including about 1 million Syrians who work mainly
in construction and agriculture.

Analysts: Wiretapping scandal could hurt economic stability

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ An austerity plan meant to stabilize
South America's largest economy could be undermined by corruption
allegations involving two top government officials, analysts said
Tuesday.
	   Brazil secured a dlrs 41.5 million rescue package from the
International Monetary Fund, by promising austerity measures and a
reduction in its dlrs 65 billion budget deficit. The package was
announced Friday.
	   Yet analysts fear a scandal involving alleged attempts to
influence the phone company's privatization may stall key
congressional action needed to pass the austerity measures.
	   The allegations involve Communications Minister Luiz Carlos
Mendonca de Barros and Andre Lara Resende, president of Brazil's
national development Bank.
	   Conversations, secretly recorded on the eve of last July's dlrs
19 billion privatization auction of the state-run telephone holding
company, Telebras, allegedly show Barros and Resende favoring a
consortium of personal friends in its bid to purchase part of
Telebras' operations. The two officials coordinated the sale.
	   Since news of the tapes surfaced in the Nov. 9 issue of the
magazine, Epoca, the brewing scandal has been the top news story in
Brazilian media. Another newsmagaizne, Veja, published excerpts in
this week's issue.
	   It is unclear where the tapes came from or who made them. Both
Barros and Resende have denied any wrongdoing _ and the consortium
they allegedly favored lost the auction.
	   That hasn't stopped opposition politicians from calling for a
full congressional investigation, which analysts say could weaken
the resolve of legislators facing the tough budget cuts needed to
save the ailing economy.
	   ``The government's worst nightmare at the moment is a
congressional probe into the tapes,'' said Alexandre Barros, a
Brasilia-based political and business consultant. ``It will draw
attention away from the austerity measures and possibly weaken
them.''
	   In late October, the government unveiled a mix of taxes and
spending cuts in a bid to save nearly dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and
some dlrs 80 billion by 2002. The measures must be approved by
Congress.
	   The measures, designed to reduce Brazil's budget deficit of 7
percent of gross domestic product, are likely to aggravate the
economic slowdown and push unemployment past nearly 8 percent,
analysts said. Independent economists put unemployment at nearly 20
percent.
	   Some politicians, Barros said, will agree with the creation of
an inquiry committee ``so they can later indulge in some horse
trading with the government.''
	   ``They'll negotiate withdrawal of their support in exchange for
approval of projects that can dilute the fiscal austerity
package,'' he added.
	   Political consultant Jose Luciano Dias said an investigation
will give Congress a stronger hand when it votes on austerity
measures proposed by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
	   ``The President will become more dependent on the good will of
Congress,'' he said.
	   Aware of the danger, the government is rallying allies to delay
a possible investigation _ at least until after Congress approves
the belt-tightening measures.
	   To complicate government determination further, police are also
looking into allegations that Cardoso and three close allies
stashed away dlrs 368 million in a Cayman Islands corporate
account.
	   Unlike the wiretapping, though, the impact of these allegations
is quickly fizzling out, said political consultant Jose Luciano
Dias.
	   ``The documents are so grotesquely false that no one is giving
them any credence at all,'' he said.
	   Other analysts, though are waiting to see what details on the
wiretaps emerge before deciding what the impact will be on the
package.
	   Silvio Camargo, head of international institutional equity sales
at Banco Fator, a Brazilian investment bank, said that so far ``the
tapes offer no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing.''
	   ``If solid evidence of irregularities emerges, then the momentum
for a congressional probe will grow, jeopardizing the austerity
measures,'' he said.

Russia criticizes calls for overthrowing Saddam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 4th graf to CORRECT that Saddam has limited access to
inspectors, not banned them from Iraq. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia on Tuesday criticized Washington's calls
for overthrowing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but said the
crisis must be resolved soon, once and for all.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the calls
``clash with the norms and principles of international law.''
	   ``The (U.N.) Security Council's resolutions must be carried out,
but one mustn't forget that they also state the need to respect
Iraq's sovereignty and political independence. The decision on what
government Iraq will have is a prerogative of the Iraqi people.''
	   Saddam has repeatedly limited access for U.N. weapons inspectors
in Iraq, then eased up when the United States threatened air
strikes, then cracked down again.
	   Now, U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright are openly calling for overthrowing Saddam and
pledging support to opposition groups in Iraq.
	   While the Russian Foreign Ministry statement criticized the U.S.
position, it also said the recent developments around Iraq ``have
demonstrated the need for the quickest settlement of the problem.''
	   ``Otherwise, dramatic splashes of tensions around Iraq will
again and again agitate the world community,'' it said.
	   Iraq owes Moscow billions of dollars from Soviet times, when the
Arab nation was a big arms buyer, and Russia wants the conflict
around Iraq resolved so it can begin collecting debts.

IAPA elects new board members, laments slayings of journalists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BILL CORMIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay (AP) _ The outgoing president of the
Inter American Press Association on Tuesday lamented the number of
journalists killed this year and called for a fight against
obstacles of press freedom.
	   A grouping of newspaper publishers from across the Americas,
IAPA also elected 20 new members of its board of directors and
heard praise from Uruguay's president for the media's role in
democratic society.
	   ``Twenty six journalist have been killed in the past year and
that's been a horrifying statistic,'' said departing IAPA president
Oliver F. Clarke, chairman of The Gleaner Company Limited, Jamaica.
	   He said IAPA sent 66 protests to governments in the past year
over attacks on journalists or infringement on press liberties.
IAPA also sent nine missions to investigate the most serious cases
during the year.
	   ``We continue to investigate the murders of journalists and to
urge governments'' to prosecute those responsible for the deaths,
Clarke said.
	   He has called for non-stop IAPA pressure on judicial systems in
many countries that have failed to prosecute those who assault or
kill journalists.
	   Uruguayan President Julio M. Sanguinetti later told the
publishers that the press serves as a beacon for democracy, but
warned against the excesses of ``yellow journalism.''
	   He also warned the press to be wary of those who try to use the
media for their own benefits, they political powers or others.
	   As part of the penultimate day of meetings, Clark informed IAPA
that 18 heads of states _ and the Organization of American States _
had endorsed IAPA's document on press freedom called the
Chapultepec project.
	   But while the Chapultepec endorsements were a highlight, Clarke
has acknowledged that the operation of a free press in Latin
America faces some major obstacles.
	   Separately, he announced elections of 20 new members of the
60-member IAPA Board of Directors, who will fill terms from 1998
until 2001.
	   Elected to the board of directors from U.S. publications were
Robert J. Cox of The News and Courier, Charleston, South Carolina;
Diana Daniels of The Washington Post; Gregory Favre of The
Sacramento Bee, Sacramento, California; Jack Fuller of the Chicago
Tribune; Earl Maucker of the Sun-Sentinel, Fort Lauderdale,
Florida; Sergio Munoz of the Los Angeles Times; Laurence G.
O'Donnell of The Wall Street Journal; Robert Rivard of the San
Antonio Express-News, San Antonio, Texas; Scott C. Schurz of the
Herald-Times, Bloomington, Indiana; Paul C. Tash of the St.
Petersburg Times, Florida.
	   Elected to the board from outside the United States were
Washington Beltran of El Pais, Montevideo, Uruguay; Felipe Edwards
of El Mercurio, Santiago, Chile; Jose Santiago Healy of El
Imparcial, Hermosillo, Mexico; Saturnino Herrero Mitjans of Clarin,
Buenos Aires, Argentina; Roberto Eduardo Romero of El Tribuno,
Salta, Argentina; Renato Simoes of A Tarde, Salvador, Brazil; Jayme
Sirotsky of RBS, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Eduardo Ulibarri of La
Nacion, San Jose, Costa Rica; Aldo Zuccolillo of ABC Color,
Asuncion, Paraguay.

Still recovering from El Nino, Guyana faces harsh La Nina
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT WILKINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Last year, drought from the El Nino
weather phenomenon crippled Guyana's economy. Now scientists warn
El Nino's cooler counterpart, La Nina, may bring further damage in
the form of flooding.
	   The weather service in this impoverished English-speaking
northern South American nation is warning residents to expect heavy
rains and flooding through May.
	   Near-daily rain storms have begun in Georgetown, the flood-prone
capital that sits below sea level behind a system of dikes.
	   ``I hope people pay attention to our forecast and take the
necessary precautions,'' said Chief Meteorologist Dilip Jaigopaul.
	   Meteorologists predict a 60 percent to 70 percent increase in
rainfall during the winter rainy season. In normal years, Guyana
gets about 185 millimeters (7.5 inches) of rain in November and
January, and about 262 millimeters (10.5 inches) in December.
	   Last year, scientists blamed a months-long drought on El Nino, a
warming of the Pacific Ocean off the South American coast. La Nina,
a cooling phenomenon, could have the opposite effect, Jaigopaul
said.
	   The drought cost farmers millions of dollars and forced the
government to truck rice, canned food and other supplies to
communities deep in the tropical forest.
	   The drought also dried up rivers used to transport equipment to
far-flung gold mines, which produce the biggest share of the
country's export earnings.
	   On Tuesday, the government said it would collect food donations
to prepare for possible flooding in coastal areas, where about
635,000 of Guyana's 706,000 people live.
	   Most of Guyana's cities lie at least 2 meters (6 feet) below the
Atlantic Ocean behind dikes, sluices and a reinforced concrete
seawall.

Police arrest more than 100 on anniversary of student revolt

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More than 100 people, mostly in their
mid-teens, were arrested Tuesday in clashes with police during
events marking the 25th anniversary of a student uprising against
military rulers.
	   Chanting ``Americans are murderers'' and ``down with
imperialism,'' about 10,000 people took part in a march from the
Athens Polytechnic University, site of the revolt, to the United
States embassy, where they burned an American flag before
dispersing peacefully.
	   A makeshift bomb made of three camping gas canisters later
exploded in a district of the capital outside an office belonging
to the Greek Communist Party, causing minor damages but no
injuries. A previously unknown anarchist group claimed
responsibility for the blast, blaming Communist Party members with
helping police make the arrests during the march.
	   The demonstrators were surrounded by more than 5,000 police
officers who were tasked with preventing riots and acts of
vandalism from self-proclaimed anarchist groups seeking
confrontations with police. Every year, the commemoration of the
1973 Athens Polytechnic revolt is marred by such incidents.
	   Another 5,000 people staged a peaceful march on the United
States consulate in the northern port city of Salonica, while about
4,000 Greek Cypriots staged a rally to the American embassy on the
island of Cyprus.
	   At least 23 people died and hundreds were wounded in the revolt
when the army stormed the campus on Nov. 17, 1973. The actual death
toll has never been firmly established, but it is thought to be
considerably higher.
	   The revolt is credited with helping bring the downfall of
1967-74 military rule. The junta is also blamed for instigating a
1974 coup on Cyprus, which led to Turkey invading and occupying the
northern third of the island.
	   Students and the Communist-led construction workers union
guarded the grounds of the Polytechnic in central Athens.
	   Authorities had been worried about 200 arson attacks this year
that have been carried out by shadowy organizations widely believed
to be linked to the Polytechnic demonstrators.
	   Two cars were firebombed early Tuesday in separate attacks. No
one was hurt.
	   The atmosphere has been further charged by a string of police
scandals and recent government education reforms that have led to
school occupations and teachers' demonstrations.
	   On Monday, Premier Costas Simitis was pelted with eggs and
oranges during a visit to the Polytechnic to lay a wreath at the
memorial.
	   Greece's constitution bans police form entering the grounds of
Athens Polytechnic or other universities except with the permission
of the academic senate.
	   The commemorations for the revolt ends each year with a march to
the U.S. embassy to protest Washington's widely perceived support
of the dictatorship.
	   In January, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns issued a public
apology for Washington's role during the junta. ``I wish my own
country had stood more firmly on the side of democracy and freedom
during those years,'' said Burns.
	   Greece's deadliest terrorist group, November 17, takes its name
from the day the student uprising was crushed. Four Americans and
one U.S. embassy employee have been among the 22 people killed by
the group.

Greg Norman: a Shark in peaceful waters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ He fell asleep during ``Phantom of the
Opera'' but fell in love with ``The Lion King'' on Broadway. He
took spontaneous lunch breaks with his wife and went 36 holes in
England on the other side of the ropes. He met the new boyfriend of
his 16-year-old daughter.
	   This is what Greg Norman means by getting his life back.
	   And this is why he says he looks forward to getting back to
golf, but not to the life of a professional golfer.
	   ``I've never seen Greg this relaxed,'' Laura Norman, his wife of
17 years, said during the Shark Shootout in California. ``It's
funny, because a lot of the wives on tour said, 'Boy, you must be
ready for him to get out of house.' But we had so much fun living a
normal life.''
	   Not that renting an island in the Bahamas constitutes a normal
life. There was also a three-week trip to Europe, part of which was
spent watching his 13-year-old son Gregory in a golf tournament, a
shopping-theater extravaganza in New York and fly fishing in
Colorado.
	   But where they went or what they did is not the issue.
	   ``It wasn't like we were going to a golf tournament,'' Laura
Norman said.
	   This week at Sherwood Country Club, a gorgeous Jack Nicklaus
course carved from the Southern California foothills, they were
back to the routine. Norman was grinding away, trying to rediscover
his feel. His wife and two children were tagging along.
	   ``I don't know if it's good or bad,'' she said about her
husband's return to golf. ``But it is going to be an adjustment.''
	   That goes for Norman, too.
	   Since coming back from April 22 surgery on his left shoulder,
Norman has said he does not want to fall into the same routine he
was in for 20-plus years as a global golfer, which looks even more
like drudgery coming off what he calls ``the best summer of my
life.''
	   Ultimately, his return could have as much to do with his swing
as his priorities.
	   Norman answered the first question last week in the Shark
Shootout, and not just because he and Steve Elkington won in a
sudden-death playoff.
	   Any concerns about whether his shoulder would be just as strong
were put to rest with each vicious swing off the tee, with the
3-wood that had to carry 260 yards (237 meters) over a bunker to an
elevated green, with the 8-iron that he knew he had to crush to
squeeze that extra five yards out of it.
	   ``I felt like I got my power back,'' Norman said. ``I knew I
could put it out there when I needed to put it out there. And
that's important when you know you can go after it if you need
to.''
	   His game still needs fine-tuning. The first real test will be
two weeks from now in the Australian Open, where Norman will be on
his own for 72 holes.
	   But don't be surprised if Norman doesn't need a special
invitation to get back to the Masters (his five-year exemption from
winning the British Open expired this year). Since he joined the
PGA Tour in 1984, he has either won or finished second 21 percent
of the time, and there's no reason to believe it will be any
different now.
	   ``He would love to come straight out and win. That's just Greg's
nature,'' his wife said. ``He's not the type to just let it happen
because he doesn't know any differently. He's been No. 1 for so
long, and you have to work your butt off to get there. Then, you
have to work even harder to stay there.''
	   Norman says being No. 1 in the world rankings _ he's been there
longer than anyone from his generation _ was never a priority and
won't be now. He says he has an unfiltered approach to golf, that
he will not play as many tournaments, not spend as much time on the
driving range, not treat the major championships as life-or-death
situations.
	   ``I don't have an urgency to do anything any more,'' he said.
``I've got a pretty level approach on everything in the future, and
I'm going to maintain that all the way through.''
	   But what happens when the shark smells blood? How long before
his unfiltered view of golf is polluted by getting into contention
at a major championship for the umpteenth time?
	   What will he feel if comes up short once again?
	   ``I think he'll be just as driven, but I think he'll handle it
differently,'' Laura Norman said. ``The biggest change in him this
summer was he didn't have all those pressures _ from being out here
and the pressure he puts on himself that causes him to be so
focused.
	   ``I think he'll enjoy it more this time,'' she said. ``And I
think he'll play even better.''

Tens of thousands of people search for stars
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Whether they stood on the tallest mountain in Thailand or the
desert in California, tens of thousands of people were searching
the skies for a glimpse of the biggest meteor shower in decades.
	   Clouds interfered with the view from many sites, but many
stargazers were rewarded with a spectacular view of meteors
streaking through the skies in blazes of red and white as the
Leonid meteor shower reached its climax early Wednesday in Asia.
	   The shower, which peaks every 33 years, is caused by the Earth's
passage through the long tail of the Comet Tempel-Tuttle. The
storm, which began Monday, got its name because it appears to come
from the direction of the constellation Leo.
	   The biggest crowds gathered in Asia, which was best positioned
for viewing the climax, but the spectacle was seen throughout the
globe _ weather permitting.
	   In Tokyo and many other Asian cities, public offices and private
businesses turned off their lights to enhance viewing. Though the
night remained bright in the Tokyo area, meteors could be seen
streaking across the skies every two or three minutes at the peak
of the storm.
	   ``I only wish I could think up wishes faster,'' said Ikue Oe, a
housewife watching the storm with her husband in the Tokyo suburb
of Yokohama.
	   Tens of thousands of tourists swarmed to Doi Inthanon,
Thailand's highest peak at 2,565 meters (8,464 feet), and Doi
Suthep, another mountain with a famed Buddhist temple on top.
	   People shrieked and squealed with delight as they glimpsed the
night's first shooting star at almost exactly 1 a.m. Wednesday
(1800 GMT Tuesday). But their enjoyment was tempered by the sight
of clouds moving in.
	   Officials said 10,000 people had passed through the national
park's gates by 7:30 p.m. Tuesday (1230 GMT), seven hours before
the anticipated peak of the promised celestial spectacle.
	   People huddled in blankets drove in, paid the 20 baht (55 U.S.
cents) entrance fee and continued up the mountain, scouting for
suitable viewing spots and turning the park into a tent city. The
mountain's actual peak was reserved for dignitaries and scientists.
	   The crowds that gathered at sites in the Mojave Desert in
California were smaller but no less enthusiastic.
	   The desert's campgrounds, normally empty on November weeknights,
were jammed with dozens of stargazers in the early morning hours,
many peering through telescopes and whooping and hollering with
each dazzling display from the Leonid meteor shower.
	   Sandra Macika, 36, of San Jose saw about 30 meteors as she
watched the skies from Mercy Hot Springs, about 30 miles (50
kilometers) south of Los Banos.
	   ``I could see in front of me big streaks of light falling on the
highway,'' she said.
	   Most Australians who rose early Wednesday were disappointed to
find storm clouds blocking the rare display of celestial fireworks.
	   Sydney Observatory astronomy curator Nick Lomb said that while
some astronomers at Parkes Observatory, in northwestern New South
Wales, had seen fireballs through the clouds, it was not the meteor
storm they had hoped for.
	   The view apparently was clearer in Norway, where rescuers were
swamped with calls from people who spotted what they thought were
red distress flares fired from ships in trouble off the southern
coast.
	   ``The meteors really changed color, and sometimes they were
bright red, so I can understand that people associated them with
distress rockets,'' said rescue leader Ben Vikoeren.

Russia promises renewed help in search for Cold War prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 9 and 12 that Volkogonov also co-chaired
POW/MIA commission. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Responding to a U.S. plea, Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov pledged Tuesday to revive a probe into whether
Soviet spy agencies plotted to seize U.S. prisoners from the Korean
War.
	   After five years of investigation, a U.S.-Russian panel on POWs
said last year it had failed to find evidence of such a plot, but
the memoirs of a late Russian military historian prompted the
United States to press for renewed study.
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore asked Primakov for help Tuesday
during a meeting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
Malaysia. Gore gave Primakov a letter asking him to open Russian
records in hopes of finding a final answer to a question that has
haunted many Americans for decades.
	   ``Primakov said he would do whatever he could to help,'' said a
senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity.
	   It remained unclear which archives Russia would open to
investigation. The previous probe included reviews of more than
10,000 documents and interviews with hundreds of Russians.
	   More than 8,000 Americans are missing from the 1950-1953 war, in
which Moscow sided with North Korea and the United States supported
the South. The war ended in a tense military standoff that
continues today, seven years after the end of the Cold War.
	   The families of some of the missing Americans say they may have
been taken to the former Soviet Union, and could still be alive.
Some Russians claim to have seen Americans in hospitals or prisons
over the years.
	   U.S. officials said Washington wanted to look into a claim by
Gen. Dmitry Volkogonov, a military historian whose memoirs
described a possible plan to obtain Americans for questioning.
Volkogonov, who died in December 1995, wrote that he had tried in
vain to confirm that such a plan existed.
	   Volkogonov was co-chairman of the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission
on POW/MIAs, set up in 1992 to determine the fate of missing
servicemen from both nations.
	   A former KGB director has told U.S. officials he knew of no such
plan but it may have been discussed in KGB documents, said another
U.S. official at the APEC summit, also speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin has said there's no reason to
believe any Americans are alive and being held against their will
in Russia.
	   The U.S.-Russian commission said last July it had no information
to contradict Yeltsin's statement.
	   However, the Americans still want to see additional classified
material.
	   ``Given the nature of the relationship between North Korea and
the Soviet Union, the Soviets must have gotten their hands on some
Americans,'' Malcolm Toon, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow and
co-chairman of the joint commission, said at the time.
	   ``It would be wrong to say we are satisfied with the results of
our investigation so far,'' Toon said.
	   The Russians are looking into the fate of Soviet troops missing
in Afghanistan.

Four train cars catch fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A fire broke out on a train in southern
Egypt Tuesday, gutting four carriages, police officials said.
	   Some 4,000 students were on the train, but all escaped unharmed
as the train was standing in a siding when the fire began.
	   The train had just stopped at the station of Beni Suef, 100
kilometers (65 miles) south of Cairo, to make way for an express
train when fire broke out on the roof, police officials said.
	   Some 20 fire engines rushed to the station, but by the time fire
fighters had extinguishing the blaze, it had destroyed four cars.
	   Railway accidents are not uncommon in Egypt owing to the trains'
lack of maintenance and overcrowding. Last month a train flew off
its tracks and crashed into the central square of a small town in
the Nile Delta, killing 47 people.

	   The vote and a retraction of inflammatory statements earlier
Tuesday by Arafat pushed the Wye River acccord over two majpor
hurdles towards implementation.
	   The crisis over Arafat's recent remarks was the latest in a
series of flare-ups to plague the U.S.-brokered land-for-peace
accord.
	   Lawmakers got their first look at withdrawal maps before
Tuesday's vote. Coming out of a map room in the Knesset, right-wing
lawmakers said they were shocked to see how isolated some Jewish
settlements would become after the first pullout from 2 percent of
the area. Others complained that the government was hiding the
truth from them by only posting a map for the first phase of
withdrawal.
	   ``This is a fraud,'' charged Michael Kleiner, a right-wing
legislator in Netanyahu's coalition. The public and the press were
not allowed to view the maps.
	   After seeing the maps, Naomi Bloomenthal, a staunch member of
Netanyahu's Likud party sat with a group of fellow lawmakers and
looked close to tears. She told Israel TV it was one of the hardest
days of her life. She did not say how she would vote over the
accord.
	   Kleiner said two small Jewish settlements near the Palestinian
city of Jenin in the northern West Bank would become surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled areas when the first pullout phase takes
place. He said it would take Jewish children up to two hours to
reach schools in other communities because Palestinians control
would slice through Israel's current contiguous hold over that
area.
	   And Ephraim Sneh, a former general and member of the dovish
Labor party said after viewing the maps that he would abstain. Sneh
said territory had been carved up in a way which would complicate
future negotiations.
	   Addressing the Knesset, Netanyahu said maps would be shown to
the parliament before each pullback. He called on ministers to
support the peace accord.
	   ``I hope that what comes out today is a wide agreement on the
Wye accord and the desire to see it carried out. I think this is
the only way to achieve peace,'' Netanyahu said.

 &UR; JERUSALEM: Netanyahu said.

<TEXT>
	   Monday, Netanyahu suspended plans for the redeployment and
demanded a retraction from Arafat after the Palestinian leader
repeatedly said he would announce statehood in May and alluded to
armed conflict as a means to gain independence.
	   On Tuesday, Arafat opened a news conference by reading a
softened statement directed at the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis. Peace is a strategic choice of the Palestinians,'' Arafat
said. ``We stress that concerning any differences in final status
negotiations, we want to solve these issues by peaceful means,
through negotiations, and not in any other way.''
	   Although Arafat did not entirely drop the possibility of
declaring independence in May, when the current peace accords
expire, his call to solve final status issues including permanent
borders, was viewed as a back-down.
	   Israel termed the remarks ``positive'' and Netanyahu's adviser
David Bar-Illan said the prime minister ``considers this a
retraction.''
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet would still have to review whether the
Palestinians have lived up to their obligations before going ahead
with the pullback from an initial 2 percent. The Cabinet was to
meet Wednesday but the prime minister's office announced the
meeting had been pushed back to Thursday to give more time to the
Palestinians.
	   A statement said that by Thursday, Israel expects the
Palestinians to have jailed 10 of 30 named fugitives, publish a
statement against incitement and a plan to confiscate illegal
weapons. Sections of the Palestinian charter which call for
Israel's destruction are to be amended by the PLO central
committee.
	   According to the peace accord, the larger Palestine National
Council is also expected to address those clauses when it convenes
in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton in Gaza in December.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinians have
met all their commitments so far, such as resuming security
cooperation with Israel. Later this week, the Palestinians plan to
announce the legal framework for confiscating illegal weapons and
on Nov. 23, a committee reviewing cases of incitement will meet for
the first time, Erekat said.
	   Negotiators from both sides met Tuesday to discuss
implementation in several other areas including the release of 250
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails by Friday.
	   Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was to meet
with Arafat's deputy and the speaker of the Palestinian legislature
to resume negotiations on a permanent peace agreement after a
suspension of 18 months. Palestinian officials seemed encouraged by
the movement.
	   ``The agreement will be implemented at the end of this week,''
said Hassan Asfour.

Bochum goalkeeper cleared in doping case, Bochum keeps points
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German soccer federation (DFB)
cleared Bochum goalkeeper Thomas Ernst of doping charges Tuesday
and allowed his team's 3-2 victory over defending Bundesliga
champion Kaiserslautern to stand.
	   Ernst tested positive after the Sept. 26 game that Bochum had
won 3-2 and Kaiserslautern had appealed to be awarded the three
points and to have Bochum's victory annulled.
	   Bochum said Ernst was given a medicine to stabilize his blood
pressure at half-time of the game after he had been involved in a
severe collision with a Kaiserslautern player, Michael Schjoenberg,
who suffered a leg fracture.
	   Kaiserslautern would have lost the game anyway because its coach
Otto Rehhagel had broken DFB rules by fielding four non-European
foreigners.
	   The federation's legal panel ruled Tuesday that Ernst was not
guilty of doping and allowed Bochum's victory to stand.
	   Kaiserslautern withdrew its appeal during the seven-hour
meeting. Both clubs were fined: Bochum 80,000 marks (dlrs 48,000)
for using a doped player, Kaiserslautern 5,000 marks (dlrs 3,000)
for the illegal substitution.

Boesak assistant recants accusations in South African aid misuse
</HEADLINE>
trial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A major witness recanted
allegations of financial wrongdoing against anti-apartheid activist
Allan Boesak on Tuesday, delivering a blow on Tuesday to the
prosecution's case.
	   Freddie Steenkamp, a bookkeeper at the Foundation for Peace and
Justice charity _ now defunct _ told the court he had lied under
oath about alleged theft by Boesak of a million rand (dlrs 300,000
at the time).
	   Much of the money was from Scandanivian donors, singer Paul
Simon and the Coca-Cola Foundation.
	   Steenkamp was sentenced last year to six years in prison for
fraud and theft, after pleading guilty to charges totalling nearly
a million rand (dlrs 300,000 at the time.)
	   In his confession, he said he followed Boesak's example of
stealing charity money for personal use.
	   ``My approach to the problem was basically that if it was
acceptable for Boesak, then it was acceptable for me,'' Steenkamp
told the Cape Town High Court last year.
	   He apologized for lying about Boesak's role under cross
examination by Mike Maritz, Boesak's lawyer, and said a grudge
caused him to make false charges.
	   ``I'm sorry that it all happened. Money was easily obtainable by
the FPJ and I used it,'' Steenkamp told the court.
	   The former aide also admitted he had ruined Boesak's political
career.
	   When the court adjourned for lunch, Boesak smiled as
well-wishers congratulated him.
	   The case has badly damaged Boesak's political career, causing
him to give up an assignment as ambassador to the United Nations in
Geneva.
	   A former minister who once headed the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches, Boesak, 52, has paid back some money and an investigation
by the President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress cleared
him of any criminal wrongdoing.
	   However, the ANC probe was criticized by Scandinavian donors to
the foundation, and criminal charges followed. Boesak has insisted
he is innocent.
	   Boesak played a prominent role in the anti-apartheid movement
that culminated with the nation's first all-race election in 1994
that brought the ANC to power.
	   But scandal and personal problems, including a publicized love
affair with the woman who is now his second wife, caused Boesak to
give up his ministry.

	   MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) _ Jacques Medecin, who ruled Nice,
France, for 25 years as mayor before fleeing to South America in a
bid to escape corruption charges, died Tuesday. He was 70.
	   The cause of death was unknown, hospital officials said.
	   One of the French Riviera's most outspoken politicians, Medecin
held the mayor's post from 1965 until 1990, when he slipped off to
Uruguay ahead of pursuing French authorities.
	   He was extradited to France in 1994 and sentenced to 3 1/2 years
in prison for accepting over dlrs 700,000 in bribes from a traffic
signal company in exchange for municipal contracts. He also was
convicted of embezzling nearly dlrs 3 million from the Nice Opera
during the 1980s.
	   An appeals court later upheld his corruption conviction but
reduced his sentence, allowing him to go free after serving two
years in jail.
	   Medecin maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal, saying
he was a scapegoat for the government of late President Francois
Mitterand. The former mayor claimed Mitterand, a socialist,
resented his lengthy run as head of a right-wing administration.
	   ``I think everyone understands now that I was used as a smoke
screen to hide the turpitudes that resulted in billions of francs
in personal enrichment and that were the mark of 14 years of
Mitterrand's regime,'' he said.
	   After his release from jail, Medecin returned to Uruguay, where
he lived near the Atlantic coastal resort of Punta del Este.
	   Medecin is survived by three daughters.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More than 100 people, mostly in their
mid-teens, were arrested Tuesday in clashes with police during
events marking the 25th anniversary of a student uprising against
military rulers.
	   Chanting ``Americans are murderers'' and ``down with
imperialism,'' about 10,000 people took part in a march from the
Athens Polytechnic University, site of the 1973 uprising, to the
United States embassy, where they burned an American flag before
dispersing peacefully.
	   A makeshift bomb made of three camping gas canisters later
exploded in a district of the capital outside an office belonging
to the Greek Communist Party, causing minor damages but no
injuries.
	   A previously unknown anarchist group claimed responsibility for
the blast, accusing Communist Party members of assisting helping
police to make the arrests during the march.
	   The demonstrators were surrounded by more than 5,000 police
officers assigned to prevent the rioting that has marked previous
commemorations.

Israeli helicopter fires at guerrillas after attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ An Israeli helicopter gunship fired a
missile Tuesday night at guerrillas who had attacked an military
post in the Israeli-occupied zone of southern Lebanon, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   The guerrillas had fired rockets and machine guns at the
Baraachit outpost, about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the Israeli
border and 55 kilometers (35 miles) southeast of the port of Sidon,
the officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The post is manned by Israeli troops and militiamen of the
allied South Lebanon Army.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the guerrilla
attack and the gunship's retaliation. Nor did a guerrilla group
claim responsibility for the attack.
	   The clash came a day after three Israeli soldiers were killed
and four wounded, two of them seriously, in a roadside bombing in
the occupied zone. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah took responsibility
for that attack, which inflicted the highest Israeli losses in more
than a year.
	   Israel's army, with the aid of 2,500 militiamen, set up the zone
in 1985 to protect its northern territory from cross-border
attacks.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
reiterated that his government was not interested in keeping
Lebanese territory.
	   ``We will continue to work in order to withdraw the army from
Lebanon under the conditions that will guarantee the defense of the
northern border,'' Netanyahu told army radio.

	   MIAMI (AP) _ Chris Dundee, who turned Miami Beach into a boxing
capital and promoted more than 1,000 fights in a 40-year career,
died at a nursing home. He was 91.
	   Dundee, who also managed fighters, died Monday. He never fully
recovered from a stroke nine years ago.
	   ``Chris couldn't lick that stroke,'' said his brother Angelo, a
trainer and cut-man who worked with such champions as Muhammad Ali
and Sugar Ray Leonard. ``He couldn't walk, and I think that took
all the juice out of him. He liked to rap with the people and
couldn't do it any more.
	   ``If Chris was around today, there'd be a lot more happy boxing
fans, because he catered to the public. He had the knack.''
	   The Dundees were natives of Philadelphia. Chris came to Miami
Beach from New York in 1950 and soon began running the Fifth Street
Gym. Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano and Ali trained there before the gym
was razed in 1993.
	   ``Chris was the Miami Beach chamber of commerce,'' Angelo Dundee
said. ``That's why it was heartbreaking when they took down our
gym. That was a great monument.''
	   Chris Dundee promoted fights in Miami Beach for more than 30
years. On his birthday in 1964, Ali _ then known as Cassius Clay _
won the world heavyweight title with a seventh-round technical
knockout over Sonny Liston.
	   From 1928 to 1948, Dundee managed some 300 fighters. They
included Midget Wolgast, who won the world flyweight championship
in 1930; Ken Overlin, who became middleweight champion in 1941; and
Ezzard Charles, who won the heavyweight title in 1949.
	   Dundee also was a promoter for wrestling, the circus and the
Harlem Globetrotters. For years he hosted a Thanksgiving dinner for
boxers down on their luck.
	   Chris Dundee was enshrined in the International Boxing Hall of
Fame in 1994, joining Angelo.
	   Dundee was born Cristofo Mirena in 1908 and later adopted the
name used by Hall of Fame fighter Johnny Dundee. In 1926, at age
19, Chris began hanging around boxing gyms with his brother Joe, a
club fighter in Philadelphia.

Israeli parliament approves Mideast peace accord

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli parliament overwhelmingly approved
the latest Mideast land-for-peace accord with the Palestinians
Tuesday paving the way for an Israeli troop withdrawal from West
Bank land.
	   The Knesset endorsed the agreement by a vote of 75-19 with nine
abstentions. It was also a vote of confidence in Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who signed the agreement with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the White House Oct. 23rd.
	   Tuesday's vote and a retraction of inflammatory statements
earlier by Arafat pushed the Wye River accord over two major
hurdles towards implementation of the deal.
	   But most of the support for the premier Tuesday came from the
dovish opposition. After two days of rowdy debate, only nine of 17
ministers in Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet showed up for the vote
and two voted against it. Israeli radios said Netanyahu could
legally fire Shaul Yahalom and Yitzhak Levy of the National
Religious Party for voting against him. All nine members of the NRP
voted against the deal.
	   Others in his coalition stayed away as well, partly as a result
of viewing maps of the first withdrawal from 2 percent of the West
Bank which could take place by Friday. In all, Israel is to
withdraw in stages from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian security and anti-terror measures.
	   Coming out of a map room in the Knesset, right-wing lawmakers
said they were shocked to see how isolated some Jewish settlements
would become after the first pullback. Others complained that the
government was hiding the truth from them by only posting a map for
the first phase of withdrawal.
	   ``This is a fraud,'' charged Michael Kleiner, a right-wing
legislator in Netanyahu's coalition. The public and the press were
not allowed to view the maps. Kleiner tried to alter Tuesday's vote
to be based only on the first redeployment, but the Knesset speaker
rejected the request.
	   After seeing the maps, Naomi Blumenthal, a staunch member of
Netanyahu's Likud party sat with a group of fellow lawmakers and
looked close to tears. She told Israel TV it was one of the hardest
days of her life. In the end, she voted in favor of the agreement.
	   Kleiner, who voted against the deal, said two small Jewish
settlements near the Palestinian city of Jenin in the northern West
Bank would become surrounded by Palestinian-controlled areas when
the first pullout phase takes place. He said it would take Jewish
children up to two hours to reach schools in other communities
because Palestinians control would slice through Israel's current
contiguous hold over that area.
	   And Ephraim Sneh, a former general and member of the dovish
Labor party abstained. Sneh said territory had been carved up
around settlements and Palestinian villages in a way which would
complicate future negotiations.
	   Addressing the Knesset before the vote, Netanyahu said maps
would be shown to the parliament before each pullback. He called on
ministers to support the peace accord.
	   ``I hope that what comes out today is a wide agreement on the
Wye accord and the desire to see it carried out. I think this is
the only way to achieve peace,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Monday, Netanyahu suspended plans for the redeployment and
demanded a retraction from Arafat after the Palestinian leader
repeatedly said he would announce statehood in May and alluded to
armed conflict as a means to gain independence.
	   On Tuesday, Arafat opened a news conference by reading a
softened statement directed at the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis. Peace is a strategic choice of the Palestinians,'' Arafat
said. ``We stress that concerning any differences in final status
negotiations, we want to solve these issues by peaceful means,
through negotiations, and not in any other way.''
	   Although Arafat did not entirely drop the possibility of
declaring independence in May, when the current peace accords
expire, his call to solve final status issues including permanent
borders, was viewed as a back-down.
	   Israel termed the remarks ``positive'' and Netanyahu's adviser
David Bar-Illan said the prime minister ``considers this a
retraction.''
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet would still have to review whether the
Palestinians have lived up to their obligations before going ahead
with the first pullback. The Cabinet was to meet Wednesday but the
prime minister's office announced the meeting had been pushed back
to Thursday to give more time to the Palestinians.
	   A statement said that by Thursday, Israel expects the
Palestinians to have jailed 10 of 30 named fugitives, publish a
statement against incitement and a plan to confiscate illegal
weapons. Sections of the Palestinian charter which call for
Israel's destruction should be amended by the PLO central
committee.
	   According to the peace accord, the larger Palestine National
Council is also expected to address those clauses when it convenes
in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton in Gaza in December.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinians have
met all their commitments so far, such as resuming security
cooperation with Israel. Later this week, the Palestinians plan to
announce the legal framework for confiscating illegal weapons and
on Nov. 23, a committee reviewing cases of incitement will meet for
the first time, Erekat said.
	   Negotiators from both sides met Tuesday to discuss
implementation in several other areas including the release of 250
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails by Friday.
	   Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was to meet
with Arafat's deputy and the speaker of the Palestinian legislature
to resume negotiations on a permanent peace agreement after a
suspension of 18 months. Palestinian officials seemed encouraged by
the movement.
	   ``The agreement will be implemented at the end of this week,''
said Hassan Asfour.

Model program to stop TB successful _ up to a point
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Even the most successful programs to combat
tuberculosis fail to eradicate as many as a third of new
infections, pointing to the need for new strategies, researchers
said in a new report.
	   Baltimore's model program used state-of-the-art techniques to
cut the city's TB rate from one of the highest in the United States
to one of the lowest. It was among the first to implement directly
observed therapy and aggressive contact tracing.
	   But the two techniques did not stop the spread of the dangerous
lung infection among casual contacts, researchers concluded in a
report in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
	   ``It suggests that to bring TB rates down from low to even
lower, or if one wants to think of eradication, more is going to be
needed,'' Dr. William R. Bishai, the study's lead author, said in a
telephone interview Monday.
	   In directly observed therapy, health workers observe patients
take each dose of medicine during months of treatment to ensure
none is missed. Patients may be required to take medicine daily or
several times a week.
	   Contact tracing requires health workers to question each patient
to learn who he has exposed to the infection so that they can be
notified and given preventive therapy.
	   TB spreads mainly when infected people cough or sneeze bacteria
into the air, where they are inhaled by others. Incomplete therapy
promotes drug-resistant bacteria, a growing problem.
	   Tuberculosis is a bigger global killer than AIDS and malaria
combines. Last year, more than 7 million people got sick and nearly
3 million died from TB, according to the World Health Organization.
No effective vaccine is available.
	   Fewer than 20,000 new TB cases were diagnosed in the United
States last year, but highly drug-resistant TB has turned up in 43
states. An estimated 15 million Americans are infected with TB, but
85 to 90 percent or inactive and not infectious.
	   Baltimore implemented directly observed therapy and contact
tracing in 1981, and lowered its rate from more than 35 new cases
per 100,000 people in 1981 to fewer than 15 cases per 100,000
people in 1996.
	   But in the 2 1/2 years ending in 1996, new infections still
accounted for about one-third of all diagnoses, with the remainder
being old infections that had just begun to cause illness,
researchers said.
	   The new cases clustered mostly in areas with high rates of
poverty, poor education, drug abuse, alcoholism and the AIDS virus,
where TB control has traditionally been difficult, the researchers
said.
	   ``A lot of the recently transmitted TB appeared to be
transmitted casually _ probably between people who didn't know one
another's identities,'' said Bishai, assistant professor of
international health at Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene
and Public Health.
	   Contract tracing wouldn't help those people, Bishai said.
	   An expert not involved in the study noted that other cities have
tried the same TB-control measures for shorter periods and have
found the same thing.
	   Creative approaches will be needed, said the expert, Dr. Peter
F. Barnes of the University of Texas Health Center at Tyler.
	   One technique could use DNA fingerprinting to locate clusters of
new infections, and then an old approach _ chest X-rays _ to screen
everyone in the cluster for unidentified active cases, he said.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli parliament overwhelmingly approved
the latest Mideast land-for-peace accord with the Palestinians
Tuesday, paving the way for an Israeli troop withdrawal from West
Bank land.
	   The Knesset endorsed the agreement by a vote of 75-19 with nine
abstentions. It was also a vote of confidence in Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who signed the agreement with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the White House Oct. 23rd.
	   Tuesday's vote and a retraction of inflammatory statements
earlier by Arafat pushed the Wye River accord over two major
hurdles towards implementation of the deal.
	   Most of the support for the premier Tuesday came from the dovish
opposition. After two days of rowdy debate, only nine of 17
ministers in Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet showed up for the vote
and two voted against it.
	   Netanyahu could legally fire Mational religious Party ministers
Shaul Yahalom and Yitzhak Levy for voting against him. All nine
members of the NRP voted against the deal.
	   Others in his coalition stayed away as well, after viewing maps
of the first withdrawal from 2 percent of the West Bank, which
could take place by Friday. In all, Israel is to withdraw in stages
from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian security and anti-terror measures.
	   The Palestinians already control 27 percent of the territory.
	   Coming out of a map room in the Knesset, right-wing lawmakers
said they were shocked to see how isolated some Jewish settlements
would become after the first pullback. Others complained that the
government was hiding the truth from them by only posting a map for
the first phase of withdrawal.
	   ``This is a fraud,'' charged Michael Kleiner, a right-wing
legislator in Netanyahu's coalition. The public and the press were
not allowed to view the maps.
	   Naomi Blumenthal, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, appeared
close to tears after viewing the map. She told Israel TV it was one
of the hardest days of her life. In the end, she voted in favor of
the agreement.
	   Kleiner, who voted against the deal, said two small Jewish
settlements near the Palestinian city of Jenin in the northern West
Bank would become surrounded by Palestinian-controlled areas when
the first pullout phase takes place. He said it would take Jewish
children up to two hours to reach schools in other communities
because Palestinians control would slice through Israel's current
contiguous hold over that area.
	   Addressing the Knesset before the vote, Netanyahu said maps
would be shown to the parliament before each pullback. He called on
ministers to support the peace accord.
	   ``I hope that what comes out today is a wide agreement on the
Wye accord and the desire to see it carried out. I think this is
the only way to achieve peace,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu had suspended plans for the redeployment on Monday and
demanded a retraction from Arafat after the Palestinian leader
repeatedly said he would announce statehood in May and alluded to
armed conflict as a means to gain independence.
	   On Tuesday, Arafat opened a news conference by reading a
softened statement directed at the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis. Peace is a strategic choice of the Palestinians,'' Arafat
said. ``We stress that concerning any differences in final status
negotiations, we want to solve these issues by peaceful means,
through negotiations, and not in any other way.''
	   Although Arafat did not entirely drop the possibility of
declaring independence in May, when the current peace accords
expire, his call to solve final status issues including permanent
borders, was viewed as a back-down.
	   Israel termed the remarks ``positive'' and Netanyahu's adviser
David Bar-Illan said the prime minister ``considers this a
retraction.''
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet would still have to review whether the
Palestinians have lived up to their obligations before going ahead
with the first pullback. The Cabinet was to meet Wednesday but the
prime minister's office announced the meeting had been pushed back
to Thursday to give more time to the Palestinians.
	   A statement said that by Thursday, Israel expects the
Palestinians to have jailed 10 of 30 named fugitives, publish a
statement against incitement and a plan to confiscate illegal
weapons. Sections of the Palestinian charter which call for
Israel's destruction should be amended by the PLO central
committee.
	   According to the peace accord, the larger Palestine National
Council is also expected to address those clauses when it convenes
in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton in Gaza in December.
	   Negotiators from both sides met Tuesday to discuss
implementation in several other areas including the release of 250
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails by Friday.
	   Palestinian officials seemed encouraged by the movement.
	   ``The agreement will be implemented at the end of this week,''
said Hassan Asfour.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The world's newest automaker, DaimlerChrysler
AG, officially became a member of the global business community
Tuesday when its shares began trading in Europe and the United
States.
	   A balcony overlooking the main trading floor of the New York
Stock Exchange was decorated for the day with the red grille of a
Jeep Grand Cherokee and a silver grille of a Mercedes-Benz E-class.
	   Horns honked and the headlights flashed just before co-chairmen
Robert J. Eaton of the former Chrysler Corp. and Juergen Schrempp
of the former Daimler-Benz AG rang the bell to open the day's
trading on the NYSE.
	   DaimlerChrysler shares, trading under the symbol DCX, closed up
dlrs 4.81 1/4 at dlrs 84.31 1/4 in New York. In Frankfurt,
DaimlerChrysler shares edged up 60 cents to close at dlrs 85.20 on
their first day of trading.
	   Schrempp, who will take full control of the company within three
years, said it was an emotional day for him. Eaton declared it
``the beginning of a new era.''
	   ``This is a historic day for the entire auto industry,'' he
said. ``There is no blueprint for what we are doing today.''
	   Celebrations were held at DaimlerChrysler plants and offices
worldwide.

Turks, Kurds clash in Brussels streets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; with Italy-Kurds &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Fighting flared Brussels Tuesday
evening between Turkish immigrants and supporters of a militant
Kurdish separatist group who took to the streets to demand the
release of their leader arrested last week in Italy.
	   Two houses belonging to Kurds were set alight and windows were
broken at a cafe frequented by Kurdish separatist supporters during
the clashes in a neighborhood which is home to Kurdish and Turkish
immigrants, local news reportes said.
	   Police units were rushed to the area and two people were
arrested, VRT radio reported. There were no immediate reports of
any serious injuries, although a number of people were taken to
hospital, including one police officer was treated for burns.
	   Some 200 Kurdish demonstrators gathered to march on the Italian
embassy and demand the relese of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a 14-year
insurgency to secure home rule for Kurds in southeastern Turkey.
	   But fighting broke out before they left the largely immigrant
neighborhoods northeast of downtown. Local television reports said
police appeared to have restored order by around 10.0 p.m. (2100
GMT) some two hours after the clashes began.
	   Ocalan is seeking political asylum in Rome. Turkey says he is a
terrorist and wants him extradited to face trial.

Report: Soviets showed dummy missiles on Red Square parades
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Khruschev spelling thruout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Many of the monstrous strategic missiles displayed
in Red Square parades during the Soviet era were only dummies, but
they scared the West into an expensive response, a Russian magazine
reported Tuesday.
	   One such fake, GR-1, an acronym for Global Missile, showed
during a May 9, 1965, parade prompted the United States to build an
anti-missile defense system worth billions of dollars, said the
weekly Vlast (Power).
	   In fact, the Soviets had abandoned the GR-1 project long before
the parade.
	   Another two mobile ballistic missiles shown on the same day were
also fakes, their test launches having been a complete failure, the
magazine said.
	   ``Foreign military attaches were scared to death, triggering
panic in NATO headquarters,'' it said. ``A huge international
uproar followed, and only those who prepared this demonstration
knew they were dummies.''
	   One of the authors of the Vlast report worked as a Soviet
missile engineer and said he had personally worked on a support
system for one of the fake missiles to prevent it from bouncing on
the stone-paved Red Square.
	   The magazine said Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev first bluffed
the West with the legend of powerful Russian missiles, saying the
Soviet Union was making them ``like sausage.''
	   ``Such comparison sounded ambiguous for the Soviet people,
because the sausage was in deficit, but it duly impressed
foreigners,'' it said.
	   At the time Khruschev made the comment, the Soviets only had
four intercontinental ballistic missiles on duty, while the United
States had 60.
	   ``The myth about the Soviet missile superiority was convenient
for both the Soviet leadership and the American military industrial
complex, which was getting huge contracts,'' the magazine said.
	   It wasn't until 1970 that the Soviet Union reached a parity with
the United States on land-based intercontinental ballistic
missiles, and the overall nuclear balance was attained only shortly
before the 1991 Soviet collapse, Vlast said.
	   ``That was the end of the missile race,'' it said. ``The Soviet
Union broke its neck in the financial and technological competition
and collapsed.''

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More than 100 people, mostly in their
mid-teens, were arrested Tuesday in clashes with police during
events marking the 25th anniversary of a student uprising against
military rulers.
	   Chanting ``Americans are murderers'' and ``down with
imperialism,'' about 10,000 people took part in a march from the
Athens Polytechnic University, site of the 1973 uprising, to the
United States embassy, where they burned an American flag before
dispersing peacefully.
	   A makeshift bomb made up of a large number of camping gas
canisters exploded outside a branch of a U.S. bank in the
Korydallos suburb of the capital.
	   The Citibank branch was set ablaze, but police said there were
no injuries in the 11:45 p.m. (2145 GMT) attack. There was no
immediate claim of responsibility.
	   Earlier, a similar device made of three camping gas canisters
later exploded in a district of the capital outside an office
belonging to the Greek Communist Party, causing minor damages but
no injuries.

Ethiopian Jews turn to Americans for help

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of Ethiopian Jews demonstrated Tuesday
against government plans to end immigration from Ethiopia and
called on visiting U.S. Jews to help bring their relatives from
Africa.
	   Tuesday's protest was held outside the General Assembly, an
annual conference attended by some 3,000 North American Jewish
leaders, held this year in Israel for the first time.
	   Ethiopian activists complained that Israel is keeping some 8,000
of their relatives out of the country. The Israeli government,
which brought over thousands of Ethiopian Jews in two dramatic
airlifts, has said all of Ethiopia's Jews have been brought to
Israel.
	   Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, who heads a
ministerial committee on relations with the Diaspora said Tuesday,
that many of the Ethiopians trying to immigrate were not Jewish.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As peace activists demanded that the army
dismantle seven Jewish settlement outposts on remote West Bank
hills, settlers took over another hill Tuesday as part of efforts
to thwart a transfer of much of the land to the Palestinians.
	   Israeli army troops surrounded dozens of settlers who took up a
position on the hill near the Kedumim settlement but did not force
them from the site, Israel radio reported.
	   The latest land grab came as the Israeli parliament met to
approve the Wye Memorandum signed in Washington, which outlines an
Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank. The
Knesset approved the accord 75-19 with nine abstentions.
	   As the first phase of the withdrawal drew closer to its expected
date in the coming days, settlers have made attempts to take
isolated hills in the West Bank to prevent them from being handed
over to the Palestinians in later deals.
	   The outposts, consisting of several trailers each, have been set
up since the peace summit during which Israel agreed to the
withdrawal.
	   The settlers were encouraged earlier this week by Israeli
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon who said they ``should move, should
run, should grab more hills, expand the territory.''
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Monday that
Sharon's statement served to ``undermine the trust and confidence''
needed to make peace.
	   Sharon's ministry, in turn, said in a statement Tuesday that it
was ``taken aback'' by Rubin's comments, saying Sharon's point had
been the need to strengthening existing settlements.
	   However, the Israeli daily Haaretz said Sharon's call to seize
hilltops appeared to be contradicting a quiet pledge by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the United States more than a year
ago that settlements would only be expanded to ``immediately
contiguous'' areas. This would exclude the settling of areas
several hills removed from the nearest built-up land, Haaretz said.
	   Haaretz said the understanding was confirmed by five different
Israeli and U.S. officials. The newspaper said the Americans
accepted the limited pledge because Netanyahu made it clear that
his coalition would not accept a settlement freeze.
	   In a speech to parliament Monday, Netanyahu denied that he had
accepted any restrictions on Jewish settlement building.
	   Concerning the latest settlement outposts, the Israeli group
Peace Now and opposition legislator Dedi Zucker said Tuesday they
have asked Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai in writing to
dismantle them. If this is not done by the end of the week, Zucker
said, the activists would ask the Supreme Court to step in.
	   The Defense Ministry said it had not received the Peace Now
letter and had no comment.
	   In the West Bank settlement of Tekoa, one of 18 settlements
which will become more isolated after Israel completes the
withdrawal, settlers dug trenches and laid electric wire fences
Tuesday to increase security around their area.
	   Other settlements that expect the withdrawal to put them close
to Palestinian-controlled areas also set up lookout posts and laid
barbed wire, Israel TV reported.

Rodman publicist says basketball star happy with marriage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rodman confirming wedding; new to some points &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGIE WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Dennis Rodman confirmed Tuesday that he is
married to ex-``Baywatch'' television actress Carmen Electra. And
he said he's happy about it.
	   ``I love Carmen and am proud to be married to her,'' Rodman said
in a statement issued Tuesday through his publicist.
	   The two got married in Las Vegas on Saturday, but Rodman's agent
questioned whether the marriage was legal, saying the Chicago Bulls
basketball star was drunk at the time.
	   ``Obviously anyone that would marry somebody that was
intoxicated to the point that they couldn't speak or stand had
ulterior motives of some sort,'' Rodman's agent, Dwight Manley,
told The Associated Press on Monday.
	   Manley said Rodman, 37, was taken advantage of by Electra and
people he called ``leeches.''
	   But Rodman, in a handwritten statement, said he was indeed in
love and apologized ``for any false statements given on my behalf
regarding my marriage to Carmen Electra.''
	   After getting a marriage license Saturday morning, the two
exchanged vows at A Little Chapel of the Flowers on the Las Vegas
Strip. Workers sworn to secrecy refused to confirm the wedding.
	   Despite Manley's claim that Rodman was drunk, Cheryl Vernon,
supervisor of the Clark County Marriage License Bureau, said a
license would never be issued to someone who appeared intoxicated.
	   Cindy Guagenti, Electra's spokeswoman, said Manley's statements
were ``inaccurate and untrue.''
	   Rodman's marriage has not yet been recorded. The minister who
performed the ceremony has 10 days to submit the license to the
recorder's office. It is valid for one year.
	   Basketball's bad boy and Electra, 26, have been dating since the
spring.
	   Electra left ``Baywatch'' this month for another beach show,
``Hyperion Bay'' on the WB network.
	   Rodman's foster parents, Pat and James Rich of Bokchito, Okla.,
told Inside Edition they had met Electra and believe she will be a
good influence in Rodman's life.
	   ``I figured this could be the girl he marries,'' Pat Rich said.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Turkish immigrants battled supporters
of a militant Kurdish separatist group who took to the streets of
Brussels Tuesday evening to demand the release of their leader,
under arrested in Italy.
	   Two houses belonging to Kurds were set alight and windows were
broken at a cafe frequented by Kurdish separatist supporters during
the clashes in a neighborhood that is home to Kurdish and Turkish
immigrants, local news reports said.
	   Police units were rushed to the area and two people were
arrested, VRT radio reported. There were no immediate reports of
any serious injuries, although a number of people were taken to
hospital, including one police officer was treated for burns.
	   Some 200 Kurdish demonstrators gathered to march on the Italian
embassy and demand the release of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a 14-year
insurgency to secure home rule for Kurds in southeastern Turkey.
	   Fighting broke out before they left the largely immigrant
neighborhoods northeast of downtown. Local television reports said
police appeared to have restored order by around 10 p.m. (2100 GMT)
some two hours after the clashes began.
	   Ocalan is seeking political asylum in Rome. Turkey says he is a
terrorist and wants him extradited to face trial.

	   KADENA AIR BASE, Okinawa (AP) _ Meteors rained down on Asia in
blazes of red and white as the biggest meteor storm in decades
reached its climax just before dawn Wednesday.
	   From the top of the highest mountain in Thailand to the
neon-drenched streets of Tokyo, Asians turned their eyes to the
constellation Leo for the climax of the storm, which peaks every 33
years.
	   And wherever weather permitted, they were treated to a glorious
show of nature.
	   ``It's wonderful,'' said Toshiaki Kogai, one of hundreds of
Japanese who watched the storm from a park just south of Tokyo. ``I
never imagined it would be like this.''
	   In Tokyo and many other Japanese cities, public offices and
private businesses heeded a government plea to turn down their
lights to enhance viewing.
	   Though the night remained bright in the capital area, meteors
could be seen streaking across the skies every two or three minutes
at the peak of the storm.
	   Some appeared to fizzle as they fell. Others looked like moving
dots.
	   Each brought many a wish.
	   ``I only wish I could think up wishes faster,'' said Ikue Oe, a
housewife out watching the storm with her husband in the Tokyo
suburb of Yokohama.
	   The spectacle was eagerly met across the continent.
	   In northern Thailand, tens of thousands of tourists swarmed to
Doi Inthanon, the Southeast Asian country's highest peak at 2,565
meters (8,464 feet), and Doi Suthep, another mountain with a famed
Buddhist temple on top.
	   Clouds and lightning hindered the viewing as the storm wore on,
however.
	   To hedge its bets against clouds, NASA sent up two research
planes brimming with scientific sensors from this U.S. Air Force
base on this southern Japan island.
	   NASA saw this year's storm as a rare opportunity to study the
composition of both comets and meteoroids _ and perhaps learn
something about the origin of life on Earth in the process.
	   ``We have a very unique opportunity here to get some information
about the way life may have arisen,'' said NASA astrobiology
specialist Gregg Schmidt.
	   Some scientists believe the elements necessary for life on Earth
may have been brought here by comets or meteorites. Astrobiology is
the study of life on earth and its connection with the cosmos. It's
a reletively new science, and officials said this was NASA's first
major astrobiology mission.
	   Though Asia was best positioned for viewing the climax of the
storm, the Leonids were seen _ but not necessarily recognized _
elsewhere.
	   Rescuers in Norway were swamped with calls from concerned
Norwegians who spotted what they thought were red distress rockets
fired from ships in trouble off the southern coast.
	   ``The meteors really changed color, and sometimes they were
bright red, so I can understand that people associated them with
distress rockets,'' said rescue leader Ben Vikoeren.
	   The shower is caused by the earth's passage through the long
tail of the Comet Tempel-Tuttle. It is called the Leonid shower
because the meteors appear to come from the direction of the
constellation Leo.
	   Though the Leonids occur every November, they are usually not
particularly spectacular. But every 33 years the comet speeds
through the inner solar system and sheds swarms of particles as it
nears the sun.
	   NASA scientist Schmidt said the Leonid storm in 1833, for
example, packed as many as 10,000 meteors per hour.
	   ``The 1833 Leonid shower started a religious revival based on
what people saw,'' he said.
	   This year's storm wasn't nearly as intense, but it did generate
some very pragmatic concerns.
	   Many of the world's 600-plus satellites were maneuvered to
reduce the possibility of damage from the speeding grit, which can
poke holes in solar panels, pit lenses, blast away mirror coatings
or cause damaging electromagnetic pulses.
	   Russian space authorities said the crew of the Mir space station
was prepared for a too-close encounter and would enter the Soyuz
escape capsule when the shower hit its peak.
	   But Air Force Capt. Steve Butow, a senior member of the NASA
Leonid project, said there probably wasn't much cause for concern
for airplanes or people on the ground.
	   ``Most of the stuff that's making the trails in the sky are
probably no larger than the size of a small marble at the
maximum,'' he said. ``These things will abort at about 100
kilometers (60 miles). So no Armageddon tonight.''

IMF chief brings encouragement to Nicaragua, Honduras

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The chief of the International
Monetary Fund said Tuesday he favors giving hurricane-ravaged
Nicaragua and Honduras a break on their loans, wiping most of the
nations' IMF debts off the books.
	   While touring the region, Michel Camdessus proposed that about
80 percent of the counties' debts with the IMF be forgiven under a
program for heavily indebted countries.
	   The IMF director also urged individual governments to help ease
a debt load that had stalled development in the two countries long
before Hurricane Mitch hit them last month.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman said after a breakfast meeting with
Camdessus that such help would help his government use ``the
painful experience of Hurricane Mitch to rebuild and transform the
country.''
	   Camdessus pledged ``our total commitment'' to helping Nicaragua
and praised the government for pledging to continue with fiscal
reforms agreed upon as part of an aid package earlier this year.
	   ``This should be a very powerful incentive'' for other agencies
and governments to help, Camdessus said, ``because now we are
dealing not only with immediate aid for rebuilding, but also for
the reconstruction of a new and better country.''
	   As of last year, roughly two-thirds of Nicaragua's foreign debt
was with other governments and about one-quarter was with
multilateral organizations such as the IMF and World Bank. Most of
the rest was with commercial lenders or suppliers.
	   France, Cuba, Austria, the United States, Spain and other
countries already have announced they will pardon all or some of
the two countries' debts.
	   Nicaragua owes more than dlrs 6 billion and Honduras about dlrs
4.3 billion.
	   Both governments have struggled for years to reduce the debt,
which eats up much of their capital. The dlrs 300 million Nicaragua
owes each year is equivalent to 40 percent of all its exports.
	   Mitch added to the load. Nicaragua's Central Bank President Noel
Ramirez estimated Mitch had caused dlrs 1.5 billion worth of
damage. Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse earlier said
damage there could surpass dlrs 4 billion.
	   Ramirez said Nicaragua already has received low-interest loans
of dlrs 50 million from the Inter-American Development Bank, dlrs
70 million from the World Bank and dlrs 50 million from the IMF.
	   Camdessus came to Nicaragua shortly after Hillary Rodham Clinton
departed on Monday. The first lady said the United States would
roughly double emergency aid commitments to the region, to a total
of more than dlrs 250 million.
	   Turning her attention from immediate disaster to long-term
development, Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday visited El Salvador, where she
announced dlrs 1.8 million in U.S. support for a pre-school
program. She said that education was a key in helping El Salvador
recover from a 12-year civil war that ended in 1992.
	   Meanwhile, Honduran presidential adviser Plutarco Castellanos
told reporters on Tuesday that no aid had yet reached about 60,000
Misquito Indians on the country's Atlantic Coast, where the
hurricane hit hardest.
	   ``We are trying to bring humanitarian aid to the Misquitos, but
it is difficult to that because the zone can only be reached by
canoe,'' he said. ``And the rivers continue to be flooded.''
	   Castellanos said a Cuban medical team was working at Puerto
Lempira in the Misquito area but had not been able to visit more
remote parts of the region due to a lack of boats and fuel.
	   Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina came to Honduras on
Tuesday, bringing a 20-member medical team to add to Cuban workers
already helping in the region. Cuba says it has 103 doctors and 50
other health workers aiding hurricane victims in Central America.

Norman to be a ``guinea pig'' for shoulder research
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ While the rest of his family will be
skiing during the Christmas holiday, Greg Norman will be hooked up
to a computer with wires and needles to learn more about the impact
a golf swing has on the shoulder.
	   The research in Vail, Colorado will be led by Dr. Richard
Hawkins, who performed surgery on Norman's left shoulder in April.
	   ``I'm going to be a guinea pig for this,'' Norman said. ``I want
to find out what muscles fire first on the down swing. That will
teach you what muscles to work on physically, and that will help
kids 20 years behind us.''
	   Norman, 43, isn't sure that his grueling routine on the practice
range contributed to his shoulder injury. He has a long history of
sports that involve shoulder rotation.
	   ``I used to be a big swimmer,'' he said. ``Having that and
playing Australian rules football, cricket, all that stuff ... golf
wasn't the sole reason for the shoulder. Golf just accelerated the
problem.''
	   Hawkins had planned to set up video cameras at the Shark
Shootout last weekend, but couldn't work out all the logistics in
time.
	   ``It will be exciting to see what we can do,'' Hawkins said.
``Golf has been poorly understood and is hard to analyze.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; KITE'S CLUBS: &LR;  Tom Kite confirmed that he will be leaving Hogan
after 10 years to sign a new deal with Titleist. Kite's contract
expires in December, but he received permission to start testing a
set of Titleist DCI irons during the Shark Shootout.
	   ``This probably won't be the set I end up playing, but I like
the way they play,'' Kite said.
	   It will be only the third time the 48-year-old Kite has changed
equipment during his career. He was with Wilson for 15 years before
signing a 10-year deal with Hogan.
	   ``Hopefully, I'll be with Titleist for quite a bit,'' he said.
	   Kite said he expected to stay with Hogan for the rest of his
career when he signed with them in 1988. But Hogan went through
eight presidents during his contract, and he said the golf ball
became a factor in negotiations with Spalding, which acquired the
Hogan Co. a year ago.
	   ``I know the Strata is a good ball, but I've played Titleist all
my life, and it's hard to get away from that,'' he said.
	   Kite hasn't won since 1993, but Titleist figures to get a big
bang for its buck in 2000 when he is eligible for the Senior Tour.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LOOKS ARE DECEIVING: &LR;  On another equipment front, pay no
attention to the Armour 845 label on Fred Couples' bag. He has been
playing the new Maxfli Revolution irons since the PGA Championship
and apparently will stick with them.
	   Robin English, the worldwide tour rep for Maxfli, said Couples
will continue to play the Revolution irons. English was busy during
the Shark Shootout, going back and forth to the equipment trailer
to make sure Couples had the right specifications.
	   TearDrop, which owns Armour irons, picked up the contract rights
to Couples in its acquisition of certain Lynx assets in bankruptcy
court, and it was believed that Couples would switch to the 845s.
	   TearDrop spokesman Seth Ader said only that Couples will get
into the irons soon.
	   ``He just didn't want to change clubs in the middle,'' Ader
said.
	   While Couples recently signed a three-year deal to continue
playing the Maxfli Revolution ball, Maxfli will not be able to
advertise that he plays its irons.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MATCH PLAY MUSINGS: &LR;  While it's not yet official, the PGA of
America plans to treat the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship in February just like any other PGA Tour event as it
relates to Ryder Cup points.
	   With points now double, the winner of the 64-man draw will get
150 points. The four players who lose in the quarterfinals will be
considered having tied for fifth and each will get 45 points. The
eight players who fail to get into the quarterfinals will receive
3.75 points for tying for eighth.
	   The Match Play is the first in the new World Golf Championship
series and could become one of the biggest of the year because of
its format and limited international field. On that end, Augusta
National officials are said to be mulling over what kind of
exemption to give the winner and could have a decision by the
Masters.
	   As it is, winners of the major championships get a five-year
exemption to the Masters, while every other PGA Tour victory _
including The Players Championship _ is worth a one-year
exemption.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; AT THE TOP: &LR;  One golf executive looks like he may be staying,
another is on his way out.
	   F. Morgan ``Buzz'' Taylor has been nominated for a second
one-year term as president of the U.S. Golf Association. The
election of officers and the 16-member executive committee will be
Feb. 6 during the USGA's meeting in Clearwater, Fla.
	   Taylor, 67, first joined the USGA executive committee in 1986
and served as treasurer, secretary and vice president before
becoming president last year.
	   Royal and Ancient secretary Mike Bonallack will retire in the
year 2000, the year the British Open returns to St. Andrews. The R
and A already has begun looking for his successor by placing an ad
in British newspapers with a simple headline: Secretary.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; FINAL WORD: &LR;  ``All I know is, any time the flags go up, guys
want to win. And we want to win.'' _ Steve Elkington on the
Presidents Cup.

Alleged Quebec bike-gang chief on trial for prison guards' murder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with six grafs to UPDATE with testimony starting. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ A reputed Hells Angel leader believed to be a
key figure in North America's bloodiest ongoing motorcycle gang war
went on trial Tuesday, accused of ordering the killing of two
prison guards.
	   The trial of Maurice ``Mom'' Boucher got under way before a
sequestered 12-member jury _ the first time this decade the
precaution has been ordered for a Montreal jury.
	   More than 60 people have been killed since 1994 in bombings and
shootings linked to a power struggle between the Hells Angels and
the rival Rock Machine gang for control of Quebec's illegal drug
trade.
	   Most of the victims have been gang members or hangers-on, but an
11-year-old boy was killed by a biker bomb three years ago, and
last year two prison guards were shot dead, allegedly on Boucher's
orders.
	   Diane Lavigne, 42, was shot by a passing motorcyclist as she
drove home from work in June 1997. Pierre Rondeau, 49, died in a
hail of bullets from two gunmen three months later as he drove a
prison bus.
	   Almost as soon as proceedings began Tuesday, the prosecution
called its key witness, Stephane Gagne, a former Hells Angel
sentenced to 25 years in prison after admitting to shooting
Lavigne. He recounted the attack and was expected to testify over
the next several days that Boucher ordered the killings to send a
message to guards not to interfere with gang activities in prison.

Falk: Jordan sidelined for now in talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting Tuesday, more talks set for Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Michael Jordan will not get involved again in
labor talks until the National Basketball Association makes a
``serious'' offer at settling the lockout, Jordan's agent said
Tuesday.
	   ``When serious negotiations begin, I would expect he will be
back in there,'' agent David Falk said. ``The next step has to be
for the league to come in with a better offer.''
	   On the lockout's 140th day, the two sides met for two hours and
agreed to conduct their first full negotiating session in three
weeks on Friday.
	   Commissioner David Stern, deputy commissioner Russ Granik and
Steve Mills, the NBA's vice president for basketball development,
met with union boss Billy Hunter, Patrick Ewing, president of the
union, and Herb Williams.
	   ``It was, as usual, cordial but unproductive,'' Granik said of
Tuesday's meeting. ``We didn't get anywhere.''
	   Still, the two sides agreed to the larger session Friday.
	   ``We sort of sense that with the holidays approaching, if we
don't start making progress soon the season is in jeopardy. We'll
give it one more try on Friday.''
	   The first six weeks of the season already have been scrapped,
and with each passing day the likelihood increases of the season
not beginning until January.
	   There had been an expectation around the league that a deal
would be reached in time for NBC to televise its first games of the
season _ Christmas doubleheader of Chicago vs. New York and the
L.A. Lakers vs. Phoenix. That scenario appears increasingly
unlikely, too.
	   ``My guess isn't better than anybody else's, but I hope we're
showing games,'' said Ed Markey, an NBC spokesman. ``If there are
no NBA games, we might revert back to showing regular Friday night
programming.''
	   Jordan took part in the last full bargaining talks Oct. 28,
exchanging hard words with Washington owner Abe Pollin in a meeting
that preceded the 8 1/2-hour session. But Jordan has not been heard
from publicly since those discussions ended.
	   Falk, whose other high-profile clients include Ewing and Alonzo
Mourning, says Jordan will not be the individual to jump-start the
bargaining.
	   ``What this thing is all about is the process of negotiation,''
Falk said. ``Both sides are trying to be fair, but both have
different understandings of what fair is. There is a range of
fairness, and both sides should make sure they don't
overpersonalize this.''
	   The owners and players are stuck on the main economic argument
of what constitutes a fair split of revenue.
	   Players, who received 57 percent last season, are offering no
concessions to slow salary growth unless the percentage rises to 60
percent.
	   Owners, who had the right to reopen the last labor agreement if
the percentage rose above 51.8 percent, want the players to accept
50 percent.
	   The owners have offered increased minimum salaries for veterans
and have agreed in principle to the union's request for an annual
salary cap exception equal to the average salary (which was dlrs
2.6 million last season), but have demanded other mechanisms that
would limit salaries the highest-paid players could receive.

Bochum goalkeeper cleared in doping case, Bochum keeps points
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German soccer federation (DFB)
cleared Bochum goalkeeper Thomas Ernst of doping charges Tuesday
and allowed his team's 3-2 victory over defending Bundesliga
champion Kaiserslautern to stand.
	   Ernst tested positive after the Sept. 26 game that Bochum had
won 3-2 and Kaiserslautern had appealed to be awarded the three
points and to have Bochum's victory annulled.
	   Bochum said Ernst was given a medicine to stabilize his blood
pressure at half-time of the game after he had been involved in a
severe collision with a Kaiserslautern player, Michael Schjoenberg,
who suffered a leg fracture.
	   Kaiserslautern would have lost the game anyway because its coach
Otto Rehhagel had broken DFB rules by fielding four non-European
foreigners.
	   The federation's legal panel ruled Tuesday that Ernst was not
guilty of doping and allowed Bochum's victory to stand.
	   Kaiserslautern withdrew its appeal during the seven-hour
meeting. Both clubs were fined: Bochum 80,000 marks (dlrs 48,000)
for using a doped player, Kaiserslautern 5,000 marks (dlrs 3,000)
for the illegal substitution.

taking a look at Helsinki's infrastructure and plans for the 2006
Winter Olympics.
	   Helsinki _ and its co-organizer Lillehammer in Norway _ were the
last stop for the commission. They have visited five other
candidates; Sion (Switzerland), Turin (Italy), Zakopane (Poland),
Poprad Tatry (Slovakia), and a joint bid of Klagenfurt in Austria,
Planica in Slovakia and Tarvisio in Italy.
	   ``We are here not to compare Helsinki's bid to other cities'
bids. We are here to evaluate your bid only,'' said delegation
leader Chiharu Igaya. ``You have a wonderful sport tradition in
this country and you have produced so many great winter sportsmen.
The jumping venue in Lahti was really something.''
	   Lahti, site of several World Cup skiing events, would host the
cross-country skiing, ski jumping, biathlon and the freestyle
skiing.
	   Lillehammer, the Olympic host in 1994, is slated to arrange the
alpine skiing, the sledding and luge events.
	   The evaluation commission will meet at the IOC headquarters in
Lausanne December 8-9 to finish its report on the bids which will
be made public at the end of January. The decision on the host of
the 2006 Winter Games will be made next June 19 during the IOC's
session in South Korea.

	   Whether they stood on the tallest mountain in Thailand or the
desert in California, tens of thousands of people were searching
the skies for a glimpse of the biggest meteor shower in decades.
	   Clouds interfered with the view from many sites, but many
stargazers were rewarded with a spectacular view of meteors
streaking through the skies in blazes of red and white as the
Leonid meteor shower reached its climax early Wednesday in Asia.
	   The shower, which peaks every 33 years, is caused by the Earth's
passage through the long tail of the Comet Tempel-Tuttle. The
storm, which began Monday, got its name because it appears to come
from the direction of the constellation Leo.
	   The biggest crowds gathered in Asia, which was best positioned
for viewing the climax, but the spectacle was seen throughout the
globe _ weather permitting.
	   In Tokyo and many other Asian cities, public offices and private
businesses turned off their lights to enhance viewing. Though the
night remained bright in the Tokyo area, meteors could be seen
streaking across the skies every two or three minutes at the peak
of the storm.
	   ``I only wish I could think up wishes faster,'' said Ikue Oe, a
housewife watching the storm with her husband in the Tokyo suburb
of Yokohama.
	   Tens of thousands of tourists swarmed to Doi Inthanon,
Thailand's highest peak at 2,565 meters (8,464 feet), and Doi
Suthep, another mountain with a famed Buddhist temple on top.
	   People shrieked and squealed with delight as they glimpsed the
night's first shooting star at almost exactly 1 a.m. Wednesday
(1800 GMT Tuesday). But their enjoyment was tempered by the sight
of clouds moving in.
	   Officials said 10,000 people had passed through the national
park's gates by 7:30 p.m. Tuesday (1230 GMT), seven hours before
the anticipated peak of the promised celestial spectacle.
	   People huddled in blankets drove in, paid the 20 baht (55 U.S.
cents) entrance fee and continued up the mountain, scouting for
suitable viewing spots and turning the park into a tent city. The
mountain's actual peak was reserved for dignitaries and scientists.
	   The crowds that gathered at sites in the Mojave Desert in
California were smaller but no less enthusiastic.
	   The desert's campgrounds, normally empty on November weeknights,
were jammed with dozens of stargazers in the early morning hours,
many peering through telescopes and whooping and hollering with
each dazzling display from the Leonid meteor shower.
	   Sandra Macika, 36, of San Jose saw about 30 meteors as she
watched the skies from Mercy Hot Springs, about 30 miles (50
kilometers) south of Los Banos.
	   ``I could see in front of me big streaks of light falling on the
highway,'' she said.
	   One group was camping out in the Sandhills of central Nebraska,
getting away from city lights.
	   ``We're catching an average of two or three meteors a minute,
one of the best meteor showers I've seen in quite some time,''
Daniel Glomski said Tuesday morning.
	   Not everybody in Asia was treated to the show.
	   Outside Beijing, small groups of people huddled in heavy coats
and under quilts in temperatures around minus 10 degrees Celsius
(about 10 Fahrenheit) on furrowed fields at an astronomy station.
But while the sky was full of stars, only a few were falling.
	   And most Australians who rose early Wednesday were disappointed
to find storm clouds blocking the rare display of celestial
fireworks.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Ten convicted kidnappers _
including two Canadians whose imprisonment has attracted widespread
attenetion in their country _ began their second hunger strike in
seven months to pressure the Brazilian government to release them.
	   The prisoners stopped eating Monday after accusing authorities
of reneging on an agreement reached after a 16-day hunger strike in
April, the president of the Sao Paulo-based Committee to Free
Political Prisoners said Tuesday.
	   At that time, Judge Otavio Augusto Machado de Barros agreed to
transfer the ten inmates within 60 days to a minimum-security
prison.
	   The prisoners would have then been allowed to participate in a
work-release program before being deported by the end of the year,
committee president Breno Altman claims.
	   The ten _ Canadians Christine Lamont and David Spencer, five
Chileans, two Argentines and one Brazilian _ are serving 26 to 28
year sentences at Sao Paulo's Carandiru Penitentiary for the 1989
abduction of Abilio Diniz, owner of Brazil's largest supermarket
chain. They held him hostage for six days before police freed him.
	   The foreigners said they will now drink only water until
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso approves their expulsion and
grants the lone Brazilian a full pardon.

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Turning her attention the
disaster wrought by hurricane Mitch to long-term development, U.S.
First Lady Hillary Clinton promoted child care and
anti-domestic-violence efforts in El Salvador on Tuesday.
	   Mrs. Clinton was on the second leg of a Central American tour
that began with visits to Honduras and Nicaragua to announce
increases in U.S. aid for victims of Hurricane Mitch.
	   El Salvador's first lady, Elizabeth Aguirre de Calderon Sol,
accompanied Mrs. Clinton to her country's largest shelter for
orphaned, abused or abandoned children on Tuesday.
	   Mrs. Clinton announced dlrs 1.8 million in U.S. support for a
pre-school program, saying that education was a key in helping El
Salvador recover from a 12-year civil war that ended in 1992.
	   Little girls in frilly pink and green dresses dangled their
stocking-clad feet over chairs as Mrs. Clinton spoke at the San
Vicente de Paul Center, which was refurbished with U.S. aid
following the country's 1986 earthquake.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ One of Venezuela's most powerful
political parties huddled for a second day Tuesday to discuss
backing a consensus candidate to defeat former coup leader Hugo
Chavez in the Dec. 6 presidential race.
	   Leaders of the Social Christian COPEI have said they want their
own nominee, former Miss Universe Irene Saez, to lead the
anti-Chavez front but have not ruled out backing another candidate.
	   Party leaders said they would announce a decision by the end of
the week. Still, it isn't clear a consensus can be reached because
of divisions among the candidates and parties opposing Chavez.
	   Chavez's leftist coalition swept congressional elections Nov. 8
and he is ahead in all polls for the presidential race.
	   The leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt is backed by millions
of Venezuelans angry about widespread poverty and corruption in the
oil-rich nation. The wealthy fear he will impose a leftist

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A proposal by President Ernesto Zedillo to
combat rampant crime by creating a national police agency may be
doomed before it is formally presented to Congress.
	   Zedillo's administration on Monday proposed the agency as part
of a major anti-crime package, which also calls for tougher
sentences.
	   Opposition legislators, who control the Congress, said Tuesday
that the approach is dangerous.
	   ``Creating a national police would pave the way for a return to
an authoritarian rule,'' independent Sen. Adolfo Aguilar Zinser
said.
	   Rather than protecting citizens, the new police agency ``would
be used to exercise a more centralized political control, and to
try to dissuade dissident voices,'' he said.
	   The plan must be approved by Congress before it becomes law. It
was to have been presented to the Senate Tuesday, but its
introduction has now been indefinitely delayed.
	   In announcing the proposed national police agency Monday,
Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida said it involve a careful
screening process to ensure the ``honorability, honesty, efficiency
and skills'' of new agents.
	   The proposed national police would bring together several
federal law enforcement agencies, including immigration inspectors,
customs and highway police.
	   ``The proposed police agency could go after potential criminals
before any wrongdoing has been committed,'' Sen. Francisco Molina
of the conservative National Action Party said, ``and our
Constitution establishes that law enforcement authorities can only
act after a crime has taken place.''
	   Aguilar Zinser, the independent senator, said that if the
government is serious about creating a more efficient law
enforcement system, it should increase Congress' oversight
authority.
	   ``The problem is not whether we have a state police or a
national police,'' Aguilar Zinser said. ``The problem with police
is corruption, and the national police would be as corrupt as other
police agencies.''

Mexican authorities bring more charges against Salinas brother
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican authorities Tuesday brought
additional charges against the brother of former President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, in jail on charges of illicit enrichment and
masterminding the murder of a political rival.
	   A second count of illicit enrichment charges was presented
Monday by Judge Iram Garcia, accusing Raul Salinas with the
unlawful appropriation of more than 43 million pesos (dlrs 4.3
million), the attorney general's office said.
	   Authorities did not provide details of the new charges, but last
month, the attorney general's office announced it had discovered
289 secret bank accounts, 123 homes, ranches, apartments and land
holdings under Raul Salinas' name or those of an alias or business
partner.
	   Some 85 accounts were in foreign banks, totaling dlrs 55.7
million. In Mexico, bank holdings discovered so far amount to some
dlrs 94.6 million. Prosecutors haven't identified the source of
Salinas' money, but have said it is well beyond what he could have
earned in his position with a government food distribution company.
	   Illicit enrichment charges were first filed against Raul Salinas
in 1995 before the full extent of his holdings were known. Those
charges are still pending.
	   Raul Salinas also faces murder charges stemming from the 1994
killing of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the secretary-general of
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and Salinas' former
brother-in-law.
	   Salinas has denied any involvement. Prosecutors, who are seeking
the maximum 50-year sentence, and defense attorneys have rested
their cases and are awaiting a judge's ruling.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli parliament overwhelmingly approved
the latest Mideast land-for-peace accord with the Palestinians
Tuesday, paving the way for an Israeli troop withdrawal from West
Bank land. It was a vote of confidence in Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who signed the agreement with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat at the White House Oct. 23rd. Tuesday's vote
and a retraction of inflammatory statements earlier by Arafat
pushed the Wye River accord over two major hurdles toward
implementation of the deal. Most of the support for the premier
Tuesday came from the dovish opposition. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS).
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors spent their first
hours back in Iraq Tuesday checking their computers and
remote-control camera system. Spokeswoman Caroline Cross said the
first test of Iraq's pledge to cooperate with the inspectors _ who
have been blocked from working since August _ would come Wednesday
when they go out in the field. Eighty-six inspectors from the U.N.
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, and the International Atomic
Energy Agency returned Tuesday following the government's decision
Saturday to allow them to resume work. About 150 U.N. relief
workers _ who were pulled out like the inspectors for fear of a U.S
attack on Iraq _ returned to Baghdad on Monday and Tuesday to
resume the supervision of the distribution of food to Iraq's 22
million people. (IRAQ)
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The chief of the International
Monetary Fund said Tuesday he favors giving hurricane-ravaged
Nicaragua and Honduras a break on their loans, wiping most of the
nations' IMF debts off the books. While touring the region, Michel
Camdessus proposed that about 80 percent of the counties' debts
with the IMF be forgiven under a program for heavily indebted
countries. France, Cuba, Austria, the United States, Spain and
other countries already have announced they will pardon all or some
of the two countries' debts. Nicaragua owes more than dlrs 6
billion and Honduras about dlrs 4.3 billion. (MITCH)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ House Republicans readied an expanded witness
list Tuesday as they made last-minute arrangements for impeachment
hearings. President Bill Clinton's lawyers welcomed an opportunity
to cross-examine Kenneth Starr _ the prosecutor who has outlined
the case for trying Clinton on charges he lied to cover up an
extramarital affair _ but sought more time for their questions than
lawmakers allotted. In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee,
White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff asked that Clinton's lawyers
be given 90 minutes to question Starr at the opening hearing slated
for Thursday, when the committee begins to hear evidence in only
the third presidential impeachment inquiry in history.

	   ROME (AP) _ Kurds marched through Rome in a 10,000-strong
protest Tuesday to demand asylum for their captured rebel leader _
a demand Italy's premier said would be denied unless Abdullah
Ocalan has truly renounced terrorism. The march was the largest yet
in days of growing protests since Italian police arrested Ocalan on
his arrival at Rome's airport Thursday. Kurds are streaming into
Rome and launching rallies and hunger strikes across Europe in
opposition to Turkey's request he be extradited for trial. Ocalan
leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which is fighting for
autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey. The 14-year-old conflict
has killed 37,000 people. (ITALY-TURKEY-KURDS)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Hewlett-Packard weighed down the Dow, but most
stock measures rose Tuesday after the Federal Reserve cut interest
rates again to protect the economy from a global slowdown. The Dow
Jones industrial average dropped 24.97 points _ or by 0.28 percent
_ at 8,986.28 after wiping out an 82-point loss and then rising 91
points. The short-lived rally lifted the Dow above 9,100, the
highest level since just after the blue-chip barometer peaked at
9,337.97 on July 17. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Federal Reserve on Tuesday reduced
short-term interest rates by one-quarter percentage point, acting
for the third time in seven weeks to inoculate the U.S. economy
against spillover from world financial turmoil. The central bank's
monetary policy panel voted to move the benchmark federal funds
rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4.75 percent,
from 5 percent. It announced the change at the conclusion of a
closed-door meeting. Rates on a variety of consumer and business
loans, from credit cards to auto loans, were expected to fall in
response to the Fed's action. The largely symbolic discount rate,
which the Federal Reserve charges on its own loans, also was
reduced by a quarter point, to 4.5 percent. ``Although conditions
in financial markets have settled down materially since
mid-October, unusual strains remain,'' the central bank said in a
statement. (US-FED-INTEREST RATES)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Japan's failure to reform its banking system
represents the greatest risk to world economic growth over the next
two years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said Tuesday. The global economy still faces problems
even if Japan acts quickly, the OECD said in its semi-annual world
economic outlook that was released Tuesday. The OECD report said
growth in its member countries will slow from 2.2 percent this year
to 1.7 percent in 1999 and that open trade policies and easier
monetary policy in the United States and Europe are necessary to
prevent an even greater downturn. Growth is expected to recover in
2000, reaching around 2.3 percent. The prospects for world trade
are good, with growth expected at 5.3 percent next year, 6.1
percent in 2000, up from 4.6 percent this year. (FRANCE-OECD)
	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Tuesday
that he will visit Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in January to encourage
both nations to open up to foreign investment in their oil
industries. ``That will be one of the main purposes of my visit,''
Richardson said at a press conference following his speech to the
19th Oil and Money Conference. Saudi Arabia recently has begun
seeking help from U.S. oil companies in developing energy reserves,
the first time outside participation has been solicited since the
kingdom's oil industry was nationalized in 1973. Richardson
described the Saudi policy shift as ``a potential major
breakthrough.'' Industry analysts said the change was forced by low
oil prices, which have dried up the capital available to
oil-producing nations. (BRITAIN-US-MIDEAST OIL)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The world's newest automaker, DaimlerChrysler
AG, officially became a member of the global business community
Tuesday when its shares began trading in Europe and the United
States. DaimlerChrysler shares, trading under the symbol DCX,
closed up dlrs 4.81 1/4 at dlrs 84.31 1/4 in New York. In
Frankfurt, DaimlerChrysler shares edged up 60 cents to close at
dlrs 85.20 on their first day of trading. (DAIMLERCHRYSLER)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German pharmaceutical giant Hoechst on
Tuesday announced a severe sales slump in the first three quarters
_ and a major restructuring that fed speculation it might merge
with France's Rhone-Poulenc. Both companies declined to comment on
the speculation, which had boosted their share prices Monday.
Nevertheless, Hoechst chairman Juergen Dormann said, ``there will
be a further consolidation process'' in the pharmaceuticals
industry. Hoechst said it would split into two separate, listed
companies by spring 1999, spinning off its industrial chemicals
operations through a listing of subsidiary Celanese AG in Frankfurt
and New York. Hoechst said the move will allow the parent company
to focus on life sciences _ pharmaceuticals, pesticides and
biotechnology. (GERMANY-HOECHST)

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Michael Jackson, the Salsa Kids, Luciano
Pavarotti, Arthur Rimbaud's masterpiece ``A Season in Hell,''the
New York Public Library's reading room, and Dennis Rodman. Some
items have moved as separates. &QL;

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Michael Jackson met Tuesday with
President Robert Mugabe during a secretive visit to Zimbabwe hosted
by the state arms maker.
	   Jackson refused to speak with reporters. Mugabe said he
discussed ideas with Jackson for investment in a hotel development
in Victoria Falls, one of the nation's top tourist destinations.
	   The pop star arrived late Monday without advance publicity.
Hundreds of screaming young fans hearing of his arrival thronged
his hotel, and he signed a few autographs before attending a
cocktail party hosted by Zimbabwe Defense Industries _ his host.
	   Jackson came with a delegation from U.S.-based United Pacific
Holdings Group, said Col. Tshinga Dube, head of Zimbabwe Defense.
Jackson has a financial interest in United Pacific.
	    &UR; ___
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Hundreds of fans of the Puerto Rican salsa
group, the Salsa Kids, stormed a wooden platform on which they were
performing, causing it to collapse and slightly injuring the band
members, their agent said Tuesday.
	   The three band members were slightly injured when a wooden
platform they were performing on collapsed, group representative
Norma Pujal told reporters.
	   The platform collapsed due to pressure from the hundreds of fans
who had pushed past a security cordon and reached the platform's
legs, she said.
	   The accident occurred Monday in the town of Tena in the Amazon
jungle, 75 miles (120 kilometers) southeast of Quito. News of the
accident did not emerge until Tuesday because of the town's remote
location.
	   The singers suffered bruises to their heads and necks and were
released from a local clinic, Pujal said. They will return to
Puerto Rico shortly, she said.
	    &UR; ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti will give
a one-night performance in Lebanon in June 1999, organizers said
Tuesday.
	   Pavarotti, 63, will sing at Beirut's Sports City stadium on June
12 in what organizers are billing as a ``historic event'' to mark
the country's emergence from the 1975-90 civil war.
	   The performance will take place about 17 years after Israeli
warplanes bombed the stadium and destroyed it during Israel's 1982
invasion.
	   The 50,000-seat Sports City was rebuilt at a cost of dlrs 75
million for the Pan-Arab Games in July 1997.
	   Ticket prices for the Pavarotti show are yet to be announced.
Proceeds will go to charity.
	   Since the end of the 1975-90 civil war, Lebanon has hosted a
number of international performers, such as Spanish tenor Jose
Carreras, Julio Iglesias, Paul Anka, Shirley Bassey and cellist
Mstislav Rostropovitch.
	    &UR; ___
	   PARIS (AP) _ A six-page, hand-scrawled rough draft of Arthur
Rimbaud's masterpiece ``A Season in Hell'' was sold Tuesday to
France's National Library for 2.9 million francs (dlrs 517,000),
about half of its presale estimate.
	   The state-run library which opened to the public in 1996
exercized its right of pre-emption and obtained the manuscript for
the amount of the final bid.
	   All state-run institutions in France have the right to pre-empt
art and other valuables for its collections.
	   The sale at the Drouot-Montaigne auction house fetched a total
of 12 million francs (dlrs 2.1 million). The sale included 10
autographed poems by Rimbaud and two letters by Lautreamont, a 19th
century novelist.
	   ``Une Saison en Enfer'' (A Season in Hell), a prose poem dating
from 1873, has long been a cult work among Rimbaud admirers. It
expresses his passion for the writer Paul Verlaine, his lover with
whom he would eventually quarrel, as well as his religious and
aesthetic convictions.
	    &UR; ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The New York Public Library's famed third-floor
Reading Room reopened to the public after a dlrs 15 million
overhaul, showing off a brighter space, new paintings and work
stations linked to the Internet.
	   ``There's just a certain love that you have for this room and
for what it means and how it's helped me with my research over the
years,'' said Richard Cacchione, a financial consultant who raced
up the stairs when the doors opened Monday after the 18-month
renovation.
	   Norman Mailer, Isaac Bashevis Singer and E.L. Doctorow are some
of the noted authors who have toiled in the room, which measures
the distance of a football field and the height of a five-story
building.
	   The windows, which were painted over during World War II and not
cleaned since, now bathe the room in sunlight. Three large overhead
murals of a blue sky with pastel clouds that had turned brown from
leaks and dirt have been repainted.
	   The landmark library with the stone lions out front first opened
its doors in 1911.
	   ___
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Basketball bad boy Dennis Rodman is married.
Really.
	   Rodman confirmed Tuesday that he tied the knot with
ex-''Baywatch'' actress Carmen Electra.
	   ``I love Carmen and am proud to be married to her,'' Rodman said
in a statement issued Tuesday through his publicist.
	   The two got married in Las Vegas on Saturday, but Rodman's agent
questioned whether the marriage was legal, saying the Chicago Bulls
star was drunk at the time.
	   ``Obviously anyone that would marry somebody that was
intoxicated to the point that they couldn't speak or stand had
ulterior motives of some sort,'' Rodman's agent, Dwight Manley,
told The Associated Press on Monday.
	   Manley said Rodman, 37, was taken advantage of by Electra and
people he called ``leeches.''
	   But Rodman said he was indeed in love and apologized ``for any
false statements given on my behalf regarding my marriage to Carmen
Electra.''
	   After getting a marriage license Saturday morning, the two
exchanged vows at A Little Chapel of the Flowers on the Las Vegas
Strip.
	   Rodman and Electra, 26, have been dating since the spring.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Choking yellow fumes fill the air and
acid flows through the streets of the Wazipur neighborhood, home to
Asia's biggest _ and most primitive _ stainless steel complex.
	   In a hellish daily ritual that results from ignorance of safety
standards, greed and official neglect, 22-year-old Satish Kumar

vat on the roadside. He wears gloves and high rubber boots, but no
mask to protect his eyes and lungs from the fumes.
	   Kumar coughs, recovers and then jumps into the tub. For hours,
he stands there shuffling small sheets of stainless steel in an
acid bath to wash away carbon impurities left on the metal's
surface from the manufacturing process. He is paid 1,300 rupees _
about dlrs 30 _ a month.
	   Looking for work, Kumar traveled more than 600 miles (950
kilometers) from his village in Bihar, considered India's most
lawless state, to find this job in the capital. ``This is another
kind of lawlessness,'' he says.
	   Kumar works for one of about 1,000 small factories that clean
steel in Wazirpur, then dump the acid into storm drains. The
cleaned-up steel sheets are used to make glasses, bowls, spoons and
kitchenware both for export and domestic sales.
	   Wazirpur ``is a hell for nearly 100,000 people who eke out a
living,'' says Dr. Balkrishna Sharma, who runs a clinic in the
neighborhood. Many workers suffer from asthma and don't stick to
the job for more than three or four years.
	   When the monsoon rains come in July and August, an acid lake
spreads through the neighborhood, which also is home to a squatter
community of hundreds of people. The streets run black with
chemical wastes. Residents wade through acid solutions sometimes up
to knee-deep.
	   ``We have no choice. We have nowhere else to go,'' says Mohini
Devi, who lives with her husband and three children in a mud hut in
the industrial complex.
	   New Delhi officials long ago promised to clean up the area, but
made no progress. So, last year, India's Supreme Court intervened,
naming a five-man study committee that has recommended building a
100 million rupee (dlrs 2.3 million) waste treatment plant for the
area. Factory owners are to contribute half the cost.
	   The local government has allotted land for the proposed plant
and work is expected to start soon. The project also is to include
construction of proper drainage and the paving of roads. No date
for completion has been set.
	   Industrialized countries have switched from acid baths to an
advanced and safer electroplating system. But, with India's low
labor costs, that process would increase manufacturing costs for
Indian steel makers. And it also requires an uninterrupted power
supply, something the Indian electric grid doesn't provide.
	   ``We can't adopt that technique in the face of power
shortages,'' says Parsuram Sharma, a spokesman for a local factory
owners' association.
	   Conditions in the steel-making district are worsened by poor
maintenance. The area has huge craters instead of paved streets,
allowing toxic pools to accumulate.
	   ``For six to seven years, the authorities haven't bothered to
repair the roads,'' says Nirlesh Garg, owner of a steel plant.
	   The government collects at least 200 million rupees (dlrs 4.7
million) every month from the district through income tax, excise
duty and sales tax, but the owners' pleas for infrastructure
improvements have been unanswered, Sharma, the owner assocation
spokesman, says.
	   ``Whenever we approach the state governor, chief minister and
industry minister, the stock reply is, `Government has no money.'''

Ancient city struggles for survival in modern Syria

<TEXT>
	   ALEPPO, Syria (AP) _ Caravans of thousands of camels once
trudged down the cobblestone streets of Aleppo's covered market,
laden with silk from China and spices from India.
	   Today, the market seems little changed from the 16th century,
when the city in northern Syria was a center for trade between
Europe and Asia.
	   But the ancient heart of the city, where Syrian, Iranian and
Russian shoppers still mingle with the occasional Westerner, is
beginning to fade as Aleppans abandon their traditional houses for
modern apartments in new neighborhoods.
	   Some fear the vibrant old city, which was once a key stop on the
silk road, will soon become a sterile showcase for tourists. Its
population has dropped from 170,000 to 120,000 over the past two
decades.
	   Aleppo is fighting back.
	   The city government is using a war chest of 500 million pounds
(dlrs 10 million) to fix broken sewer pipes, install phone lines
and give loans and grants to residents to repair their homes.
Almost half the money came in a grant from Germany.
	   ``We don't want the old city to be a museum,'' says Tawfik
Kiziah of the government's Aleppo rehabilitation project. ``We want
the city to be alive.''
	   Encouraging residents to remain in an old area with decaying
infrastructure is a daunting task.
	   Sewer pipes, some of which date from before World War I, leak
water that ruins walls. That can lead to the slow destruction of
buildings.
	   The stone streets of the old city, which once held caravans
4,000 camels long, are often too narrow for cars.
	   Beneath the domes of the old market, bales packed with rolls of
cinnamon bark and burlap bags filled with square bricks of olive
oil soap overflow from tiny storefronts into the 12 kilometers (8
miles) of streets that make up the covered market. That creates an
enticing medieval atmosphere for tourists, but a cramped traffic
jam for residents.
	   The market is chaotic. Hundreds of shoppers and hawkers rush in
and out of the ``souk'' while old wooden carts piled high with
melons and red and yellow cherries rumble along the streets.
	   There are few schools or clinics near for the district's
residents.
	   Ahmad Nasri, whose family has lived in the same house in the old
city for about 250 years, says he's ready to join the exodus.
	   ``I'd prefer to sell ... but you can't get a good price,'' Nasri
says, pointing to the cracked paint and sagging ceiling above his
bed.
	   He says his two-story house, which envelops a courtyard filled
with lemon and orange trees, is too big and too old to maintain.
	   The city has given 210 loans to people like Nasri to repair
critical damage to their homes. Most of the loans were for only
about 40,000 pounds (dlrs 800).
	   ``This is only a drop in the bucket,'' says Adli Qudsi, a
consultant to the rehabilitation project. ``We are looking for more
money.''
	   He says the city plans to begin giving loans and grants of
150,000 pounds (dlrs 3,000) to repair houses that are of particular
architectural or historic interest.
	   City officials concede, however, that they don't have enough
money for many major repairs. Loans and grants, for example, are
not given to residents in some areas where the damage is the most
extreme.
	   The ruling Arab nationalist government often tries to highlight
the country's role in Arab history and supports restoration
projects that focus on its Islamic heritage, but Syria's economy is
struggling and its treasury is limited.
	   Khadija Hamami used her 40,000-pound (dlrs 800) loan to repair a
collapsed ceiling in the room where her son Ali sleeps. Another
ceiling has since fallen in and the unemployed widow can't afford
to fix it.
	   Outside the front door of her tiny, cramped house, a broken
sewer pipe drips water into an open ditch. In her courtyard, a
long, deep crack cuts across the far wall.
	   Hamami would like to leave for the thriving new parts of the
city, which is now home to about 2 million people. But she says she
can't afford to move.
	   ``There are no other choices,'' she says.
	   Khaldoun Fansa, a member of the Technical Committee for the
Protection of the Old City of Aleppo, concedes that ``it's a
challenge for us to keep Aleppo as a living city.''
	   ``It is a big dream, but we have to start, and we have,'' he
says

In Conakry, a revolutionary life is remembered

<TEXT>
	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ In better days, before he began wasting
away from cancer, the man who once was Stokely Carmichael _
firebrand 1960s American socialist, friend to revolutionaries and
preacher of armed struggle _ would stand on his balcony overlooking
the ocean, smile his enormous smile, and wait for the neighborhood
children.
	   As with everything he did, taking kids to the beach was part of
the movement that consumed his life.
	   ``Going to the beach with the children, that's revolution
itself,'' said his 17-year-old son, Bocar, as weeping women
consoled one another in Carmichael's linoleum-floored living room.
``It's unity and having fun and it's Africa.''
	   On Tuesday, the balcony was crowded with people mourning
Carmichael, who three decades ago changed his name to Kwame Ture
and moved to this ramshackle West African city. On Sunday, at age
57, he died of prostate cancer.
	   By the time of his death, Ture was relegated to the political
fringes, largely forgotten except as a living fossil of a turbulent
time in American history. The causes he espoused _ populist
revolution, radical socialism and pan-Africanism _ were largely
left to history's dustbins.
	   But to his family, the neighborhood kids and old friends from
the movement, a revolutionary was dead, and they came to pay
homage.
	   ``He tried and worked to build united mass revolution parties in
the United States and worldwide,'' said Bob Brown, who was first
arrested with Ture more than 30 years ago and had stayed with him
ever since, going to Cuba, Libya and thousands of college lectures.
	   In Ture's circle, the turbulent times are far from over. His
living room is a time warp of leftist 1960s ideals, a place where
bourgeois attitudes are scorned, where pictures of Fidel Castro and
Moammar Gadhafi hang in honored places near the doily-covered,
beat-up television and nearly all talk revolves around ``the
movement.''
	   Until his death, he answered the phone saying, ``Ready for the
revolution.''
	   But Ture's socialism was no empty gesture.
	   His house, while nice by West African standards, wouldn't
qualify as middle-class in most American towns. The road to his
front gate is treacherously rocky, and he had to look across the
roofs of concrete shacks to see the ocean.
	   When he got cancer, he received much of his treatment in Cuba
and Guinea, far from the world-class cancer centers he could have
continued using in New York.
	   ``The last words he said to me were, `Revolution comes before
medication,''' said Ture's mother, Mabel Carmichael, who came to
Conakry to be with her son when he died.
	   As Carmichael, Ture was among the most fiery leaders of black
militancy.
	   Born in Trinidad but raised in New York City, he began his
activism in the United States as a freedom rider, fighting to
integrate public transportation.
	   He also headed the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in
the United States and became prime minister of the Black Panther
Party. He popularized the phrase ``Black Power!'' _ a cry that
changed the way the once nonviolent civil rights movement was
viewed.
	   He cut his ties with black American leftists because of their
alliances with white radicals and moved to Guinea in 1969, invited
by one of his self-selected namesakes, President Ahmed Sekou Toure.
	   In Africa, Ture believed he had returned to where he belonged.
	   ``To him, it was home,'' Bocar said, ``and he taught me to love
it.''
	   His life continued to revolve around the movement. He dipped
into Guinean government _ then a brutal semi-Stalinistic regime,
rife with purges and plots. When President Toure died in 1984,
though, Ture stayed on.
	   His days were spent reading, writing and preparing the hundreds
of lectures he gave each year, mainly in the United States to
mostly black college audiences, preaching socialism and
pan-Africanism.
	   Divorced from two wives _ the South African singer Miriam Makeba
and a Guinean doctor _ he raised Bocar for years.
	   The idea that he became a relic infuriates his inner circle.
	   ``When I read about him in the United States, they make it seem
like he went into a big sleep'' after the '60s, said Bocar, a
student at the University of Virginia. ``What I saw growing up
here, that was wrong.''
	   ``He'd get up early, start reading, start writing, and just keep
going,'' Bocar said.
	   Michael Thelwell, a professor of Afro-American studies at the
University of Massachusetts in Amherst who is now compiling Ture's
memoirs, said the activist was misunderstood by the American media.
	   ``There's nothing wrong with being a militant,'' said Thelwell,
a onetime friend and colleague of Ture.
	   When his causes became passe, Ture kept pressing.
	   ``He never got discouraged,'' his mother said. ``He said if he
got one person to agree with him, he'd make a profit _ though not
of money of course.''
	   But even in Guinea, Ture eventually became a forgotten figure.
	   ``Everyone in my generation knew about Kwame Ture,'' said Daniel
Sara, a Guinean official from Conakry's American Cultural Center,
where the radical activist would stop in to use the library. ``The
young now, though, they don't know him.''

U.N. demands Yugoslavia hand over three charged with war crimes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Condemning Yugoslavia's failure to
cooperate with war crimes investigators, the U.N. Security Council
demanded Tuesday that Belgrade arrest three men charged with
organizing a massacre of 200 Croats in 1991.
	   The council also deplored Yugoslavia's recent refusal to issue
visas to Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour and a team of investigators
to visit the embattled Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   And it repeated its call to Yugoslav authorities and leaders of
the Kosovo Albanian community to cooperate with the tribunal's
prosecutor in the investigation of possible war crimes.
	   A Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists that started in
February has left hundreds dead, mostly Albanian civilians, and
made refugees of hundreds of thousands more. The province's ethnic
Albanian majority favors independence, while Serbs consider Kosovo
an integral part of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Scattered violence has continued despite an Oct. 12 agreement in
which Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged to halt his
offensive and start talks aimed at restoring Kosovo's autonomy.
	   A council resolution demanding that Belgrade cooperate with the
tribunal was passed by a vote of 14-0, with China abstaining. The
resolution is legally binding but did not contain any punitive
action if Yugoslavia doesn't comply.
	   The council demanded that Yugoslavia immediately execute arrest
warrants issued by the tribunal on Sept. 8 for Veselin
Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic and Milan Mrksic.
	   Yugoslavia, which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro, has
refused to extradite its citizens sought by the tribunal, citing a
constitutional ban on extradition.
	   But the council noted that its resolutions require states to
comply with requests from the tribunal, to execute arrest warrants,
and to comply with requests for information and investigations.
	   ``A state may not invoke provisions of its domestic law as
justification for its failure to perform binding obligations under
international law,'' the council said.
	   Despite obstruction by Serbian authorities, the war crimes
tribunal, based in The Netherlands, announced earlier this month
that it will continue investigating alleged war crimes in Kosovo
during the nearly eight-month crackdown by the Yugoslav army and
Serb police.
	   The Yugoslav government claims the tribunal has no jurisdiction
to investigate alleged war crimes in the Serbian province.
	   After Tuesday's council vote, British Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock asked what message Belgrade was sending with its lack of
cooperation.
	   ``Is it against reconciliation as part of the peace process in
the Balkans. Is it so completely careless of justice? Is it not
worried that the world sees that Belgrade just selects parts of
resolutions to comply with?,'' he asked.
	   But China's Ambassadpr Qin Huasun, explaining his country's
abstention, said Kosovo was an internal matter and ``terrorists''
on both sides should be equally condemned.

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ An austerity plan meant to stabilize
South America's largest economy could be undermined by corruption
allegations involving two top government officials, analysts said
Tuesday.
	   Brazil secured a dlrs 41.5 billion rescue package from the
International Monetary Fund, by promising austerity measures and a
reduction in its dlrs 65 billion budget deficit. The package was
announced Friday.
	   Yet analysts fear a scandal involving alleged attempts to
influence the phone company's privatization may stall key
congressional action needed to pass the austerity measures.
	   The allegations involve Communications Minister Luiz Carlos
Mendonca de Barros and Andre Lara Resende, president of Brazil's
national development Bank.
	   Conversations, secretly recorded on the eve of last July's dlrs
19 billion privatization auction of the state-run telephone holding
company, Telebras, allegedly show Barros and Resende favoring a
consortium of personal friends in its bid to purchase part of
Telebras' operations. The two officials coordinated the sale.
	   Since news of the tapes surfaced in the Nov. 9 issue of the
magazine, Epoca, the brewing scandal has been the top news story in
Brazilian media. Another newsmagaizne, Veja, published excerpts in
this week's issue.
	   It is unclear where the tapes came from or who made them. Both
Barros and Resende have denied any wrongdoing _ and the consortium
they allegedly favored lost the auction.
	   That hasn't stopped opposition politicians from calling for a
full congressional investigation, which analysts say could weaken
the resolve of legislators facing the tough budget cuts needed to
save the ailing economy.
	   ``The government's worst nightmare at the moment is a
congressional probe into the tapes,'' said Alexandre Barros, a
Brasilia-based political and business consultant. ``It will draw
attention away from the austerity measures and possibly weaken
them.''
	   In late October, the government unveiled a mix of taxes and
spending cuts in a bid to save nearly dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and
some dlrs 80 billion by 2002. The measures must be approved by
Congress.
	   The measures, designed to reduce Brazil's budget deficit of 7
percent of gross domestic product, are likely to aggravate the
economic slowdown and push unemployment past nearly 8 percent,
analysts said. Independent economists put unemployment at nearly 20
percent.
	   Some politicians, Barros said, will agree with the creation of
an inquiry committee ``so they can later indulge in some horse
trading with the government.''
	   ``They'll negotiate withdrawal of their support in exchange for
approval of projects that can dilute the fiscal austerity
package,'' he added.
	   Political consultant Jose Luciano Dias said an investigation
will give Congress a stronger hand when it votes on austerity
measures proposed by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
	   ``The President will become more dependent on the good will of
Congress,'' he said.
	   Aware of the danger, the government is rallying allies to delay
a possible investigation _ at least until after Congress approves
the belt-tightening measures.
	   To complicate government determination further, police are also
looking into allegations that Cardoso and three close allies
stashed away dlrs 368 million in a Cayman Islands corporate
account.
	   Unlike the wiretapping, though, the impact of these allegations
is quickly fizzling out, said political consultant Jose Luciano
Dias.
	   ``The documents are so grotesquely false that no one is giving
them any credence at all,'' he said.
	   Other analysts, though are waiting to see what details on the
wiretaps emerge before deciding what the impact will be on the
package.
	   Silvio Camargo, head of international institutional equity sales
at Banco Fator, a Brazilian investment bank, said that so far ``the
tapes offer no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing.''
	   ``If solid evidence of irregularities emerges, then the momentum
for a congressional probe will grow, jeopardizing the austerity
measures,'' he said.

Four train cars catch fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A fire broke out on a train in southern
Egypt Tuesday, gutting four carriages, police officials said.
	   Some 4,000 students were on the train, but all escaped unharmed
as the train was standing in a siding when the fire began.
	   The train had just stopped at the station of Beni Suef, 100
kilometers (65 miles) south of Cairo, to make way for an express
train when fire broke out on the roof, police officials said.
	   Some 20 fire engines rushed to the station, but by the time fire
fighters had extinguishing the blaze, it had destroyed four cars.
	   Railway accidents are not uncommon in Egypt owing to the trains'
lack of maintenance and overcrowding. Last month a train flew off
its tracks and crashed into the central square of a small town in
the Nile Delta, killing 47 people.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ For Al Gore it was a dream
assignment: Step in for the boss at a summit of leaders grappling
with a global financial crisis.
	   Two years before the 2000 election, the trip to the meeting of
the 21-nation Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum is giving
Gore a chance to look presidential _ mixing with world leaders and
lecturing his hosts about human rights.
	   ``I think that this is a perfect example of why the vice
president is very tough to take on,'' said Bill Carrick, a
California political consultant and ally of Gore rival Dick
Gephardt, the House minority leader.
	   ``He's going to be able to use his institutional position to
underscore that he's in office _ the second highest office in the
country,'' Carrick said.
	   Gore grabbed headlines at APEC with forceful remarks in praise
of the ``brave people of Malaysia'' who have taken to the streets
to protest Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's crackdown _ and
jailing _ of a former ally.
	   Of course, there were critics of Gore's provocative comments
about people power and human rights, in a country that in the past
two months has seen its worst rioting in three decades.
	   Malaysian Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz called Gore's remarks
``the most disgusting speech I've ever heard in my life.'' And New
Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley branded it ``megaphone
diplomacy.''
	   But Gore stood his ground. With Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov looking on, the vice president told reporters, ``My point
is very simple _ these economies have some very difficult choices
to make for reform to move forward.''
	   Back in Washington, the White House let it be known that Gore
was trumpeting administration views and following the path set by
Clinton, who during last summer's visit to China engaged in a
vigorous debate with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   ``It certainly was the same speech that the president was
planning to use, and it certainly reflects U.S. policy,'' said
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
	   Standing up to Mahathir should play well on the campaign trail.
And it could help U.S. human rights advocates forget a 1997 Gore
trip to China when the vice president was criticized for
de-emphasizing human rights to grab contracts for U.S. businesses.
	   Lacking during the Gore trip, of course, was the intensity that
invariably follows a president around the globe. ``Is that all
there is?'' one embassy staffer nervously asked a colleague at one
point, as a skimpy group of 10 reporters waited to record Gore's
arrival this week.
	   And Gore's substitute performance also underscores the
tenuousness of being No. 2: His political future is tied to
Clinton's success or failure.
	   During his six years as vice president, Gore has made extensive
foreign travels, and his familiarity with world leaders was on
display as he chatted and shared laughs with other leaders. At
other times, Gore the policy buff was on full display.
	   He discussed a futuristic plan to hook up the vast Asian region
in a natural gas grid. And he outlined a new plan to help Asian
economies recover with another dlrs 10 billion in loans and aid.
	   That will give Gore's boss something to talk about when he
arrives in Tokyo on Thursday to take up his shortened Asia trip.
Clinton will visit Japan, South Korea and Guam.
	   Gore will be headed back to Washington to resume his No. 2 role.

U.S. says sanctions against Iraq won't be lifted after review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS with deputy U.S. ambassador making clear that sanctions
against Iraq won't be lifted after council reviews Iraq's
compliance with its resolutions &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States made clear Tuesday that
economic sanctions against Iraq will not be lifted at the end of a
comprehensive review of Baghdad's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   The U.N. Security Council has promised to launch a review when
U.N. weapons inspectors confirm that Iraq has resumed cooperation
unconditionally _ and Baghdad wants the review to bring an end to
the oil embargo imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   But Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh told a news conference
that the U.S. government has always viewed the comprehensive review
as just that _ a review of Iraqi obligations and the many questions
it hasn't answered.
	   ``We don't see the sanctions lifting as the end result of the
comprehensive review,'' he said.
	   Burleigh's comments were bound to irritate and disappoint Iraqi
leaders who, in their own words, have been looking for a light at
the end of the tunnel.
	   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said Sunday that Baghdad
made a commitment to cooperate with the inspectors ``provided the
work will lead at some point to the end of the story.''
	   For Iraq, the end of the story is lifting sanctions and Baghdad
says it deserves to have the bans ended now. But the United States
says Baghdad has a long way to go.
	   Baghdad curtailed weapons inspections Aug. 5 and banned them
entirely on Oct. 31, demanding a comprehensive review that would
set a clear timetable for the lifting of sanctions. The Iraqi
government lifted the ban and agreed to unfettered inspection
Saturday, as the U.S. was about to launch massive airstrikes.
	   Burleigh stressed that while the council has focused on Iraq's
compliance with resolutions demanding the elimination of its
weapons of mass destruction, the United States is also demanding
its compliance with resolutions calling for an accounting of
missing Kuwaitis, looted Kuwaiti property and government archives.
	   To show that the United States considers the fate of Kuwaiti
prisoners ``an extremely important issue'' for Iraq to resolve,
Burleigh called a sudden news conference and brought along Ibrahim
Al-Shahine, vice-chairman of the Kuwait National Committee for
Missing Persons and Prisoners of War Affairs.
	   Burleigh stressed that Iraq must comply with all U.N.
requirements before sanctions can end, and he dismissed Baghdad's
suggestion that sanctions should be lifted incrementally in
proportion to Baghdad's compliance.
	   ``There's no issue about incremental lifting of sanctions. It's
not allowed under the resolutions. And as far as I know, there's no
member of the council arguing for incremental lifting of
sanctions,'' Burleigh said.
	   The Iraqis have charged the United States with misinterpreting
U.N. resolutions to prolong the process of lifting sanctions.
	   The comprehensive review envisioned by the Security Council will
be divided in two parts, the first focusing on disarmament and the
second on other issues, including Kuwaiti prisoners.
	   The Iraqis want an oil embargo _ which they consider the most
punishing _ lifted after weapons inspectors verify that they have
eliminated their nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the
long-range missiles to deliver them.
	   But even though some Security Council members might support this
alternative, Burleigh ruled it out and demanded Iraqi compliance
with all U.N. resolutions.
	   ``Our position has been consistent since 1991 _ that all of
these obligations need to be met,'' he said.

U.S. sailors regret not getting go-ahead to hit Saddam's arsenal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS EISENHOWER (AP) _ Navy pilot Lt. Matt Bartell was
getting dressed for his first combat mission Saturday when the
announcement came over the public address system: Stand down. The
United States had scrapped a planned attack on Iraq.
	   ``We were mentally geared up. It was pretty frustrating,'' said
Bartell, 26, an F/A-18 pilot from Barrington, Rhode Island.
	   From the cacophonous flight deck to the muted assembly room deep
in the belly of this aircraft carrier, servicemen said Tuesday they
felt let down they had lost a chance to bomb Saddam Hussein's
hideout.
	   But the disappointment was giving way to the heady anticipation
of celebrating Christmas peacefully with their families. There was
also relief that American troops and Iraqi civilians were spared a
possible war.
	   ``There will be a little bit of that, `Boy! We were almost
there,''' said Eisenhower's skipper, Capt. Denby Starling. ``When
you don't go out to do it, there is a little bit of letdown.
	   ``But am I disappointed that we did not launch aviators off the
ship ... and send them in harm's way? No, absolutely not.''
	   The crew feel like a ``basketball team that always practices but
never plays a game. And that was to have been our game. It was a
heartbreaker,'' said Aviation Ordinance Man Dirk Palmer of Fort
Monroe, Virginia.
	   By Tuesday, sailors had dismantled most of the bombs that had
been assembled and loaded on strike aircraft. After being on a war
footing last week, the 4,700-crew ship is settling back into
routine.
	   ``You should have been here a couple of days ago. The place was
steaming,'' Lt. Mick Rankin told a group of visiting reporters in
the combat direction center, a dimly lit room where officers keep
track of every ship and aircraft in the Gulf region on color video
screens.
	   But even routine is hard work. And impressive.
	   On the flight deck, a flat spread of steel layered with black
non-skid paint, jets and other aircraft took off and landed
regularly with ship-shaking shudders and earsplitting roars. Using
only 319 feet (100 meters) of runway, steel catapults hurled
aircraft from 0 to 170 mph (274 kph) in 2 1/2 seconds.
	   And every 45 seconds, pilots touched down in a narrow rectangle
to ensure a hook protruding from the plane's rear was ensnared by a
thick steel rope strung across the deck.
	   Eisenhower's complement of 46 F-14 and F/A-18 jet fighters fly
100 sorties a day. They keep a vigil around the carrier's battle
group that comprises 14 other ships _ destroyers, cruisers, a
submarine and smaller ships.
	   President Bill Clinton deployed the force after Saddam decided
Oct. 31 to put a complete stop to the work of U.N. inspectors
searching for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. A U.S.-British
strike was planned for Saturday, but canceled after Iraq agreed to
cooperate with inspectors.
	   Clinton has said the present level of force will remain in the
region to ensure Iraq fulfills its pledge.

Woods advances to championship round on Kauai
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GORDON SAKAMOTO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POIPU, Hawaii (AP) _ Tiger Woods rolled in an uphill, curling
putt on the 427-yard (389-meter) 15th hole Tuesday to shut out Lee
Janzen and advance to the championship round of the dlrs 1 million
PGA Grand Slam of Golf.
	   The 3-and-2 victory put Woods into Wednesday's final 18 holes of
match play against V.J. Singh, who had to go the full 18 holes to
turn back Mark O'Meara, who dropped his second shot at the final
hole into the water. Singh took the match, 2-up.
	   It appeared Woods, who got into the four-man field _ limited to
winners of this year's majors _ as the top alternate, would end the
match early.
	   After five holes on the windswept 6,957-yard (6,331-meter) Poipu
Bay Resort Course on the island of Kauai, he was up by four,
including 20-foot (6-meter) birdies on the opening two holes.
	   But Janzen, winner of the U.S. Open, rallied on the eighth and
ninth holes with birdies and he gained another hole when Woods
bogeyed the 394-yard (358-meter) 10th to pull within one.
	   They exchanged bogeys over the next four holes before Woods
landed his second shot at the 15th at the lower end of the
two-tiered green.
	   He closed the match with the uphill, 35-foot (11-meter) birdie,
which broke about 12 feet (3.6 meters) to the left and dived into
the hole. A birdie at the next hole closed the match.
	   For Singh, it was a measure of revenge. At the World Match Play
Championships in England last month, O'Meara embarrassed the native
of Fiji with a runaway 11-and-10 victory.
	   Singh, winner of the PGA Championship, was up by two through the
first seven holes, but saw the margin disappear on the 12th. A
birdie two holes later put him ahead for good as O'Meara struggled
with his putting.
	   O'Meara became the oldest player (41) to win two majors in the
same year with victories in the Masters and British Open.
	   Woods earned the alternate position after turning in the best
performance by a player in this year's major championships. He is
the only player who played in this event a year ago.
	   The first round of the 36-hole event, which was changed to a
match play format this year, was played under cloudy skies _ there
was a brief shower squall midway through the front nine _ and winds
gusting up to 35 miles per hour (56 kmph).

Dispersed families excited about sightseeing tour to North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo
 &UR; By PAUL SHIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ It was a cold winter day in 1950
when then 19-year-old Lee Man-soo was drafted into the North Korean
People's Army at the height of the Korean War.
	   Exactly 48 years later, Lee, 67, now a South Korean citizen, was
among nearly 1,000 people leaving Wednesday for a sightseeing trip
to a scenic mountain close to his hometown on the North's east
coast.
	   ``Half-happy and half-sad, that's my feeling,'' Lee said,
holding the wrinkled hand of his wife, Ji Un-suk, 63, also a native
of North Korea who was accompanying him on the trip.
	   ``I couldn't live a single day in the past half century without
tears,'' Lee said. ``Setting foot on North Korean soil is my
lifetime dream.''
	   Lee believes his two brothers, aged 74 and 77, still live in his
hometown of Songjun-ri, 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) from Diamond
Mountain, which North Korea's communist government has decided to
open to South Korean tourists beginning this week.
	   Lee's home village is near that of Chung Ju-yung, the founder of
the Hyundai conglomerate that is organizing the tour. Chung visited
the North twice earlier this year and struck a deal to start the
unprecedented tours.
	   If the weather is clear, Lee can expect to see his seaside home
village from the cruise ship which will carry him and other
tourists from South Korea. About half of them have relatives in
North Korea.
	   About 10 million people in both Koreas remain separated from
their families since the division of their peninsula into the
communist North and the capitalist South in 1945 and the 1950-53
Korean War. Their border, the world's most heavily armed, is sealed
with no mail or other direct means of communications.
	   Only a handful of family reunions have been permitted by the two
governments. And none will be allowed during this week's tour,
which will last four nights and five days.
	   Yet, Lee thinks he is lucky, because he will be one of those who
will come closest to their homes. He happily remembers the days he
climbed Diamond Mountain twice.
	   Lee also sadly remembers the day he was separated from his
family and inducted into the North Korean army.
	   With no military training, he was thrown into battle as a medic.
His battalion fought numerous battles with South Korean and U.S.
troops as it kept advancing southward.
	   In one battle with American troops in early 1951, Lee's
battalion lost half of its men and he surrendered. He was later set
free and became a South Korean citizen.
	   ``I became a Christian and I'm now happily married. But I always
feel empty somewhere deep in my heart. Family, my family in the
North, always gives me pain,'' he said.
	   Lee's tragedy is shared by many other separated family members
on the tour.
	   Shim Jae-rin, at 98, is the oldest among those on the tour and
has to take sleeping pills to calm himself.
	   ``After the word that I can go, I can't sleep without pills,''
Shim said. ``My home in the North is several hundred kilometers
(miles) from Diamond Mountain, but to me, going to the mountain is
going halfway to my home.''
	   Shim, a widower, said his friends and neighbors chipped in to
pay his fare of dlrs 800. Others are paying up to dlrs 2,530 for
better shipboard accommodations.
	   Shim said his brother living in Los Angeles visited the North a
few years ago and confirmed that many of his relatives are still
alive in his home town of Jinnampo on the North's west coast.
	   While sympathizing with the problems of separated family
members, government officials are concerned that emotionally
overwhelmed visitors may break away to try to meet their families.
	   ``Don't think ever that family reunion will be possible. If you
do anything to provoke North Koreans, that will jeopardize the
whole tour project,'' Sohn In-sup, a government instructor, said
during a recent orientation for travellers.

Hingis beats Schnyder at Grand Slam Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Martina Hingis was healthy this time.
	   The last time she played her Swiss Fed Cup teammate, Hingis
retired with leg cramps during their semifinal match at the Grand
Slam Cup just over a month ago. The two were tied 5-5 in the third
set at the time.
	   Tuesday night, Hingis lost a hard-fought first set before
defeating Patty Schnyder 4-6, 6-0, 6-3 and advancing to the
quarterfinals at the dlrs 2 million Chase Championships.
	   Earlier Tuesday, in the daytime debut of the season-ending
tournament, No. 8 Nathalie Tauziat of France beat Natasha Zvereva
of Belarus 6-3, 6-1.
	   In a late match, No. 3 Jana Novotna played Steffi Graf, a
five-time Champions winner who came into this year's tournament
unseeded but on a 10-match winning streak.
	   Schnyder and Hingis engaged in long baseline barrages, striking
with power and keeping the ball deep. Hingis pulled off the first
service break, in the fifth game of the opening set when Schnyder
made two forehand errors. But the second-seeded Hingis gave the
break right back in the next game when she double-faulted on both
of the last two points.
	   Both struggled to hold serve before Schnyder finally did in the
10th game to close out the first set, much to the displeasure of
Hingis. When a shot by Schnyder that appeared to hit the baseline
was not called long, Hingis whined, ``Come on.''
	   The loss of the set was like a wakeup call. Hingis ripped
through the next set as her penetrating groundstrokes kept Schnyder
back on her heels behind the baseline.
	   She was only getting her second wind.
	   The third set produced excellent tennis as both players found
the lines. Schnyder broke Hingis in the second game after the two
battled through three deuces. On the final point of the game, both
were at the net when Schnyder opened the face or her racket and
lofted a perfect forehand volley over the head of Hingis.
	   The Madison Square Garden crowd roared its approval.
	   Hingis broke right back at 30. Then, in the next game, Schnyder
won the longest point of the match when Hingis raced to her left
and hit a backhand down the line that was wide.
	   Hingis yelped, then regrouped to eventually hold serve. She also
won the next two games to take a 4-2 lead, and after Schnyder held
at love in the seventh game, Hingis wrapped up the first-round
victory by losing only three points in the next two games.
	   The last time Tauziat and Zvereva played was on center court at
Wimbledon, with Tauziat coming from behind to earn a hard-fought,
three-set victory.
	   Their match Tuesday featured a lot of points but little
excitement as Zvereva couldn't do enough with the ball to create
problems for the French veteran. Tauziat, for her part, kept
hitting to Zvereva's backhand, a tactic that worked repeatedly.
	   Tauziat pulled off the first service break in the match, that
coming in the sixth game of the first set as she took a 4-2 lead.
That was followed by two more breaks of serve, giving Tauziat a 5-3
lead. She closed out the set when Zvereva's backhand down the line
was wide.
	   It only took 37 minutes for Tauziat to wrap up the opening set
before a sparse Garden crowd. She sailed through the second set in
31 minutes.

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The United States, China, Germany and
Norway will be the four seeds for next summer's Women's World Cup,
FIFA said Tuesday.
	   The 16-team tournament will be played in eight U.S. cities from
June 19-July 10. The draw will take place Feb. 14 at San Jose,
California during halftime of a game between the U.S. women's team

Tokyo stocks rise, dollar higher in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices edged higher in early trading
Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve slashed interest rates.
The U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 12.39 points,
or 0.86 percent, to 14,425.39 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Tuesday, the average lost 15.27 points, or 0.11
percent.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve announced a quarter-percentage point
cut in short-term interest rates Tuesday. Traders said the move
would boost stability in the U.S. stock market, which will benefit
Tokyo stocks.
	   America's central bank decided to reduce the benchmark federal
funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4.75
percent, from 5 percent. The discount rate, which the Fed charges
on its own loans to banks, fell to 4.5 percent.
	   Analysts said, however, that the positive impact of the U.S.
move on Tokyo stocks would be undermined by Moody's Investors
Service's downgrade Tuesday of Japanese government securities,
which will increase borrowing costs.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 0.84 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,106.81.
The TOPIX closed up 2.15 points, or 0.19 percent Tuesday.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 24.97 points _ or 0.28 percent _ to close Tuesday's session
at 8,986.28.
	   On the foreign exchange market, short-covering pushed the dollar
higher against the yen in early trading, dealers in Tokyo said.
	   The dollar was traded at 121.22 yen, up 0.60 yen from late in
Tokyo on Tuesday and also above its late New York level of 121.00
yen overnight.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.845 percent from 0.855 percent Tuesday, driving it's
price up to 108.45 yen from 108.41 yen.

Israeli parliament approves Mideast land-for-peace deal

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Approval for the Middle East land-for-peace
accord moves back to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fractious
cabinet, now that it has cleared the parliament with an
overwhelming vote affirming the plan.
	   The Knesset endorsed the agreement to withdraw Israeli troops
from West Bank territory by a 75-19 vote with nine abstentions. It
was a vote of confidence in Netanyahu, who signed the agreement
with Yasser Arafat at the White House Oct. 23.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet would still have to review whether the
Palestinians have lived up to their obligations before going ahead
with the pullback from an initial 2 percent.
	   The Cabinet was to meet Wednesday, but the prime minister's
office announced the meeting had been pushed back to Thursday to
give more time to the Palestinians.
	   The Cabinet barely approved the accord last week, with eight
ministers voting in favor, four against and five abstaining.
	   Most of Netanyahu's support Tuesday came from the dovish
opposition. After two days of rowdy debate, only nine of 17
ministers in Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet showed up for the vote
and two voted against the U.S.-brokered accord that calls for
Israel to withdraw troops from an additional 13 percent of the West
Bank.
	   Lawmakers got their first look at withdrawal maps before
Tuesday's vote. Coming out of a map room in the Knesset, right-wing
lawmakers said they were shocked to see how isolated some Jewish
settlements would become after the first pullout from 2 percent of
the area.
	   Others complained that the government was hiding the truth from
them by only posting a map for the first phase of withdrawal.
	   ``This is a fraud,'' charged Michael Kleiner, a right-wing
legislator in Netanyahu's coalition. The public and the media were
not allowed to view the maps.
	   Addressing the Knesset earlier, Netanyahu said maps would be
shown to the parliament before each pullback and called on
ministers to support the peace accord.
	   ``I hope that what comes out today is a wide agreement on the
Wye accord and the desire to see it carried out. I think this is
the only way to achieve peace,'' Netanyahu said.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu suspended plans for the redeployment and
demanded a retraction from Arafat after the Palestinian leader
repeatedly said he would announce statehood in May and alluded to
armed conflict as a means to gain independence.
	   Arafat opened a news conference Tuesday by reading a softened
statement directed at the Israelis.
	   ``I stress ... that we are protective of the peace process in
the Middle East and all the peace agreements we signed with the
Israelis. Peace is a strategic choice of the Palestinians,'' Arafat
said.
	   Although Arafat did not entirely drop the possibility of
declaring independence in May, when the current peace accords
expire, his call to solve final status issues including permanent
borders, was viewed as a back-down.
	   A statement said that by Thursday, Israel expects the
Palestinians to have jailed 10 of 30 named fugitives, publish a
statement against incitement and a plan to confiscate illegal
weapons. Sections of the Palestinian charter which call for
Israel's destruction are to be amended by the PLO central
committee.
	   According to the peace accord, the larger Palestine National
Council is also expected to address those clauses when it convenes
in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton in Gaza in December.

U.S. says sanctions against Iraq won't be lifted after review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late reaction from Iraq's U.N. ambassador &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States made clear Tuesday that
economic sanctions against Iraq will not be lifted at the end of a
comprehensive review of Baghdad's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   The U.N. Security Council has promised to launch a review when
U.N. weapons inspectors confirm that Iraq has resumed cooperation
unconditionally _ and Baghdad wants the review to bring an end to
the oil embargo imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   But Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh told a news conference
that the U.S. government has always viewed the comprehensive review
as just that _ a review of Iraqi obligations and the many questions
it hasn't answered.
	   ``We don't see the sanctions lifting as the end result of the
comprehensive review,'' he said.
	   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said Tuesday night that
Baghdad believes it will be able to convince the Security Council
that it has meet ``the bulk of the requirements'' in the
resolutions.
	   ``And if the comprehensive review comes up with a conclusion
that Iraq has done so, the sanctions obviously and logically should
be lifted,'' he said.
	   Baghdad curtailed weapons inspections Aug. 5 and banned them
entirely on Oct. 31, demanding a comprehensive review that would
set a clear timetable for the lifting of sanctions. The Iraqi
government lifted the ban and agreed to unfettered inspection
Saturday, as the U.S. was about to launch massive airstrikes.
	   Burleigh stressed that while the council has focused on Iraq's
compliance with resolutions demanding the elimination of its
weapons of mass destruction, the United States is also demanding
its compliance with resolutions calling for an accounting of
missing Kuwaitis, looted Kuwaiti property and government archives.
	   To show that the United States considers the fate of Kuwaiti
prisoners ``an extremely important issue'' for Iraq to resolve,
Burleigh called a sudden news conference and brought along Ibrahim
Al-Shahine, vice-chairman of the Kuwait National Committee for
Missing Persons and Prisoners of War Affairs.
	   Al-Shahine said Kuwait wants an accounting of 600 Kuwaitis;
Hamdoon said they were missing in action.
	   ``We do not have any detainees or prisoners of war and we have
been cooperating with the ICRC on this matter,'' Hamdoon said,
referring to the International Committee of the Red Cross,
``providing whatever information that is available.''

Premier: Kurdish leader must prove he's renounced terrorism

	   ROME (AP) _ Kurds are launching rallies and hunger strikes
across Europe in opposition to Turkey's request that a captured
Kurdish rebel leader be extradited for trial.
	   An estimated 10,000 Kurds protested in Rome on Tuesday to demand
asylum for their captured leader _ a demand Italy's premier said
would be denied unless the rebel commander has truly renounced
terrorism.
	   The march was the largest yet in days of growing protests since
Italian police arrested Abdullah Ocalan at Rome's airport Thursday.
	   More than 4,000 also protested Tuesday outside the Interior
Ministry in Bonn, Germany. Smaller but more violent protests were
staged in Moscow, Ankara, Turkey, and the Belgian capital,
Brussels.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which is
fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey. The
14-year-old conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Supporters marched past the Colosseum and into Piazza Venezia on
Tuesday, waving red flags and making the streets of downtown Rome
ring with their cries.
	   Kneeling in the piazza, they chanted, ``We love you, Ocalan. We
are with you, Ocalan. We will die for you, Ocalan.''
	   Premier Massimo D'Alema told Parliament's lower house Tuesday
that Ocalan ``rejected all terrorist actions'' in a statement
issued Monday. ``Now it's a matter of seeing whether he sticks to
it.''
	   ``Our country doesn't intend to be a host for terrorist
activities,'' D'Alema said.
	   Turkey, one of Italy's NATO allies and a strong trading partner,
is pushing hard for Ocalan's extradition.
	   However, extradition appears unlikely because Ocalan is on trial
in absentia for capital crimes in Turkey. Italy's courts have
consistently refused to extradite suspects to countries where they
could be executed.
	   ``This is not an act of hostility toward Turkey, but one of
respect for our own laws, history and values,'' said D'Alema.
	   Turkey is so eager to get Ocalan back that it has taken steps
toward abolishing capital punishment.
	   Syria recently expelled Ocalan from his longtime haven under
pressure from Turkey. He then sought asylum in Russia, but was
rebuffed. From Moscow, he flew to Rome, where he was arrested.
	   Ocalan is believed held in a military hospital in Rome.
	   The Kurdish cause enjoys considerable sympathy in Europe. In
Turkey, though, many Turks are incensed at what they see as Italy's
harboring of a terrorist.
	   In Ankara on Tuesday, hundreds of Turks demonstrated outside the
Italian Embassy.
	   ``If he's not handed over, we'll walk to Italy, we'll annex
Italy, we'll turn Italy upside down!'' one demonstrator screamed
into a loudspeaker.
	   In Moscow, about 100 Kurds continued a hunger strike for a
fourth day to protest what they claim is an international
conspiracy against Ocalan. Two Ocalan supporters set themselves on
fire outside the Russian parliament building. Police extinguished
the flames and the two men were hospitalized with burns, officials
said.
	   In Brussels, about 200 Kurdish demonstrators marched outside the
Italian Embassy demanding Ocalan's release. In one neighborhood,
Turkish immigrants battled supporters of Ocalan. Two houses
belonging to Kurds were set alight and windows were broken at a
cafe frequented by Kurdish separatist supporters. No serious
injuries were reported.
	   Germany also has an outstanding warrant for Ocalan issued in
1990 on terrorism-related charges. But Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer said Tuesday in Rome that Germany would not ask for his
extradition. Belgium has also said it would not accept Ocalan as an
alternative to extraditing him to Turkey.

U.N. inspectors test computers and cameras on first day back in

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The hunt for forbidden arms is about to
resume, but U.N. weapons inspectors know the real test of Iraq's
compliance won't come for a while.
	   Eighty-six inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, and the International Atomic Energy Agency returned Tuesday
after Iraq's decision Saturday to allow them to resume work.
	   The United States and Britain had threatened airstrikes against
Iraq unless it removed its restrictions on the inspections. Iraq
backed down as air and missile attacks were about to be unleashed.
	   The inspectors' spokeswoman, Caroline Cross, told The Associated
Press that an equipment check went well and that the first of the
inspections _ which have been blocked since August _ would come
Wednesday.
	   At first, the inspectors are expected to visit declared arms
sites where they have already installed cameras and sensors for
long-term monitoring.
	   The real challenge will come later, when they begin surprise
checks on sites where U.N. arms experts suspect Iraq has been
hiding evidence of banned chemical and biological weapons and
long-range missiles.
	   Some 150 U.N. relief workers _ who were pulled out with the
inspectors for fear of airstrikes _ returned to Baghdad on Monday
and Tuesday to resume the supervision of the distribution of food
to Iraq's 22 million people.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before economic sanctions imposed after Iraqi
forces overran Kuwait in 1990 can be lifted. Iraq insists that
inspectors have ignored evidence showing it has complied.
	   Cross told reporters that UNSCOM was looking forward to ``a
productive and professional relationship'' with the Iraqi
government.
	   Under the agreement, the United Nations pledged to respect the
``national security, sovereignty and dignity'' of Iraq and to only
enter presidential compounds when accompanied by diplomats.
	   Once the inspectors report they are able to work effectively,
the U.N. Security Council will conduct a review of Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   The Iraqi government wants the review to lead quickly to the
lifting of U.N. sanctions _ a move both the United States and
Britain have resisted.
	   The sanctions have devastated the country's economy by limiting
the sale of oil, which provided most of the country's income.
	   Iraq banned inspectors from working on Aug. 5 and then cut off
long-term monitoring of its weapons program on Oct. 31.

Dive company charged with safety infractions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Charges have been filed under the
Workplace Health and Safety Act against a north Queensland dive
company allegedly responsible for the disappearance of two American
divers.
	   Thomas Lonergan, 33, and his 28-year-old wife Eileen, from Baton
Rouge, Louisiana, were last seen on Jan. 25, when they went diving
from boat Outer Edge at St. Crispin Reef, 38 nautical miles
northeast of Port Douglas, north of Cairns.
	   The area is about 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) north of the
state capital of Brisbane.
	   Outer Edge owner and skipper Geoffrey Nairn faces charges of
manslaughter after an inquest in September found the couple had
perished at sea after being left behind on the reef.
	   Nairn and his company Rye Holdings, trading as Outer Edge, were
charged in Cairns Magistrates Court on Wednesday with failing their
duty to ensure the safety and health of passengers.
	   He will face Queensland state's Workplace Health and Safety Act
charges on April 20 of next year.

Key issues in Kurds' struggle for autonomy in Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Italy-Kurds &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The arrest of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan in Rome has
sparked protests by Kurds throughout Europe. Some of the key issues
involved in the Kurdish conflict:
	   Q: Who are the Kurds and how many are there?
	   A: There are an estimated 20- to 25 million Kurds spread out in
four countries _ Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq. Some 12- to 15
million live in Turkey, most in poor southeastern regions. Kurds
share a common language, related to Iran's Farsi, and are
overwhelmingly Sunni Muslims.
	   Q: What is the legal status of Kurds in Turkey?
	   A: Kurds are not recognized as a minority, unlike the Greeks,
Armenians, Assyrians and Jews. Recognized minorities have the right
to teach and publish in their respective languages.
	   Q: What rights do Kurds have in Turkey?
	   A: Turkey's last military government banned the use of Kurdish
in 1983, but Kurdish was legalized in unofficial settings in 1991.
Publications are also legal, but Kurdish cannot be used in
broadcasts, education or political settings. It is illegal to base
a political party on ethnic grounds. A pro-Kurdish party exists,
the People's Democracy Party, which has been battling numerous
court cases on charges ranging from separatism to supporting a
terrorist organization.
	   Q: When did the Kurdish movements for independence begin?
	   A: Kurds were promised an independent homeland in the 1920
Treaty of Sevres, which carved up Turkey after the collapse of the
Ottoman Empire. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern
Turkey, fought to regain the land. Plans for a Kurdish state were
abandoned by the international community in 1923. There have been
numerous Kurdish revolts since.
	   Q: When was the Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, created and what
are its aims?
	   A: Ocalan, a political science dropout, created the PKK in 1978.
The group turned to armed struggle in 1984. Originally fighting for
independence, the group now says it aims for equal rights for Kurds
and an autonomous Kurdish state or a federation with Turkey.
	   Q: What's been the toll of the conflict?
	   A: Close to 37,000 people have died. The PKK has waged a
guerrilla war in the southeastern mountains and carried out
militant attacks in western Turkey and Germany.
	   Q: What's Turkey's answer to accusations of discrimination
against Kurds?
	   A: Turkey insists there is no division between Turks and Kurds
in society. Authorities point to success stories of Kurds,
including late President Turgut Ozal and current parliamentary
speaker, Hikmet Cetin.
	   It rejects negotiations with the PKK.

Former NFL coach Weeb Ewbank dies at 92
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OXFORD, Ohio (AP) _ Weeb Ewbank, the winning coach in two of pro
football's most famous championship games, died Tuesday at his
home. He was 92.
	   The cause of death was not released immediately. Ewbank was
hospitalized briefly last year for treatment of a heart problem.
	   Ewbank was the only coach to win titles in the American Football
League and National Football League.
	   He coached Joe Namath and the New York Jets over the Baltimore
Colts 16-7 in the third Super Bowl, giving the AFL its first title
over the more established NFL.
	   In 1958, Ewbank coached Johnny Unitas and the Colts to a 23-17
overtime win over the New York Giants. The game was credited with
making pro football one of the most popular American sports.
	   Ewbank also led the Colts to the championship over the Giants
31-16 in 1959.
	   He posted a 130-129-7 pro coaching record. He coached the Colts
from 1954 to 1962 and the Jets from 1963 to 1973.
	   Ewbank, a native of Richmond, Indiana, lived with his wife,
Lucy, in Oxford. He is survived by his wife, three daughters, eight
grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.

Opposing sides in lockout finally talk again

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After 11 days of silence, the opposing sides in
the National Basketball Association lockout finally spoke Tuesday
and agreed to resume formal bargaining talks later this week.
	   Commissioner David Stern, deputy commissioner Russ Granik and
Steve Mills, the NBA's vice president for basketball development,
met for two hours on Day 140 of the lockout with union director
Billy Hunter, union president Patrick Ewing and Herb Williams of
the Knicks.
	   ``It was, as usual, cordial but unproductive,'' Granik said.
``We didn't get anywhere.''
	   Still, the two sides agreed to the larger session Friday. It
will be the first session involving the full owners' and players'
negotiating committees since Oct. 28, the night Michael Jordan sat
in on an 8 1/2-hour session.
	   ``We sort of sense that with the holidays approaching, if we
don't start making progress soon the season is in jeopardy,''
Granik said. ``We'll give it one more try on Friday.''
	   The first six weeks of the season already have been scrapped,
and with each passing day the likelihood increases of the season
not beginning until January.
	   ``When serious negotiations begin, I would expect (Jordan) will
be back in there,'' agent David Falk said. ``The next step has to
be for the league to come in with a better offer.''
	   There had been an expectation around the league that a deal
would be reached in time for NBC to televise its first games of the
season _ Christmas doubleheader of Chicago vs. New York and the
L.A. Lakers vs. Phoenix.
	   ``My guess isn't better than anybody else's, but I hope we're
showing games,'' said Ed Markey, an NBC spokesman. ``If there are
no NBA games, we might revert back to showing regular Friday night
programming.''
	   Jordan took part in the last full bargaining talks Oct. 28,
exchanging hard words with Washington owner Abe Pollin in a meeting
that preceded the 8 1/2-hour session. But Jordan has not been heard
from publicly since those discussions ended.
	   Falk, whose other high-profile clients include Ewing and Alonzo
Mourning, says Jordan will not be the individual to jump-start the
bargaining.
	   ``What this thing is all about is the process of negotiation,''
Falk said. ``Both sides are trying to be fair, but both have
different understandings of what fair is. There is a range of
fairness, and both sides should make sure they don't
overpersonalize this.''
	   The owners and players are stuck on the main economic argument
of what constitutes a fair split of revenue.
	   Players, who received 57 percent last season, are offering no
concessions to slow salary growth unless the percentage rises to 60
percent.
	   Owners, who had the right to reopen the last labor agreement if
the percentage rose above 51.8 percent, want the players to accept
50 percent.
	   The owners have offered increased minimum salaries for veterans
and have agreed in principle to the union's request for an annual
salary cap exception equal to the average salary (which was dlrs
2.6 million last season), but have demanded other mechanisms that
would limit salaries the highest-paid players could receive.

Quebec candidates spar over impact of secession drive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ In the only debate of Quebec's high-stakes
election campaign, the separatist premier and his anti-separatist
rival argued bitterly Tuesday over whether the prospect of another
secession referendum was crippling the province's economy.
	   The election is Nov. 30, and the debate _ telecast throughout
Quebec _ was considered a crucial opportunity for challenger Jean
Charest to try to erase a slight lead enjoyed by the separatist
Parti Quebecois of Premier Lucien Bouchard.
	   Charest repeatedly asserted that the mostly French-speaking
province would benefit if the threat of secession faded.
	   ``The fact that they're proposing a new referendum, that's a
ball and chain that's slowing our economy down,'' Charest said.
	   Bouchard stuck by his promise to hold a referendum if re-elected
_ but only when he determined there were ``winning conditions.'' He
has said he does not want a repeat of separatist referendum defeats
in 1980 and 1995.
	   ``I want to have the winning conditions, so we can go forward
once and for all,'' he said. ``We can't wait for the next
generation... We need a referendum and we need sovereignty.''
	   Bouchard defended the often painful spending cuts implemented by
his government as it sought to erase a dlrs 6 billion (dlrs 4
billion U.S.) budget deficit.
	   ``Nothing is perfect but the worst is behind us,'' he said.
	   Charest hit hard on cuts to the health-care system, saying,
``People are suffering.''
	   In the last provincial election in 1994, the Parti Quebecois won
77 of the legislature's 125 seats compared to 47 for the Liberals _
even though the popular vote was split nearly evenly.
	   With current polls showing a slight lead for the separatists,
analysts see the possibility of a similar outcome this time. There
is a widespread theory that the Liberals must win the overall
popular vote by 4 or 5 percentage points to compensate for the fact
that their support is concentrated around Montreal while separatist
support is spread more evenly throughout the province.
	   There was a third candidate in the debate: 28-year-old Mario
Dumont, leader and sole legislative member of Democratic Action, a
party which supports greater autonomy for Quebec but not
necessarily independence. Seeking to boost his profile, he recently
renamed his party Democratic Action-Team Mario Dumont.

 &UR; Russia promises renewed help in search for Cold War prisoners

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Answering a U.S. plea, the Russian
prime minister is promising to help find out whether Soviet spy
agencies plotted to obtain U.S. prisoners from the Vietnam War.
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore asked Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov for help Tuesday during a wide-ranging, two-hour meeting
at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The bilateral meeting also touched on Russia's financial crisis,
a steel trade dispute, and America's concerns about anti-Semitic
comments made in Russia, according to U.S. officials.
	   Suspicions that Americans captured in Vietnam may have been
taken to the Soviet Union arose after the recent release of the
memoirs of a late Russian military historian who said he had heard
of such a plan.
	   A U.S.-Russian commission on POWs has looked into similar
suspicions that the Soviets obtained U.S. servicemen from the
1950-53 Korean War. The panel said in 1997 that after a five-year
investigation, it could not confirm that had happened in Korea.
	   Gore gave Primakov a letter asking him to open Russian records
to settle the Vietnam question. Moscow supported North Vietnam in
the war, which ended in April, 1975, with its takeover of former
South Vietnam.
	   ``Primakov said he would do whatever he could to help,'' said a
senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity.
	   In all, 2,078 Americans are listed as missing in Southeast Asia,
including 1,549 in Vietnam. The families of some hold out hope
their relatives are still alive.
	   U.S. officials stressed that they had no evidence to support
suspicions the Soviets obtained U.S. prisoners from Vietnam.
	   But they said Washington wanted to look into a claim by Gen.
Dmitri A. Volkogonov, the military historian whose memoirs
described a possible plan to obtain Americans for questioning.
Volkogonov, who died in December 1995, wrote that he had tried in
vain to confirm that such a plan existed.
	   A former KGB director has told U.S. officials he knew of no such
plan but said it may have been discussed in KGB documents, said
another U.S. official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   ``We were asking for the support of the Russian government in
finding documents and whether such a plan was put into effect,''
the official said.
	   Gore and Primakov also discussed trade, security issues and
weapons non-proliferation, the U.S. officials said.
	   They described the wide scope of their discussions at a Kuala
Lumpur hotel, which ran much longer than scheduled, as a reflection
of the close, cooperative relationship built in recent years by
Washington and Moscow.
	   Primakov outlined Russian economic reform plans, and spoke of
his desire to improve his country's battered international credit,
the U.S. officials said. They said Clinton administration officials
were ready to offer economic advice, but ``do not want to prescribe
to them.''
	   Primakov is ``telling us that he's already in agreement with the
kinds of things that we are worried about the most,'' an official
said. ``We don't have to tell him how bad hyperinflation could
be.''
	   Russia's default on billions of dollars in foreign debt in
August leveled its own economy and triggered market upheaval on
stock markets around the world.
	   Russia's action was the most severe market selloff that has
occurred in a financial crisis that began in Asia 17 months ago,
leaving many of its countries in their worst recession in decades.
	   The move by Russia also was major embarrassment for the
International Monetary Fund, which had just assembled a dlrs 22
billion bailout package for Russia in hops of staving off the
collapse of its currency, the ruble.
	   The IMF has suspended support for Russia until it comes up with
a new credible reform program. Before the APEC summit, the United
States and its allies had said they were awaiting further
information on just what Yeltsin's government plans to do.
	   The crisis with Iraq _ which forced President Bill Clinton to
cancel plans to attend the APEC meeting _ didn't come up in the
meeting, because Gore and Primakov decided their governments had
had ``ample communication'' on the matter, an official said.
	   The two leaders also touched on a U.S. anti-dumping complaint
against Russian steel imports, but didn't have any substantive
talks about this, the official said.
	   Primakov emphasized the importance of the steel industry to his
struggling economy, but he didn't ask for negotiations or press for
resolution of the dispute, according to the official.
	   ``The vice president understands that importance, noted the
importance of steel to the U.S. economy, and said the United States
will enforce its laws,'' he said.
	   Among ``special points'' raised by Gore were American concerns
about a recent upsurge in anti-Semitic statements by Russian
politicians, the U.S. officials said.
	   A Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, caused an uproar this
month when he blamed Russia's problems on Jews in a speech laced
with ethnic slurs. President Boris Yeltsin chided his government
for being slow to react, and there were calls to ban the Communist
Party after it refused to condemn the remarks by Makashov.
	   ``Primakov expressed a shared sense of shock about the
appearance of this kind of sentiment in Russian political life,''
the U.S. official said.

	   OXFORD, Ohio (AP) _ Weeb Ewbank, the winning coach in two of pro

Asians look to sky for spectacular meteor storm

<TEXT>
	   KADENA AIR BASE, Okinawa (AP) _ Star-gazers across Asia huddled
outside in the pre-dawn chill Wednesday to admire luminous flares
of red and white streaking through the skies during the greatest
meteor shower in decades.
	   NASA sent up research planes from this U.S. Air Force base in
southern Japan in an attempt to glean hints into the origins of
life on earth and the planet's relationship to the cosmos.
	   From Thailand's highest peak to the neon-drenched streets of
Tokyo, people in Asia _ where the meteors burned brightest _ lifted
their eyes to a magnificent spectacle of nature as the storm
reached its climax in the direction of the constellation Leo.
	   ``It's wonderful,'' said Toshiaki Kogai, one of hundreds of
Japanese who watched the storm from a park just south of Tokyo. ``I
never imagined it would be like this.''
	   In Tokyo and many other Japanese cities, public offices and
private businesses heeded a government plea to dim their lights to
enhance viewing of the storm, which peaks every 33 years.
	   Though the night remained bright in the capital area, meteors
could be seen every two or three minutes at the height of the
shower.
	   Some appeared to fizzle as they fell. Others looked like moving
dots.
	   Each brought many a wish.
	   ``I only wish I could think up wishes faster,'' said Ikue Oe, a
housewife out watching the storm with her husband in the Tokyo
suburb of Yokohama.
	   In the United States, the best seats were wherever the sky was
darkest and clearest.
	   The crowds that gathered at sites in the Mojave Desert in
California early Tuesday were enthusiastic.
	   Sandra Macika, 36, of San Jose saw about 30 meteors. ``I could
see in front of me big streaks of light falling on the highway,''
she said.
	   One group was camping out in the Sandhills of central Nebraska,
getting away from city lights.
	   ``We're catching an average of two or three meteors a minute,
one of the best meteor showers I've seen in quite some time,'' said
Daniel Glomski early Tuesday morning.
	   In northern Thailand, tens of thousands of tourists swarmed to
Doi Inthanon, the Southeast Asian country's highest peak at 2,565
meters (8,464 feet), and Doi Suthep, another mountain with a famed
Buddhist temple on top.
	   But clouds and lightning hindered the viewing.
	   The view was clearer in Norway, where rescuers were swamped with
calls from people who spotted what they thought were red distress
flares fired from ships in trouble off the southern coast.
	   ``The meteors really changed color, and sometimes they were
bright red, so I can understand that people associated them with
distress rockets,'' said rescue leader Ben Vikoeren.
	   NASA sent up two research planes to study the composition of
both comets and meteoroids _ and perhaps learn something about the
beginnings of life on Earth in the process.
	   ``We have a very unique opportunity here to get some information
about the way life may have arisen,'' said NASA astrobiology
specialist Gregg Schmidt.
	   Some scientists believe the elements necessary for life on Earth
may have been brought here by comets or meteorites.
	   The NASA planes will provide scientists with data to determine
the cosmic debris' molecular composition _ and find traces of any
organic material it may carry.
	   The shower is caused by the earth's passage through the long
tail of the Comet Tempel-Tuttle. It is called the Leonid shower
because the meteors appear to come from the direction of the
constellation Leo.
	   Though the Leonids occur every November, they are usually not
particularly spectacular. But every 33 years the comet speeds
through the inner solar system and sheds swarms of particles as it
nears the sun.
	   NASA scientist Schmidt said the Leonid storm in 1833, for
example, packed as many as 10,000 meteors per hour.
	   ``The 1833 Leonid shower started a religious revival based on
what people saw,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ England opening batsman Michael
Atherton will play in the first cricket test against Australia
starting in Brisbane Friday after passing a fitness test.
	   The former England captain, who was given an injection for a
persistent back injury, was included in a 12-man squad for the
opening match of the Ashes series.
	   Fellow batsman John Crawley was also included in the squad after
being assaulted in Cairns Sunday night. Crawley suffered cuts and
bruises to his face but was one of seven batsmen named by England.
	   English selectors have chosen a three-pronged pace attack headed
by Darren Gough with support from Alan Mullally and seamer Angus
Fraser, while off-spinner Robert Croft got the nod over Peter Such.
	   The team is: Alec Stewart (capt), Nasser Hussain (vice-capt),
Michael Atherton, Mark Butcher, Graham Thorpe, Mark Ramprakash,
John Crawley, Dominic Cork, Robert Croft, Angus Fraser, Alan
Mullally, Darren Gough.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations approved a
modest set of proposals Wednesday to battle the region's worst
economic crisis in decades, following a disappointing summit
overshadowed by conflicts over human rights and free trade.
	   The group's final statement, to be released later Wednesday,
praised signs of recovery in four of the hardest-hit Asian
countries, and said they must continue adopting the painful reforms
recommended by the International Monetary Fund.
	   But the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum also
called for more financial assistance from the international
community, and endorsed a U.S. proposal to speed emergency loans to
crisis countries.

	   Despite the strong anti-free market views promoted by this
year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the APEC
statement rejected calls for stiffer regulation of foreign exchange
trading or new controls on the movement of capital in and out of
countries.
	   Offering Mahathir a consolation prize, the statement did call
for a review of the practices of international credit rating
agencies. Mahathir has angrily charged in recent days that the
agencies downgrade the debt of developing countries arbitrarily,
without proper review.
	   ``We are resolved to work together to support an early and
sustained recovery in the region to contain risk and contagion and
prevent the possibility of a global recession,'' said the
statement, which was to be read by Mahathir after the APEC leaders
concluded their two-day summit meeting.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia: summit meeting.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   The free-trade summit was overshadowed by a diplomatic furor set
off by U.S. Vice President Al Gore, and by a disagreement between
the United States and Japan, which forced the forum to delay a
landmark free-trade agreement.
	   The pact, which would have slashed tariffs on dlrs 1.5 billion
in world trade, but opposition by Japan to two of the nine sectors
proposed _ fishing and forestry products _ forced the APEC forum to
send the plan to the 124-nation World Trade Organization in Geneva
for resolution.
	   But Gore also announced an agreement with Japan on a joint
approach to dealing with the financial crisis, including a dlrs 10
billion support package designed to help struggling Asian nations.
	   Half the money will come from the United States and the other
half from Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   The assistance, although small compared with the magnitude of
the region's debt burdens, should help assure nervous financial
markets that the world's two largest economies have put aside past
bickering over the best approaches to take.

Singapore bank initiates fourth round of rate cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's largest bank slashed its prime
lending rate by half a percentage point on Wednesday, sparking the
fourth round of such cuts in about two months.
	   Government-linked Development Bank of Singapore lowered the
interest rate it charges its best customers from 6.5 percent to 6
percent. Singapore's other major local banks are expected to follow
suit soon.
	   Since mid-September, the four largest Singapore banks have eased
credit in line with falling local interbank rates, slumping global
interest rates, and a stronger local currency.
	   DBS has gradually trimmed 1.5 percentage points off the prime
rate since the cuts began.
	   Three-month interbank rates in the city-state are hovering at
around 2.25 percent. Local banks usually adjust their lending rates
if the difference between the prime lending rate and the interbank
rate widens to about 2.5 to 3 percentage points, analysts said.
	   The latest round of Singapore rate reductions comes as the U.S.
Federal Reserve cut its short-term interest rate on Tuesday by a
quarter of a percentage point to the lowest level in four years.
	   The Singapore stock market reacted positively to the U.S. and
local rate cuts.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Index jumped 1.9 percent higher in
early morning trading. Interest-rate sensitive stocks such as banks
and property shares have led the market rally.
	   The bank's decision to cut came just a day after it completed
its takeover of national savings bank PosBank and its subsidiaries
for 1.6 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 979 million).

	   Gore's decision on the eve of the summit to deliver a speech in
Kuala Lumpur sympathizing with the host country's anti-government
reform movement caused divisions in APEC's 21 leaders.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Gore's
remarks could put the nation's democratic process at risk. And APEC
officials from Singapore, New Zealand and Thailand urged the vice
president to stick to economic issues at the summit.
	   Nevertheless, Gore defended his speech, saying that nations
fighting off economic crises must work as hard to promote
democracy. Gore was a stand-in for President Clinton, who stayed in
Washington because of the Iraqi crisis.
	   Anti-government protests by supporters of dissident Anwar
Ibrahim have occurred across Malaysia since the former deputy prime
minister was fired, arrested and later placed on trial, for
challenging Mahathir's 17-year rule with a reform movement.
	   During the APEC meetings, top officials from the U.S.,
Philippine, Canadian and Australian delegations met privately with
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to sympathize with Anwar's campaign
and to express concern over the way he is being treated and tried
on corruption and sex charges that he vehemently denies.
	   With Asia in its worst financial crisis in decades, the APEC
summit was intended to be a chance for the leaders to recommend
measures that would help revive economic growth and stabilize
currency and stock markets.
	   Asia's financial crisis, which began in July 1997 in Thailand,
has spread to Russia and is threatening Brazil and other Latin
American nations. The U.S. economy has even felt the effects.
	   As expected, the final statement appeared to hew closely to the
Clinton administration's free-market, pro-IMF handling of the
crisis. The IMF has provided a total of nearly dlrs 120 billion to
Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea to help bolster their
economies. In return, it has demanded the nations adopt unpopular
measures that have sent interest rates soaring and unemployment
rising. Not all Asia's leaders have embraced the IMF formula.

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Turning her attention from
immediate disaster to long-term development, U.S. first lady
Hillary Clinton is promoting child care and anti-domestic-violence
efforts in El Salvador,
	   Mrs. Clinton was on the second leg of a Central American tour
that began with visits to Honduras and Nicaragua to announce
increases in U.S. aid for victims of Hurricane Mitch.
	   El Salvador's first lady, Elizabeth Aguirre de Calderon Sol,
accompanied Mrs. Clinton to her country's largest shelter for
orphaned, abused or abandoned children on Tuesday.
	   Mrs. Clinton announced dlrs 1.8 million in U.S. support for a
pre-school program, saying that education was a key in helping El
Salvador recover from a 12-year civil war that ended in 1992.
	   Mrs. Clinton said the program would ensure that ``each child has
a chance to fulfill his or her God-given potential.''
	   Little girls in frilly pink and green dresses dangled their
stocking-clad feet over chairs as Mrs. Clinton spoke at the San
Vicente de Paul Center, which was refurbished with U.S. aid
following the country's 1986 earthquake.
	   At a forum on domestic violence, Mrs. Clinton praised El
Salvador for its ``remarkable progress'' on the road to peace, such
as its reshaping of its military, modernizing its police forces,
reintegrating combatants into society, resettling victims of the
war and adopting laws to protect women and children.
	   ``But perhaps the most profound change is that El Salvadorans
who once fought on opposite sides of the battle field are now
debating their differences from opposite sides of the aisles in the
legislature as citizens are using ballots instead of bullets to
express their disagreements.''
	   She said war is comparable to domestic violence because in both
situations, women often are forced to flee their homes, or are left
alone to raise their children.
	   Women continue to be the victims of violence even though wars
largely have ended in the hemisphere, she said.
	   ``Violence against women is not simply cultural, or a custom. It
is simply criminal. A crime. The devastating effects of domestic
violence on women are just as dramatic as the affects of war on
women.''

U.N. condemns Burundi violence and calls for cease-fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council condemned the
escalating cycle of violence in Burundi and called for a cease-fire
and swift punishment for those guilty of recent massacres.
	   ``The council condemns all attacks against civilians and
reiterates the need for all parties to respect human rights and
humanitarian law, and reminds the government of its responsibility
to protect all its citizens,'' the council said Tuesday in a press
statement.
	   After a briefing on the recent violence committed by both rebel
forces and government troops, the council said it endorsed U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's condemnation and call for an
immediate end to all attacks.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh, the current council
president, said members welcomed the government's announcement that
it will investigate the massacre of innocent civilians by
government troops in early November.
	   The army last week apologized for the massacre and announced the
establishment of a commission of inquiry into the attack.
	   The statement said the official death toll of those wrongly
killed was now 56. But survivors said the minority Tutsi-led army
killed more than 100 mostly Hutu civilians in retaliation for a
Hutu rebel attack on a nearby camp for Tutsis.
	   Burleigh said the council wants the commission to be granted
immediate access to the site of the alleged massacre.
	   Hutu rebels are attempting to topple the government of President
Pierre Buyoya, a retired Tutsi officer who took control of Burundi
in a bloodless coup in 1996.
	   The Tutsis, who make up 14 percent of the country's population
of 6 million, control the military. Hutus account for 84 percent.
	   Ethnic violence in Burundi has left more than 200,000 people
dead since 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's
first democratically elected president Melchoir Ndadaye, a Hutu.
	   Buyoya's promise to stem the bloodshed has proven fruitless to
date.

Brazil's Palmeiras wins berth in Mercosur Cup finals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ With a first-half goal by Oseas,
Brazil's Palmeiras defeated home team Olimpia 1-0 Tuesday to win a
berth on 3-0 aggregate in the South American Mercosur Cup finals.
	   Argentine referee Oscar Zequeria stopped the match in the 69th
minute after a stone thrown from the stands struck linesman Ernesto
Taibi in the head.
	   Nineteen minutes into the game, Paulo Nunes received a pass from
Zinho, carried the ball down left field, centered and Oseas leaped
high to score with a deft kick near the goal line.
	   Palmeiras scored twice more in the first half, but referee Oscar
Zequeira invalidated both goals for offside.
	   Olimpia's best chance to equalize came at the end of the first
half, when Brazilian keeper Velloso deflected Mauro Caballero's
powerful shot on the goal line.
	   Fans began to throw stones and bottles to the field especially
after Olimpia defender Nelson Zelaya was red-carded for rough play
in the 61st.
	   The other semifinalists, Cruzeiro of Brazil and San Lorenzo of
Argentina, are scheduled to play Nov. 19 and 25.

Dollar, Tokyo stocks rise

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday trading; CORRECTS number of

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices moved higher Wednesday morning
on expectations the government may offer further economic stimulus
measures as a visit to Japan by President Bill Clinton approaches.
The U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 154.05
points, or 1.07 percent, to finish the morning session at
14,567.05. On Tuesday, the average lost 15.27 points, or 0.11
percent.
	   The dollar bought 121.52 yen in midday trading, up 0.90 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
121.00 yen overnight.
	   Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers hinted in
Washington on Tuesday that Clinton will be pushing Japan to move
its economy ahead when he visits Tokyo on Thursday and Friday.
	   His comments have raised hopes that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
may respond with more stimulus measures when he meets with Clinton,
traders said.
	   ``With Clinton coming here, Obuchi has to look good,'' said
Louis Tseng, head of derivatives at Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   Traders said Japan is also under pressure to do more to
stimulate its economy at this week's Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum meeting under way in Malaysia.
	   Buying by Japanese public funds and short-covering in the
futures market largely contributed to the morning rise, traders
said.
	   The Tokyo market was also supported by a quarter-percentage
point cut in short-term interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve
Tuesday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 6.07 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,113.72. The
TOPIX closed up 2.15 points, or 0.19 percent Tuesday.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 24.97 points _ or 0.28 percent _ to close Tuesday's session
at 8,986.28.
	   On the foreign exchange market, traders said the dollar
strengthened on buying by Japanese institutional investors and
importers as well as some purchases by speculators looking to cover
short, or oversold, dollar positions.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.845 percent from 0.855 percent Tuesday, driving it's
price up to 108.45 yen from 108.41 yen.

Free-trade summit in Malaysia ends with modest proposals

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations approved a
modest set of proposals Wednesday to battle the region's worst
economic crisis in decades, following a disappointing summit
overshadowed by conflicts over human rights and free trade.
	   The group's final statement, to be released later Wednesday,
praised signs of recovery in four of the hardest-hit Asian

called for more financial assistance from the international
community, and endorsed a U.S. proposal to speed emergency loans to
the crisis-hit countries.
	   Despite the strong anti-free market views promoted by this
year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the APEC
statement rejected calls for stiffer regulation of foreign exchange
trading or new controls on the movement of capital in and out of
countries.
	   Offering Mahathir a consolation prize, the statement did call
for a review of the practices of international credit rating
agencies. Mahathir has angrily charged in recent days that the
agencies downgrade the debt of developing countries arbitrarily,
without proper review.
	   ``We are resolved to work together to support an early and
sustained recovery in the region to contain risk and contagion and
prevent the possibility of a global recession,'' said the
statement, which was to be read by Mahathir at the conclusion of
the two-day summit by APEC leaders.
	   The free-trade forum was overshadowed by a diplomatic furor set
off by U.S. Vice President Al Gore, and by a disagreement between
the United States and Japan, which forced the group to delay a
landmark free-trade agreement.
	   The pact would have slashed tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion in
world trade. But opposition by Japan to two of the nine sectors
proposed _ fishing and forestry products _ forced APEC to send the
plan to the 124-nation World Trade Organization in Geneva for
resolution.
	   But Gore also announced an agreement with Japan on a joint
approach to dealing with the financial crisis, including a dlrs 10
billion support package designed to help struggling Asian nations.
	   Half the money will come from the United States and the other
half from Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   The assistance, although small compared with the magnitude of
the region's debt burdens, should help assure nervous financial
markets that the world's two largest economies have put aside past
bickering over the best approaches to take.
	   Gore's decision on the eve of the summit to deliver a speech in
Kuala Lumpur sympathizing with the host country's anti-government
reform movement caused divisions in APEC's 21 leaders.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Gore's
remarks could put the nation's democratic process at risk. And APEC
officials from Singapore, New Zealand and Thailand urged the vice
president to stick to economic issues at the summit.
	   Nevertheless, Gore defended his speech, saying that nations
fighting off economic crises must work as hard to promote
democracy. Gore was a stand-in for President Bill Clinton, who
stayed in Washington because of the Iraqi crisis.
	   Anti-government protests by supporters of Malaysian dissident
Anwar Ibrahim have occurred in the country since the deputy prime
minister was fired, arrested and later put on trial for challenging
Mahathir's 17-year rule with a reform movement.
	   During the APEC meetings, top officials from the U.S.,
Philippine, Canadian and Australian delegations met privately with
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to sympathize with Anwar's campaign
and to express concern over the way he is being treated and tried
on corruption and sex charges that he vehemently denies.
	   With Asia in its worst financial crisis in decades, the APEC
summit was intended to be a chance for the leaders to recommend
measures that would help revive economic growth and stabilize
currency and stock markets.
	   Asia's financial crisis, which began in July 1997 in Thailand,
spread to Russia and is threatening Brazil and other Latin American
nations. The U.S. economy has even felt the effects.
	   As expected, the final statement appeared to hew closely to the
Clinton administration's free-market, pro-IMF handling of the
crisis. The IMF has provided a total of nearly dlrs 120 billion to
Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea to help bolster their
economies. In return, it has demanded the nations adopt unpopular
measures that have sent interest rates soaring and unemployment
rising. Not all Asia's leaders have embraced the IMF formula.
	   Mahathir has criticized the bailout programs and blamed Asia's
woes on foreign currency speculators. In September, he banned
trading of the national currency outside the country and imposed
controls on foreigners trying to pull investments out of Malaysia.
	   Gore said the new dlrs 10 billion support package he announced
during the APEC meetings would help speed debt restructuring in the
region. It is likely to be used to guarantee bonds issued by Asian
countries, according to U.S. officials. The proceeds of the bonds
would be used to bolster Asian banks, which have some dlrs 2
trillion in problem loans.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

Former NFL coach Weeb Ewbank dies at 91
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OXFORD, Ohio (AP) _ Weeb Ewbank, the winning coach in two of pro
football's most famous championship games, died Tuesday at his
home. He was 91.
	   The cause of death was not released immediately. The Hall of
Fame coach, who attended last Sunday's Jets-Colts game in
Indianapolis, was hospitalized briefly last year for treatment of a
heart problem.
	   Ewbank was the only coach to win titles in the American Football
League and the National Football League. He coached Joe Namath and
the New York Jets over the heavily favored Baltimore Colts 16-7 in
the third Super Bowl in 1969, giving the AFL its first title over
the more established NFL.
	   In 1958, Ewbank coached Johnny Unitas and the Colts to a 23-17
overtime win over the New York Giants for the NFL championship.
Often called ``The Greatest Game Ever Played,'' it was credited
with making pro football one of the most popular American sports.
	   Ewbank also led the Colts over the Giants 31-16 for the title in
1959.
	   He posted a 130-129-7 record during 20 seasons as a pro coach.
He coached the Colts from 1954 to 1962 and the Jets from 1963 to
1973.
	   ``I greatly admired Weeb,'' Jets chairman of the board Leon Hess
said Tuesday night. ``He was a man who knew everything there was to
know about football organization and player motivation.''
	   Ewbank, a native of Richmond, Indiana, lived with his wife,
Lucy, in Oxford. He is survived by his wife, three daughters, eight
grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.
	   In addition to coaching in two of pro football's most memorable
titles games, Ewbank coached the Jets in the famous ``Heidi'' game
in 1968 and the first Monday night game in 1970.
	   Ewbank was a mild-mannered man who approached football with a
curious mixture of emotion and efficiency. Twice, he took over
teams floundering at the bottom of their league and built them into
champions.
	   Ewbank's first construction project occurred in Baltimore, where
he coached the Colts to consecutive NFL championships. Team owner
Carroll Rosenbloom called Ewbank ``my crew-cut IBM machine.'' After
each day's workout with the Colts, Ewbank would write a report and
file it in the basement of his house.
	   Rosenbloom eventually fired Ewbank, but recommended him as a
coach to Sonny Werblin, then president of the Jets. Ewbank came
back to haunt his former team when he coached the Jets over the
Colts in the Super Bowl, a victory ``guaranteed'' by Namath several
days before the game.
	   From 1949 to 1953, Ewbank was an assistant under coaching great
Paul Brown with the Cleveland Browns. The team dominated pro
football during that period, winning the All-American Conference
title in 1949, then capturing the NFL championship in 1950 and
Eastern Division titles in 1951, 1952 and 1953.
	   When Ewbank took over the Colts in 1954, the team was a
perennial loser. But within six years, he led the team to two NFL
titles.
	   Among the stars Ewbank developed in Baltimore were Unitas, Alan
Ameche, Raymond Berry, Lenny Moore, Gino Marchetti, Art Donovan,
Bill Pellington, Jim Parker and Big Daddy Libscomb.
	   After being fired by Rosenbloom in 1963, Ewbank helped turn
around another staggering franchise.
	   On the day Ewbank was named coach of the AFL's New York team,
the club's nickname was changed from Titans to Jets. It turned out
to be a symbolic gesture, because Ewbank eventually got the team
off the ground, just as he had with the Colts.
	   Ewbank retired after the 1973 season, coaching his last game on
Dec. 16, the day O.J. Simpson broke Jim Brown's single-season
rushing mark and the 2,000-yard plateau for the season on a snowy
day at Shea Stadium.
	   He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton,
Ohio, in 1978.

In twist to poison scandal, police say wife tried to kill husband
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A scandal involving a married couple who allegedly
poisoned victims to collect life insurance took a bizarre turn
Wednesday, when police in western Japan arrested the wife on
suspicion of trying to poison her husband.
	   Police in Wakayama prefecture, or state, arrested Masumi
Hayashi, 37, for allegedly slipping arsenic into a meal she served
her husband, Kenji, in February 1997, a police spokesman said.
	   The couple is already in custody. Masumi has been charged with
allegedly serving a man arsenic-laced food in September 1997 in an
effort to obtain 129 million yen (dlrs 1.1 million) in insurance on
his life.
	   Kenji has been charged in the same case with insurance fraud.
	   Police also have been investigating a mass poisoning in the same
area in July, when four people, including two children, died at a
festival after eating curry laced with arsenic.
	   No arrests have been made in the curry case, which set off a
series of copycat poisonings in Japan, including the death of a man
who drank a can of tea laced with cyanide.
	   The Hayashis have been under investigation, partly because Kenji
ran a termite extermination company that gave him access to
poisonous chemicals.
	   In Wednesday's arrest, police alleged that Masumi, a former
insurance saleswoman, tried to kill her husband to receive some 110
million yen (dlrs 900,000) in life insurance that she had secretly
taken out on him.
	   Kenji, 53, quickly fell ill and vomited up the food, saving his
life, said a Wakayama police spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Wakayama, near Osaka, is 453 kilometers (281 miles)
southwest of Tokyo.
	   The spokesman said police didn't know if Kenji held any
suspicions toward his wife.
	   Police also arrested Masumi for allegedly trying to kill a
36-year-old employee in Kenji's extermination company in February
1987 by putting arsenic into a meal that she took to his house.
	   Police alleged she did it to collect 30 million yen (dlrs
250,000) in life insurance, also probably taken without the
victim's knowledge.

Graf, Hingis win Chase matches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Graf-Novotna match &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Steffi Graf continued her remarkable resurgence
Tuesday night, advancing into the quarterfinals of the Chase
Championships with a 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-1 victory over third-seeded
Jana Novotna.
	   After suffering a series of injuries and surgeries, Graf is
playing again like the woman who dominated women's tennis for a
decade.
	   Since undergoing wrist surgery in September, Graf has won 11
consecutive matches and two tournaments.
	   The top three players in the world have been among her last four
victims. And she has won her last nine matches in the season-ending
Championships at Madison Square Garden, having won the title in
both 1995 and 1996 before missing last year while recuperating from
knee surgery.
	   Also advancing into the quarterfinals Tuesday were second-seeded
Martina Hingis and No. 8 Nathalie Tauziat. Hingis beat Swiss Fed
Cup teammate Patty Schnyder 4-6, 6-0, 6-3, while Tauziat ousted
Natasha Zvereva of Belarus 6-3, 6-1 earlier in the day.
	   Novotna became the Championships' first defending champion to
lose in the first round. But she ran into one of the best players
in history. Graf, because of a lack of matches, wasn't seeded. And
she suffered cramps in both calves, taking an injury timeout in the
opening game of the final set.
	   With the Garden crowd solidly behind her, cheering loudly every
time she won a point, Graf put her feared forehand on display,
spraying winners all around the court.
	   But Novotna, who captured her first Grand Slam tournament title
this year when she won Wimbledon, was up to the task, matching Graf
stroke for stroke, point for point.
	   She won the first-set tiebreak when her forehand down the line
hit the top of the net and bounced over Graf, landing just inside
the baseline. Novotna blew a kiss skyward as she walked off the
court.
	   Graf didn't delay letting Novotna know she was in a battle. The
German broke Novotna to begin the second set. It was the only break
of the set, but the only one she needed.
	   Then came a long and decisive game to begin the third set.
	   Graf won the first point with a perfectly placed forehand down
the line. She followed with a fault on the next point and
immediately walked to umpire Mike Morrissey and requested an injury
timeout. A trainer came on the court and worked on both calves.
	   The Czech Republic right-hander held serve, raising her arms in
mock triumph when she won the final point on an overhead. It was
the last game she would win.
	   Schnyder and Hingis engaged in long baseline barrages. Hingis
pulled off the first service break, in the fifth game of the
opening set when Schnyder made two forehand errors. But the
second-seeded Hingis gave the break right back in the next game
when she double-faulted on the last two points.
	   Both struggled to hold serve before Schnyder finally did in the
10th game to close out the first set, much to the displeasure of
Hingis. When a shot by Schnyder that appeared to hit the baseline
was not called long, Hingis whined, ``Come on.''
	   The loss of the set was like a wakeup call. Hingis ripped
through the next set as her penetrating groundstrokes kept Schnyder
back on her heels behind the baseline.
	   She was only getting her second wind.
	   The third set produced excellent tennis as both players found
the lines. Schnyder broke Hingis in the second game after the two
battled through three deuces. On the final point of the game, both
were at the net when Schnyder lofted a perfect lob volley over the
head of Hingis.
	   The Madison Square Garden crowd roared its approval.
	   Hingis broke right back, then won the next three games for a 4-2
lead, and after Schnyder held at love in the seventh game, Hingis
wrapped up the first-round victory by losing only three points in
the next two games.
	   The last time Tauziat and Zvereva played was at Wimbledon, with
Tauziat coming from behind to earn a hard-fought, three-set
victory.
	   Their match Tuesday had little excitement as Zvereva couldn't do
enough with the ball to create problems for the French veteran.
Tauziat kept hitting to Zvereva's backhand, a tactic that worked
repeatedly.
	   Tauziat pulled off the first service break in the match in the
sixth game of the first set for a 4-2 lead. That was followed by
two more breaks of serve, giving Tauziat a 5-3 lead. She closed out
the set when Zvereva's backhand down the line was wide.
	   It only took 37 minutes for Tauziat to wrap up the opening set,
and she sailed through the second set in 31 minutes.

Winter bonuses for Japanese workers down more than 2 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese workers will feel the effects of their
country's recession on their pocketbooks this winter as bonuses
paid by companies shrink for the first time in four years, a major
newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The average December bonus will drop 2.12 percent to 808,980 yen
(dlrs 6,685) per worker, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported based
on a survey of 391 major companies.
	   This is the largest fall in percentage terms since the newspaper
began surveying corporate bonuses in 1975, the report said.
	   In Japan, bonuses are considered part of workers' salaries and a
similar summer bonus is paid around July or early August. The
amount is loosely reflects the company's profitability and is
considered a barometer of the health of the nation's overall
economy.
	   The newspaper said the average winter bonus at manufacturing
firms covered by the survey will fall 2.19 percent from last year,
and the average bonus at non-manufacturing firms will drop 1.07
percent.
	   Japan's economy has been sluggish for much of this decade after
the collapse of the speculative ``bubble'' economy in the late
1980s.
	   Things went from bad to worse last year, when the economy slid
into the longest recession on record.
	   In its latest monthly report released Tuesday, Japan's central
bank said consumption remains sluggish, bloating inventories and
eroding corporate profits.
	   On Monday, the Japanese government announced a record 24
trillion yen (dlrs 198 billion) package, including public works
spending and tax cuts, aimed at restoring the economy to growth.

5.8 magnitude quake rattles southern Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A magnitude 5.8 earthquake struck deep in
the mountains of southern Taiwan early Wednesday, damaging roads
and buildings. There were no reports of casualties.
	   The quake's epicenter was located near Santimen township in
Pingtung county, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of the
capital Taipei, the Central Weather Bureau reported.
	   The quake struck at 6:23 a.m. (2223 GMT), opening cracks in
mountain roads, breaking windows and knocking objects off tables,
said a government office receptionist in the township who gave her
surname as Kao.
	   Effects of the quake near the township of 6,000 people were also
felt strongly further south in neighboring Taitung county's Tahwu
township, the weather bureau said.
	   Taiwan frequently is hit by quakes that cause mostly light
damage, although a magnitude 6.2 trembler that struck mountainous
central Nantou county in July killed five people and injured 22.
	   An earthquake's magnitude is a measure of the total energy
released, as indicated by ground motion recorded on seismographs.
An increase of one digit in the scale represents a tenfold increase
in the strength of the quake.
	   An earthquake with a magnitude of 5 can cause considerable
damage in a populated area.

Cambodian leader Hun Sen guarantees safety of politicians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen has
guaranteed the safety and political freedom of all politicians,
trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they can return to the
country and not be arrested or killed.
	   The assurances were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a
vocally anti-Hun Sen opposition party, who was forced to take
refuge in U.N. offices in September to evade arrest after Hun Sen
accused him of being behind a plot against his life.
	   Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament from his party have
been living overseas for two months. But a deal reached between Hun
Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, on forming a new
government last week has opened the door for their return.
	   In a letter dated Monday to King Norodom Sihanouk, the prince's
father and Cambodia's head of state, Hun Sen said that guarantees
of safety extended to Ranariddh applied to all politicians.
	   ``I would like to reaffirm the duties and responsibilities of
the royal government in guaranteeing security for all politicians
as well as their liberty in the conduct of political activities in
accordance with the laws in force,'' said the letter, broadcast on
television Tuesday.
	   Rich Garella, a Sam Rainsy Party spokesman, expressed caution
Wednesday over Hun Sen's guarantees, saying the Cambodian leader
``continues to leave himself loopholes.''
	   Sam Rainsy had written to Sihanouk over reports that he was
under investigation by a Phnom Penh court on allegations that
members of his party in league with Khmer Rouge guerrillas had
fired a rocket at Hun Sen's motorcade Sept. 24.
	   Hun Sen's assurances come a week before the first session of
Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly. Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy had contested the results of assembly elections in July,
contending Hun Sen's party had won a narrow majority through fraud
and intimidation.
	   Hun Sen and Ranariddh agreed to form a coalition last week that
would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and make the prince
president of the National Assembly. The deal assures the two-thirds
vote in parliament needed to approve a new government.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party, which placed a distant third in the vote,
was left out of the arrangement.

Pacific Rim leaders parade in custom-made batik shirts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a colorful contrast to the
stark economic crisis they were discussing, Pacific Rim leaders
donned bold batik shirts on Wednesday handpicked by Malaysia's
prime minister.
	   ``It's green and bright, like Kuala Lumpur sunshine,'' Singapore
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said of his shirt.
	   Tradition has it that leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum wear clothing symbolic of the host country in a
light-hearted show of unity during their annual summits.
	   On Wednesday, several of the 21 leaders pointed to their shirts
as they entered the Malaysian-style Cyberview Lodge, the site of
their informal talks in a high-tech business park 40 kilometers (25
miles) outside Kuala Lumpur.
	   All were bright, with bold geometric or floral designs and
different colors.
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore, sitting in for President Clinton,
who stayed in Washington to deal with the Iraqi crisis, sported a
dark rose-colored version with a blue, green and white floral
pattern.
	   New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, the only woman,
instead wore a lavender ``baju kebaya,'' Malaysia's national dress
consisting of a long blouse over a sarong-like skirt.
	   The leaders waved as they posed in their outfits for the
traditional group photograph that has become synonymous with the
annual APEC summits.
	   Last year in Vancouver they wore matching leather bomber
jackets, and the year before in the Philippines they wore
traditional barong shirts.
	   This year the shirts were handpicked by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad and reportedly cost 600 ringgit (dlrs 160) each.
	   Each shirt was tailored according to each leader's measurements
after Mahathir selected his favorites from a local designer.
	   ``The prime minister chose 21 shirts from a selection of about
40 or 50,'' an APEC spokesman told The Star newspaper.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,
Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

ACB denies Hair being forced to stand down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Cricket Board has denied
that controversial umpire Darrell Hair will not be allowed to
officiate in matches involving Sri Lanka during an international
limited-overs tournament next year.
	   Hair outraged Sri Lankan officials during the 1995-96 season
when he continually called no balls on off-spinner Muttiah
Muralidharan for throwing. In an autobiography released this week,
Hair calls Muralidharan's action ``diabolical,'' saying he would do
the same again.
	   Following the tour of Australia, International Cricket Council
experts assessed the Sri Lankan's action and approved it. He has
not been no-balled for throwing since.
	   Despite a Sydney newspaper report that ACB chief executive
Malcolm Speed will recommend Hair be stood down from Sri Lankan
matches, an ACB spokesman said no decision had yet been taken. But
he admitted that the ACB would discuss the issue at its board
meeting Thursday.
	   ``The issue of Darrell Hair and his book is up for discussion at
the ACB board meeting tomorrow,'' the spokesman said. ``Standing
him down is just one of the recommendations which has been made and
which will be on the agenda.''
	   Dhammika Ranatunga, chief executive of the Board of Control for
Cricket in Sri Lanka, told the Sydney Morning Herald that Hair
should not officiate ``because his comments on Muralidharan's
action contravene the ICC's code of conduct.'' (ad/djp)

Pretoria to bar Tamil Tiger offices in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ South African President Nelson Mandela
has assured Sri Lanka that he will not allow Tamil Tiger
separatists to open offices in his country, the Sri Lankan
government said Wednesday.
	   South African officials gave the assurance to Sri Lankan Foreign
Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar in Johannesburg earlier this week, the
Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   The Sri Lankan government says intelligence agencies reported
that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were planning to shift
operations from London to South Africa, after Britain enacted new
anti-terrorism laws that made the militant group's operations in
London illegal.
	   South Africa has many Tamil immigrants, some of whom support the
Tamil Tigers' 15-year-old campaign for a separate homeland for the
minority Tamils of Sri Lanka.

Hong Kong airport delays opening of second runway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The opening of a second runway at Hong Kong's
new U.S. dlrs 20 billion airport will be delayed for six months
because its lighting system needs modifications, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Airport Authority spokesman Chris Donnolly said the delay was
unlikely to have any significant impact on operations. Air traffic
remains 20 percent below the peak capacity of 37 flights per hour
at Chek Lap Kok, which has been plagued by a series of snags since
opening in July.
	   Last month, a Boeing 747 cargo jet burst two tires when taking
off, closing the first runway and delaying about 100 flights,
including six that had to be diverted.
	   Donnolly said airport authorities were ``not in a rush'' to
complete the second runway, which had been scheduled to open in
late December, until improvements can be made in the lighting
system, which cost 300 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 38
million).
	   ``As desirable as two runways are, we think it is more prudent
to ensure that everything works,'' Donnolly said.
	   Officials have detected the possibility of brief delays when air
traffic controllers switch the runway lights to change the
direction of takeoffs and landings, so contractors are now working
to ensure that the lights operate independently on each runway,
Donnolly said.
	   That way, any potential problem with the lights would be
isolated to just one runway, he said. The second runway is now
scheduled to open in June.
	   Cathay Pacific Airways, Hong Kong's flag carrier, called the
delay ``unfortunate'' but will cooperate with airport authorities
to ensure the second runway opens as soon as possible, spokeswoman
Quince Chong said.

Hurricanes beat Canadiens in National Hockey League action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) _ Martin Gelinas, Gary Roberts
and Ray Sheppard scored in a seven-minute span and the Carolina
Hurricanes handed the Montreal Canadiens their fourth straight loss
5-4.
	   The Hurricanes, returning home from a three-game West Coast
trip, fell behind 2-1 after one period, but rallied Tuesday night
to keep Montreal in last place in the Northeast Division.
	   Carolina played most of the game without captain Keith Primeau,
who left midway through the first period after taking a shot off
his left ankle. He did not return but X-rays were negative.
	   ___
 &UR; Flyers 4, Penguins 1 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Rod Brind'Amour scored one goal in the third
period and set up another as the Philadelphia Flyers got a rare 4-1
win in Pittsburgh.
	   The Flyers are 2-13-5 in their last 20 games at the Civic Arena.
Overall, Philadelphia has won consecutive games to end a 0-5-2
skid, the club's longest winless streak in nearly five years.
	   The Flyers got excellent goaltending from John Vanbiesbrouck,
who broke a personal 0-3-2 streak. Pittsburgh was 0-for-7 on the
power play, including a four-minute chance at the beginning of the
second period.
	   ___
 &UR; Blackhawks 2, Predators 1 &QC; 
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Tony Amonte scored his league-leading
13th goal and Mark Fitzpatrick made 37 saves as the Chicago
Blackhawks ended a 10-game winless streak with their 2-1 victory
over the Predators.
	   Amonte scored 6:16 into the third period to make it 2-0. He put
a shorthanded wrist shot through Predators goaltender Mike Dunham's
legs on the breakaway.
	   Nashville's Cliff Ronning cut the score to 2-1 with his 200th
career goal moments later. It was Nashville's first power-play goal
in six games.
	   Fitzpatrick stopped Ronning and Scott Walker in the closing
moments.
	   The Blackhawks were 0-8-2 in their last 10 games and had been
outscored 43-17 in that span.
