LAKERS RALLY AND GET BACK ON TRACK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ The Los Angeles Lakers regained their composure
in the second half and retook home-court advantage in the Western
Conference finals, beating the Portland Trail Blazers, 93-91,
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' winning basket came when Kobe Bryant passed to an
open Ron Harper, who made the shot with 29 seconds left in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers had the ball with 12 seconds left but could
not score.
</P>
<P>
   The game and series swung toward the Lakers in the fourth
quarter. They took off on an 11-3 run for a 83-74 lead with 7
minutes 23 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers' frustration boiled over into an altercation
between Portland leader Scottie Pippen and the Lakers reserve Rick
Fox. Both players squared off, had to be separated and were
assessed technicals, but momentum was clearly with Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After leading by 12 points early in the third quarter, the Trail
Blazers began to fade. Bryant slid a pretty back-door bounce pass
to Ron Harper under the basket to cut the the Lakers' deficit to
two points, 65-63. They finally tied the score on A.C. Green's jump
shot with 2 minutes 47 seconds left in the quarter and grabbed
their first lead at 69-67 on Harper's two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams traded baskets and the lead in the final two minutes
of the third quarter, until Shaquille O'Neal's two free throws put
the Lakers ahead by 72-71 at the end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the raucous atmosphere of the Rose Garden, the Lakers
slowly built second-half momentum. Then trailing by 61-49 early in
the third quarter, they reeled off eight straight points. Harper
capped the run with an acrobatic shot while plowing into Pippen and
sending his former Chicago Bulls teammate sprawling across the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first half, the Trail Blazers' balance and depth
revealed serious flaws in the Lakers, who were lucky to trail by
only 55-45 at halftime. They were that still in the game because
Bryant assumed the offensive leadership. Bryant scored 18 points on
8 of 13 attempts while O'Neal was trying to figure out how to get a
shot off against Portland's defense.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who had nine points at halftime of Game 2, managed eight
points Friday night while taking only six shots. He also had seven
rebounds. Next for the Lakers was Fox, who added five points in
seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers did make a 7-0 run to climb to 47-40 midway through
the second quarter, but the Trail Blazers finished with an 8-5 edge
for their
</P>
<P>
   10-point halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   While O'Neal struggled, Arvydas Sabonis matched O'Neal in the
middle, scoring nine points and getting three rebounds. Sabonis
scored four more points in the first half than he did in the
previous two games.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Stoudamire led the Trail Blazers in the first half with 11
points.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace and Steve Smith added 10 apiece. Portland
received a huge boost off the bench from Stacey Augmon, who
blindsided the Lakers with eight points in 8 minutes of the second
quarter. Augmon, who had taken only one shot in the first two
games, made 4 of 6 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Without Bryant, the Trail Blazers might have blown out the
Lakers in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, mostly exploiting a 9-inch height advantage against
Stoudamire, scored 14 points on 6-of-8 shooting as Portland took a
30-22 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Bryant, the Lakers shot 52.6 percent in the first
quarter, but couldn't match the 68.4 percent clip of the Trail
Blazers, who again stymied O'Neal early.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sabonis immediately came out and significantly outplayed
O'Neal, making both his field goal attempts, dropping two free
throws and grabbing one rebound in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal resembled the Sabonis of Game 1 with his line: Zero
points and zero rebounds. O'Neal took only one shot in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis had help, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen and Wallace again roamed freely on defense, buzzing along
the perimeter, then dropping down to harass O'Neal in a game of
human bumper cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three strong, long guys doubling on me,'' O'Neal said
before Game 3. ``In order for this team to go far, it's not going
to be me scoring 40 and nobody else doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' worst fears were realized in the first three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers hit six of their first eight shots and
effortlessly rolled to a quick 15-2 lead. &QL;

 &HT;    CANDIDATES SQUARE OFF IN MEXICO'S SECOND PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ While striking teachers fought outside the site of
a televised debate, Mexico's top three presidential candidates each
tried to convince voters they represented the true path to change
in this troubled country.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida Ochoa, whose party has controlled the
presidency for 71 years, promised to ``distribute income more
justly'' and ``consolidate the advances'' Mexico has made in recent
years in democracy and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But two challengers pounded Labastida as a candidate of the
status quo, whose Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is
responsible for Mexico's deeply ingrained problems with corruption
and inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Leading challenger Vicente Fox Quesada, a conservative who is
running neck-in-neck with Labastida, exhorted Mexicans to ``opt for
a change'' by joining his ``alliance for change'' and voting out
the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who don't want the PRI anymore are the majority,''
he said, urging voters to choose him over another opposition
candidate, leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano of Mexico's
Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you to build a bridge to the country we all dream of,''
Fox said. ``That Mexico is close, just as close as July 2 is.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, who is running in third in polls, portrayed Fox as a
conservative who also bore responsibility for Mexico's problems and
told voters to vote their conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like you,'' he said. ``I know my conscience and my vote
do not have a price.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate followed a week of public relations disasters for
Fox, who has mounted one of the most aggressive opposition
campaigns in history against the PRI. There were no immediate
claims of who won the debate. For much of the 90-minute event the
candidates argued over complicated economic proposals and accused
each other of lying about promises.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls show Fox either a few points behind Labastida or dead
even. Several polls have even put him slightly ahead. A wily
marketing expert, Fox has cited selective polls in his attempt to
wage psychological warfare and position himself as a frontrunner.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from this second televised encounter could have a
critical impact on the candidates' campaigns as Mexico heads into
the final stretch before the election.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the charismatic Fox has achieved historic momentum
in this campaign. A rancher, and former Coca-Cola executive and
governor of Guanajuato state, Fox has made great strides beyond his
party's conservative, middle-class base by reaching out to Mexico's
poor and disaffected with blunt language.
</P>
<P>
   By pledging to build a pluralistic government, he has picked up
support from leftists, too. Fox represents the conservative
National Action Party, or PAN, but he is also backed by Mexico's
environmentalist Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   This week, prior to the debate, Fox squabbled on live television
during an impromptu meeting with his rivals over when and how to
hold the debate. The episode delighted Labastida and Fox was widely
ridiculed in cartoons, headlines and in commentaries.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, Fox acknowledged that he was ``stubborn''
during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ``you need character, strength and real leadership
to get rid of 70 years of corruption, poverty and desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's performance Friday was critical to overcoming the damage
he suffered earlier in the week, said University of Guanajuato
political expert Luis Miguel Rionda. ``Never before has there been
this sense of uncertainty about an election during the final month.
The coin is really up in the air between Fox and Labastida.''

is ordinary, bland butter, bought by ordinary, bland people and
consumed on ordinary, bland occasions. And there is Vologda Butter.
Vologodskoye Maslo is butter so cultured that it was originally
called Parisian butter, even though it is made in Vologda oblast.
This is profitable butter. And this is why some scruple-deprived
people are making counterfeit Vologda Butter. A foreign journal by

   CONGRESS-FOREIGN-POLICY (Washington) _ News analysis: The most
important foreign policy vote so far this year, the 237-197 House
approval of the China trade deal, was no new affirmation of
internationalism by an often provincial Congress, but a
reaffirmation of one of its oldest truths: Members vote their
districts. That is, they vote their districts if their constituents
have an interest, and a trade bill is a singular foreign policy
measure because the question of jobs gained and lost commands
attention from lawmakers and constituents ordinarily not much
concerned about the rest of the world. By Adam Clymer. 1,300 words.

insulin-producing cells have enabled eight patients with a severe
form of the disease to stop taking insulin injections. Two to 14
months after being transplanted in a simple procedure resembling a
transfusion, the cells are still working in all eight patients,
half of whom were treated almost a year ago, at the University of
Alberta. The patients, who had Type 1 diabetes, in which the body
produces little or no insulin of its own, no longer have any
symptoms of the disease. Although they no longer need insulin to
control their blood sugar, they now must take other drugs to
prevent rejection of the transplants. By Denise Grady. 1,500 words.

<P>
   Today's purple-and-gold, news-and-views edition of The Sporting
Muse:
</P>
<P>
   News: The Lakers beat Portland 93-91 to regain the edge in the
NBA's Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Views: The Lakers can thank coach for the win. Not Phil Jackson,
but Mike Dunleavy.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers coach had a 12-point lead and the momentum in
the third quarter when he started moving personnel in and out of
the lineup. After turning Shaquille O'Neal into the biggest
non-factor in the western hemisphere with constant double- and
triple-team defenses, Dunleavy suddenly went small with his subs.
</P>
<P>
   On the bench was Arvydas Sabonis. On the bench was Scottie
Pippen. In-and-out was Rasheed Wallace. When you have a team like
the Lakers on the ropes, a team with some superb personnel but
ebbing confidence, the last thing you do is release the
stranglehold. If the Blazers go for the kill in the third quarter,
as they did in game 2, the Lakers don't regain the home advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy also didn't make very good use of Bonzi Wells or Brian
Grant. The latter seems at his best when he's playing at the same
time as Wallace and/or Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   News: Ron Harper hits the game-winning shot.
</P>
<P>
   Views: It takes a lot of patience and courage for O'Neal and
Kobe Bryant to let a Harper, Glen Rice or Robert Horry take a shot
in that situation. But this is an essential of the triangle
offense, the willingness to take the uncovered opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In the Game 2 loss, these opportunities were missed or
squandered. Friday, Horry had a great third quarter on both ends
and Harper came up with the game-winner and several solid defensive
stops. Double H needs to step up, too, because Rice is playing
spotty and Rick Fox is clueless.
</P>
<P>
   News: Pacers take 2-0 lead over Knicks in Eastern final.
</P>
<P>
   Views: The New York press is wailing over Patrick Ewing possibly
being sidelines, but the Knicks are actually a better team without
the elderly, immobile center. They made their playoff run a season
ago without him, and his absence forces Jeff Van Gundy to play more
uptempo, which suits Knicks like Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby.
</P>
<P>
   And while the consensus says the Lakers or Portland will rout
the east champ in the finals, I wouldn't be so quick to judge.
Indiana has no answer for Shaquille O'Neal or Portland's big men,
but a team with a shooter like Reggie Miller should never be
discounted. Likewise, the Knicks have enough athletes to compete
and would benefit from last year's finals appearance.
</P>
<P>
   News: Dodgers rail at suspensions handed down for fracas with
the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Is it proper to use the world overkill'' when talking
about a player-fan altercation.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball's new cop, Frank Robinson, obviously is
trying to make a statement about brawls and confrontations. Many of
the players ticketed weren't doing much more than standing around.
</P>
<P>
   But they were standing in the seats. Short of a blatant fan
assault, which doesn't include stealing someone's hat, there's no
reason for a player to enter the stands -- especially since they're
sober and the guys in the stands likely are not.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers do the simple thing and back off, they aren't hit
with multiple suspensions and no one has to listen to G.M. Kevin
Malone prattle on about integrity of the pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   My only question for Robinson: Why wasn't Malone suspended,
since he ran on the field during the brawl, and why wasn't Davey
Johnson suspended, since he's the figurative head of the family
that went off?
</P>
<P>
   News: Dodgers send Orel Hershiser to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Orel's recent appearances were ugly, but I have a hard
time believing he can't be of service to the Dodgers. The work of
Alan Mills, Mike Fetters and Terry Adams hasn't exactly been
brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   News: Former USC star Seth Etherton makes his major league debut
for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Etherton becomes the 19th pitcher used by the Angels this
season, and it's not even June. If each team uses 20 pitchers this
season, 600 different pitchers will have performed in the majors.
And we wonder why there's so much scoring.
</P>
<P>
   News: Baseball pennant races develop early.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Baseball sometimes gets breaks it doesn't deserve.
Despite balanced schedules that trash division rivalries and the
advent of the wild card, the 2000 season is shaping up as a
stunner.
</P>
<P>
   All four teams in A.L. West are .500 or better (through
Thursday), Chicago and Kansas City are giving Cleveland a run in
the A.L. Central, and the Yankees and Red Sox are locked in what
looks like an old-fashioned race.
</P>
<P>
   The N.L. is far less discerning, with Atlanta and Arizona
seemingly locked into division titles. But the wild card fight,
which includes the Dodgers, at the moment looks like a six-team
pileup.
</P>
<P>
   News: Bobby Knight gets a hand-slap from Indiana officials in
midst of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Views: I have no problem with this, but only because I really
want to see Knight go out on his shield, with one hand on a
referee's or player's neck and the other giving fans of (fill in
the Big Ten opponent) the finger.
</P>
<P>
   News: Salt Lake City Olympic Committee releases private geld''
(money) memo regarding IOC member enticements.
</P>
<P>
   Views: It is totally amazing that allegedly intelligent people
feel the need to write incriminating things down on paper.

(PHOENIX) - Builders around the state are still building apartments
that are not accessible for the disabled despite requirements that
have been around for a decade, Attorney General Janet Napolitano
said Friday, May 26.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano has slapped 21 new or nearly new apartment and
condominium complexes around the state with ``administrative
charges'' for such problems as ramps that are too steep for
wheelchairs to climb or doorways too narrow to pass through.
</P>
<P>
   The builders, who were not identified, must make repairs costing
thousands of dollars or risk being sued by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about punishing builders, it's about protecting
the right of the disabled to live wherever they want,'' Napolitano
said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation merely scratches the surface of the problem,
Napolitano and disability advocates say. Prompted by complaints,
investigators randomly selected 32 new or nearly new properties.
Only one, a complex in Bisbee, completely complied with Arizona
fair-housing laws. A handful had not yet finished construction or
had problems too minor for citations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was absolutely no surprise to us at all, but it shouldn't
even be an issue,`` said Darrel Christenson of the advocacy group
Arizona Bridge to Independent Living. ``The Fair Housing Act has
been around for a long time now, and it's not as if developers,
contractors and city officials don't know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Christenson said some disabled people who, in an accessible
home, could live alone have been forced into nursing homes at
higher-than-normal rents. Among the 10,000 people on the waiting
list for Section 8 affordable housing in Phoenix, more than 3,000
claim disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   About 700,000 Arizonans have disabilities, though not all
require specialized living arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Fair-housing laws dictate, among other things, that apartments
with no elevators must make every ground-floor unit accessible to
wheelchairs, said Robin Coulon, an assistant attorney general in
the civil rights division.
</P>
<P>
   Doorways must be wide enough to pass through, bathrooms and
kitchens large enough to maneuver, and walls reinforced in case
they need to be equipped with rails. In apartments with elevators,
all units must meet this standard.
</P>
<P>
   The worst offenses found were ramps too steep and doorways too
narrow for wheelchair passage, Coulon said. ``That's pretty basic
stuff, and in apartments built since 1998, that's pretty egregious.
It's now going to be very expensive to reframe those doorways, but
it would not have been if they did it earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors found major violations, defined as those that would
cost more than $100 to correct, at complexes in Phoenix, Tucson,
Sahuarita, Casa Grande, Gilbert, Prescott, Cottonwood and Peoria.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems, building industry experts say, is that the
federal fair-housing guidelines are vague, and that local
governments have no authority to reject plans based on
non-compliance. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Andrew
Cuomo recently announced an effort to more clearly outline the
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we have been asking for for years,'' said Wayne
Kaplan of the Arizona Multi-Housing Association. ``We will continue
to work with the Attorney General's Office and other agencies to
mutually resolve differences and misunderstandings. But the big
problem is trying to get a clear understanding of what is
accessible.'' &QL;

 ASSEMBLY PASSES $100 BILLION DRAFT BUDGET BILL  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The Assembly passed a $100 billion state budget
Friday, sending the weighty document on to a budget conference
committee that will spend the next two weeks hashing out the
details.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-to-10 vote on the Assembly's budget plan marked the first
time in 10 years there has been wide bipartisan support for a draft
budget bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans cautioned their support will fade if Democrats
do not increase the $2.7 billion currently devoted to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget contains the good, the bad and the ugly,'' said
Assembly Minority Leader Scott Baugh, R-Huntington Beach. ``We're
not interested in a budget that doesn't have substantial and
permanent tax relief. I hope when this budget returns to the floor,
it will have some good and probably some bad, but no ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats hold a majority in both houses, they need
Republican votes to reach the two-thirds approval necessary to send
the budget to Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh said Republicans want $4 billion in wide-ranging tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of tax cuts comes as state government is flush with a
$12.3 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has offered nearly $2.5 billion in tax cuts, including a
controversial plan to exempt teachers from the state income tax.
That proposal is not included in the Assembly bill.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said he is
not dismissing Davis' tax exemption plan outright.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll give it a fair hearing,'' he said. But behind him, Baugh
shook his head ``no'' at the question. Baugh has said he will not
support Davis' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Democratic governor's cuts would come from one-time
income tax rebates of as much as $150 per single taxpayer or up to
$300 for couples who file jointly.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Davis' proposal would leave out taxpayers who
earned too little to pay state income taxes last year. Forty-one
percent of families and individual taxpayers would receive no
rebates, according to a study by the Institute on Taxation and
Economic Policy, a nonprofit, Washington-based research
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats have proposed about $1.4 billion in cuts
through sales tax rebates in the budget, which is for the fiscal
year that starts July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Republicans brought up 17 budget amendments, mostly
dealing with tax cuts and abortion, but Democrats blocked them from
the bill. Some GOP members also warned against the massive spending
package.
</P>
<P>
   ``This state budget is growing faster than your family budget,
and it is growing at the expense of your family budget,'' said
Assemblyman Tom McClintock, R-Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Assemblyman Rico Oller of San Andreas warned, ``The
downturn will come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will remember this day as the one when we spent the
reserve,'' Oller said. ``It will cause us to be in a very tight
spot in a few years. This is a bad budget _ no one would run their
house or business this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also are pushing for more money for education,
community colleges and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh said there are areas where mass transit does not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is far too much emphasis on mass transit,'' he said.
``We need to dedicate more money to highways, to help people stuck
in gridlock.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern also was raised over the lack of funds for special
education. A pending lawsuit may force the state to refund more
than $1 billion to school districts for special education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Assembly, Senate and Davis will spend the
next two weeks working on some compromise, in an attempt to meet
the state's constitutional deadline of June 15 for passing a
budget. Last year was the first time in many years that lawmakers
met the deadline.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two men with criminal histories, one of whom, the
police said, staged five terrifying gunpoint robberies at fast-food
outlets in New York last year, were arrested Friday as suspects in
the execution-style shootings of seven bound-and-gagged workers at
a Wendy's restaurant in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 48 hours after the grisly massacre in Wendy's basement
walk-in refrigerator, in which five victims were slain with bullets
to the head and two were shot in the head and left for dead, police
seized John B. Taylor, 36, outside a relative's house in Brentwood,
in Suffolk County. They said he had once worked at several
fast-food restaurants in New York City, including the Wendy's where
the massacre occurred.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, detectives in Queens said they had taken
into cus- tody a second man, Craig Godineaux, 30, a security guard
who lives in South Jamaica. He was seized at the SCR Clothing store
at 89-74 165th Street, Jamaica, where he works. The authorities
said that he had a record of two convictions for selling drugs and
one for robbery, and that he had served three state prison terms _
of 10 months, two years and three years _ in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what led the authorities to the
suspects, but the case against them appeared to be strong.
Detectives said Taylor and Godineaux made statements implicating
each other in the crimes. Each acknowledged that they had robbed
the Wendy's restaurant, but Taylor said that Godineaux had shot the
employees and Godineaux said that Taylor had done the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Taylor had a .380 caliber pistol _ the same
caliber as the gun used in the shootings _ in a belt pack when he
was seized. The weapon was turned over to the Police Department
laboratory for ballistics tests to determine if it was the gun used
in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   After arresting Taylor, investigators began searching his
sister-in-law's house and said they hoped to find other evidence,
including cash stolen from Wendy's and a videotape that had
apparently been taken by the assailants from the restaurant's
surveillance camera at the time of the killings. The videotape may
have caught the assailants in action.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the investigators said they had found Taylor's palm
print on a box in the blood-spattered refrigerator, and they said
he had been identified by a witness as one of two men who had
emerged from the Wendy's, on Main Street in Flushing, about 11:45
p.m. Wednesday, minutes after the killings.
</P>
<P>
   About $2,000 was taken from an office in the basement, officials
said, and the shootings _ which stunned the city and even some
law-enforcement officials with their brutality _ were apparently
carried out to eliminate witnesses to the robbery, some of whom
might have recognized one of the assailants.
</P>
<P>
   Charges were not immediately filed in the killings, and police
said it was unclear whether one or two men had fired the shots in
what appeared to be an inside job, with the assailants aware of the
Wendy's operations and layout and the manager's name, which they
invoked in a ruse to get in at closing time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Taylor, a short, stout man, was being held Friday night on an
outstanding warrant from last year, in which he jumped bail in a
robbery case. He was said to have worked at several New York
fast-food outlets in recent years, including a McDonald's in
Manhattan that he was arrested for burglarizing in 1996, and as
recently as last fall at the Wendy's in Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   The swift arrests came as more than 100 detectives worked around
the clock in pursuit of numerous leads in a case that had drawn
expressions of shock from city officials, prosecutors, police
officials, employees of fast-food outlets and ordinary New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, in addition to announcing
rewards totaling $60,000 for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of the assailants, said that a relief fund had been
established to aid the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people crowded the sidewalk outside the scene of the
massacre Friday as a makeshift memorial of flowers, lighted candles
and written prayers grew against the wall of the restaurant.
Passersby stopped to pray and some spoke of their sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad,'' Rinkel Bhasin, 23, said after slipping behind a
police barricade to add her bouquet of white daisies to the
memorial. She said she had often patronized the Wendy's.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two survivors, Jaquione Johnson, 18, who lives with
an aunt in Jamaica, Queens, underwent six hours of surgery Friday
for his head wound and remained in critical condition in an
intensive care unit of the New York Hospital Medical Center of
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The second survivor, Patrick Castro, 22 _ who had been shot
through both cheeks, played dead until the assailants departed,
then wriggled free of the duct tape bindings and summoned help with
a call to 911 _ was released from the same hospital late Thursday
and was under police protection.
</P>
<P>
   Five families, meantime, were making arrangements for funerals.
Those killed were Anita C. Smith, 22, of South Jamaica; Ramon
Nazario, 44, of Flushing; Jeremy Mele, 18, of Neptune, N.J.; Ali
Ibadat, 40, of Ridgewood, Queens, and Jean Dumel Auguste, 27, the
Wendy's night manager, who lived in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   While little was known of Godineaux Friday night, Taylor was
described by acquaintances as the father of two sons and a
daughter, who had lived with his children in an apartment in Lefrak
City, in Elmhurst, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very secretive guy,'' said George Gross, an
across-the-hall neighbor who said he also did Taylor's tax returns
over the past decade. ``He never opened up to anybody.'' He said
Taylor often dressed in a suit and tie, even when he worked in
fast-food outlets or as a maintenance man for a Caldor's store.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said that in 1996 Taylor had worked as
an assistant manager at two McDonald's restaurants in Manhattan,
one at 341 Fifth Ave., and the other at 22 E. 42nd St. On June 26,
1996, the officials said, Taylor and a second man were discovered
in an attempted burglary at the Fifth Avenue place at 6 a.m., by
several employees just arriving for work.
</P>
<P>
   The two men fled, but Taylor was recognized, and police arrested
him a day later at the 42nd Street McDonald's. On July 12, he
pleaded guilty to third degree robbery. While prosecutors requested
a six-month jail term, Taylor, as a first offender, was sentenced
to five years of probation.
</P>
<P>
   Former co-workers at the Fifth Avenue restaurant said Taylor was
involved in several scams, including stealing receipts and placing
ghost workers on the payroll and taking their pay for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that Taylor robbed or tried to
rob at least five fast-food restaurants in Queens last year, all
within an eight-day period in June.

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Don't start celebrating that open-wheel truce
just yet.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two weeks, people around Indianapolis Motor
Speedway have done their best to keep this year's Indy 500 from
becoming a key battleground in the five-year war between the Indy
Racing League and Championship Auto Racing Teams.
</P>
<P>
   But as Sunday's race approaches, it appears that CART vs. IRL
again has become the theme of Indy 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The first prominent salvo came Thursday from Al Unser Jr., who
is competing at Indy for the first time since 1995, the last time
CART drivers raced there.
</P>
<P>
   Unser sounded fairly upbeat about his return to Indy on Thursday
_ until the subject of driver Juan Montoya came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd better respect Indianapolis,'' said Unser, a two-time
Indy winner who jumped from CART to the IRL this season, ``because
Indianapolis will bite you hard. You don't walk away from those.
They carry people out of here on stretchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser wasn't smiling.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of detente, Unser was given the chance to soften
his statements. Instead, he strengthened them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he said when asked whether he really meant what he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't just talking through my you know what.''
</P>
<P>
   What particularly irks Unser is Montoya's aggressive driving
style, which Montoya learned in Formula One and has honed in CART
the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Likely at Unser's behest, and with Montoya in mind, IRL stewards
in Thursday's drivers' meeting ``made it clear that anybody who
moves (crowds) anybody else down the track on the straightaways
gets the black flag,'' Unser said. ``That's called defensive
driving. It's driving with your mirrors. And it is not allowed in
the (IRL) Northern Light Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Unser found an opportunity to blast CART on behalf of the
IRL.
</P>
<P>
   ``CART allows one (blocking) move. That one move will kill
you,'' Unser said. ``Ask Jeff Krosnoff. That one move killed him in
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Krosnoff was killed in a CART race in Toronto in 1996 when his
car flew into a fence after colliding with Stefan Johansson's.
 &LR; brkstr:III  &LR; tx:Montoya, one of two full-time CART drivers at Indy
this year along with Jimmy Vasser, had left the track Thursday
before Unser made his comments and has chosen not to respond to
them. But he has sounded less than thrilled to be in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Montoya expressed some annoyance with what some
perceive as the stodginess of Indianapolis Motor Speedway and its
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much tradition here,'' he said. ``I'm not saying
it's bad, but it's too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Indy fans, Montoya said, ``If you don't give them an
autograph, you're an (expletive). In Formula One, it's impossible
for fans to get autographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he regard an Indy 500 victory as a blow struck for CART?
</P>
<P>
   ``We come here,'' Montoya said. ``(Team owner Chip Ganassi) gave
me a car. He decided he wanted to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know, I just drive the car as fast as I can. Simple.''
 &LR; brkstr:III  &LR; tx:Ganassi took advantage of a decision by CART to
hold open the last two weeks in May to give teams and drivers the
opportunity to race in the 500.
</P>
<P>
   Ganassi bought IRL equipment for Montoya and Vasser, and here
they are.
</P>
<P>
   Before a CART press dinner Wednesday night, with cameras rolling
and tape recorders recording, Ganassi toed the peace-and-harmony
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a T,'' he said, ``everybody (at the speedway, which is
owned by IRL founder and president Tony George) has been great.
Nobody has even mentioned the CART-IRL thing all week long.''
</P>
<P>
   But during dinner, a speaker stepped to the microphone and
shouted something to the effect that CART was going to kick the
behind of the IRL on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ganassi grinned broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Indy legend and IRL stalwart A.J. Foyt returned serve Friday
when asked his opinion of Ganassi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Floyd Ganassi (Chip's father) is a great guy,'' Foyt said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, legendary driver Mario Andretti indirectly criticized
George in a news conference, saying politics were ruining the
sport. George countered that Andretti was just bitter because his
son Michael has not been able to race at Indy since the split and
may never be able to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another salvo came from speedway staffers on qualifying day.
When IRL driver Greg Ray knocked Montoya off the pole late last
Saturday, the media-room staff broke protocol by erupting in
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Just a race? Hardly.  &LR; brkstr:III  &LR; tx:So far, words have been the
weapon of choice in the battle between the IRL and CART at Indy
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants that battle to carry over on the track.
</P>
<P>
   When the green flag drops Sunday, 33 cars will head toward the
first turn at 200 miles per hour. Leading that pack will be Ray,
with Montoya immediately to his right.
</P>
<P>
   History and reputation indicate that Montoya will be looking to
come out of turn one as the race leader.
</P>
<P>
   Ray may or may not allow that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aggressive by nature,'' Ray said. ``He's aggressive by
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he will tap his aggressiveness if his car is running
well and the situation is right.
</P>
<P>
   If not, and there is the potential for disaster, he'll back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only going to drive to my comfort level,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   And that goes for the whole race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't give a darn about the first 199 laps,'' Ray said. ``If
the car is good, I'll go. If not, I won't.''  &LR; brkstr:III  &LR; tx:Ask
George about a return of some of the excitement to the 500 this
year, he'll tell you it never left.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed most IRL loyalists will insist that the race remains as
exciting as it was before CART teams fled in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indy is still Indy,'' former CART driver Robby Gordon said
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Many around the sport and the city of Indianapolis disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Miller has covered the race for 31 years. He said George
is ``kidding himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the race used to be the focal point of the city.
Tickets were almost impossible to come by, and those that were to
be had were in the hands of scalpers and were out of the price
range of ordinary fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be open the gates, make ice and count the money,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   No longer.
</P>
<P>
   The race still attracts almost a half-million fans for the race.
But Miller said that Indy has become a one-day event in that such
events as practice, qualifying and carbureation day now attract
little interest.
</P>
<P>
   Unser said fans still turn out for that stuff, but it doesn't
look that way because increased seating has spread people around.
</P>
<P>
   But just about everybody seems to agree that at least a bit of
the excitement has returned this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be more of a positive buzz nationally,'' George
said. ``The only way I have to gauge that is walking around.''
 &LR; brkstr:III  &LR; tx:There seems to be several reasons for whatever
renewed interest there is in the 500.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of 19-year-old Sarah Fisher in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Unser.
</P>
<P>
   The return _ albeit in a limited role _ of Roger Penske, who is
sponsoring Jason Leffler's car.
</P>
<P>
   And especially, the entry of Ganassi's two drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is renewed interest,'' IRL driver Scott Sharp said.
``Yes, I think so. There are just a lot of good stories here this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   All of those stories, however, have ties to the good old days,
the pre-split days.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is driving for Derrick Walker, also a current CART team
owner and one of the original founders of CART.
</P>
<P>
   Penske is a CART team owner and also a founder of the CART
series.
</P>
<P>
   And Target//Ganassi racing is the top team in CART.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, talk of reuniting the two series was the hot topic
at Indianpolis. This year, it is a non-topic.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, just about everybody says. Many agree with Miller, who
said Indy will never be Indy again until there is only one
open-wheel series in this country.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, he cautions, maybe not even then.

   The Royals smashed a club-record four home runs _ by Jeramine
Dye, Mark Quinn, Brian Johnson and Carlos Febles _ in the sixth
inning as they scored eight times and wiped out the Anaheim Angels'
4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After seven innings, the Royals led 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   Dye led off the sixth with a homer over the right-field wall,
his 14th this season but his first since May 7.
</P>
<P>
   The power surge continued against Angels right-hander Seth
Etherton, making his major-league debut, as Quinn followed with a
425-foot blast to the grass beneath the center-field scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   That ended Etherton's debut, with Jeff Weaver arriving to
inherit a 4-3 lead. But Joe Randa singled, Carlos Beltran doubled,
and Johnson lofted a three-run homer to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Sanchez walked, Johnny Damon singled, and Febles arched
another three-run drive into the left-field seats for a 9-4 lead
that ended Weaver's outing.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals had hit three home runs in an inning 14 times
previously but four was a first.
</P>
<P>
   By then there had been seven homers in the game, five by the
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the game was delayed 1 hour, 11 minutes by rain. A
half-hour after the scheduled 7:05 start a glorious rainbow arched
east of the stadium, then a fainter second rainbow appeared.
</P>
<P>
   At least the crowd of 22,394 had that entertainment before
Royals right-hander Chris Fussell finally unfurled the first pitch
at 8:16 in soggy 75-degree weather.

RATES HINGE ON FED, NOT FISCAL POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Has anyone noticed that federal budget surpluses have
failed to produce the interest rate decline many economists and
political leaders said would be the reward for conquering chronic
budget shortfalls?
</P>
<P>
   The result, in fact, has been the opposite. Just as the federal
budget began to move from red ink to black a couple of years ago,
the trend of interest rates turned up, which was contrary to
conventional wisdom espoused during the anti-deficit crusade.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Were the experts wrong? Perhaps. More likely,
though, the false promise of lower interest rates was more a matter
of sugar-coating prospective outcomes in the name of promoting what
was perceived as a greater good.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, economists worthy of their doctorates know full
well there is no convincing correlation between balanced budgets
and interest rates, and never has been. During the '70s, '80s and
'90s, in fact, the interest rate-budget deficit correlation was
frequently inverse, as rates often declined even as deficits
soared.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, those same economists know that there is always much
more at work than fiscal policy when it comes to interest-rate
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing that kept the promise of budget surpluses from
translating into lower interest rates was the hedge fund crisis in
September '98 that gave the financial world a case of high anxiety.
It was serious enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to intervene,
and thereby assure global financiers it would guarantee the
system's integrity. The rising demand for supersafe money havens
perforce led to rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the Fed decided it had had enough of the stock
market's irrational exuberance and began raising the key rates
under its control. All this time, of course, the budget surpluses
were expanding, but the credit markets paid no attention. In any
showdown between fiscal rectitude and Fed tightening, it's no
contest. The Fed rules.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the disconnect between fiscal policy and
interest rates has been in Japan, which has opened the red-ink
floodgates in the name of trying to stimulate the economy out of a
decade of malaise. Despite running the highest budget deficits in
the industrialized world recently, however, interest rates in Japan
are virtually zero. For a time, in fact, interest rates in Japan
were negative, which means some major players were actually paying
financial intermediaries to hold their money.
</P>
<P>
   Again, what has happened in Japan has been more a response to
monetary policy machinations than anything dictated by market
forces responding to fiscal policy developments.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to say that ending the era of chronic U.S.
budget deficits wasn't a worthwhile achievement. The only honest
justification Americans ever had for opposing federal profligacy,
though, was that keeping government spending in balance with its
revenue was the right and responsible thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   If any average American, however, bought into the fanciful claim
that the end of deficits would make it easier to buy a car or a
house or a washing machine on credit, they were ignoring the
reality of what was happening around them.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates will ease when the Fed says they will.

 Volunteer experience gives UPS managers a new perspective  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ The way Ron Alexander tells it, he was a
starched-white-shirt kind of manager in a starched-white-shirt kind
of place.
</P>
<P>
   When they took away his pager, his cell phone and his laptop, he
felt violated.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of his corporate identity and its trappings, he was put
to perhaps the most significant management test of his United
Parcel Service career: He was sent to a poverty-stricken border
area near McAllen, Texas, to do community service work for a month.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander wasn't in trouble. In fact, the month separated from
his responsibilities was a prize _ an appointment to the company's
Community Internship Program.
</P>
<P>
   The UPS district security manager, who oversees 29 buildings and
operations in the Kansas City area and Kansas, was given a
``volunteer'' assignment that ranked him among 50 (out of about
2,300 UPS managers worldwide) who are chosen annually for the
once-in-a-career opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost like a secret honor society, where those tapped
aren't exactly sure why they were chosen and, perhaps even more
curious, aren't specifically told what they're expected to get out
of it.
</P>
<P>
   But a few days after Alexander returned to Kansas from working
among the most wrenching rural poverty he'd ever seen, he said he
saw one lesson clearly:
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody came into my office and was complaining about some
problem, and I was listening...but in the back of my mind I was
thinking, `You think you've got problems?' I was able to accept and
handle the situation without getting upset. I think I have a better
appreciation now for priorities and for what real problems are.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting a package from Point A to Point B on time continues to
be the vital core part of Alexander's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a big deal, and I'm still running around a lot and
taking phone calls day and night to get it done,'' Alexander said.
``It's still a big, big deal to the organization if someone messes
up in the chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a commitment, but I'm not as intense. I don't know
if the feeling will last, but for now I think I have a better
perspective on balancing my work life.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a common reaction from Community Internship Program
participants. Don Wofford, UPS corporate community relations
manager in Atlanta and a ``graduate'' of the program, said 1,100
UPS managers had had similar experiences since the selective
volunteer interlude began being offered in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a gimmick to inject humanity or appreciation for
diversity into the management ranks. It's also a signal that
participants have been marked as up-and-comers and people worth
keeping. Six of UPS's top 14 management team members are Community
Internship grads.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they get back to their regular work, we look for four
major outcomes,'' Wofford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope for greater awareness of the economic and social
conditions that exist in this country today; we want them to have
greater understanding of these situations; we want them to be
sensitive to the cultural differences they've seen, and we want to
encourage involvement in the areas in which they live, whether it's
participating in food drives or other volunteer work or whatever
problems their own back yards present.''
</P>
<P>
   From March 17 to April 13, Alexander's group of nine UPS
managers _ from all over the United States and China _ met in the
U.S. border city of McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   They were allowed one trip home in the middle of the month, but
otherwise they stayed in a ``second-rate hotel.'' Contact with
their offices was all but forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   The company hooked them up with a social service agency that
worked with a largely Mexican population.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's group, without an experienced handyman among them,
was assigned to provide electricity, plumbing and significant
structural repairs to the dirt-floored shacks of two families.
</P>
<P>
   They had a Time//Life handyman's tip book and a $1,000 spending
budget to buy supplies. Alexander said they made frequent trips
into the local Wal-Mart for nails and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Wofford said, UPS sent three similar management
groups into an impoverished section of Chicago, into the Chinatown
neighborhood of New York City and into a poor Appalachian area near
Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   It costs UPS a half-million dollars a year to support the
program. Participants continue to draw full pay, and their travel,
lodging and meal expenses are covered. It's worth the expense and
hassle of covering for key managers when they're absent from work,
Wofford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a global company,'' he said. ``We need managers who have
enlarged perspectives.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why UPS changes its Community Internship work sites to
correspond to social or economic conditions. Over the years,
they've put more emphasis on understanding Hispanic culture, and
they're trying to add an opportunity to learn more about
Asian-American culture.
</P>
<P>
   The focus reflects the changing demographics of the United
States, as well as the customers and employees of UPS, Wofford
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who sees more and more workers with Hispanic
backgrounds being hired at his Kansas and Kansas City-area
operations, said he learned important lessons about cultural
differences.
</P>
<P>
   One example sticks in his mind:
</P>
<P>
   ``Like young people everywhere, there were some down there who
had loud stereo systems in their cars. You'd hear that boom, boom,
boom on the streets. But down there, whenever we'd pull up next to
a car with Hispanic teen-agers, if they'd notice us next to them,
they'd unfailingly turn down the volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't just happen once or twice. It happened every time.
It showed a respect for elders that's part of the culture, and
that's important to understand when I'm dealing with young Hispanic
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS asks the managers to keep a private journal of their
Community Internship experiences, but they don't have to turn it
in. And there's no official debriefing when they return to the
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, nobody talks about it much at all,'' Alexander said.
``It's really a low-profile kind of deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Wofford said, there's a track record of greater community
voluntarism and social service support at the UPS facilities where
managers have gone through the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are managers who can make things happen,'' Wofford said.
``They influence a lot of people. There is a ripple effect.''

DOCTOR: MOST TRIPLETS DELIVERED EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY MAUREEN WEST  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Doctors deliver triplets too early, resulting in more
health problems for babies and higher hospital bills, according to
a report by the Phoenix area's premier multiple-births specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers of triplets are pleading with doctors to deliver them at
30 or 31 weeks because they are getting so large and are in such
discomfort, Dr. John Elliott told the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists this week.
</P>
<P>
   But Elliott said doctors shouldn't be too ready to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy way out seems to be to deliver early and put them in
the nursery or intensive care,'' Elliott said. ``Toughing it out
for even one or two weeks more can make a tremendous difference in
infant health and cost of care.''
</P>
<P>
   A pre-term baby at 30 weeks costs $217,000 per infant, while one
born at 36 weeks costs about $15,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple-birth moms from fertility clinics all over the United
States are coming to Phoenix to deliver at Good Samaritan Regional
Medical Center because of the national reputation of Elliott and
his associates. Elliott and his partners, Phoenix Perinatal
Associates, have delivered 51 sets of quadruplets and 260 sets of
triplets.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital last year opened a special living area for mothers
of multiples, who stay for up to four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty percent of our success is learning to psychologically
deal with the mother, and the other 50 percent is the medical part
of it _ knowing what drugs to use to hold back contractions,'' said
Elliott, who studied psychology as an undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
   With advances in reproductive technologies, many women who
previously could not conceive are becoming pregnant. But new
treatments and drugs have also increased the number of multiple
births. In 1980, there were 1,337 triplet births in the United
State. By 1998, there were 6,919.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, the number of births involving three or more babies
nearly doubled from 57 in 1988 to 111 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Often Elliott's relationship with his triplet mothers is
adversarial. Triplet mothers under his care often deliver by
Caesarean section at 34, 35 or 36 weeks. Full term is about 38
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel my body stretching beyond what it is supposed to
stretch, and I couldn't walk,'' Margie Jones of Phoenix said,
describing the final days of her triplet pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would plead with doctors every day, but I am ecstatic that I
made it this far,'' added Jones, who on Wednesday gave birth to
three boys. She was pregnant 34 weeks, six days.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was in the hospital for 55 days, after complications arose
during the 27th week of her pregnancy. She was on magnesium to
control contractions and developed a blood clot in her lung.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hell,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Mihelich remembers well those dark days, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, Elliott would come in and say, `One more day,' ''
she said. ``Sometimes, he would start the day with a pep rally with
my husband and anyone else he could bring in. I hated them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihelich gave birth at 34 weeks on Dec. 17 to three healthy boys
_ Anthony, Benjamin and William _ who were all out of the hospital
by early January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful, but I'm glad he did it. Every day I carried them
was two days they didn't have to spend in the neonatal intensive
care unit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott studied records of 1,000 U.S. mothers of triplets over
the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   He found that 35 percent of the early deliveries, before 34
weeks, were made at the doctor's discretion, not because of a
medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers are in tremendous discomfort or pain. But when you ask
them to decide between seeing their child in an incubator, hooked
up on a breathing machine, they will choose being uncomfortable,''
Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   But some doctors also are concerned about the mothers' health if
they carry too long. Others don't feel comfortable with techniques
that help women carry babies longer.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said the estimated risk for maternal death for a mother
carrying triplets is 1 in 3,000 vs. 1 in 10,000 for a mother
carrying one child.
</P>
<P>
   Although other doctors generally agree with Elliott that 34 to
35 weeks is the ideal time to deliver triplets, it's not an easy
decision for doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always in the back of a doctor's mind is: What if something
happens to one or all of the babies at 32 or 33 weeks and I didn't
do as the family wished,'' said Dr. Richard Dickson of Obstetrix, a
Tucson practice that specializes in complicated pregnancies. ``Some
are women who have been trying for years to have children.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Culbertson, an obstetrician who has delivered single
babies, twins and a few triplets, understands why some doctors
would deliver at 31 or 32 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Culbertson said he and other doctors don't believe in using high
dosages of drugs, as Elliott and his associates do, to stop
contractions and delay deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle that all doctors struggle with is that many of the
drugs used to keep babies in the uterus carry some degree of risk
for moms and babies,'' Culbertson said. ``There comes a point when
the benefit of using the medication may be outweighed by the
risk.'' &QL;

POLICE LEARN HOW TO HANDLE MENTAL PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ March 15. Melissa Crites makes a frantic 911 call,
telling the dispatcher that her 24-year-old son is suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   She warns the Kansas City police that he is mentally ill, and
has been hospitalized eight times before for his illness. She also
warns police that he wants them to kill him. Police call this
``suicide by cop.''
</P>
<P>
   When police arrive in the 8400 block of Ward Parkway Plaza,
Crites breathes easier. Until she hears three shots. Her son had
charged police holding a steak knife above his head. He was
critically wounded.
</P>
<P>
   A police investigation showed that the shooting was justified,
that the man rushed at officers and that they had no time to do
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But Crites complained later that she thought the police could
have done something else to calm him down: ``The officers did
exactly what my son wanted them to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenario repeats itself daily across the nation. Encounters
between police and the mentally ill can end tragically. But a
program out of Memphis, Tenn., that soon will begin in Kansas City
offers hope to the mentally ill and their families, who often rely
on police for help.
</P>
<P>
   The program can mean the difference between a police officer
inflaming a difficult situation or defusing it.
</P>
<P>
   Called Crisis Intervention Teams, or CIT, it is a 40-hour course
that teaches police how to detect signs of mental illness in a
person's behavior and how to calm frenzied people with words
instead of force.
</P>
<P>
   The program was developed in Memphis a decade ago by police and
mental health professionals. Since then, it has been credited with
reducing violent encounters and helping more mentally ill people
find treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have noticed its success. Washington, Illinois and
New Mexico are among the states that have adopted the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Crisis Intervention Teams program is coming to the area
because of a Lee's Summit police officer, Nikk Thompson, who
learned of the program over the Internet after another frustrating
encounter with a mentally ill homeless person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (the police) are the initial responders to people with
mental illness and, frankly, I don't think we've been doing our
jobs,'' said Thompson, who once had to shoot a suicidal Vietnam
veteran who pointed a weapon at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen so many homeless guys who we'd pick up and then they
just end up right back on the street again. Police get frustrated
answering these types of calls, calls that can be very dangerous.
But when you think about what the families of these people have to
deal with for a lifetime, that really humbles you....This program
is about helping people because it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson wrote a proposal to his department's chief, Ken Conlee,
and was soon on his way to Memphis. Now, Thompson and another
officer, Don Crippes, are certified and are ] working to get the
program into area police academies.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, two officers from Memphis will explain the program
to area police departments. By January, there will be at least nine
more Crisis Intervention Teams-trained officers in the Lee's Summit
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Two Kansas City officers will be trained by January, said Capt.
Jan Zimmerman, commander of the advanced training unit.
</P>
<P>
   Although mental health professionals conduct seminars for police
officers, ``this program is truly a community policing initiative
that offers great benefits to everyone,'' Zimmerman said. ``Mental
illnesses come into so many contacts with the police, from criminal
behavior to vagrancy. Now these officers will be trained to
recognize those symptoms and know which agencies are available to
help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Area mental health advocates are elated that the program is
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried for five years to bring CIT in,'' said Guyla
Stidmon, executive director of the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of
Greater Kansas City. ``Many times the police are the persons who
have the first encounters because the illness has often gone
undiagnosed. Sometimes the symptoms behind the illnesses make it
impossible to avoid the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens, if the police are not trained properly to
respond to these calls, calls often from families, well, that's
when tragedies occur....But CIT is just the first step to help the
mentally ill. The creation of a mental health court is needed, too,
to prevent gaps in service. It's not an either-or solution. We need
them both, and we need them quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Katheryn Shields, Jackson County executive, talked about mental
health courts in her February State of the County address. Florida
and Washington have mental health courts.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is based loosely on the same concept as a drug court,
where offenders are offered a choice between treatment or jail
time. In the mental health court, people who have committed minor
crimes would be steered into treatment and medication programs
instead of jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the early stages of organizing a task force to
look at how we could do this, but I hope to have it up and running
by this time next year,'' Shields said.
</P>
<P>
   She has asked Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird to be a
co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had such good success with drug court; I immediately
thought this sounded like a good one, too,'' he said. ``The
inability of the system to deal with the mentally ill has created a
grave problem for jails across the nation, not just here. A great
shortcoming is that we have no system in place to help the mentally
ill. We offer no help, no treatment. It's a gigantic hole in the
system.''

CHINESE VENTURE IN KANSAS SHOWS HOW TRADE MAY BE ENHANCED BY

   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Chang Jiping kneels in a dry Kansas field south
of Lawrence. A breeze wafts his flannel shirt in the midmorning
heat. With a small knife and tape, the 40-year-old Chang grafts
branches of Chinese pear dates onto the roots of wild dates planted

   While titans of American business thumped their chests this week
after the House of Representatives approved a bill to treat China
no different from other trading partners, Chang simply nodded his
head in approval.
</P>
<P>
   American business groups saw the vote as a turning point that
could lead to billions of dollars in exports to China, which agreed
to lower tariffs on imports. American agriculture in particular is
expected to benefit from greater sales of grains, pork and beef.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, mostly labor unions and environmental groups, predict
the main export of big business will be production jobs from the
United States to China, where factory workers make about 15 cents
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Average Americans may be confused about how it will affect them.
</P>
<P>
   But the budding venture of Chang Jiping suggests the success or
failure of increased trade between the world's largest economy and
the world's most populated country will result from factors far
more intricate than the feuding factions have expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his plan to grow pear dates in Kansas turns both
arguments in on themselves. It brings Chinese capital to the United
States. It has the possibility of teaching American agribusiness
about a food crop the Chinese have been cultivating for 5,000
years. If the business grows, it would create jobs and wealth for
Americans. And it would provide American consumers greater choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to work on something that would be good for the two
sides, to develop trade and culture between both sides,'' Chang
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese love pear dates because they are ``sweet and crisp
and juicy,'' Chang said. They can be eaten green, ripe or dried.
</P>
<P>
   Chang and the Chinese partners in his company, Pioneer
Agriculture Technology and Trade, have grand expectations for pear
dates. Kansas growing conditions are much like his native Shanxi
Province. They see an immediate market in the growing Asian
population in North America, and they believe when Americans try
them, they will appreciate the unique fruit.
</P>
<P>
   If things go well, he expects to turn an initial investment of
about $200,000 into an industry that will result in millions of
dollars in sales for his Chinese partners and for Kansas fruit
farmers to whom he is trying to introduce the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people who have tasted date think they are wonderful,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the fruit did not strike the fancy of Frank Morrison, a
recently retired Kansas fruit horticulturist, he said there is no
doubt that it can be grown in Kansas. ``I thought it was a bit
dry,'' said Morrison, who has helped Chang with the project.
</P>
<P>
   Until test marketing validates it, Morrison is not encouraged by
the crop's prospects. But Mark Keim of Keim's Produce in Lawrence
believes pear dates will be enthusiastically received.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will be able to sell more than he can grow,'' said
Keim, who tried the dates during a visit to Chang's orchard.
``People can't get enough of things that are unique.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Kansas Professor Clyde Stoltenberg has watched
Chang's plan unfold. Stoltenberg, co-director for the Center for
International Business at Kansas University, thinks a small venture
like Chang's can do much to develop understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just involves people getting to know people on a one-to-one
basis,'' said Stoltenberg. ``It is quite consistent with the idea
that most business growth in this country is coming from
medium-sized business, not the big ones.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees Chang's patience and persistence mimicking how most
trade between the two countries will develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not be an overnight phenomenon,'' Stoltenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's story began in 1992, when as a midlevel manager in the
Shanxi Power Co., he was sent to KU for training in American
management techniques. A year later, the company sponsored Chang
while he earned a master's degree in economics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Chang returned to China. He remained in touch with
contacts at the university and harbored a plan to start a business
that would unite his U.S. experience with his Chinese heritage.
While attending a conference in Lawrence in 1997, he received
encouragement from state development officials.
</P>
<P>
   He was pondering what that business should be when an associate
brought a wooden box of pear dates to his office. Biting into one,
he had a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   He knew the climates of Kansas and the Shanxi province were
similar. Kansas had lots of land and growing the dates there meant
they would be fresh for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Chang felt so certain of his destiny that when he came to the
United States in early 1998 to lay the groundwork for the project,
he brought an agriculture expert and a suitcase full of fig seeds.
He knew U.S. Customs would not let the seeds through unchallenged,
but he also knew the plan would lose a year if he missed the 1998
planting season. With help from Morrison and other contacts in
Kansas, he persuaded Customs officials to release the seeds within
a week.
</P>
<P>
   Chang planted seeds on land near Lawrence. He also managed to
get a fruit grower near Garden City, Kan., and one near Sabetha, to
plant seeds as a further test of the product. Last spring, grafts
were made, and by last fall some of the trees bore fruit.
</P>
<P>
   It will take about five years for the shrublike trees to fully
mature. When they do, Chang said they can produce 6,000 pounds per
acre. He hopes to sell the fruit for about $2 a pound for a gross
yield of $360,000 per acre.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he also is growing Chinese vegetables that he sells
to restaurants, at a farmer's market and to the local grocery to
generate income.
</P>
<P>
   Without elaboration, Chang said he believes China's admittance
into the World Trade Organization, which this week's House vote
helps achieve, will be good for both the U.S. and China. He thinks
it will open up his country to some new ideas and it will be good
for his family and friends in China as it exposes China to new
ideas. It should help Pioneer Agriculture Technology and Trade's
pear date business and it should make it easier for other plans to
export U.S. products to China.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at the request of some Chinese vegetable growers,
Chang returned with some American fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They liked Miracle-Gro very much,'' Chang said.

HERSHISER SENT TO SINGLE-A
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Orel Hershiser is back starting. He's set to do so
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the San Bernardino Stampede against Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   The manner in which the Los Angeles Dodgers have juggled their
roster reached a new level of creativity Friday as veteran
right-hander and fan favorite Orel Hershiser was optioned to the
organization's Single-A affiliate in the California League.
</P>
<P>
   The move was made to make room for right-handed reliever Mike
Fetters, who was activated from the disabled list. And it was
Hershiser who proposed it to the front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very used to being useful and I'm very used to
contributing and being an integral part,'' said Hershiser, who's
1-2 with a 10.70 ERA and hasn't pitched since May 9. ``As you sit
and evaluate the ballclub and everybody's role, I could see as a
team guy, my spot was being wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, 41, isn't going to the minors to fade into oblivion
and resurface as a member of the Dodgers front office. He's moving
down to start, get in shape and be ready for what L.A. hopes will
be a playoff push the final few months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball rules stipulate an optioned player must remain in the
minors for at least 10 days unless there's an injury. Originally,
the Dodgers agreement with Hershiser stated he would remain in the
minors for no more than 21 days. However, that stipulation was
removed after further consultation, a source said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Hershiser isn't expected to spend too much time with
the Stampede. He's hoping to make three or four starts and then
return when the roster crunch works itself out.
</P>
<P>
   As a player with five years or more of major-league service,
Hershiser had to agree to the assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just to get in shape and be ready to pitch,'' Hershiser
said. ``The last 30 days I have 4 innings. That's less work than
you would get in spring training. You need innings. You need
competitive innings to be effective. Ability and health are not a
question. I just want to get myself in shape and go do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding enough innings to keep Hershiser sharp has been
impossible. He's struggled adapting to his role since being shifted
from starter to reliever after an April 19 start in which he hit
four Houston batters in 1 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said it's been tough on him
mentally trying to figure out how best to utilize Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   He tried the bullpen, but that didn't work. In four relief
outings, Hershiser's 0-1 with a 15.18 ERA. His last appearance
lasted a third of an inning and ended when Arizona's Damian Miller
hit a 12th-inning grand slam to cap a five-run rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a situation where he thought it would be best for the
team if he went out and got some work in,'' Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone said. ``Our starters here have been pretty good and
our bullpen has been pretty good, and he wasn't getting his work
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser signed as a free agent with the Dodgers during the
winter. He's being paid $2 million this season, and the club holds
an option for 2001. At the time of his signing, he was regarded as
an insurance policy for the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   And with Carlos Perez coming off a season in which he was 2-10
with a 7.43 ERA, it was thought the Dodgers would cash in that
policy quickly. But Perez, who is 4-2 with a 5.74 ERA, has exceeded
expectations and earned his keep in the rotation - at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement was announced between Perez and the Dodgers earlier
this month that pushed the deadline of Perez's five-year right to
decline a demotion to May 31. It's likely that agreement will be
extended in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers also remain committed to developing young
right-hander Eric Gagne, who's 0-3 with a 4.33 ERA in seven games
(six starts). All of which leaves Hershiser still in search of a
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Hershiser) was put in the starting rotation right now,
he'd probably figure out a way to get some people out,'' Johnson
said. ``It's not a question of proving anything to anyone. I can
watch a guy on the side, so can (pitching coach) Claude Osteen, and
you can tell he still has plenty of weapons left.''

EX-PENSION FUND ATTORNEY HAD QUALMS ABOUT LOAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - A one-time union pension funds attorney testified
Friday, May 26, that the unions considered backing out of a $10
million loan for Fife Symngton but gave it to the former Arizona
governor anyway because Symington's financial statement showed he
was flush.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Coppersmith, a private attorney and former Arizona
congressman, told the U.S. Bankruptcy Court that he was asked by
pension fund administrator Donald Eaton to see ``if there was any
way out'' of the 1990 loan, which financed Symington's Mercado
office and retail project in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Symington was a real estate developer at the time, and was
running his first campaign for governor. He filed for personal
bankruptcy in 1995, during his second term in office.
</P>
<P>
   The pension funds are suing Symington, claiming that he used a
bogus financial statement to get the $10 million loan. They are
asking Judge George Nielsen to keep Symington on the hook for the
loan, which Symington personally guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Coppersmith's testimony backed earlier testimony from a pension
fund administrator who said the funds were nervous about making the
loan for the Mercado. The administrator said the funds feared they
had committed too many real estate loans to the Phoenix market,
which slid into a severe recession in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The partnerships Symington directed lost the Mercado and about a
dozen other properties, including the Camelback Esplanade in
Phoenix, now one of the most successful commercial properties in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying about Eaton's nervousness over the fledgling Mercado,
Coppersmith said, ``This was not a loan he was eager to make.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coppersmith said the pension funds concluded that they were
legally and ethically committed to make the loan, after receiving a
financial statement from Symington that reported he was financially
strong despite the increasing shakiness of the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   That financial statement, in which Symington reported a net
worth of $12 million, is the centerpiece of the trial, which will
resume July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Symington acknowledges errors in the statement, but insists they
were accidental.
</P>
<P>
   Symington attorney Rob Shull argues that the pension funds were
legally bound to make the loan because of a 1987 commitment for
which Symington paid $110,000. Shull says the pension funds
committed themselves to make the loan unless Symington was
insolvent. &QL;

   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ Although Glen Sather insists that he is biding his

   Several NHL officials confirmed Friday that the only issue
remaining in the talks was compensation.

made.

L.A. SEARCHES FOR NEW SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHERRY JOE CROSBY AND DAVID R. BAKER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The secretive search for a new superintendent of
Los Angeles schools has turned to the head of a government agency
that boosts foreign investments and the former chief of a North
Carolina district, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   George Munoz, president and chief executive officer of the
Overseas Private Investment Corp., and John Murphy, former
superintendent of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools could interview
with the board on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Romer, former governor of Colorado, was interviewed by the
school board on Thursday. And sources said Henry Cisneros, former
U.S. Housing Secretary, is still under consideration despite his
public withdrawal of his name.
</P>
<P>
   The board has conducted its search in private and without any
public input, citing a tight deadline and the fear that disclosing
names could scare away some candidates. Board President Genethia
Hayes has said the district wants to select a superintendent by
June 5, three weeks before interim Superintendent Ramon Cortines'
term expires June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz oversees OPIC, a 200-employee government agency that
finances and insures long-term U.S. investments in developing
countries and emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   The businessman attracted attention at an early age. In 1984, he
became president of the Chicago Board of Education at age 33. He
became known as an ardent supporter of bilingual education and
dropout prevention programs. President Clinton, who met Munoz at a
literacy conference in Little Rock, Ark., in 1990, later nominated
him to become the chief financial officer of the U.S. Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy served as superintendent of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Schools from 1991 to 1995. The nation's 23rd-largest school system,
it serves more than 100,000 students in kindergarten through 12th
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the superintendent search described Murphy as a
strong-willed reformer. During his tenure in Charlotte-Mecklenburg,
he replaced 90 of 125 principals. He left the district after
tangling with local school board members and politicians over his
reform policies that required replacing or reassigning poorly
performing employees.
</P>
<P>
   He now oversees educational services for the Arvida Co., a Boca
Raton, Fla.-based developer of master-planned communities.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the board met with another finalist, Romer,
for five hours and asked the veteran politician how he would run
the nation's second-largest school district.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said board members were impressed by Romer's passion for
education and his knowledge of the city and the 711,000-student
district, which faces a severe shortage of schools and qualified
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were favorably impressed with former Gov. Romer,'' Hayes
said. ``The bottom line is that he did a very good job about
understanding the demographics of the district and the political
complexities in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The board also was struck by Romer's political connections,
Hayes said. As head of the Democratic National Committee, he knows
some of America's most influential power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly doesn't hurt that the man knows the president of
the United States,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Some district officials also said that Romer's political
connections could help Los Angeles Unified ward off unwelcome
interference from Sacramento, where state legislators are
contemplating appointing a watchdog over the district.
</P>
<P>
   During his interview with the board, Romer initiated discussion
about his perceived weaknesses, such as his age. He is 71.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes described Romer as an energetic and active man who sported
minor cuts on his hands from chopping wood and performing other
chores.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Hayes said she is looking for a candidate who is
capable of running the district in the throes of serious change.
Candidates' age and ethnicity should not be primary considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it turns out our answer is wrapped up in a 71-year-old
white guy from Colorado, so be it,'' she said.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A funny thing happened to the Angels on the
way to their fourth consecutive win and sole possession of first
place in the A.L. West: They got blindsided by a Kansas City Royals
uprising in the sixth inning that resulted in eight runs, turning a
4-1 Angels lead into a 9-4 loss before 22,394 Friday night at
Kauffman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The game also featured the first career ejection of Angels
manager Mike Scioscia, who came to the defense of Garret Anderson,
who was ejected moments earlier after a face-to-face argument with
home plate umpire Tony Randazzo.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals set a club record with four home runs in the fateful
sixth inning, two that were allowed by starter Seth Etherton, who
pitched well in his major league debut. He gave up a leadoff homer
to Johnny Damon on his second pitch of the game, but didn't allow
another run until entering the sixth with a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up back-to-back homers to Jermaine Dye and Mark
Quinn, Etherton was removed from the game with a 4-3 lead and a
chance at getting the victory. But the Angels bullpen, which has
been so good lately, was hammered in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Weaver allowed a single and a double before giving up a
three-run homer to Brian Johnson. Weaver then gave up a walk and a
single before Carlos Febles pounded another three-run homer for the
9-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels might have been reeling a bit when Anderson came to
the plate in the eighth inning. After taking a 2-1 pitch for a
called strike -- the ball appeared outside -- Anderson found
himself screaming face-to-face with Randazzo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't say anything to him, I never say anything to
umpires,'' said Anderson, whose ejection was the first of his major
league career. ''I've never had an umpire initiate something like
that. He tried to provoke something, but I still didn't say
anything until he took his mask off and got in my face.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically he got mad at me for tracking the ball through the
zone. I do that all the time. I want to see if the ball goes over
the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He did say something,'' said crew chief Ed Montague. ''He
leaned out over the plate looking at the pitch. That can be an
attempt to show up the umpire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I said don't be doing that and he did it again,'' Randazzo
said of Anderson tracking the pitch. ''He said 'What are you going
to do about it?' and I ejected him.''
</P>
<P>
   Randazzo first reached the majors last year in the National
League for the last month of the season. Montague had been in the
National League for 25 years before this season, when the umpires
work in both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know what the problem is?'' Montague said. ''(Randazzo)
doesn't know the kid, he doesn't know his body language. You learn
body language. Whenever a kid reacts like that it puts an umpire in
a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said he felt Randazzo was the aggressor and was wrong
in throwing out his center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought Tony was really out of line,'' Scioscia said. ''The
umpire was far too aggressive in that situation. Garret didn't say
anything. He shows up and plays the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before all the fireworks late in the game, Etherton settled into
a groove in the middle innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things went pretty well until the sixth,'' said Etherton, who
gave up three runs and seven hits. ''I was able to settle down a
little bit and make pitches when I needed to. My biggest struggle
tonight was my inconsistent delivery. I was flying open a little
bit. It had to do with an adrenaline rush. I've never had that many
people watch me pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd was Etherton's family, which came out from Orange
County for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took a 2-1 lead in the second inning on Anderson's
two- run homer (No. 12). Bengie Molina's two-out, RBI single in the
fourth made it 3-1 and Darin Erstad's solo homer (No. 7) in the
fifth gave the Angels a 4-1 lead.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A funny thing happened to the Angels on the
way to their fourth consecutive win and sole possession of first
place in the A.L. West: They got blindsided by a Kansas City Royals
uprising in the sixth inning that resulted in eight runs, turning a
4-1 Angels lead into a 9-4 loss before 22,394 Friday night at
Kauffman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The game also featured the first career ejection of Angels
manager Mike Scioscia, who came to the defense of Garret Anderson,
who was ejected moments earlier after a face-to-face argument with
home plate umpire Tony Randazzo.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals set a club record with four home runs in the fateful
sixth inning, two that were allowed by starter Seth Etherton, who
pitched well in his major league debut. He gave up a leadoff homer
to Johnny Damon on his second pitch of the game, but didn't allow
another run until entering the sixth with a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up back-to-back homers to Jermaine Dye and Mark
Quinn, Etherton was removed from the game with a 4-3 lead and a
chance at getting the victory. But the Angels bullpen, which has
been so good lately, was hammered in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Weaver allowed a single and a double before giving up a
three-run homer to Brian Johnson. Weaver then gave up a walk and a
single before Carlos Febles pounded another three-run homer for the
9-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels might have been reeling a bit when Anderson came to
the plate in the eighth inning. After taking a 2-1 pitch for a
called strike -- the ball appeared outside -- Anderson found
himself screaming face-to-face with Randazzo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't say anything to him, I never say anything to
umpires,'' said Anderson, whose ejection was the first of his major
league career. ''I've never had an umpire initiate something like
that. He tried to provoke something, but I still didn't say
anything until he took his mask off and got in my face.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically he got mad at me for tracking the ball through the
zone. I do that all the time. I want to see if the ball goes over
the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He did say something,'' said crew chief Ed Montague. ''He
leaned out over the plate looking at the pitch. That can be an
attempt to show up the umpire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I said don't be doing that and he did it again,'' Randazzo
said of Anderson tracking the pitch. ''He said 'What are you going
to do about it?' and I ejected him.''
</P>
<P>
   Randazzo first reached the majors last year in the National
League for the last month of the season. Montague had been in the
National League for 25 years before this season, when the umpires
work in both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know what the problem is?'' Montague said. ''(Randazzo)
doesn't know the kid, he doesn't know his body language. You learn
body language. Whenever a kid reacts like that it puts an umpire in
a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said he felt Randazzo was the aggressor and was wrong
in throwing out his center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought Tony was really out of line,'' Scioscia said. ''The
umpire was far too aggressive in that situation. Garret didn't say
anything. He shows up and plays the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before all the fireworks late in the game, Etherton settled into
a groove in the middle innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things went pretty well until the sixth,'' said Etherton, who
gave up three runs and seven hits. ''I was able to settle down a
little bit and make pitches when I needed to. My biggest struggle
tonight was my inconsistent delivery. I was flying open a little
bit. It had to do with an adrenaline rush. I've never had that many
people watch me pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd was Etherton's family, which came out from Orange
County for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took a 2-1 lead in the second inning on Anderson's
two- run homer (No. 12). Bengie Molina's two-out, RBI single in the
fourth made it 3-1 and Darin Erstad's solo homer (No. 7) in the
fifth gave the Angels a 4-1 lead.

DiSARCINA'S INJURY MIGHT CLOUD FUTURE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The season-ending shoulder injury to
shortstop Gary DiSarcina has brought to the surface questions
involving his future with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The club holds an option for 2001 at $3.45 million. But whether
it decides to bring him back next season might affect the future of
other core players, like Darin Erstad, Tim Salmon and Troy
Percival.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts of Erstad and Salmon are up after 2001, and
Percival's ends after this season with the club holding an option
for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon and Percival would be eligible for free agency after
2001, Erstad after 2002. The club did make one significant signing,
locking up Garret Anderson through 2004 with a four-year, $20
million deal.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of DiSarcina's future relates to others in
terms of financial commitment and an effort by the club to keep
possibly its most popular player inside the clubhouse. DiSarcina's
teammates will keep an eye on the outcome, but won't guess as to
what might happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can speculate to death in this game,'' said Erstad, one of
DiSarcina's best friends on the team. ``I'll deal with whatever
happens when it happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we're a better team with him, but we don't
have that luxury this year,'' Erstad said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to fill the intangibles,'' manager Mike
Scioscia said. ``We'll miss what Gary brings as far as being a
field leader and his confidence out there. ... I don't think it's
fair to expect anyone to have the level of experience or
intangibles DiSarcina has.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Garret Anderson's second-inning homer Friday was
the Angels' 42nd of the month, breaking a club record for May (41
in 1961). ... To make room on the roster for Friday's starter Seth
Etherton, the Angels optioned pitcher Brett Hinchliffe to Triple-A
Edmonton.

FULLY AUTOMATED VIDEO STORE OPENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Talk about low overhead. RoboVideo in Encino,
California, is open 24 hours a day -- but owners Les Butler and
Laurent Sebban don't have to worry about finding someone to work
the graveyard shift or paying anyone overtime.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have employees.
</P>
<P>
   Or racks and shelves displaying videocassette boxes.
</P>
<P>
   What they do have is 1,000 first-run movie titles that customers
literally help themselves to. And their sights are set on taking
some business from Blockbuster, the Goliath of the video rental
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Butler and Sebban say theirs is the first fully automated video
store in the country, putting the San Fernando Valley at the
forefront of a concept that may become cutting-edge in the video
rental universe.
</P>
<P>
   Similar stores have operated in Europe for about 10 years so the
kinks have been worked out, notes Sebban, a native of southern
France.
</P>
<P>
   ``This worked very well in Europe so I started thinking it would
be a good idea to bring it to America,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the store tucked behind Starbucks in Encino, at the southwest
corner of Louise Avenue and Ventura Boulevard, the decor is sparse.
The floor is painted with strips of azure and sky blue. Walls
bedecked with movie posters are also blue, trimmed with yellow and
red. Small TV monitors are positioned flush with the walls near the
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Three video selectors are recessed into the back wall and one is
tucked next to the north wall.
</P>
<P>
   These function as the store's clerks.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment for a store this size costs about $125,000 and
Sebban, a Van Nuys resident, and Butler, who lives in Hollywood,
are the U.S. distributors. They hope about a dozen automated stores
will open in the West Los Angeles and Valley area over the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Their system uses bar code technology and is Windows based.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   A customer gets a debit-type card and puts an amount on it, say
$20, that can be used for rentals. Then the card can be inserted
into one of the selector stations and the customer is prompted
through the process, much like at an ATM machine.
</P>
<P>
   Movie titles can be viewed according to categories, such as
action and comedy. Titles also can be viewed alphabetically.
</P>
<P>
   The customer can see a poster from the movie and a description.
</P>
<P>
   Once the selection is made, the customer presses the rent
button, removes the card and inserts it in the dispenser. About 15
to 20 seconds later a door opens and the video slides out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, you've got your video store right in front of
you, at your finger tips. And you don't have to walk up and down
aisles looking at boxes,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   When the card runs out of money, customers can put more on it --
either with a credit card or cash.
</P>
<P>
   Returns are just as easy. Put the card in the dispenser, the
door opens and the video returns to whence it came.
</P>
<P>
   That would involve the ``robo'' part of the store -- a big beige
metal contraption that houses the video titles and the hardware and
software that gets them out of storage and into customers' hands.
</P>
<P>
   RoboVideo also has a free-standing kiosk that could be placed in
a shopping mall and one that could be fitted to the front of a
regular video store, thus turning it into a 24-hour operation. Each
kiosk holds 500 titles.
</P>
<P>
   Butler and Sebban believe convenience will be the key to
RoboVideo's success. The membership card also opens the door after
hours.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Northridge resident Beverly Chang likes about the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   She works nearby and had dropped off one video and rented a DVD
during her lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really convenient. You don't have to deal with (clerks)
and it's really fast. You can just come in, rent what you want and
it's cheaper than Blockbuster,'' she said. ``And I've gotten
everything I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, Butler and Sebban think they also have price on their
side.
</P>
<P>
   For the ``grand opening special,'' rentals are $1.50, $1.75 and
$2 for six, 12 and 24 hours, respectively. In about two months the
prices increase to $1.75, $2.25 and $2.75.
</P>
<P>
   So far Blockbuster is not worried about the automated
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition is always great in the marketplace. We're
certainly going to be focused on our initiatives. We're doing
everything we can to make video rentals as convenient as possible
for our customers,'' said Blockbuster spokesman Randy Hargrove.

BUHNER, BELL DOUBLE-TEAM DEVIL RAYS WITH BAT, GLOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ David Bell and Jay Buhner both came up
big on the field Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Only Buhner came up big in the box score.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners right fielder slammed his 10th homer, had two
singles, walked twice, scored two runs and drove in four in
Seattle's 11-4 win over Tampa Bay. A .274 hitter at game time,
Buhner pushed his average up to a luscious .292.
</P>
<P>
   Bell went 1-for-6 at the plate, didn't score a run and didn't
drive one in. But if he had no impact on the box score, he had
far-reaching impact on the game. Bell's defense at third base was
good for preventing anywhere between three and five runs.
</P>
<P>
   It's not box-score friendly, perhaps, but it's certainly
pitcher-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never see a pitcher who doesn't notice the defense
around him,'' starter Aaron Sele said after improving to 5-2 with a
seven-inning stint. ``If you're not watching the game, you maybe
don't notice what David did.''
</P>
<P>
   If you were watching, you couldn't help it.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, converted back to third base after spending most of his
Mariners life last year as a second baseman, started two huge
double plays, shutting down a rally in the first inning and
undercutting another rally before it had a chance to materialize in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he made a couple of terrific plays worth only one
out _ but each worth the price of admission. He took a hit away by
cutting in front of shortstop Alex Rodriguez early, and he took
another hit away by spearing a ball down the line late.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, David won the game,'' infield coach Larry Bowa said.
``You wouldn't know it to look at the box score, but you ask the
pitchers _ they know.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell's biggest play of the night came in the eighth inning.
Seattle had given Sele an 8-4 lead, but 111 pitches into the game,
Sele didn't have anything left. Manager Lou Piniella turned to Jose
Mesa, and Mesa was immediately scorched for a double and a walk to
open the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's John Flaherty smoked a ball that had ``base hit''
written where the commissioner's signature should be, but Bell
erased it. He dove to pluck the ball, got to his knees to throw and
started a double play that all but eliminated the Devil Rays as
competitors in this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``David has done it time and again,'' said Rodriguez, who kept
the eighth inning scoreless with a nifty diving stop of a line
drive but was more interested in talking about Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won a couple of games because of the way he plays
defense. Tonight was not new. He took them out of innings a couple
of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell has a .237 batting average that bugs him. But the bugs
don't reside in his glove. He plays defense for keeps to keep his
average from getting him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not a .230 hitter,'' said Bell, who hit .268 a year
ago. ``I've got to help out any way I can, and if I'm not hitting,
then I can help out by playing defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, on the other hand, has been hitting most of the year. He
had a bases-loaded walk in a six-run Seattle first inning, singled
in the third, singled and drove in a run in the fifth, walked to
set up a run in the seventh and simply massacred a Roberto
Hernandez pitch in the ninth for a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners began the season concerned that Buhner, injured
much of the past two seasons and coming off surgery, would not be
an everyday player. He isn't, not quite _ he gets Saturday's game
off, for example _ but he plays more than three quarters of the
time, and he's given terrific value for the time he's been in the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   His 10 homers and 36 RBIs, both third-best marks on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay's done a really nice job this year. He really has,''
Piniella said. ``He's hit for a nice average, and he's hit for
power with some RBIs. He's been a good fit for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, has Sele, who is back home in Seattle after spending
his prior big-league career in Boston and Texas. He's off to a 5-2
start with a 4.27 ERA, and while he didn't dominate the Devil Rays,
he held them at bay while the Mariners were building up the lead.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the lead-building in the first inning took so long that
Sele had to go run and stretch all over again between leaving the
bullpen before the game and throwing his first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll trade that half-hour delay for six runs any time,'' Sele
said. ``It took me a little while to get it together after that.
But David helped with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Cox's first big-league homer, a two-run shot in the first,
cut into Sele's big lead, but Bell closed out the inning by
starting a double play with Bubba Trammell at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not see it in the box score, but we don't win this
game without what David Bell did tonight,'' Sele said.

O'NEAL HAS MESSAGE: FOLLOW ME

<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ The Most Improved Player in the league? With
apologies to Indiana's Jalen Rose, he was at the Rose Garden on
Friday. Shaquille O'Neal bloomed in front of this city's
disbelieving eyes in the second half of the Lakers' 93-91 win over
the Trail Blazers in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal scored 18 of his 26 points in the final two quarters and
if his strong finish after a slow start came too late to sway the
NBA voters, well, it was not a moment too soon to impact this
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were staring at a serious abyss at the start of the
third quarter that was some of O'Neal's doing. He didn't have a
rebound or a point in the first 12 minutes and the way the Trail
Blazers were swarming him, he was lucky to get off the one first-
quarter attempt he sort of heaved like a shot put toward the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, the 7-footer had as many personal fouls (two) as
offensive rebounds. He was looking a lot like the frustrated player
that folded last year whenever the calls and the balls didn't go
his way.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, the Lakers trailed 55-45 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the third quarter, which revealed the depth of
O'Neal's development in this, his eighth year in the league. He
didn't recoil from the pressure, he rose above it. He asserted
himself physically, making 5 of 8 shots. But more importantly, he
stayed strong mentally and his teammates rallied behind his
stoicism to take a 2-1 lead into Sunday's Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Watching O'Neal fight for rebounds and re-direct shots and
create his own space out of nothing in the second half, it was hard
to believe that Rodney Rogers received three votes to O'Neal's two
in the Most Improved Player balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, remember, went from the Clippers to Phoenix, a move akin
to an orphan being adopted by the Huxtables.
</P>
<P>
   We'll grant Rogers the Most Improved Environment. But to go from
a disgruntled, disinterested Clipper to the NBA's sixth man of the
year is not really making strides, it's making amends.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to us O'Neal had a much harder mission, trying to
elevate his game without the benefit of a change of scenery. Of
course, there was the change in Lakers personnel and it seemed
clear from the start new coach Phil Jackson's strategy was to goad
O'Neal into greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the Trail Blazers blanketed O'Neal with Arvydas
Sabonis and Brian Grant and Rasheed Wallace, Jackson surrounded the
7-footer with challenges. He called him out to block more shots,
the better to change the trajectory of a game; he commanded him to
make more foul shots because nothing buoys a team's offense like
getting two points for free.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had O'Neal's ear; that much became clear when the center
swatted 239 shots during the regular season, the most since his
rookie year in Orlando. He had five blocked shots in Game 1 of this
series and did OK at the free-throw line despite the Trail Blazers'
best efforts to embarrass him, making 12 of 25 attempts in the
fourth quarter to key the Lakers' 15-point win.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, O'Neal's improvement at the free-throw line
has been harder to see, sometimes, than the sweat he leaves on the
court. He missed 12 of 17 attempts in Game 2 and that, combined
with his listlessness on the defensive end - as evidenced by his
zero blocked shots - told the story of the Lakers' 29-point blowout
loss that allowed the Trail Blazers to even the series at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   So when O'Neal strode into the Rose Garden, there was some
question as to whether he'd be a thorn in the Trail Blazers' side
or compost for Portland's blossoming boldness.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a luxuriant place for the league's Most Valuable
Player to find himself, having to prove his indomitability anew.
</P>
<P>
   And not just to the Trail Blazers. O'Neal had something to
demonstrate to his teammates, too; namely that when the going got
tough, he would get them going.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, what winners do. They draw their teammates
into their eddy, the better to pull the opponent under. Scottie
Pippen certainly understood that in Game 2, hitting 6 of 10 shots
and playing stifling defense as the Trail Blazers suffocated the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, it was O'Neal's turn. Instead of retreating
turtle-like when the Trail Blazers smothered him, O'Neal came out
in the third quarter like a hare. He set the pace with a defensive
rebound of the Trail Blazers' first miss. He had a layup and a
blocked shot - his first of the game - before the quarter was four
minutes old.
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of O'Neal's 5-for-8 shooting from the field (and
3-for-5 shooting from the foul line), the Lakers took a one-point
lead into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had opened a crack in the Trail Blazers' armor. And his
teammates, as they've been waiting to do, followed his lead.

ROSE GARDEN THRONY HOME AS LAKERS RALLY TO NIP BLAZERS

   PORTLAND, Ore. _ They were once the Jackals who stole one in La
La Land.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the Portland Trail Blazers just plain robbed
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That is if you buy into another assessment from coach Phil
Jackson after his Los Angeles Lakers' 93-91 comeback victory in
Game 3 of the Western Conference finals at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Normally Jackson's appraisals are considered psychological mumbo
jumbo, not to be taken seriously. But this time he could not have
been more right.
</P>
<P>
   Portland led for nearly three quarters, only to surrender the
lead and fall behind by eight points in the fourth quarter. The
Blazers stormed back to tie and even had a chance to win at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of going into Game 4 Sunday with a chance to send
the series back to Los Angeles ahead by two games, the Blazers fell
behind 1-2 in the best-of-seven affair and blew the home-court
advantage they had taken away.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure? Squarely back on the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just tightens things up,'' said Jackson, who called the
Blazers ``jackals'' for celebrating their Game 2 win in Los
Angeles. ``Now the pressure is on them in Sunday's ballgame to try
and maintain. That spells death door for Portland. This is a series
when you get that kind of momentum, you've got to ride it.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland, which used an energetic first quarter to go ahead by
13 points, knew it blew Game 3 long before the game's final
sequence. Trailing by two with 11 seconds left, Blazers guard Damon
Stoudamire drove the lane and dished out to center Avydas Sabonis.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sabonis avoided a lunging Shaquille O'Neal, he was met
at the basket by Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, who blocked Sabonis'
shot at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, Ron Harper was left alone on the baseline where
he sank a baseline jumper that broke a 91-91 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just lost our rhythm,'' Blazers forward Scottie Pippen
said. ``We just weren't as sharp, defensively and offensively. We
just have to try and forget about this one. ... We still feel good
about ourselves. We let this slip away. Obviously they know it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers will take what amounted to a number of Blazer
gifts. Portland turned the ball over 15 times. The miscues
accounted for 25 Lakers points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnovers we made were costly,'' Blazers coach Mike
Dunleavy said. ``That was the biggest difference in the game. We
made some bad decisions on our turnovers. We were throwing the ball
into the (crowd). Now we're in a situation where it's our turn to
respond to a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who was held to eight points in the first two quarters,
led the Lakers' surge. He scored 16 points in a third period where
L.A. outscored Portland 27-16 and erased a 55-45 halftime deficit.
</P>
<P>
   A.C. Green's baseline jumper provided the game's first tie,
65-65, with 2:49 left. The Lakers eventually took their first lead
a minute later when Harper sank two free throws for a 69-67
advantage. O'Neal then converted three of four free throws that put
the Lakers ahead 72-71 heading in to the final frame.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' biggest lead was 83-74 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaching staff and the players got on me,'' O'Neal said.
``They said I wasn't working hard enough to get shots. They said
they wanted me to be aggressive and score. It's not to our
advantage for me to shot over two and three guys. I have to get
deep (inside the paint), so that's what I tried to do. Once I got
deep, I just went (to the basket) quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers did not double-team O'Neal as much in the second
half. They could not keep him from catching the ball deep in the
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based on reads,'' Dunleavy said of when to double O'Neal.
``We did a better job _ I don't know if it was energy or not _ of
getting to him in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers arrived in Portland with just one adjustment
following their 106-77 Game 2 loss on Monday. Instead of using Glen
Rice to guard Pippen, Jackson put a more athletic Bryant on the
versatile forward.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who had success against Pippen in the regular season,
seemed to relish the assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie was just doing a lot of staring,'' said Bryant, who
scored 25 points ``He wasn't doing a lot of talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pippen: ``It's just about going out an playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Pippen's energy level and spirit were high, he scored
just 12 points and shot 5-for-13.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Portland appeared to be headed toward another blowout in
the first half with a Pack-a-Shaq defensive scheme working
smoothly. The Blazers blanketed O'Neal with aggressive double- and
triple-teams from various spots on the floor throughout the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal shackled in the paint, the Lakers' offense settled
for outside shots and Bryant's creativity. Bryant's 14-point first
quarter kept the Lakers within 30-22 after an emotionally-charged,
raucous start.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time since we've been together that we've
had to lead the team together,'' Bryant said. ``We're up for the
challenge. We're not going to let our teammates down.''

FETTERS WANTS TO STAY IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Fetters wore the uniform of the Angels, the Milwaukee
Brewers, the Oakland A's and Baltimore Orioles before slipping on
that of his childhood team, the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long road to playing for the one team he desperately
wanted to play for, but at 35 he figures this isn't the end for
him. Fetters says as a few more good years left in his surgically
repaired right elbow, he'd love to remain with the Dodgers. But he
knows the only way that's goi ng to happen is if he's healthy and
performs well.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he was antsy after being activated from the disabled
list bef ore Friday's game against the Philadelphia Phillies at
Dodger Stadium. He impressed the Dodgers so much during the first
month of the season tha the went from a non-roster invitee in
spring training to the primary set-up man in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to play anywhere else,'' said Fetters, a Van Nuys
native and former Pepperdine star. ``I want to retire wearing this
uniform. The only thing that dictates that is how I pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first month of the season Fetters, who signed a one-year
deal, w as outstanding. He was 1-0 with a 2.53 ERA, appearing in 11
of the Dodge rs' first 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   But he was experiencing soreness in his elbow in his last few
outings, a nd wasn't as effective. But it wasn't until a May 3
appearance against A tlanta that his elbow, on which he had surgery
performed last June, bega n to swell.
</P>
<P>
   To that, manager Davey Johnson said he would be much more
reserved in hi s use of Fetters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him setting up,'' Johnson said. ``I'm going to be
careful with him because I think when I went back-to-back in a
couple of tough games I set him back. I think it's going to take
time. I'm going to go slow wi th him.''
</P>
<P>
   More Fetters: Watching the Phillies take batting practice
brought back s ome tough memories for Fetters. He injured his elbow
pitching against th em last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it was a forkball to (Scott) Rolen, and he hit it
for a hom e run,'' Fetters said. ``When I threw the pitch, I felt
my elbow grow in an instant. I finished the inning, went over to
the manager and told hi m I was done. He said, `ok.' I said, `No,
I'm done for the season.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I have a lot of emotion in seeing them. They're the
team th at took me over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield returns: Left fielder Gary Sheffield returned to the
lineup af ter missing the last two games with a sprained right
ankle, and not coin cidentally the Dodgers had trouble scoring runs
in both games he missed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers lost both games, scoring a total of four runs. It's
the fewe st runs they've scored in back-to-back games since May 1
and 2, and Shef field's absence also caused Johnson to alter the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   With Sheffield out, Shawn Green moved up from fourth to third
and Eric K arros went from fifth to fourth. It also caused Todd
Hollandsworth, who led off in his first 18 starts, to bat fifth one
game so F.P. Santangelo could play left field and lead off.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Johnson will take it slow with right-hander Terry
Adams, who is experiencing pain in his right clavicle. But it
doesn't bother Ad ams when he pitches. ...Phillies third baseman
Scott Rolen is expected t o miss the series with a sprained left
ankle.

 For New York fans, this act is nothing special  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are 8 million stories in the Naked City and one
belongs to the nitwit who vaulted out of Yankee Stadium's upper
deck in the third inning of Friday night's Yankee-Red Sox joust.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ultimate in Yankee Stadium moments _ last performed
during a Boston-New York series in 1989. Friday night's fan lay
still on the screen behind home plate for several minutes while
Wilson Delgado and Paul O'Neill were retired by Ramon Martinez.
Play was halted for another few moments before the would-be
Wallenda finally crawled to the safety of a luxury box.
</P>
<P>
   That was the highlight of the night for Gotham fans as Ramon
Martinez (7 2/3 strong innings), Rich Garces, and Derek Lowe
slammed the door on the Yanks and put the Red Sox back in first
place with a 4-1 victory over the world champs.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how to break it to you guys, but this series is not
a very big deal in New York. The local papers are full of Knicks,
Devils, Rudy G., and the heinous Wendy's massacre in Flushing, but
there was hardly a word about Sox-Yanks in Apple rags.
</P>
<P>
   Games Saturday and Sunday night are already sold out, but fans
at the Stadium will likely have mini-TVs in their laps to see if
the bowser trio of Latrell Sprewell, Marcus Camby, and Larry
Johnson can make a shot against the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that New York is simply a Knicks town come playoff
time. It's just that Boston's obsession with New York is not wholly
reciprocal. Bill Parcells noticed this when he left the Patriots
for the Jets. That rivalry also plays much bigger in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox and Yanks were tied for first place, sharing the best
record in the American League. It marked the first time they'd met
when tied for first place since 1978 (except for the first week of
the '95 season). Most participants tried to downplay the late-May
meeting, but Yankee manager Joe Torre acknowledged, ``Whether it's
Fenway Park or Yankee Stadium, you can tell who you're playing by
the energy. The adrenaline really flows when you play the Red
Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens drew a big media crowd and shared his thoughts on
pitching against Pedro Martinez Sunday night. The Rocket needs no
reminding that Pedro and the Red Sox humiliated him at Fenway last
October. Meanwhile, Pedro was still taking care of personal matters
in the Dominican Republic and unavailable for pregame comment. (He
was spotted in the dugout later to watch Ramon.) Too bad. We would
have enjoyed introducing him to the inimitable George King, one of
the two men who jobbed him out of the 1999 MVP award by not putting
him anywhere on the 10-man ballot. For the record, King said he'll
be in Boston when the Yanks come to Fenway next month.
</P>
<P>
   Another hot locker belonged to Carl Everett. The Sox center
fielder was in big demand because of comments he reportedly made
about the Yankees early this spring. Everett was originally
property of the Yankees, and they left him unprotected in the
expansion draft. Everett has backed off some of the stronger stuff
about Paul O'Neill being over the hill and Derek Jeter being
overrated, but he still doesn't like the Yankee organization. Sox
publicist Kevin Shea (a.k.a. ``Dean Wormer'') stood guard by
Everett's locker to make sure there were no more inflammatory
quotes. Everett still managed to rip broadcaster Joe Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   The starting lineups were hardly impressive. Boston was without
Nomar Garciaparra and Jose Offerman. The Yankees went without Derek
Jeter and Chuck Knoblauch. Skittish Knoblauch was a late scratch
because of an alleged strain of his left forearm, but one wonders
if management wants him to overcome his Matt Young disease
(incapable of throwing to first) away from the national spotlight
of Sox-Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter played a minor league game in Tampa Friday night and hoped
to fly by private jet to New York to be ready for the Red Sox
Saturday. Nomar is also slated to vault off the disabled list and
into the lineup. However, the series is not big enough for George
Steinbrenner. The Boss is not expected in the Bronx all weekend.
Perhaps he's studying the lottery field for the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of changes at the Stadium. Jimy Williams's
office was cut in half to make space for a coaches' room, and
fences have been erected in front of both dugouts to protect
uniformed personnel from foul shots. Ancient Yankee coach Don
Zimmer was cracked on the coconut during the playoffs last year and
the mesh on the Yankee side is adorned with a sign that reads,
``Don Zimmer Fence Co.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that Friday marked the beginning of the
no-beer-in-the-bleachers rule, the first ``Boston sucks'' chants
rained down from the cheap seats at 7:09 p.m., just as David Cone
wound up to throw the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, destined to be on the spot for the rest of the night,
was loudly booed when he stepped to the plate in the first, but he
hit a ``take that'' two-run single to center, then stole second.
Playing with righteous rage, he looked like Roger Clemens pitching
against the Red Sox for the first time in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was like that for most of the night. It was a lot like last
year when the Sox beat the Yankees eight times in 12 regular-season
meetings. No need revisiting what happened in October of '99.
There'll be time for that . . . in October 2000.

 Command performance: Ramon puts on show in Bronx  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Red Sox 4 Yankees 1
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes, especially for a fan base that treats his
little brother as if he were the fifth Beatle, it seems as if Ramon
Martinez is mistaken for a Frank Sinatra Jr., trying to do a
passable impression of a more talented and famous namesake.
</P>
<P>
   But long before Pedro the Younger hit the top of the charts,
Ramon the Elder was composing his own formidable body of work.
Different riffs, more subtle shadings, perhaps, but with the
unmistakable markings of a great artist at work.
</P>
<P>
   And while the klieg lights will be turned on full blast Sunday
night for Pedro Martinez-Rocket Clemens redux, Ramon Friday night
showed the New York Yankees that he still has some high notes left
in him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, displaying a command of the strike zone that would
have made his brother jealous _ 107 pitches, 77 for strikes _
allowed just a run in 7 2/3 innings in a 4-1 win that vaulted the
Sox out of a first-place tie with the Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great performance out there, a Ramon-type
performance,'' said Pedro Martinez, who returned from a two-day,
excused hiatus in his native Dominican Republic to witness his
brother's finest effort this young season. ``It's about time things
started to fall in place for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett, the self-proclaimed Yankee hater, delivered a
two-run single in the first to spot Martinez a 2-0 lead, and Mike
Stanley followed two innings later with a two-out, two-run home run
off Yankees starter David Cone. Rich Garces picked up Martinez by
striking out Bernie Williams with a runner on second to end the
eighth, and Derek Lowe rang up his 10th save before a crowd of
54,470 that included one misguided fool who thought he could fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when you've thought you've seen everything,'' Stanley
said of Stephen Laurenzi, the 24-year-old man who climbed on the
railing of the upper deck behind home plate and took a header into
the screen while the Yankees were batting in the third inning.
``Only in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez lasted just 2 1/3 innings in his last start, when he
was beaten, 7-5, by the Tigers Sunday after sitting out 10 days
because of a strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of game I can pitch,'' Martinez said of his
performance Friday night in which he did not issue a walk (he hit
one batter) and gave up seven hits, including Clay Bellinger's
third-inning home run for the only Yankee run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel terrible with myself, when I have those games where I
pitch just two innings,'' he said. ``That's not me. I think about
those games. The only thing that makes me feel good is knowing my
arm is in good shape, and it's just a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett, whose disdain for the Bombers is widely known in all
five boroughs, delivered a two-run single in his first at-bat
against the team that drafted him in the first round 10 years ago,
then let him go in the expansion draft two years later. He might
never have had the chance if Cone had turned Brian Daubach's
first-and-third comebacker into an inning-ending double play
instead of turning his attention to Jeff Frye, who was trapped off
third base.
</P>
<P>
   Frye, who had doubled and taken third on John Valentin's bounced
single through the left side, did a dash-dot-dash pattern down the
third base line long enough to let both runners move up into
scoring position. Everett followed with a line single to center,
and it was 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think David would like to have that ball back to the mound
back,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``It's a double-play
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez benefited from the kind of base-running blunder that
was absent from the Yankees' repertoire when these teams last met
during the American League Championship Series in October. Three
successive singles with no outs in the fifth netted the Yankees
nothing, as they wound up with two runners on third.
</P>
<P>
   Boss Steinbrenner was in Tampa, otherwise there might have been
mass firings on the spot _ Bellinger and Chris Turner, the young
catcher who held up at third even though center fielder Everett had
dived for Ricky Ledee's single and had given up on making a play at
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bellinger made the right read and the wrong decision,'' Torre
said. ``Just because you read it as a base hit doesn't mean that
everybody does. On the front end, I don't think Chris was as sure
it was a base hit as (Bellinger) was. Willie held him up at third
because there was nobody out. It was just a bad play, and there's
no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the last spot of trouble Martinez encountered. He set
down 10 straight until Paul O'Neill's opposite-field, ground-rule
double with two outs in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because he hurt his arm doesn't mean you lose your
head,'' said Torre. ``I thought he pitched a very heady game
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez gave way to Rich Garces, who recently ate at a
Venezuelan restaurant in Watertown, Casa de Pedro, that is not
named after the Sox pitcher but features a dish called salmon Pedro
Martinez. The suspicion is that was too small a piece of fish for
El Guapo, who snacked on toasted Bombers Friday night, striking out
Williams to end the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about last year,'' said Garces, who faced down
the Yankees here with the bases loaded in Game 1 of the ALCS.
``It's unbelievable. You can't hear yourself breathing out there.
But this was the type of situation you've got to keep calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie Williams is one of the best hitters in the major
leagues. But I got ahead of him with a curveball, threw a couple of
fastballs inside, then came back and got him with the curveball.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe gave up a two-out double in the ninth before turning out
the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage, Sox. It's the Dartmouth kid, Brian Rose, Saturday
afternoon, Pedro Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But this one belonged to Ramon. Maybe Garces will go back to
that restaurant in Watertown and find a dish named after the Elder,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramon was unbelievable today,'' Garces said. ``He was
incredible. We're happy for him. We need him to pitch like this.''

LAKERS BACK IN CHARGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Kobe Bryant needed no prompting. Shaquille
O'Neal needed only a nudge or two. And Ron Harper, all he needed
was a few feet of space.
</P>
<P>
   And now everything the Los Angeles Lakers need is back within
their sights. A series that seemed perilously close to slipping
through their fingers is once more situated firmly back in their
palms, held in a tight clench.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's brilliant shooting got the Lakers started Friday night,
O'Neal's power pushed them to the finish and Harper's final jumper
made it all stand up as the Lakers tipped the Portland Trail
Blazers 93-91 before 20,135 at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Lakers a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven
Western Conference finals and restored, for now, their home-court
advantage. Game 4 is Sunday at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out tonight,'' Harper said, ``with a frame of mind to
get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   They worked the job in shifts. Bryant started with a 14-point
first quarter on his way to a 25-point night. O'Neal carried the
third by scoring 13 of his game-high 26 points. Then Harper closed
the store.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a pass from Bryant, Harper swished a 19-foot baseline
jumper to break a 91-91 tie with 29.9 seconds left. It was a fine
bit of redemption for the veteran guard, who has been the Blazers'
favorite man to leave while double-teaming O'Neal and Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's rewarding for Ron,'' coach Phil Jackson said,
``especially when they've been leaving him in this series with open
shots, to hit a shot that counted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers got two chances to tie the game, but Rasheed Wallace
lost the ball on the first possession, and the second ended with
Bryant swooping in to block Arvydas Sabonis on his drive to the
hoop as the clock ran down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just closed the lane,'' Bryant said. ``Shaq did a great job
running Sabonis off the 3-(point) line. ... I wanted to close
Sabonis down because he's an excellent passer, but he penetrated,
went up for his shot and I was fortunate enough to get a hand on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Good fortune seemed to accompany Bryant all night. He was
assigned to guard Scottie Pippen and silenced him for most of the
game, holding him to 12 points. And after two subdued offensive
performances, Bryant came out firing Friday, hitting fadeaways and
off-balance jumpers with ease. He was 8 for 13 by halftime, and his
final point total equaled his production in Games 1 and 2 combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were kind of unsure as a ballclub the type of game
it was gonna be, what kind of pace it was gonna be played at,''
Bryant said, ``and I wanted to come out and try to set the tone,
send a message not only to us as a ballclub that we can win here,
but to the Portland team as well that the team you're facing
tonight isn't the same as you faced last game.''
</P>
<P>
   It took O'Neal longer to get the message. He struggled to work
through the double-teams, went scoreless in the first quarter and
by halftime had been outscored, 9-8, by Arvydas Sabonis. Portland
shot 56.1 percent in the half, built a 55-45 lead, and as Jackson
noted, ``we were feeling pretty fortunate just to be down by 10
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Then O'Neal made his move, finding space to work, and sometimes
creating it himself. He made 5 of 8 shots in the third as the
Lakers outscored the Blazers 27-16, grabbed their first lead of the
game late in the quarter and took a 72-71 advantage into the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went cold, and they got hot at the same time. And that's a
bad combination,'' said Portland's Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaching staff and the players kind of got on me (at
halftime),'' O'Neal said. ``They said I wasn't working hard enough
for the shot. In the first half, I felt they (defenders) were
coming really, really fast and I find it's not to our advantage for
me to take a lot of shots over two or three people. So I was just
trying to pass it out. But they said they wanted me to be more
aggressive and score. So I was looking to score a little bit
more.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the Lakers are looking to sweep this two-game set in the
Rose City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just tightens things up,'' Jackson said. ``We found a way
to get back in this series by reclaiming home-court advantage, and
now the pressure's on them in Sunday's ballgame to try and
maintain, because we can put another notch in our belt in this next
game on Sunday - that spells really death's door for Portland. And
they know it. And this is a series that if we can get that kind of
momentum, we gotta ride it. And we're gonna have to ride it.''

BLAZERS MISS OPPORTUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ That was Scottie Pippen slamming his fists onto
an overmatched press table. That was Scottie Pippen ripping down a
stack of towels outside the Portland Trail Blazers' dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers, most of them anyway, tried their best to give
credit to the Los Angeles Lakers for their 93-91 comeback victory
Friday night in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was no disguising the frustration of their emotional
loss immediately after Arvydas Sabonis' final jump shot in the lane
was blocked by Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers had played almost brilliantly in the early going to
build a quick 14-point lead. They were in control, hitting their
outside shots, dominating the boards, almost looking like they were
going to roll to an easy victory before a fired-up crowd.
</P>
<P>
   All for it to slip away. For the home-court advantage they had
stolen in Los Angeles to be quickly given back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to forget about this one,'' Pippen said. ``We let
this one slip away. Obviously, they know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen had his own strange game of ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this series, Lakers coach Phil Jackson had
Kobe Bryant guard Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the same Pippen whom Jackson has been trying to
play mind games with since before the season even began. The player
Jackson said would have to lead the Blazers, because no one else
would.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen responded aggressively in Game 2 when he constantly drove
to the basket, scoring 21 points and grabbing 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But matched against Bryant, Pippen seldom drove the lane and
often settled for being a playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   At the half, it seemed to be working well enough. Pippen had hit
only 2 of 6 field goals but had a game-high five assists and five
rebounds. And the Blazers had a 10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   But still hounded by Bryant, Pippen missed on all three
field-goal attempts in the third quarter and went without an assist
as the Lakers charged back to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   With 4:03 in the fourth quarter and the Lakers up by six, Bryant
picked up his fifth foul and Pippen again became a factor. He hit a
3-pointer and twice drove the lane for short jumpers over Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   But he also had a shot blocked by Shaquille O'Neal and threw
away a pass under the basket. Pippen finished with 12 points (5 of
13), nine rebounds and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   He had fallen to the ground when Glen Rice lost the ball in the
last seconds, giving the Blazers their fateful final chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Robert) Horry was stepping on me to keep me down,''
Pippen said. ``By the time I got up, Damon (Stoudamire) was
penetrating and then he kicked it out to Arvydas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officials are not going to call that (foul). It's a better
percentage to shoot the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers were left to heal their emotional wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have won that game,'' said Blazers forward Brian
Grant. ``It shouldn't have come down to that (shot).
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we gave this game away. We had the opportunities
to put it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the game was riddled with chances for the Blazers to run
away with the game, but they never could shake the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just turned the ball over too much in the second half,''
said Portland forward Detlef Schrempf. ``Then we had breakdowns on
defense and let them have some easy baskets. You can't do that with
a team like the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a veteran team. We've lost playoff games before. We know
we have to win one down there again now.''

DODGERS SHOO THE BLUES AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The doldrums ended about the same time the ball
hit by Todd Hundley fell into the right-field stands in the bottom
of the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Suspensions, fines, the frustration of being severely penalized
by baseball and the chaos that encompassed it lingered heavily in
the Dodger Stadium air from the moment batting practice commenced
but lifted instantly when Hundley's shot left the yard.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers reacted to the blast by scoring five
times in the sixth inning and beat the Philadelphia Phillies 11-4
Friday in the opener of a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody was kind of feeling the same way,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. ``We came out and we were lackluster.
It was big to put this thing behind us and deal with what we have
to deal with. It's kind of hard to stop thinking about it, but (we
had to) put it behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who had four RBI, added his second two-run homer of the
game in the seventh inning and Kevin Brown (4-1) pitched seven
innings and drove in his first two runs as the Dodgers ended a
two-game losing streak by beating the National League's worst team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of concerned early in the game if we were going to
get it going,'' said Hundley, who has 13 homers and 32 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shook the cobwebs off and got back to playing good
baseball. In batting practice, everyone was so dead. ... With all
the things going on, we have to keep our minds and concentrate on
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball handed down suspensions and fines to 16
players and three coaches on Wednesday, and the Dodgers were
feeling the hangover effects. It didn't help when Brown allowed
three runs in the third inning, two of which came on Rob Ducey's
homer, as the Phillies took a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Hundley provided the spark with his two-run homer to right,
which brought life to the sleep-walking Dodgers. Brown retired the
next six batters, and even though a squeeze bunt by Tom Prince gave
the Phillies a 4-3 lead in the sixth, the tenor had already
shifted. And a Philadelphia error led to five unearned runs in the
bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros tied it 4-4 with a double off the top of the wall
and Adrian Beltre had an RBI single to give the Dodgers the lead.
Kevin Elster, who later homered, was intentionally walked to load
the bases for Brown, and he picked up his second hit in 18 at-bats
to put the Dodgers ahead 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do your job well enough on the mound, (hitting) is not
an issue,'' Brown said. ``(But) it's great. That's part of the fun
of being in the National League. It's a lot more fun when you do
get a hit instead of making an out.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth ended the inning with an RBI single. The
Dodgers secured the win in the seventh when Hundley homered again
in the seventh. It marked the 11th time Hundley's homered twice in
a game, and it was the sixth time a Dodger has done it this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To start the game, I was completely clueless,'' Hundley said.
``I went to (hitting coach) Rick Down and asked for help to
straighten things out. I got back off the plate and tried to hit
the ball hard instead of trying to hit it nine miles.''

USC'S CURRIER SURVIVES WALK ON THE WILD SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FULLERTON, Calif. _ Rik Currier waited for his coach and
wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was gone,'' the USC junior said when Mike
Gillespie visited the struggling pitcher in the second inning of
Friday's NCAA baseball regional opener against Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   But Currier rebounded from his shaky beginning to throw eight
strong innings to lead the top-seeded Trojans past the Hokies 8-3
at Cal State Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   USC (39-18) moves into today's 4:30 p.m. winner's bracket game
against Loyola Marymount.
</P>
<P>
   Currier (13-3) took the mound as the Trojans' most effective
starter. He was the Pacific-10 Conference co-pitcher of the year
and was named a second-team All-American by Collegiate Baseball on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first two innings, fourth-seeded Virginia Tech
(34-24-2) seemed unimpressed with Currier's credentials. Six of the
first nine Hokies batters reached base to plate two first-inning
runs and create another jam for Currier in the second. Virginia
Tech had runners on first and second with no outs.
</P>
<P>
   With Ronald Flores hurrying to get warm in the bullpen,
Gillespie visited Currier, who had issued three walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When coach Gillespie comes out you know he has something to
tell you or you're gone,'' Currier said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie considered pulling his ace with the idea that he could
return later in the regional if needed. He encouraged him to
``pitch well,'' knowing that Currier had lasted at least six
innings in each of his previous eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever strategy Gillespie was considering was made moot by
Currier, who promptly picked off the runner on second, Nick
Perlozzo.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Foutz then struck out and Addison Bowman fouled out,
deflating the Hokies and raising Currier's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we score a run ... then we have a good chance of getting
(Currier) out of the game,'' Foutz said. ``We planned on trying to
get on them as early as possible. We wanted to let them know we
were here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans needed no more incentive. Currier did serve up a
solo homer to Kevin Bice in the sixth, but the Dana Point resident
allowed just four baserunners after his chat with Gillespie. He
finished with seven strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, USC pounded out four doubles, three by Justin Gemoll,
and two home runs in a 15-hit attack.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Concepcion's two-run homer tied the game at 2-2 in the
bottom of the second, and Seth Davidson increased the lead to 6-2
with a two-run shot to dead center off Jason Bush (9-6) in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was keeping the faith. I really felt that if we could put a
stop to (Virginia Tech), we would not be held down,'' Gillespie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie hinted that Currier, despite throwing 124 pitches,
could comeback on Sunday if the Trojans advance to the championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Currier) was definitely on the ropes. ... I love a pitcher
that can get out of trouble and pitch well like that,'' said Hokies
coach Chuck Hartman, whose team beat USC in a similar underdog
situation in a 1997 regional opener in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played great baseball after that and put us away.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyola Marymount 6, Cal State Fullerton 4: Lions left-hander
Billy Traber had moments of distress, but the West Coast Conference
pitcher of the year rarely wilted under the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Traber (10-4) worked his way out of several jams, including a
near disastrous one in the ninth, to lead the Lions (40-17).
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Fullerton (36-20) loaded the bases with no outs, but
Traber retired Chris Beck on a fly out, Jake Epstein on a sacrifice
fly and Aaron Rifkin on a ground out to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Traber had an early five-run cushion but watched the Titans cut
the lead to 5-2 and load the bases with no outs in the fifth. But
Traber, a likely high pick in the upcoming draft, struck out Steve
Woodward, Beck and Epstein in succession to avoid any damage.
</P>
<P>
   Traber struck out 13 and allowed nine hits for his fourth
complete game.
</P>
<P>
   The third-seeded Lions also faced a conference pitcher of the
year in Titans right-hander Adam Johnson from the Big West.
However, LMU scored five runs off Johnson (7-4) in the first three
innings, highlighted by David Maffei's two-run home run in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Titans meet Virginia Tech in a 1:30
elimination game this afternoon.

COMMENTARY: ABOUT LAST NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore is desperate to get chicks.
</P>
<P>
   Married chicks. Single chicks. Old chicks. Young chicks.
Anywhere a chick, chick?
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't stop turning off women, he'll never be president.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing seems to help. He got buff. He put on a pair of
provocatively tight jeans. He shook his booty _ and even his Palm
Pilot _ at a big fund-raiser. He's surrounded by female advisers.
He throws all sorts of policy ideas to women. The guy practically
lactates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's getting the brush. In the latest New York Times
poll, George W. Bush has a wide lead with men and, amazingly, edges
out Gore with women (who elected Bill Clinton), 44 to 42 percent.
Even feminists are nagging Gore about his lack of oomph.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pollster Harrison Hickman went to Capitol Hill the other
day to tell Democrats there was some good news: The campaign had
conducted a focus group to ask women who would make a better date _
Al Gore or George W. Bush _ and Gore won.
</P>
<P>
   As The Wall Street Journal reported, Hickman said the women in
the focus group found the vice president ``thoughtful, reflective
and interested in what women have to say,'' while the Texas
governor was seen as ``the type who would drive up in a flashy
convertible, honk the horn instead of coming to the door, lean
against his car chewing gum and spend all night talking about
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, someone at the meeting told me, was viewed as ``the nicer
guy, who would be more stable and reliable. Bush was seen as a guy
who would dump you in a heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's supporters were appalled that his campaign
was wasting time and money on focus groups that looked at women's
hormones rather than their brains.
</P>
<P>
   I personally am appalled that the Gore campaign equates going on
a date with picking a president.
</P>
<P>
   Going on a date is really, really hard.
</P>
<P>
   And anyhow, I know someone who went on a blind date with Al Gore
eons ago. ``It was a complete dud,'' my friend recalls. ``He didn't
talk to me. He wasn't a conversationalist, in any sense of the
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gore has probably changed a lot. For one thing, he
has learned to cover his imperfections.
</P>
<P>
   People magazine reported that he is using a pressurized makeup
wand to spray a ``light mist'' of foundation on his face, an
expensive accessory used by Hollywood actresses. After the spray
was applied, the delighted candidate gushed to his makeup artist,
``I have never looked better.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans mocked Alpha male for using a magic wand, but women
might want to take it into account when they're choosing which
candidate to date. It would be nice to have a guy who could share
the secret of how to stop makeup from caking.
</P>
<P>
   I conducted my own focus group with girlfriends who know the
candidates. This is how they weigh the pros and cons of an evening
of Tennessee waltzing or Texas two-stepping.
</P>
<P>
   W. advantages: You could count on Tex-Mex with good guac, and
putt-putt afterward. If the China trade bill comes up in
conversation, Condi's just a phone call away. If you're mugged, an
NRA posse will gallop to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   W. disadvantages: Aches and pains from a manic schedule of
jogging, tennis, fishing and golfing. You could never go to his
place. It would be a toxic-waste dump _ the only thing in the
fridge, Gatorade and a jar of grape jelly. He'd pick you up in a
Bonneville stuffed with old buddies and Bushes. He'd try to prove
gravitas by casually jamming a copy of Lingua Franca into his jeans
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Al advantages: He'll pander to you and pick your favorite
restaurant. He offers primo transportation, bulletproof limos and
Air Force Two. If the date isn't going well, he'll call a
facilitator. He'll amuse you with wild exaggerations about his
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Al disadvantages: He'd talk to your parents too earnestly for
too long. He'd take you to a revival house to see ``The Sorrow and
the Pity.'' He'd bring his global warming charts and talk about his
Inner Ecology. You'd have to be prepared for the date to become a
fund-raiser. (Al would soften the blow by calling it a
``non-finance-related, community outreach event.'') If the date was
going really well, he might shout and growl, the way he does when
he gets excited at labor rallies and black churches. Afterward, he
might force you to do a focus group to analyze how the night went.

<P>
   The Cold War is over. There are no longer two superpowers,
poised to obliterate each other and the world, restrained only by
the Strangelovian doctrine of MAD, or Mutually Assured Destruction.
And yet the world still bristles with 30,000 or so nuclear arms,
many on permanent high alert, while the ranks of nuclear powers
keep growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Cold War, these weapons were considered regrettable
but necessary because of the Communists,'' George Perkovich, an
arms expert at the W. Alton Jones Foundation, a private group in
Charlottesville, Va., said. ``Well, the Communists are gone, we won
the Cold War, but we still have the weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a peculiar state of affairs, and a frightening one, and
for the first time in years, those whose business is arms control
are trying to construct a better way to deal with the Pandora's Box
of the nuclear age.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have decided that traditional arms control is broken,''
said Stephen Hadley, a Pentagon official in the Bush administration
and a campaign adviser to Governor Bush. ``We've been keeping a
large inventory of nuclear weapons that we don't need and that the
military doesn't want.''
</P>
<P>
   Centrist thinkers on both sides of the political aisle are
calling for deep cuts in remaining arsenals, for building
antimissile defenses against rogue states, and for getting serious
about stopping the spread of missile technology and nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Impatience with the status quo can be seen everywhere. President
Clinton is moving toward approving a limited antimissile system,
initially of 100 interceptors in Alaska. Next week in Moscow, he is
to meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin about amending the
1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty and making deep offensive cuts.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said last week that as president he would reduce
America's nuclear arsenal to its ``lowest possible number,''
perhaps unilaterally. ``Our mutual security need no longer depend
on a nuclear balance of terror,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Even the United Nations has bestirred itself. Last weekend, a
conference to review the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty ended with
the first-ever statement of ``unequivocal'' commitment from the
United States and other nuclear powers to achieve comprehensive
nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the shift _ besides sheer exasperation with decades of
policy immobility _ lie significant changes in the strategic
environment. Offensive weapons technology has spread far beyond the
old nuclear club, and there has been steady progress in learning
how to shoot down missiles from land, sea and space. These
technological shifts will only gain in speed, and promise to
fundamentally alter the field of play in the years and decades
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The new theoreticians, who have been talking informally in
Washington for at least a year, also point to a depressing tally of
arms control failures. ``The old paradigm has difficulties, many of
them,'' said Jan Lodal, a former Pentagon official in the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Among the troubles he cites are stalled arms control
negotiations between Moscow and Washington, the growing irrelevance
of the nuclear test ban treaty, which was shaken in 1998 by Indian
and Pakistani bomb tests and crippled last year when the Senate
rejected it, and the developing threat of long-range missiles from
North Korea, Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those arguing for new approaches to the nuclear dilemma
aim to deprive the atom of its prestige and power in global
matters, to make it clear that a state can be a player on the world
stage without the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no longer this cataclysmic threat of a major war every
day, so we have to put nuclear weapons into the background of
international affairs,'' said Perkovich. To this end, the nuclear
powers should drastically cut their arsenals and take arms off high
alert, as Bush proposed last week. That would help curb atomic envy
in India, Pakistan and Japan, said Perkovich, author of ``India's
Nuclear Bomb'' (University of California, 1999). Deep cuts, he
added, would make America less of a nuclear hypocrite in world
eyes, bolstering its moral authority in fighting the spread of
missile technology and nuclear arms and aiding the enforcement of
all kinds of international rules and inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Iraq,'' Perkovich said. ``They're wavering on
enforcement. To get that, you need international support.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy about the new thinking. Old-school arms
controllers say the new theorists have yet to explain how
antimissile defenses would avoid stimulating new arms races and
strategic insecurity, which could create conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be something new here, because people are searching
for an alternative to doing nothing, or doing the president's
plan,'' said Joseph Cirincione, a senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace. In his view, however, arms
control is inseparable from the certainty that the first use of
nuclear weapons would mean one's own destruction. ``You can't cut
the Gordian knot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is what makes antimissile arms the most contentious part of
the new calculus. Even if affordable and feasible against
rogue-state threats, missile defenses, paradoxically, are often
seen as endangering the stability that comes with MAD (which is why
the ABM treaty sought to scrap them).
</P>
<P>
   If mutual destruction did not seem assured, the major nuclear
powers would base their war plans on overwhelming any shield with
swarms of warheads, critics argue. So Russia would refuse to cut
its arsenal further and China, which now has 20 or so warheads that
can threaten the United States, might deploy hundreds of new ones,
experts say. And that could spark chain reactions in India,
Pakistan and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deploying a national missile defense will surely crush hopes
for the positive arms control steps,'' said John Isaacs, president
of the Council for a Livable World, a Washington arms control
group.
</P>
<P>
   Even more ominously, the rest of the world might view with alarm
a United States protected by antimissile defenses, reasoning that
it could fire a massive first strike at an opponent's offensive
weapons and use antimissile arms to protect itself against any weak
retaliation. Analysts worry that the very existence of this
possibility could, in times of crisis, trigger war.
</P>
<P>
   The new thinkers say such fears can be managed through intense
strategic cooperation not just with allies, but with rivals and
even foes. The keys are avoiding any surprises, relentlessly
emphasizing benign intent and bringing others under the
new-paradigm umbrella by sharing warning systems and possibly even
antimissile arms. They point to East-West talks on defense sharing
in the closing days of the Cold War, and say new initiatives might
be much broader, involving more nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question,'' said Michael Krepon, president of the
Henry L. Stimson Center, a policy group in Washington at the center
of the new strategic thinking, ``is whether the impulse to build
defenses destroys the prospect for a cooperative transition.'' If
so, he said, ``you're stuck.''

<P>
   The Cold War is over. There are no longer two superpowers,
poised to obliterate each other and the world, restrained only by
the Strangelovian doctrine of MAD, or Mutually Assured Destruction.
And yet the world still bristles with 30,000 or so nuclear arms,
many on permanent high alert, while the ranks of nuclear powers
keep growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Cold War, these weapons were considered regrettable
but necessary because of the Communists,'' George Perkovich, an
arms expert at the W. Alton Jones Foundation, a private group in
Charlottesville, Va., said. ``Well, the Communists are gone, we won
the Cold War, but we still have the weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a peculiar state of affairs, and a frightening one, and
for the first time in years, those whose business is arms control
are trying to construct a better way to deal with the Pandora's Box
of the nuclear age.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have decided that traditional arms control is broken,''
said Stephen Hadley, a Pentagon official in the Bush administration
and a campaign adviser to Governor Bush. ``We've been keeping a
large inventory of nuclear weapons that we don't need and that the
military doesn't want.''
</P>
<P>
   Centrist thinkers on both sides of the political aisle are
calling for deep cuts in remaining arsenals, for building
antimissile defenses against rogue states, and for getting serious
about stopping the spread of missile technology and nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Impatience with the status quo can be seen everywhere. President
Clinton is moving toward approving a limited antimissile system,
initially of 100 interceptors in Alaska. Next week in Moscow, he is
to meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin about amending the
1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty and making deep offensive cuts.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said last week that as president he would reduce
America's nuclear arsenal to its ``lowest possible number,''
perhaps unilaterally. ``Our mutual security need no longer depend
on a nuclear balance of terror,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Even the United Nations has bestirred itself. Last weekend, a
conference to review the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty ended with
the first-ever statement of ``unequivocal'' commitment from the
United States and other nuclear powers to achieve comprehensive
nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The verdicts came in a downpour of piety only hours after
Latrell Sprewell's infamous choking of his coach, P.J. Carlesimo,
in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit News: ``Today, athletes spit at umpires, attack
teammates on the practice field and, in the case of Golden State
Warriors guard Latrell Sprewell, put a stranglehold on their coach
and threaten to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News: ``Sprewell still doesn't understand he
crossed a line. Maybe he is another athlete who doesn't think there
are any lines at all.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS News: ``In an era when millionaire athletes routinely behave
like spoiled brats ... ''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Chronicle: ``Sprewell's behavior escalated to
this point because pro athletes so rarely face consequences
commensurate with their indiscretions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times: ``So here we sit, knocked flat by another
pro athlete without a moral compass.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were just a few of the 487 news dispatches about Sprewell
that week featuring the word athlete, almost always as a
generalization. Sports Illustrated dubbed him ``not so much a
person as an issue''; in one harrowing lesson, readers were told,
he had taught us everything we needed to know about sports stars.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, after Sprewell's run-and-gun skills have helped
make the New York Knicks contenders for the National Basketball
Association championship, the moral has ripened into one that is
more difficult to swallow. Sprewell is now one of the most popular
athletes in New York, even embraced by the league itself in
commercials. His metamorphosis from pariah to prodigy is a lesson
all its own, less about athletes than their audience.
</P>
<P>
   In sports there is a half-life to public disdain, an inevitable
erosion that typically takes two to three years. Even the most
hardened opinions give way to the exhilaration of tape-measure home
runs or monster dunks, especially when delivered in a home uniform.
Those instants of inebriation are the ultimate subliminal
advertising: Without even knowing it, fans get nudged toward
thinking, ``Well, he can't be that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sprewell's case, his capricious and occasionally reckless
style of play after joining the Knicks went from crass to
charismatic, particularly because it energized an otherwise dull
club. (He has also gone over two years without choking his coach.)
Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy has said that New York ``loves
reclamation projects,'' and he's right. After all, drug offenders
like Lawrence Taylor, Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry have
repeatedly returned to ovations that only get louder and louder.
</P>
<P>
   Gotham is so renowned for welcoming visiting offenders, however,
that Shea Stadium security is quaking at the impending arrival of
the Atlanta Braves' John Rocker on June 29. Six months after his
xenophobic rant about New Yorkers, Rocker is midway through the
vindication cycle _ his hometown fans are cheering him, while
opposing crowds still punish him with boos and threats. One Los
Angeles Dodgers fan even ran out onto the field as Rocker prepared
to pitch and mooned him. (Alas, the gesture lost some edge when the
fan later accepted $500 from an Atlanta radio station to meet
Rocker face-to-face, and the two shook hands and yukked it up
during batting practice.)
</P>
<P>
   Why are Braves fans cheering Rocker, and why will he ultimately
find the same national absolution as Sprewell and Roberto Alomar,
who spit on an umpire in 1996 and finds little trouble anymore?
Partly because of his talent, but also because today's media
culture so excoriates its chosen malefactors so self-righteously
for so long that they become victims themselves. (In an Internet
poll following Jim Gray's aggressive interview of Pete Rose on NBC
last October, 92 percent of fans said they wanted the convicted
gambler back in baseball.)
</P>
<P>
   This sympathy has less to do with forgiveness than with
redistributing blame. Also boredom: As the 24-hour sports channels
have found other sideshows to harp on _ the National Football
League now has not one but two players accused of murder _ Rocker
is on his way to being old news, left to lie fallow until his
career blooms anew.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell navigated the road to redemption perfectly last season.
He wore wire-rimmed glasses during interviews to appear less
threatening, but retained the corn-row hairdo that kept him hip. He
spoke of just trying to fit in, while starring in a sneaker
commercial so contrite about his past behavior that he proclaimed
himself ``The American Dream.'' Perhaps he was. Months later, the
Knicks signed Sprewell to a $62 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as he seeks to propel the Knicks to the NBA finals,
Sprewell's days as a lightning rod for athlete villainy seem a
lifetime away. Back then, The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel said the
firestorm was ``a referendum on the modern athlete.'' It was about
more than that, and the verdict is in.

   ATLANTA _ Eleven days ago, when prosecutors in Birmingham, Ala.,
charged two former Ku Klux Klansmen with the deadly 1963 bombing of
a black church, there was a lot of talk about closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be some kind of closure, one way or another,''
said Doug Jones, the young U.S. attorney who has overseen the
reinvestigation of the bombing that killed four girls.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Cross, who was the pastor at 16th Street Baptist
Church when the dynamite detonated 37 years ago, said he felt
elated about the indictments. ``Perhaps this will bring closure,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what is closure, really? Is it a psychological phenomenon or
a political one or some melding of the two? Has the word become so
overused that it is all but meaningless? Can a judicial resolution
lessen the agony of the victims and families, or does it serve only
to revive pain that had long ago subsided?
</P>
<P>
   These questions are complicated, say psychiatrists, clergy and
those who have experienced grievous losses themselves. And science
has yet to reach many conclusions in what is a relatively young
field.
</P>
<P>
   But all across the world, from South Africa to Chile to
Mississippi to cities like New York that have built Holocaust
museums, the search for closure has become a driving force in
politics, law and culture.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, former President Nelson Mandela's government
made the remarkable choice of placing healing above vengeance _ and
some say justice _ by granting amnesty to thousands of apparatchiks
of the apartheid regime who agreed to testify before the country's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Chile's courts, encouraged by
the newly installed Socialist government, are pushing ahead with
the prosecution of the 84-year-old former dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet on charges he was involved in the kidnapping, murder and
torture of thousands of his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   In Neshoba County, Miss., officials are delving again into the
murders of three civil rights workers in 1964. Across the South,
authorities have reopened a number of decades-old cases that were
never adequately investigated because white police officers,
prosecutors, witnesses and jurors sympathized more with white
suspects than with black victims. The May 17 indictments of Thomas
E. Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry in the Birmingham bombing
were the latest example. Only one of the four men identified as
suspects, Robert Chambliss, was ever tried and that was 14 years
later; he died in prison in 1985.

<P>
   At its most elemental, closure is a byproduct of justice, truth
and discovery, psychiatrists and experts say. Finality does not
necessarily alleviate the anguish associated with unjustifiable
loss. But it does, in certain cases, help victims and relatives
move on. And it often restores faith in people, in government and
even in God when a previously unjust system acknowledges past
failings and tries to correct them, however belatedly.
</P>
<P>
   But people respond in different ways, and some traumas defy
closure, researchers caution. ``For some people, this may be very
painful and wake up memories and concerns that they put aside many
years ago,'' said Dr. Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, a professor of
psychiatry at the University of Michigan who studies how people
react to trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Southwick, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale
University School of Medicine, said it was important to distinguish
between seeking justice and seeking revenge. ``While seeking
justice seems to help many individuals,'' he said, ``it is commonly
felt that seeking revenge tends to further immerse the individual
in the pain of traumatic loss, making it difficult to move on in
life.'' Southwick added, ``One may never fully put to rest the
traumatic loss of a loved one.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of those who have been through the experience, however,
there is little question about the cathartic benefits.

   Myrlie Evers-Williams was home the night her husband, the NAACP
field secretary Medgar Evers, was shot in the back in their
driveway in Jackson, Miss., in 1963. She sat through two trials in
1964 as all-white juries deadlocked over the complicity of Byron de
la Beckwith. Evers-Williams, who later presided over the national
NAACP, pressed for justice for 30 years. When a jury finally found
de la Beckwith guilty in 1994, she felt an almost physiological
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall this feeling of release that was very spiritual,''
she said, ``and it was as though all of the demons in my body
exited through every pore of my being. It was as though I could
almost see it rushing out. For the first time in all those years, I
became free, my children became free and I felt that Mississippi
became freer, as did all of America. That was the point of
closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellie Dahmer waited 32 years to see Sam Bowers, a former
Klansman, convicted of the firebombing that killed her husband,
Vernon, a local NAACP leader. ``It certainly gives you a feeling
that at least your country cares about you,'' she said. ``We felt
so often that we had been so badly mistreated because we were
black.''
</P>
<P>
   As both Evers-Williams and Dahmer suggest, closure can be as
important for a place _ in their case the South _ as for survivors.
Successful prosecutions of long-ago crimes are often viewed as
political statements, as poignant assertions that times have
changed. In that sense, closure can be as liberating for future
generations as for those who suffered the pain, said Morris Dees,
co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors cases
of racial violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people have problems in a family and sweep them under the
rug and don't deal with them openly and honestly,'' he said,
``they're just going to fester.''

   ATLANTA _ Eleven days ago, when prosecutors in Birmingham, Ala.,
charged two former Ku Klux Klansmen with the deadly 1963 bombing of
a black church, there was a lot of talk about closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be some kind of closure, one way or another,''
said Doug Jones, the young U.S. attorney who has overseen the
reinvestigation of the bombing that killed four girls.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Cross, who was the pastor at 16th Street Baptist
Church when the dynamite detonated 37 years ago, said he felt
elated about the indictments. ``Perhaps this will bring closure,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what is closure, really? Is it a psychological phenomenon or
a political one or some melding of the two? Has the word become so
overused that it is all but meaningless? Can a judicial resolution
lessen the agony of the victims and families, or does it serve only
to revive pain that had long ago subsided?
</P>
<P>
   These questions are complicated, say psychiatrists, clergy and
those who have experienced grievous losses themselves. And science
has yet to reach many conclusions in what is a relatively young
field.
</P>
<P>
   But all across the world, from South Africa to Chile to
Mississippi to cities like New York that have built Holocaust
museums, the search for closure has become a driving force in
politics, law and culture.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, former President Nelson Mandela's government
made the remarkable choice of placing healing above vengeance _ and
some say justice _ by granting amnesty to thousands of apparatchiks
of the apartheid regime who agreed to testify before the country's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Chile's courts, encouraged by
the newly installed Socialist government, are pushing ahead with
the prosecution of the 84-year-old former dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet on charges he was involved in the kidnapping, murder and
torture of thousands of his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   In Neshoba County, Miss., officials are delving again into the
murders of three civil rights workers in 1964. Across the South,
authorities have reopened a number of decades-old cases that were
never adequately investigated because white police officers,
prosecutors, witnesses and jurors sympathized more with white
suspects than with black victims. The May 17 indictments of Thomas
E. Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry in the Birmingham bombing
were the latest example. Only one of the four men identified as
suspects, Robert Chambliss, was ever tried and that was 14 years
later; he died in prison in 1985.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The best-selling author in the world managed to ignore both the
sexual and the technological revolutions. She survived the whole of
the 20th century keeping her love scenes chaste and dictating her
work to a secretary.
</P>
<P>
   When Dame Barbara Cartland died last Sunday at the age of 98,
she had written 723 books. She earned a place in the Guinness Book
of World Records, with nearly a billion copies sold. And she had
become the answer to a Trivial Pursuit question, ``Who has the
longest entry in Who's Who?'' The full entry, which lists a
staggering array of titles, was once performed as a cabaret act.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring authors, take note: If you're planning to stay on top
of the best-seller list, your titles should turn heads. Cartland
replaced sex with ellipses, but she kept her covers provocative.
Judge for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cartland knew that readers of romance novels like to see the plight
of the central character revealed in the title _ especially if the
character is an anxious virgin or an emotionally unstable
aristocrat: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Virgin in Mayfair; A Virgin in Paris; The Mysterious
Maid-Servant; The Innocent Heiress; The Reluctant Bride; The
Frightened Bride; The Unpredictable Bride; The Wicked Marquis; The
Impetuous Duchess; The Marquis Who Hated Women; The Odious Duke.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Even Cartland's histories and biographies have extremely
evocative titles: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Outrageous Queen: A Biography of Christina of Sweden; Polly:
The Story of My Wonderful Mother; Metternich: The Passionate
Diplomat; The Private Life of Charles II: The Woman He Loved; The
Private Life of Elizabeth, Empress of Austria; The Scandalous Life
of King Carol.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Some of the better titles juxtapose animals and people, or
offer incongruous or distressing pairings: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Hell-Cat and the King; Diona and a Dalmation; The Prince and
the Pekinese; Ola and the Sea Wolf; Sex and the Teen-ager; The
Saint and the Sinner; Lucifer and the Angel; The Goddess and the
Gaiety Girl; The Passion and the Flower; The Duke and the
Preacher's Daughter; Pride and the Poor Princess; The Prude and the
Prodigal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; As the author of the ``I Love You'' virus recently learned,
anyone seeking a large readership should use the word love in a
title: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Love Is an Eagle; Love Is Innocent; Love and the Loathsome
Leopard; Love Holds the Cards; Love Climbs In; Love Has His Way;
Love Leaves at Midnight; Love Wins; Love Rules; Love is the Key;
Love at the Helm; Love to the Rescue; The Explosion of Love; The
Perfection of Love; The Windmill of Love; The Castle Made for Love;
A Rhapsody of Love; The Vibrations of Love; The Karma of Love; The
Twists and Turns of Love; Wish for Love; Love Under Fire; Love in
Hiding; Love in the Dark; Never Laugh at Love; Food for Love;
Recipes for Lovers; No Time for Love; In the Arms of Love; A
Portrait of Love; A Game of Love; A Dynasty of Love; A World of
Love; The Goddess of Love; A Gentleman in Love; The Dawn of Love;
The Wings of Love; The Drums of Love; The River of Love; The Fire
of Love; Signpost to Love; Moments of Love; Little White Doves of
Love; Elizabethan Lover; Barbara Cartland's Book of Love and
Lovers; Barbara Cartland's Etiquette for Love and Romance; The
Ghost Who Fell in Love.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Yes, human beings are such romantics they will even buy books
in which love might be the villain: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Love Is the Enemy; Love Is Contraband; Love for Sale; Love
Locked In; The Judgment of Love; The Many Facets of Love; No Escape
From Love, Punished With Love; Armour Against Love; Lies for Love;
The Wild Cry of Love; The Slaves of Love; The Cave of Love; A Game
of Love; The Love Pirate; The Love Trap; Conquered by Love; The
Prisoner of Love; A Fugitive From Love; The Problems of Love.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Titles lacking love may need heart: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Knave of Hearts; The Queen of Hearts; Women Have Hearts; The
Waltz of Hearts; A Duel of Hearts; The Captive Heart; The Smuggled
Heart; The Unknown Heart; The Hidden Heart; Call of the Heart,
Desire of the Heart; No Heart Is Free; A Sword to the Heart; The
Heart of the Clan; A Hazard of Hearts; The Chieftain Without a
Heart.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Some titles promise to unlock the mysteries of marriage and sex
roles, not to mention aphrodisiacs: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Men Are Wonderful; Woman, The Enigma; The Husband Hunters;
Living Together; Wanted: A Wedding Ring; The Wild Unwilling Wife; A
Very Unusual Wife; Bride to the King; The Incredible Honeymoon;
Romantic Royal Marriages; Husbands and Wives; Marriage for the
Moderns; Love, Life and Sex; Vitamins for Vitality; The Magic of
Honey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Astronomical references can give the book a nice, dreamy feel: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Touch the Stars: A Clue to Happiness; Count the Stars; Seek the
Stars; Touch a Star; A Runaway Star; Stars in My Heart; Stars in
Her Eyes; Terror in the Sun; Love in the Moon; Light of the Moon; A
Shaft of Sunlight, Pure and Untouched; Moon Over Eden; Riding to
the Moon; Love in the Clouds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A good sense of geography can help locate the characters and
orient the reader:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Paradise in Penang; Heaven in Hong Kong; Alone in Paris; Lovers
in Lisbon; Lovers in Paradise; Just Off Piccadilly; To Scotland and
Love; An Innocent in Russia; A Ghost in Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It's always smart to hint that you've got a secret or two: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Youth Secret; Secret Harbor; The Secret Fear; The Secret of
the Glen; Secret of the Mosque; Barbara Cartland's Book of Useless
Information.
</P>

   &UR; Book buyers, like everyone else, are fond of the supernatural: &LR;
</P>
<P>

Enchanting Evil; The Enchanted Waltz; Winged Magic; The Magic of
Love; Bewitched; Against This Rapture; Gift of the Gods; The Gods
Forget; Flowers for the God of Love; A Witch's Spell; Love Strikes
a Devil; The Kiss of the Devil; Stolen Halo; A Halo for the Devil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; When in doubt, use alliteration: &LR;

<P>
   Temptation for a Teacher; The Temptation of Torilla; Love, Lords
and Lady-Birds; Look Lovely, Be Lovely; The Golden Gondola; A Duel
of Jewels; A Kiss for the King; Fascinating Forties: A Book for the

<TEXT>
<P>
   The best-selling author in the world managed to ignore both the
sexual and the technological revolutions. She survived the whole of
the 20th century keeping her love scenes chaste and dictating her
work to a secretary.
</P>
<P>
   When Dame Barbara Cartland died last Sunday at the age of 98,
she had written 723 books. She earned a place in the Guinness Book
of World Records, with nearly a billion copies sold. And she had
become the answer to a Trivial Pursuit question, ``Who has the
longest entry in Who's Who?'' The full entry, which lists a
staggering array of titles, was once performed as a cabaret act.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring authors, take note: If you're planning to stay on top
of the best-seller list, your titles should turn heads. Cartland
replaced sex with ellipses, but she kept her covers provocative.
Judge for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cartland knew that readers of romance novels like to see the plight
of the central character revealed in the title _ especially if the
character is an anxious virgin or an emotionally unstable
aristocrat: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Virgin in Mayfair; A Virgin in Paris; The Mysterious
Maid-Servant; The Innocent Heiress; The Reluctant Bride; The
Frightened Bride; The Unpredictable Bride; The Wicked Marquis; The
Impetuous Duchess; The Marquis Who Hated Women; The Odious Duke.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Even Cartland's histories and biographies have extremely
evocative titles: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Outrageous Queen: A Biography of Christina of Sweden; Polly:
The Story of My Wonderful Mother; Metternich: The Passionate
Diplomat; The Private Life of Charles II: The Woman He Loved; The
Private Life of Elizabeth, Empress of Austria; The Scandalous Life
of King Carol.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Some of the better titles juxtapose animals and people, or
offer incongruous or distressing pairings: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Hell-Cat and the King; Diona and a Dalmation; The Prince and
the Pekinese; Ola and the Sea Wolf; Sex and the Teen-ager; The
Saint and the Sinner; Lucifer and the Angel; The Goddess and the
Gaiety Girl; The Passion and the Flower; The Duke and the
Preacher's Daughter; Pride and the Poor Princess; The Prude and the
Prodigal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; As the author of the ``I Love You'' virus recently learned,
anyone seeking a large readership should use the word love in a
title: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Love Is an Eagle; Love Is Innocent; Love and the Loathsome
Leopard; Love Holds the Cards; Love Climbs In; Love Has His Way;
Love Leaves at Midnight; Love Wins; Love Rules; Love is the Key;
Love at the Helm; Love to the Rescue; The Explosion of Love; The
Perfection of Love; The Windmill of Love; The Castle Made for Love;
A Rhapsody of Love; The Vibrations of Love; The Karma of Love; The
Twists and Turns of Love; Wish for Love; Love Under Fire; Love in
Hiding; Love in the Dark; Never Laugh at Love; Food for Love;
Recipes for Lovers; No Time for Love; In the Arms of Love; A
Portrait of Love; A Game of Love; A Dynasty of Love; A World of
Love; The Goddess of Love; A Gentleman in Love; The Dawn of Love;
The Wings of Love; The Drums of Love; The River of Love; The Fire
of Love; Signpost to Love; Moments of Love; Little White Doves of
Love; Elizabethan Lover; Barbara Cartland's Book of Love and
Lovers; Barbara Cartland's Etiquette for Love and Romance; The
Ghost Who Fell in Love.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Yes, human beings are such romantics they will even buy books
in which love might be the villain: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Love Is the Enemy; Love Is Contraband; Love for Sale; Love
Locked In; The Judgment of Love; The Many Facets of Love; No Escape
From Love, Punished With Love; Armour Against Love; Lies for Love;
The Wild Cry of Love; The Slaves of Love; The Cave of Love; A Game
of Love; The Love Pirate; The Love Trap; Conquered by Love; The
Prisoner of Love; A Fugitive From Love; The Problems of Love.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Titles lacking love may need heart: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Knave of Hearts; The Queen of Hearts; Women Have Hearts; The
Waltz of Hearts; A Duel of Hearts; The Captive Heart; The Smuggled
Heart; The Unknown Heart; The Hidden Heart; Call of the Heart,
Desire of the Heart; No Heart Is Free; A Sword to the Heart; The
Heart of the Clan; A Hazard of Hearts; The Chieftain Without a
Heart.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Some titles promise to unlock the mysteries of marriage and sex
roles, not to mention aphrodisiacs: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Men Are Wonderful; Woman, The Enigma; The Husband Hunters;
Living Together; Wanted: A Wedding Ring; The Wild Unwilling Wife; A
Very Unusual Wife; Bride to the King; The Incredible Honeymoon;
Romantic Royal Marriages; Husbands and Wives; Marriage for the
Moderns; Love, Life and Sex; Vitamins for Vitality; The Magic of

</P>
<P>
   Touch the Stars: A Clue to Happiness; Count the Stars; Seek the
Stars; Touch a Star; A Runaway Star; Stars in My Heart; Stars in
Her Eyes; Terror in the Sun; Love in the Moon; Light of the Moon; A
Shaft of Sunlight, Pure and Untouched; Moon Over Eden; Riding to
the Moon; Love in the Clouds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A good sense of geography can help locate the characters and
orient the reader:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Paradise in Penang; Heaven in Hong Kong; Alone in Paris; Lovers
in Lisbon; Lovers in Paradise; Just Off Piccadilly; To Scotland and
Love; An Innocent in Russia; A Ghost in Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It's always smart to hint that you've got a secret or two: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Youth Secret; Secret Harbor; The Secret Fear; The Secret of
the Glen; Secret of the Mosque; Barbara Cartland's Book of Useless
Information.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Book buyers, like everyone else, are fond of the supernatural: &LR;
</P>

Enchanting Evil; The Enchanted Waltz; Winged Magic; The Magic of
Love; Bewitched; Against This Rapture; Gift of the Gods; The Gods
Forget; Flowers for the God of Love; A Witch's Spell; Love Strikes
a Devil; The Kiss of the Devil; Stolen Halo; A Halo for the Devil.
</P>
<P>

COMMENTARY: MONEY FOR NOTHING? 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Economists don't usually make good speculators, because they
think too much. Like the famous if apocryphal professor who refused
to pick up a $100 bill, they tend to assume that if there were
money to be had, someone would already have taken it.
</P>
<P>
   However, caution that can be a liability on the trading floor is
an asset off it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the observant do spot opportunities for large,
risk-free gain _ $100 bills lying in the street _ that others have
somehow missed. But a wise man doesn't assume that such
opportunities will present themselves on a regular basis, and he
certainly doesn't use that assumption as a basis for his family
budget _ or his plan to save Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fact that historically stocks have been a very good
investment. The best-known demonstration of that fact comes from
Jeremy Siegel of the University of Pennsylvania, who has pointed
out _in his book ``Stocks for the Long Run'' _ that during the 20th
century anyone who was willing to buy and hold for long periods
would almost always have done better buying stocks than bonds. So
there wasn't a tradeoff between risk and return: Stocks were just a
better investment, period. It turns out that there was a $100 bill
lying on the sidewalk (quite a few billion bills, actually) that
for some reason nobody picked up.
</P>
<P>
   But many people have misunderstood what that observation means.
It doesn't say that there is some natural law guaranteeing that
stocks will always be a great investment; it says that historically
stocks have been underpriced. Investors weren't willing to pay as
much for claims on corporate earnings as they would have if they
had properly understood how low the risks were.
</P>
<P>
   And a funny thing happened on the way to the 21st century: The
price-earnings ratio _ the price of a dollar of corporate earnings
_ soared. In the period studied by Siegel, prices were on average
less than 15 times earnings, and stock investors on average earned
a real return of 7 percent. Nowadays the price-earnings ratio is on
average more like 30. Is this irrational exuberance, or did
investors finally absorb Siegel's lesson? Either way, that $100
bill has now been picked up. If stock investors now have to pay
twice as much as they used to for a claim on earnings, and if
profits grow in the future as they have in the past, those
investors should now expect to earn only half the historical rate
of return.
</P>
<P>
   And yet many of those offering plans to reform Social Security _
among them, of course, advisers to George W. Bush _ insist that
stocks are the answer, and that it is safe to assume that stocks
will keep on yielding 7 percent forever. And if you try to point
out that buying a piece of corporate America is much more expensive
than it used to be, they just repeat the mantra that stocks have
historically been a great investment. In other words, that $100
bill was there yesterday, so it must still be there, right?
</P>
<P>
   Is the odd susceptibility of first-rate economists to such a
naive fallacy a triumph of wishful thinking over analysis, or a
disingenuous bow to political expediency? Recent remarks by Bush
offer evidence of good old-fashioned American disingenuity at work.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 15 speech he asked his listeners to ``consider this
simple fact: even if a worker chose only the safest investment in
the world, an inflation-adjusted U.S. government bond, he or she
would receive twice the rate of return of Social Security.'' That's
an amazing fact; it's even more amazing when you realize that the
Social Security system invests all its money in, you guessed it,
U.S. government bonds. But the explanation _ which Bush's advisers
understand very well, even if the governor does not _ is that
today's workers are not only paying for their own retirement, but
also supporting today's retirees. And if you think that's a minor
detail _ that the question of how to meet existing obligations when
workers are allowed to invest their contributions elsewhere is a
side issue _ let me assure you that I too would have no trouble
devising a painless plan to save Social Security, if you let me
assume that a large part of the system's obligations would
magically disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe ``magic'' isn't quite the right word. How about
``voodoo''?

<P>
   Everyone knows America is a nation in a hurry _ especially the
makers of packaged foods. First there was the TV dinner. Then came
fast food for meals on the go. Now, with the pace of life
approaching warp speed, it's time for something marketers call
hyperconvenience food, portable comfort cuisine and dashboard
dining.
</P>
<P>
   In their continuing quest to trim the amount of time spent on
cooking and eating, packaged-food producers are streamlining every
aspect of dining _ shopping, preparation, the act itself and
cleanup. Supermarkets are clustering meal components near each
other to reduce the time spent wandering the aisles. Short-cuts
like prewashed, peeled vegetables are everywhere. Products like
yogurt that can be squeezed from a tube, snack bars that
theoretically nourish as completely as regular meals and scrambled
eggs in push-up containers are proliferating. And any food that can
be shaped to fit into automobile cup holders is considered to have
a great advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Whether fueled by time-pressed parents or unraveling family
life, ``convenience continues to dominate the food scene,'' said
John L. Stanton, a professor of food marketing at St. Joseph's
University in Philadelphia. ``People want to eat the right things
but when it comes to trading health for time, time wins.''
</P>
<P>
   At Pepsico, executives refer to hyperconvenience as a marketing
concept. ``It's accentuating the immediacy or the urgency of the
consumer,'' a company spokesman said. ``It is convenience to the
nth degree.''
</P>
<P>
   One source of inspiration is the military, which knows a thing
or two about feeding people on the march. Heater Meals of
Cincinnati has begun repackaging products for the general public
that it has long sold as army rations. Using technology tested over
and over in battle, the company offers meals like lasagna and
flame-broiled turkey in styrofoam containers that heat up when the
diner sets off a chemical reaction between a jigger of salt water
and a slab of iron and magnesium. The food is piping hot within 14
minutes, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got all kinds of markets, like truck drivers, the
National Guard and campers,'' said Derrick Wills, a marketing
assistant for Heater Meals. ``Natural disasters, too, when you need
a meal and don't have the resources to cook.'' Can overstressed
families be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Other marketers are eager to push convenience dining in new
directions. Witness the new McSalad Shaker from McDonald's. No need
to toss the salad with a couple of retro serving spoons: Just pour
the dressing over the salad in a plastic soda cup, cover the cup
with a rounded plastic top and shake the ensemble to distribute the
ingredients evenly. The container fits neatly into a car cup
holder, though people are expected to eat the salad with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Breakaway Foods of Bluebell, Pa., has shoehorned that old
standby, macaroni and cheese, into a microwaveable cardboard tube
with a push-up stick. The product, IncrEdibles, is hitting
supermarkets this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to be left behind, Frito-Lay has come up with Frito
corn chips in the same package with a portion of chili. ``With
snacking being a fourth meal, people are looking for fast fuel,''
said Lynn Markley, a Frito-Lay spokeswoman. ``These kits are the
ideal fuel for Americans on the go.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar line has been developed by the 7-Eleven convenience
store chain, which calls it ``dashboard dining.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the move toward utensil-less meals was inevitable, even
as it blurs the line between humans and animals. ``During the last
five years, there's been a real acceleration of food that is
designed to be eaten directly from the package,'' said Thomas Hine,
the author of ``The Total Package'' (Little, Brown, 1995), a study
of packaging trends and their impact on consumers. ``This is to add
an extra level of convenience that can be charged for. It's a way
of ratcheting up the profit margin.''
</P>
<P>
   In researching his book, Hine interviewed marketing consultants
who commissioned teen-agers to photograph their families. The
consultants found that people were frequently eating directly out
of boxes, bags or other containers. ``They discovered that an
extremely high percentage of food is eaten right out of the
package, whether the package was designed for that or not,'' Hine
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, teen-agers and other family members _ whether
because of schedules or dysfunction _ were shown eating meals at
different times, rather than sitting down to dinner together. In
Hine's latest book, ``The Rise and Fall of the American Teen-Ager''
(Avon), he concludes that the scattershot approach to the family
dinner hour is linked to social problems like drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such findings are music to the ears of food marketers'.
Robert Berman, the founder of Breakaway Foods, said his eureka
moment came while watching his 14-year-old daughter play with her
food. ``We were having dinner in an Italian restaurant, and she had
finished eating four or five bites of her spaghetti when she
started twirling it around her fork and holding it up in the air,''
he recalled. ``Then she started twirling it around a bread stick
and held it up. I started wondering if there was ever a portable
pasta. I did some research, and found that there hadn't been one in
3,000 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began the IncrEdibles line, which now includes scrambled
eggs (with or without sausage and bacon), as well as chili and a
healthier-sounding entry with broccoli mixed in with macaroni and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are constantly pressed for time and on the move,''
Berman said. ``When I was growing up in the '50s and '60s, my mom
made breakfast every day and the family sat down for dinner every
night. It's a very different pace we live today. Breakfast is
pretty much gone, as far as sitting down and eating. Lunch is on
the way out, and dinner is under attack.''

directions. Witness the new McSalad Shaker from McDonald's. No need
to toss the salad with a couple of retro serving spoons: Just pour
the dressing over the salad in a plastic soda cup, cover the cup
with a rounded plastic top and shake the ensemble to distribute the
ingredients evenly. The container fits neatly into a car cup
holder, though people are expected to eat the salad with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Breakaway Foods of Bluebell, Pa., has shoehorned that old
standby, macaroni and cheese, into a microwaveable cardboard tube
with a push-up stick. The product, IncrEdibles, is hitting
supermarkets this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to be left behind, Frito-Lay has come up with Frito
corn chips in the same package with a portion of chili. ``With
snacking being a fourth meal, people are looking for fast fuel,''
said Lynn Markley, a Frito-Lay spokeswoman. ``These kits are the
ideal fuel for Americans on the go.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar line has been developed by the 7-Eleven convenience
store chain, which calls it ``dashboard dining.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the move toward utensil-less meals was inevitable, even
as it blurs the line between humans and animals. ``During the last
five years, there's been a real acceleration of food that is
designed to be eaten directly from the package,'' said Thomas Hine,
the author of ``The Total Package'' (Little, Brown, 1995), a study
of packaging trends and their impact on consumers. ``This is to add
an extra level of convenience that can be charged for. It's a way
of ratcheting up the profit margin.''
</P>
<P>
   In researching his book, Hine interviewed marketing consultants
who commissioned teen-agers to photograph their families. The
consultants found that people were frequently eating directly out
of boxes, bags or other containers. ``They discovered that an
extremely high percentage of food is eaten right out of the
package, whether the package was designed for that or not,'' Hine
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, teen-agers and other family members _ whether
because of schedules or dysfunction _ were shown eating meals at
different times, rather than sitting down to dinner together. In
Hine's latest book, ``The Rise and Fall of the American Teen-Ager''
(Avon), he concludes that the scattershot approach to the family
dinner hour is linked to social problems like drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such findings are music to the ears of food marketers'.
Robert Berman, the founder of Breakaway Foods, said his eureka
moment came while watching his 14-year-old daughter play with her
food. ``We were having dinner in an Italian restaurant, and she had
finished eating four or five bites of her spaghetti when she
started twirling it around her fork and holding it up in the air,''
he recalled. ``Then she started twirling it around a bread stick
and held it up. I started wondering if there was ever a portable
pasta. I did some research, and found that there hadn't been one in
3,000 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began the IncrEdibles line, which now includes scrambled
eggs (with or without sausage and bacon), as well as chili and a
healthier-sounding entry with broccoli mixed in with macaroni and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are constantly pressed for time and on the move,''
Berman said. ``When I was growing up in the '50s and '60s, my mom
made breakfast every day and the family sat down for dinner every
night. It's a very different pace we live today. Breakfast is
pretty much gone, as far as sitting down and eating. Lunch is on
the way out, and dinner is under attack.''

   NEW YORK _ In a city aswarm with new restaurants clamoring for
recognition, the National Rifle Association managed to clear one
hurdle with ease. Back in May 2000, it caught the public's
attention by announcing plans to open a theme restaurant, the NRA
Sports Grille, in Times Square. Now, a year later, for the second
hurdle: Can it win the hearts, minds and, most important, the
stomachs of a gun-shy city eaters?
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Sports Grille will give them plenty to talk
about. Diners used to passing a velvet-rope barrier now face a new
obstacle: a metal detector that identifies patrons who have
forgotten to bring a sidearm. Once issued with a loaner, the diners
may want to stop for a Ruby Ridge cocktail at the Minuteman Bar, or
proceed straight to the Charlton Heston Room, a soaring space
decorated with stills from the actor's finest performances,
although one, from ``The Ten Commandments,'' seems to be an outtake
(I am certain that the stone tablets never referred to the right to
bear arms).
</P>
<P>
   The menu at the Sports Grille, billed as ``110 percent American
cuisine,'' relies heavily on game, and here diners need to exercise
caution. It is one thing to pick your way through the buckshot in a
Scottish grouse, and quite another to work your way around the
bullets from an AK-47 assault rifle. But it's a small price to pay
for authenticity. Most dishes on the menu are identified not only
by place of origin, but also by manner of death. My Texas antelope,
for example, was brought down at 1,500 feet by Edward ``Buddy''
Barnes, using a Weatherby MarkV Super VarmintMaster. It was tender
and flavorful, so fresh it was nearly twitching. A hefty slab of
Montana elk, however, had a distinctly metallic taste, not
surprising considering that the animal was picked off from a
helicopter by five men wielding Uzis.
</P>
<P>
   At Sports Grille, diners learn that shooting fish in a barrel is
no mere expression. The management, seeing the runaway success of
Greek restaurants in which customers personally pick out their fish
for dinner, have gone the extra step, and allowed customers to
choose a fish and then finish it off. It does add a certain thrill
to the meal. Salmon may be fighters, but I can tell you that one
Teflon-coated bullet from a Smith and Wesson Baby Sigma makes them
fold up pretty quickly. Although the emphasis is on meat dishes, I
found the fish to be first rate at the Sports Grille, and I can
particularly recommend the subtle and intriguing Congressional
Special: weakfish prepared tableside, where an NRA lobbyist removes
the backbone with no difficulty whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   The Sports Grille is a cheery, high-energy restaurant, although
conversation is made difficult by a soundtrack booming out
inspirational messages from the NRA executive vice president, Wayne
LaPierre, against a background of small-arms fire.
</P>
<P>
   Tipping is also a problem. How do you leave less than 20 percent
to a waiter in camouflage gear carrying a Glock 9-millimeter pistol
and 1,000 rounds of ammunition?
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I take that for you?'' my server asked, reaching for my
credit card. I snatched it back and said, smiling, ``The only way
you'll get is it to pry it from my cold, dead fingers.'' He didn't
laugh. In fact, his eyes narrowed, and I can swear I saw his hand
move toward his gun.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of place. &QL;

<P>
   For 18 years, the blue and white Star of David snapped over the
crumbling ramparts of Beaufort Castle, the Crusader stronghold
commanding the folding ravines and abrupt gullies that twist
through southern Lebanon and northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th century fortress has endured as a symbol of power, for
whoever ruled its battlements could rain destruction in any
direction.
</P>
<P>
   But in the two decades since Israel invaded Lebanon to dislodge
the Palestinians, such direct power has proved elusive in the
rugged southern Lebanese countryside. For all its physical presence
in the south, Israel was unable to ever bring the region completely
to heel. So now it has taken a grand gamble: that by simply leaving
southern Lebanon _ and, at least for now, turning it over to
Israel's bitterest enemies _ it will be better positioned to pursue
a broader strategic peace.
</P>
<P>
   And on its northern border, the linchpin of that peace is not in
Lebanon's small villages and rocky hills at all, but 40 miles away,
in Damascus, Syria, the capital from which Israel assumes the
Islamic guerrillas of Hezbollah can be controlled _ or set loose.
It is Syria, after all, whose 35,000 troops have not relinquished a
military embrace of Lebanon that dates from the Lebanese civil war
in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Israel has withdrawn completely from Lebanese territory,
then it is on a much higher political ground to justify retaliation
for any attacks because it is no longer occupying foreign
territory,'' said Edward Djerejian, a former American ambassador to
Syria and Israel. ``They are truly protecting their international
border from within.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak has threatened to unleash Israel's
full might against Syria in retaliation for any cross-border
violence. ``Now a new dynamic is at work,'' said Itamar Rabinovich,
who was Israel's chief negotiator with Syria from 1992 to 1996
while he was ambassador to Washington. When Israeli troops were in
Lebanon, he said, the force served as insulation _ a punching bag
that Syria could hit just by giving a nod to Hezbollah. ``Everybody
knew that the Syrians were indirectly responsible or encouraged the
attacks, but they were not directly responsible,'' he said. ``Now
there is a real danger that any attack on Israel proper would lead
to a full collision between Israel and Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   When Israel captured Beaufort Castle from the Palestinians in
1982, the architect of the invasion, Ariel Sharon, told Israeli
reporters that the castle had been taken without a single casualty.
A young lieutenant stepped forward to say that actually six men
were killed. It was an early portent that the cost of keeping an
army in Lebanon would prove far higher than anticipated.
Ultimately, Israel lost more than 900 men _ the last at Beaufort
Castle on Feb. 11. Lebanese casualties were in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But all that bloodshed left little imprint on the larger issues
of peace with Syria. Despite all the fighting between proxies, the
main issue _ control of the Golan Heights _ simply wasn't
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has kept its own border with Israel quiet since 1974, and
a big Israeli hope is, obviously, that Damascus might keep Lebanon
equally calm now in hopes of regaining the Golan Heights. Also,
with an impending transition of power from President Hafez Assad to
his son, Syria may well not want a new fight.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Syria's status as Lebanon's puppeteer has just
become harder to justify with the Israeli occupation over. Still,
the Syrians have said a struggle against Israel must continue as
long as issues like the future of Palestinian refugees in Syria and
Lebanon remain unresolved. And that touches on one of the most
problematic aspects of the Israeli gamble: In the Middle East it is
impossible to dismiss the ability of any one fringe group to ignite
the center.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most prominent flags replacing the Star of David at
Beaufort is yellow, with a fist hoisting a rifle over broad green
Arabic letters spelling Hezbollah. This militia, with its strong
ties to Syria and Iran, didn't even exist in 1982. Israel invaded
Lebanon that year to eliminate the Palestinian movements then
headquartered there and to install a puppet Christian government in
Beirut. At first, southern Lebanon's Shiites, weary of the
Palestinians' state within a state, welcomed the Israelis. But when
Israel too proved highhanded, Shiite resentment blossomed.
Hezbollah was born of a twin desire to drive out the Israelis and
to gain some say in governing the Shiites' own land.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hezbollah represents the largest question hanging over the
abrupt Israeli departure: whether, in the absence of any other
force, it will bring quiet or will try to transfer the war of
attrition across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has long been opaque about its intentions. Its rise
was engineered in part by Iran, and those ties remain close; Iran's
foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, breezily swept through southern
Lebanon last week. Still, Iran's most committed radicals are in a
power struggle at home and may not want to meddle.
</P>
<P>
   How completely Iran or Syria can direct Hezbollah has always
been unclear anyway. Now that the group has mastery of the south,
there is an obvious temptation to feel a strong sense of autonomy.
``They have something to defend now,'' said Prof. Nubar Hovsepian,
the assistant director of Middle East studies at Rutgers
University. ``They are part of the Lebanese equation, not just a
marginal presence. They have a stake in getting resources to build
up the area of the country where the Shiite have a majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Lebanon has long been poor and neglected. Hezbollah
succeeded in no small part by providing services in the area it
controlled, and now that area has been vastly enlarged.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah also controls a few seats in Parliament, but far fewer
than the older, more established Shiite party, Amal. Amal, too,
lofted their flag above Beaufort last week. But it was the calm,
methodical way in which Hezbollah exerted control over the south
that was being most closely watched for a sign of how peace _ or
new war _ might proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the original Crusaders who controlled Beaufort, Reynald of
Sidon was known for charming Saladin, the most powerful regional
military commander in the late 1100s. Reynald often used the front
of extended peace talks to buy time to strengthen the castle's
fortifications. Eventually Saladin tired of the game and laid siege
until the place surrendered. It has been changing hands _ and
defying the ambitions of conquerors _ ever since.

   The television screen snaps into focus on a Tel Aviv army
recruitment office in 2015, where a strapping Israeli raised in the
United States has come home for his military service. ``I'm here to
defend my country,'' he says, resonating with classic Zionist
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The officer he faces has flowers in his shoulder-length hair and
a glazed look in his eyes. ``Why do you want a gun?'' he asks.
``Guns are dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To defend my country against the Syrians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with the Syrians?'' asks a second officer wearing
bellbottoms and a peace medallion. ``My wife is Syrian.''
</P>
<P>
   The sketch, on the Israeli equivalent of ``Saturday Night
Live,'' mocks a future Israel at peace. And while the notion may
amuse the hip north Tel Avivians who wrote and performed the
sketch, it is no joking matter to others in Israel. They fear that
peace will mean an obliteration of the Jewish state through a slow
refusal to engage the enemy, a lowered guard and intermarriage.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's images of Israeli soldiers retreating from Lebanon
as Muslim guerrillas declared victory, and the prospect of yielding
more West Bank land to the Palestinians amid threats of unrest,
have made that fear the focus of growing anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some Israelis say the future is already here, that their
nation, steeped now in consumerism and cable television, is nearly
drained of the shared, antimaterialist conviction on which it has
survived. While most hope that by yielding land and ending
occupation they are sowing further peace and prosperity, some also
fear that therein lie the seeds of self-destruction _ that the
young will lose their commitment to defense.
</P>
<P>
   It is that anxiety that underlies the ferocity of another
national debate, over new histories of Zionism and changes in the
school curriculum. These revise the standard Zionist self-image _
the righteous, selfless pioneer _ in favor of a more complicated
and less heroic one. They portray early Zionists both as humans
drawn into war's inhumanity, and as European colonialists.
</P>
<P>
   This fight is in the background as Israel stakes out a new
strategy for confronting Syria and Lebanon; it illustrates a deep
internal conflict over whether Israelis today see themselves as
having a special mission or, after centuries of discrimination,
should only seek ``normality.'' And it raises the question of how
Israel measures up morally and politically against its neighbors.
The new scholarship assumes that Israel shares the blame for the
conflict with its adversaries and should come to terms with them as
moral and cultural equals.
</P>
<P>
   The contested revisionism, known as ``new history,'' presents
evidence of deliberate mistreatment and expulsion of Palestinians
as well as efforts to block diplomatic arrangements with the
surrounding states while publicly proclaiming a thirst for peace.
To the new historians, Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon and
its use of a proxy militia there were a continuation of a
disastrous policy that dismissed Arabs as either peasants or
mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to co-opt the locals and punish those who failed to play
along were part of a pattern that emerged before the state was
established in 1948, it is argued. Evidence of early misdeeds began
piling up from newly-opened state archives in the 1980s. When
published, the revelations were controversial. But it was the
addition of such notions to ninth grade textbooks this past year
that created a storm. Some Israelis say that teaching the young
about early Zionist sins is the start of mass suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Hillel Halkin, a writer and translator, lamented in a recent
issue of Commentary magazine that the textbook changes are ``a
process of numbing and emotional divorce'' that, in effect, invites
students to decide whether Jews or Arabs have a stronger claim on
the land'' and saps Israel's ability to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jews of Israel are an exhausted people, confused and
without direction,'' writes Yoram Hazony, a young, conservative
Israeli analyst whose new book is called ``The Jewish State: The
Struggle for Israel's Soul.'' (Basic Books). In the book Hazony
assails not only the new history but the growing intellectual and
political movement in Israel that is broadly known as
``post-Zionism.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, post-Zionism asserts that the task of saving the
world's Jews by bringing them to their homeland and making it
secure is now complete. At the same time, about a sixth of Israel's
citizens are not Jewish either because they are Arabs or
not-fully-Jewish refugees from the former Soviet Union. The
post-Zionist conclusion is that Israel should reduce or end its
Jewish character, changing its identity from ``the Jewish state''
to a state of all its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   This alarms Hazony, who says that the devotion to land and
Jewish nationalism that characterized his parents' generation is
hard to find today.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle between old-style Zionists and the post-Zionists
is, ultimately, a battle over individualism in a society that
spurned it for so long. Anyone who visited Israel in the late 1960s
will recall the smug superiority of a nation nearly without drugs,
crime or disaffected young people, where the young were outfitted
in scouting uniforms and hiking the wilderness, vying for top jobs
in the air force.
</P>
<P>
   Today Israel has dozens of cable channels and a choice of
consumer goods to rival any Western country. It has the largest
number of Nasdaq-traded companies outside the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Some young Israelis are beginning to see their nation as just
one among many and the new history only confirms that.
</P>
<P>
   For liberals, the shift in history teaching is welcome news and
a necessary preface to peace because it fosters the growth of
individualism, which they see as a vital check on group
coerciveness. In other words, they say, by freeing Israel of a
single self-congratulatory narrative, the new historians and
post-Zionists have offered freedom from what Yaron Ezrahi, an
Israeli political scientist, calls ``the tyranny of supposedly
shared meaning.'' When one's heros are reexamined and understood to
suffer from weakness and even inhumanity, one's adversaries become
less menacing. They, too, are only human. With that understood,
they say, negotiation is easier.
</P>
<P>
   As the curriculum shift and the Lebanon retreat make evident,
Israel's liberals are winning the struggle over how to cast the
national narrative. It remains to be seen whether they can get the
promised peace.

<P>
   In a court filing last week Microsoft called the government's
proposal to break the company in two ``the antitrust equivalent of
the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyerly hyperbole, it seems, but in the old days _ the very old
days _ antitrust offenders couldn't afford to take any chances. In
388-386 B.C., a group of Athenian grain dealers formed a corn
monopoly and manipulated prices, according to research by Spencer
Weber Waller, a professor at the Brooklyn Law School. The dealers
were caught, prosecuted and put to death.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the issue of the appropriate punishment in antitrust
cases has been a conundrum, if not a lethal one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kill companies occasionally, but we've never killed any
people with antitrust enforcement in America,'' said Herbert
Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust is a flexible doctrine intended to prohibit
``anticompetitive behavior'' _ a concept whose definition shifts
according to the economic and political thinking of the day. So the
remedial steps, too, have varied widely over the years.
</P>
<P>
   There are two broad approaches: ``structural'' remedies, which
involve breaking up the offending company; and ``conduct''
remedies, which involve prohibiting certain kinds of corporate
behavior, like threatening rivals or writing contracts that
restrict competition.
</P>
<P>
   Both approaches have drawbacks. Breaking up a company is
drastic, irrevocable and runs the risk of doing more harm than
good. Restraints on a company's behavior can be easily sidestepped,
may do little to curb its market power and may require constant
policing by a court or government.
</P>
<P>
   In the Microsoft case, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson appears to
be seriously weighing a breakup of the company. In his court in
Washington last Wednesday, Jackson pointedly asked the government
why it did not go even further and recommend breaking up Microsoft
into three companies instead of just two. The judge may issue his
remedies order as soon as this week, but no matter what he decides,
Microsoft will appeal both his sanctions and his legal ruling,
which found the company to be a monopolist that used its market
power to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   The track record of antitrust remedies is decidedly mixed, even
humbling. For decades, from Standard Oil in 1911 through United
Shoe Machinery in 1968, the courts tended to look approvingly on
structural remedies, says Hovenkamp, editor of the 18-volume
treatise ``Antitrust Law,'' begun in 1978 by Philip Areeda of the
Harvard Law School, who died in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   United Shoe Machinery is the classic cautionary tale for
skeptics of the structural approach. The government sued the
company and in 1953 a district court in Boston found that it had
violated the law but declined to break it up. In his opinion, Judge
Charles Wyzanski explained that federal judges are not experts in
economics or politics and ``their prophecies as to the economic
future are not guided by unusually subtle judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, the government asked the Supreme Court to modify
Wyzanski's remedies order so that United Shoe could be broken up.
In 1968, the Supreme Court agreed with the government and United
Shoe was split up, even though United Shoe's share of the
shoe-making machinery market declined from 85 percent to 48 percent
between 1953 and 1968.
</P>
<P>
   United Shoe eventually collapsed, though the role of the
government's misguided ministrations is unclear. Among antitrust
scholars, however, ``A lot of people who have studied it since
believe that the courts got it wrong,'' Hovenkamp observed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but 1968 was the height of the ``big is bad'' bias
against business and for the notion that government should step in
to restrain corporate power. That changed by the late 1970s, as
international rivals began to challenge America companies and as
free-market academics, led by University of Chicago theorists,
influenced antitrust thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The courts, in general, have been skittish about splitting up
companies in antitrust cases since the 1980s. A qualified exception
was the AT&AMP;T breakup in 1984, but that was unusual, a consent
decree applied to a government-sanctioned monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts say the structural approach to antitrust
remedies is gaining renewed respect. One reason, they say, is that
the consent decree the Justice Department signed with Microsoft in
1994 is widely seen as a failure.
</P>
<P>
   The decree, antitrust experts say, was a backward-looking remedy
that did little to restrain Microsoft's market power in an industry
moving ahead at a rapid clip. ``The government was shooting at a
moving target, and it aimed, shot and missed,'' noted William
Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University law
school.
</P>
<P>
   The cases in which breakup remedies will now receive serious
consideration by the courts, according to antitrust experts,
involve ``durable'' monopolies (at least five years old) for which
there is ``no reasonable prospect'' that the market will become
competitive unless the monopolist is split up.
</P>
<P>
   So much for theory. In the Microsoft case, what are the chances
that the company will be broken up after all the appeals are over?
A straw poll of six antitrust scholars who are not affiliated with
either side in the case rated that probability at 20 percent to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, all six wanted to do their handicapping
anonymously. There have been too many surprises already, they say,
in the antitrust soap opera formally known as the United States of
America vs. the Microsoft Corp.

   BERLIN _ Journalism, it is said, provides a first draft of
history. It is a cliche, yet sometimes an unlikely combination of
war and a witness illustrates the hallowed truth that lurks behind
a hollow phrase. I write this sitting in Berlin, dreaming of
Bosnia, and thinking of Kurt Schork, the Reuters correspondent
whose dispatches from Sarajevo helped shape the world's view of a
war that was as morally indelible to my generation of
correspondents as Vietnam was to another.
</P>
<P>
   Schork, 53, was killed on Wednesday in an ambush in Sierra
Leone. A dispatch from his news agency described the scene: the
armed men in T-shirts bursting out from behind a bank on a dusty
road 50 miles from Freetown, the volley of automatic-rifle fire, a
bullet through Schork's head. Another quick, senseless death of a
foreign correspondent: What more is there to say?
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, more must be said. For in nobody else did the
conflicts of the first post-Cold War decade find a witness so
driven or so able to write the accounts on which history will draw.
With vivid declarative sentences this American journalist hammered
out the discomfiting truths of a bloody decade. Lucidity of mind
and economy of expression combined to penetrating journalistic
effect.
</P>
<P>
   I knew him in Sarajevo, a besieged city I covered for two years
as a correspondent for The New York Times. Schork, compact,
bespectacled, precise and insatiable, had a passion for truth and a
gift for evoking it that made him a Bosnian reference. Wherever the
postmodern wars of fractured or disintegrating states broke out _
Afghanistan, Chechnya, northern Iraq, Kosovo and finally Sierra
Leone _ he was to be found. I believe he intuited, earlier than
anyone, that the pieties of the new world order, postulating a
Western triumph and even the end of history, were largely empty.
What he saw, in his remorseless way, was that the end of the
superpower confrontation had in fact unleashed a new violence, and
that the killing would pose an unavoidable challenge to supposedly
victorious Western values.
</P>
<P>
   For a deep moral conviction guided this unusual newsman, who
came to journalism late after a career that included running Bill
Bradley's first Senate campaign. It backed his stubborn belief that
his words would ultimately count and perhaps even right wrong. The
truth is, he changed things, and with his death an era has passed:
that of a gradual awakening to the fact that distant war and
genocide could not be ignored by America and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   When Yugoslavia began its protracted disintegration in 1991,
precipitating the latest round of Balkan wars, the West's instincts
were those of Neville Chamberlain on Czechoslovakia in 1938: These
were conflicts ``in a faraway country'' involving people ``of whom
we know nothing.'' Not knowing amounted to the best excuse for not
acting, especially when the imperative to do something was
accentuated by the daily Serb bombardment of Sarajevo that began in
1992 and by an archipelago of Serbian concentration camps for
Bosnian Muslims uncovered that year. Schork was driven by a desire
to ensure that nobody could claim ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   In these days of databank journalism and infotainment as news,
he wrote what the great war correspondent Martha Gellhorn famously
called ``the view from the ground.'' In so doing, he brought
journalists back to the basics: to see, to listen, to remain, to
reflect, to report. His copy was so lapidary that the oft-repeated
claims of muddle in Western capitals _ the repetitive talk of
1,000-year-old conflicts between indistinguishable Balkan tribes _
became largely preposterous in the gleam of Schork's clear-eyed
observation.
</P>
<P>
   Here, at the beginning of one of his best-known dispatches, so
descriptive of the ideological insanity unleashed, is Schork on the
killing of a Serb man and a Muslim woman, both 25, joined by love
but hounded by the politics of ethnic hatred: ``Two lovers lie dead
on the banks of Sarajevo's Miljacka River, locked in a final
embrace. For four days they have sprawled near Vrbanja bridge in a
wasteland of shell-blasted rubble, downed tree branches and
dangling power lines.'' He continued: ``Bosko is face-down on the
pavement, right arm bent awkwardly behind him. Admira lies next to
her lover, left arm across his back.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his fierce competitiveness, Schork could never hide an
overriding humanity, which once impelled him to drop his notebook
and rescue Sarajevans as Serbian shells fell on a funeral. It was
this combination of professionalism and moral clarity that made him
a beacon for many journalists seeking to untangle the wars of
recent years. And what could have been more important, for these
conflicts have already involved two genocides _ in Rwanda and
Bosnia _ and the death of more people in European violence than in
the entire 44-year Cold War era?
</P>
<P>
   These facts have only recently moved toward the center of
political consciousness, spurring the West's first ``humanitarian
war'' in Kosovo, intensifying its diplomatic quest to quiet the
killing fields of Africa. Schork's work must take a large share of
credit. As Hannah Arendt observed of acts of courage that may seem
futile in the light of early death: ``The holes of oblivion do not
exist. Nothing human is that perfect and there are simply too many
people in the world to make oblivion possible. Hence nothing can
ever be practically useless, at least not in the long run.'' No
other journalist I know did so much in recent years that will
resist oblivion.

<P>
   BERLIN _ A close aide to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was
recently astounded to find a Cabinet meeting devoted to the
divisive issue of child custody in German-American relations.
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer weighed in; so did Schroeder
himself. There was much agonizing as they reviewed the family
difficulties of Lady Catherine Meyer, who is the wife of the
British ambassador to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the new trans-Atlantic relationship, one that is
bereft of an overarching mission yet so intimate that issues long
considered domestic or secondary become major irritants. Lady Meyer
has two sons from a previous marriage to a German doctor. The boys
live in Germany with their father. Because of the vagaries of
German custody laws, the children have had limited access to their
mother, who is indignant. President Clinton, moved by this and
other similar cases, is expected to raise the issue during a visit
to Germany this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War, whose heart was in Germany, has been over for a
decade, and the big questions _ Euromissiles, Soviet divisions,
global peace itself _ have disappeared from Washington's relations
with Berlin and other European capitals. Beyond the intermittent
flaring of Balkan crises, their place has largely been taken by
genetically altered food, banana trade, the death penalty and even
child custody. America's apparent determination to build a national
missile defense system could still spur a major confrontation with
Russia that would be deeply troubling to Washington's European
allies. But, in general, how to live, what to eat and whether to
accept the death sentence seem to have become the stuff of
trans-Atlantic tiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The recurrent rows over such questions are sometimes viewed as a
sign of the fraying ties between Western Europe and the United
States. A voguish band of French intellectuals predict a coming
clash with the all-devouring, all-knowing ``hyperpower.'' But there
is another way of looking at these issues, many of which are
essentially moral. Their prominence demonstrates the unprecedented
closeness of European and American societies linked through
business and cultural bonds intensified over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we now have with the United States is a relationship so
close that it is quasi-domestic,'' said Karsten Voigt, a senior
German foreign ministry official. ``The distinction between foreign
and domestic policy has blurred as our societies have interwoven.
That is why emotional issues like genetically altered food or the
way we treat the children of international divorces rise to the
surface. In a way, foreign policy was easier when it dealt with
interests rather than emotions and morals.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions being what they are, discussion of the new issues can
get heated. An overwhelming majority of Germans consider the death
penalty as unconscionable as the slave trade. Lady Meyer and others
see Germany's child custody laws as barbaric.
</P>
<P>
   But Europeans and Americans are now divided by how they run
their domestic societies even as they are bound by a shared
international goal: enlarging the areas of the world with a
functioning market economy governed by the rule of law. Such
enlargement, in turn, opens new avenues to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressures on all advanced nations are similar in the
global economy,'' said Sidney Blumenthal, an adviser to President
Clinton. ``So what we find ourselves discussing are values _ how
open we should be to immigration, how to educate people for an
information society.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, divisions of substance do persist. President Clinton
will hear much criticism in Europe of the proposed national missile
defense system, which European governments view as a risky recourse
to an unproven system against an unproven enemy _ so-called rogue
states like North Korea whose inclination or ability to attack the
United States is doubted here. Many European officials are not
happy about the new isolationism they see in the House of
Representatives, which tried to end the deployment of American
peacekeepers in Kosovo. Europeans are uncertain about the American
view of the old continent's determination to forge a more united
Europe with its own credible military force; they also wonder what
America thinks of a European federation _ a kind of United States
of Europe _ suggested as a long-term aim by Fischer, the foreign
minister, this month.
</P>
<P>
   But even these issues seem to be about preserving a bond, and
not about confrontation. True, the French argue for the euro or a
proposed European rapid-reaction force as means to counterbalance
the United States, but such talk is de rigueur. As Karl Kaiser, a
German political scientist, noted, ``The first to scream if
American troops upped and left Germany would be the French, because
of their lingering fears of German hegemony.''
</P>
<P>
   At a profound level, America has become an essential European
power. Hence the concern here over possible isolationism and a
missile system that poses the question: what happens when Americans
have protected themselves and their European allies are sitting
ducks? ``Our militaries have gotten in the habit of working
together and that gives us something people don't want to give
up,'' said John Roper, a British security expert. ``So problems
will be finessed.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt they will. For in some senses, the deepest concern of
European governments today is that the United States is not paying
Europe enough attention. ``Americans think Europe's problems are
largely solved,'' said John Kornblum, the American ambassador to
Germany. ``They are not thinking about the structures of Europe any
more, they are thinking about why they can't sell their beef.
Europeans, however, see themselves at a critical and rather
treacherous juncture and would like America to pay more
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   At that juncture stands the question of what ``Europe'' should
be. The continent is at a crossroads. It feels a historic
obligation to expand the 15-member European Union to include the
former Communist states of Eastern Europe, but fears hordes of poor
immigrants pouring in. It knows that this larger union would become
ungovernable unless moves begin toward Fischer's federative United
States of Europe, but the end of the nation state in places like
France or Britain is a deeply divisive idea.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in these intra-European differences, the most painful and
substantive clashes of the coming months and years may well emerge.
Meanwhile, Europe and the United States, ever closer, will bicker
over Texan executions and the fate of children whose mothers and
fathers separated.  &QL;

<P>
   MIAMI BEACH _ The soft drink sat untouched, cold, sweet and
inviting. Tabitha Flores, a part-time swimsuit model, stared at the
sweating can as if it were a serpent trying to lure her from the
Garden of Eden.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred and twenty calories,'' Flores said, ``will kill
you here.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores, sitting in a consultation room in her plastic surgeon's
opulent office, lives and plays here in South Beach. She feels she
must be beautiful _ svelte, taut, curvaceous, tanned and
expensively styled _ to belong in this community where striking
beauty is commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   She had asked for a diet soda, but the sugary kind was all her
doctor had. ``This Pepsi,'' she said, flashing a smile of perfect,
recently bleached teeth, ``could ruin my weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   South Beach is utterly absorbed by beauty, peopled with fashion
models and dreamers and others who just like moving about a place
where bartenders pose like Grecian statues, cafe hostesses are
achingly lovely, and waiters and waitresses sway blank-faced
between tables as if on an invisible catwalk _ as if the ghost of

   The southernmost tip of the city of Miami Beach, South Beach is
home to several of the country's top-tier modeling agencies. This
naturally draws beautiful people _ of all colors, straight and gay
_ to this fanciful place of pastel Art Deco hotels, emerald ocean
and chic, throbbing nightclubs where the unpretty, uncool and
unfashionable are unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Beach is Babylon,'' said Flores, who is also vice
president of a marketing company. She is aware, she stressed, of
the shallowness of it, of the kind of society this culture of
beauty creates. But like so many other people here, she loves
walking out into it, competing, posing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a cultural fixation on beauty here,'' said Scott
Schieman, assistant professor of sociology at the University of
Miami. ``It's currency,'' he said, and it determines someone's
worth in the eyes of the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the number of aspiring models who make the
culture of beauty so complete here. Only a fraction of beautiful
people actually make a living from their looks, from fashion
shoots, cosmetics advertisements and runway jobs, say experts on
the fashion industry. Yet, many live the life.
</P>
<P>
   They hold firm to the ritual of cosmetic surgeries, marathon
workouts, endless dieting and scientific tanning, perpetuating a
society based on looks: on high cheekbones, perfectly rounded
breasts, sharply chiseled muscles, tiny waists and the latest fine
Italian anything. Here, a plain-looking person can stand out like a
pair of hip waders in a Victoria's Secret catalog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear snakeskin, something showing a lot of skin, very low
cut, and a drop-dead pair of stilettos,'' Flores said of her
typical weekend outfit. ``It's a costume party out there. It isn't
real life.''
</P>
<P>
   She is 5-foot-4, 112 pounds, with a 26-inch waist. She recently
had her breasts augmented to a 34-C. ``You want to be looked at,''
she said. ``Here, when people look at you, you're doing pretty
well.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the men entrusted with keeping the Beach beautiful is
Baruch Jacobs, a 43-year-old cosmetic surgeon who has augmented
some of its better-known bodies. There is little stigma attached to
it here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a patient who ordered a breast enlargement,'' Jacobs
said. ``A few days before she was set for the enlargement, she
decided not to. The modeling contract requested she not enlarge.''
She went ahead and bought the implants, and kept them until her
two-year contract was over, he said.

   The difference between South Beach and other magnets for beauty
_ like Los Angeles _ is the sheer concentration of it, some fashion
industry experts said. South Beach is less than a mile long and a
mile wide but draws beauty from all over the United States, Europe
and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have prettied-up the landscape,'' said Jason D.
Christenson, director at Wilhelmina Miami, a modeling agency here.
</P>
<P>
   It is also different from Los Angeles in the pure premium placed
on looks. In Los Angeles, movies and television are a dream. Here,
muscles are more valuable than remembering lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hollywood the waiters want to be actors,'' said Barbara
Neumann, who heads the men's division at Ford Modeling Agency on
South Beach. ``Here, they want to be models.''

<P>
   On a sweltering Saturday afternoon stretching into balmy
evening, the main drag, Ocean Drive, may be the most beautiful
place on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the buildings, or even the wide beach, where dingy
sand is specked with cigarette butts and shreds of trash.
</P>
<P>
   The people are the view.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtakingly beautiful women, bursting out of bathing suits
that seem made of only slightly more cotton than that in an aspirin
bottle, parade past the sidewalk cafes, and bored young men in $400
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana sunglasses do not even look up from $20 croissants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wear J. Crew here, you look like a nun,'' Flores said.

<P>
   Marlboro might be America's brand, but here women hold Gauloises
in languid, manicured fingers. Three men, all of whom have shaved
the hair from their chests, argue in French. Yellow Ferraris prowl
by.
</P>
<P>
   On the beach itself, men and women, much too European in their
fashion sense to wear anything except black thongs, tan for hours,
ignoring the puffy, pedestrian tourists and a few families with
children who provide contrast for the cosmetically perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes them so beautiful is being beside people who are
not so beautiful,'' Christenson said.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell, Vladimir Leiva stood on the sidewalk, passing out
cards to promote a restaurant. He is so good-looking that, when
women pass him, they go, ``Ooooohhhhhh.''
</P>
<P>
   His tan is dark and his muscles strain at a tight black shirt.
His hair, the color of ink, is slicked back from a sharply defined
face. He seems to have overdone his cologne, but here, too much is
often barely enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a fashion show,'' Leiva said, looking out on the
evening parade of people on Ocean Drive. ``I do it for myself,'' he
said of his body, wardrobe and persona. ``Beauty, image, counts a
lot. There's a lot of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiva is not a model but a clothing importer and exporter who
doubles at night as a promoter at Casa Salsa, a restaurant owned by
Ricky Martin, the Puerto Rican pop singer and Latin sex symbol.
Like many people here, Leiva talks about the dangers of ``getting
lost'' in the superficiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a lot of people using people,'' he said. ``The models
come with nothing, and they're trying to make it so big. They'll do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It creates an odd social dynamic. South Beach is as much about
money as beauty, yet striking people who yearn for glamorous lives
work in low-paying jobs to survive. Still, one cannot seem poor, or
the casting calls may never come.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends would buy $300 shoes because it is important to
have that look,'' said Vanessa Cofresi, a 27-year-old makeup artist
from Puerto Rico who has been a part-time model since she was 13.
``People here look at what you wear, what car you have, who you
hang around with.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have that in the modeling world but there's more of
that here,'' Cofresi said. ``It is important to have a good-looking
partner. I've had friends tell me, if he's not good looking, he
shouldn't be in our group.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Lois West, associate professor of sociology at Florida
International University, said the focus on beauty lends itself to
a lifestyle without any real substance or intellectual depth. Many
who live here concede that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no books, no books anywhere,'' Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   But she has lived in a more serious world. A successful
businesswoman who moved to South Beach from Washington last year,
Flores reinvented herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important up there is what's in your brain,'' she said.
``Here, you have to be attractive first.'' She is 32, so she must
work hard, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tan three, four times a week,'' Flores said. ``I work out
every day. You've got to keep up your pedicures. I am constantly
bleaching my teeth. I do facial peels continuously, grow my hair
longer, because it's sexier. You want to have the new Cartier
watch, Moschino outfits. A lot of women do it for men. I do it
because it's fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You change how you look, but if you're not careful, the devil
changes you,'' Flores said. ``South Beach is a bad habit and you
keep coming back for more.''
</P>

   One of the most beautiful here is Sofia Vergara, featured on
countless covers of Spanish-language magazines. But even she, whose
calendar sold 500,000 copies this year, is unsure of her beauty in
a teeming sea of it. ``On the Beach,'' she said, ``you're more
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone in South Beach is beautiful. But Hilario
Machando, 86, who was cruising South Beach on his rusty bicycle
with his pet Chihuahua in the basket, loves living here, anyway,
and loves that God has granted him eyes to see.

   WASHINGTON _ The arguments that finally persuaded wavering
members of Congress to grant China permanent trade status last week
had very little to do with tariffs or even whether China's
state-run industries would finally allow American farmers to
deliver beef and wheat directly to the world's largest market.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it came down to one of the biggest bets in geopolitics:
Most of the members of Congress who voted ``yes'' said they
believed President Clinton's oft-repeated assertion that the faster
the Chinese people are enmeshed in Western markets, legal systems
and technology, the faster they will be tempted to cast off the
one-party rule of the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When over 100 million people in China can get on the Net,''
Clinton argued in a commencement speech days before the vote, which
he won by a surprisingly wide margin of 237-197, ``it will be
impossible to maintain a closed political and economic society.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? Who knows. Clinton may be well into a second career as
an investment banker or a third one as a movie producer before
anyone has the foggiest sense of whether last week's decision to
end the annual congressional review of China's trading rights, and
usher the country into the World Trade Organization, has any real
effect on political freedom in China.
</P>
<P>
   Yet recent history suggests it is not an entirely wild gamble.
Look around the rest of Asia, where there is a clear _ if sometimes
tenuous _ connection between the growth of market capitalism and
the growth of some kind of democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan and South Korea are the success stories that everyone
points to, places where the arrival of high technology, commercial
legal systems and a gradual opening of the market was followed by
an end to autocratic rule. But economists and political theorists
have spent years arguing over the precise connections between freer
markets and freer political systems and _ no surprise _ they can't
agree on much.
</P>
<P>
   And for every success story there are exceptions like Singapore
and Malaysia, which have managed to embrace free enterprise while
maintaining strict one-party control. Or Russia, where political
liberty has preceded the introduction of a real market economy. But
there are a few common themes:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Free markets don't equal freedom. But they make it a lot harder
for the government _ or corrupt bureaucrats _ to rule over everyday
choices. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Before China began to embrace market principles, a Communist
Party official would get up at 5 a.m. in cities like Shanghai, go
to the market and decide who got what. As in the old Soviet Union,
the system worked for a while _ goods and services got produced,
and people didn't starve. Usually. In short, the apparatchik played
the role that pricing plays today, allocating scarce resources. And
since handing out goodies was the local official's main source of
power _ to say nothing of an opportunity to have his pockets
stuffed with bribes _ the arrival of a market economy means the
diminution of the party's arbitrary power.
</P>
<P>
   Entry into the WTO promises to reinforce this process. ``The
arrival of foreign competition means the local party officials will
lose their control over what the big factory in town produces, or
even how many people it employs,'' says Nicholas Lardy, a China
expert at the Brookings Institution. Chang Lin Tien, the former
chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley, just
returned to Taiwan a week ago to witness the swearing in of the new
president, and he says it got him thinking about what prompted the
change from the martial law of his youth to the election of the
opposition leader, Chen Shui-bian, earlier this year. ``We had some
ruthless leaders,'' he said, ``but as the economy came up, and
Taiwan became part of the global market, it ended up giving more
and more influence to the local Taiwanese and less to the party.
State-owned enterprises just couldn't compete.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A rising middle class first demands a decent apartment, then a
car, and sooner or later a vote. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Well, sometimes. In South Korea, American efforts to push a
series of authoritarian leaders toward greater freedom failed
before the country's workers began making decent wages. ``When I
think about our first efforts to convince South Korean leaders to
liberalize, well, we saved the life of Kim Dae Jung,'' said William
H. Gleysteen Jr., the former American ambassador to Seoul,
referring to the onetime dissident who is now president. ``But a
lot of the other efforts didn't amount to much. Then people started
to buy cars, to travel, and to demand a bit more political space.
They became less compliant with the government.'' By 1987 the
movement had become unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The IMF may be much reviled, but sometimes it aids and abets a
democratic coup. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Suharto did not found the Indonesian state, but he ruled over it
for 35 years. For years the CIA speculated how his regime would end
_ heart attack, coup, assassination. ``We forgot about economic
chaos,'' says one of the agency's old Asia hands. Once the Asian
economic crisis began, the International Monetary Fund began
demanding changes _ including the dismemberment of Suharto's family
enterprises, which were skewing the government's budgets. And that
unleashed political forces that Suharto couldn't withstand. The IMF
made a lot of mistakes, and the Indonesian bailout was not intended
to oust Suharto. In retrospect, though, the world got a more open
Indonesia and one less authoritarian ruler. ``Of course there was
no plan,'' says Jeffrey Garten, a former senior official in the
Commerce Department. ``But from the beginning of the Clinton
administration there was a sense that economic liberalization and
political liberalization would somehow go together. Of course, no
one envisioned how this dangerous cocktail would come together.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Internet will change this. But no one knows how. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is probably right that the Chinese will never be able to
control discourse on the Internet (which doesn't stop them from
trying). And while it may be a force for democracy, it may also
prove a spur for anti-market, anti-American feelings. No sooner had
the House passed the trade bill last week than Chinese scholars
like Han Deqiang were on the Web preaching the dangers. Han told
China Online, an electronic newsletter for executives, that through
the WTO. ``American economic hegemony could easily control China.''
Oh, and he added: ``There are 133 WTO members. Look at some of the
African countries, the corruption there is much worse than in
China.''

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ People were burning cars in the streets
again, but there was a presidential hush in the jasmine-scented
living room of B.J. Habibie, the sprightly enigma who, for a
bewildering moment not long ago, found himself the most powerful
person in the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should understand my background,'' said Habibie, a tiny,
animated man. ``I am not a politician; I am not even interested in
politics. And suddenly I had to take over.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in May 1998, when former President Suharto suddenly
resigned and, without a single word to him, left Indonesia in the
hands of his vice president, Habibie, an aircraft engineer who was
one of the most spectacularly unprepared people ever to lead a
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 17 months, Habibie rode the bucking bronco of
power, challenged from all sides as Indonesia began to redefine
itself. But he pursued a remarkably steady course toward democracy,
dismantling the dictatorship that his predecessor and friend had
painstakingly put in place during 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie freed the press, the labor unions and the political
parties, and began the slow process of pulling the military out of
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in what he calls one of his proudest achievements, he
became the first Indonesian president ever to be voted out of
office _ replaced last October by an equally eccentric leader, the
voluble, half-blind Muslim cleric Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Now Habibie, 64, has less power than he has had since becoming
Suharto's minister for science and technology more than 20 years
ago _ time, he said, to stare at his face in the mirror and decide,
yes, let's try a mustache. (``Do you like it? Do you?'')
</P>
<P>
   This week he opened the Habibie Center, a political research
institute that he is mostly financing himself. But he has quickly
become an irrelevance in Indonesia's political scene.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Suharto, who had been the target of protests last week by
rioters demanding that he be put on trial for corruption, Habibie
arouses few emotions. He serves mostly as a political science
teaser: did he lead the nation into its emerging democracy or was
he, like the rest of the men in power, simply buffeted by the
prevailing typhoon of change?
</P>
<P>
   While many analysts say he had little choice but to allow the
new freedoms that were being demanded on the streets, Habibie has
insisted that he was a heartfelt liberal who learned his democratic
lessons during decades of residence in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a man who is never reactive,'' Habibie said. ``I'm
proactive. I always work based on my beliefs and my convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be true, despite his closeness for decades to his
autocratic mentor. Whether he led or followed, he was part of a
nationwide passion for change that exploded to the surface the
moment Suharto's grip was loosened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some time to assess Habibie,'' said Daniel
S. Lev, a professor at the University of Washington at Seattle.
``But the best one can say and the worst one can say is that he did
not make things as bad as they could have been.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not block reforms, and he did not use the military to try
to stay in power, Lev said. ``The point is, he didn't stand as a
major obstruction, and those are all sort of backhanded
compliments, but he deserves them, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono, who was education minister
under Habibie, was similarly equivocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say he was forced into those things, but you must give
him credit for taking them on at an early stage,'' Sudarsono said.
``I think he was basically being used by so many people who focused
on their own personal gain. He was an OK guy, very charming, very
witty, very bubbly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Habibie described himself as a man who threw a
stone into a pond and set off waves of turbulence. The process he
set in motion, he said, was a shift from ``unipolar'' to
``multipolar'' power _ a difficult transition for a vastly diverse
nation of many islands and more than 200 million people that had
learned to submit to a single central leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the lows which exist today in our economy
and our political life are because of this transition,'' he said.
``We should help the president today to shorten the time of this
transition that is decreasing our efficiency and productivity.
Because the president is OK, I think; he is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first week as president, Habibie said, he confounded his
aides by visiting Parliament in a gesture of respect to the
legislative branch. ``Suddenly the situation happened where I have
depowered myself as president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He then helped set the ground rules for Indonesia's first
democratic election, and submitted gracefully to the result last
fall, calling himself proudly, ``the first victim of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But there has been one sad element in Habibie's presidency, the
loss of a lifelong friendship with Suharto, a surrogate father who
is 15 years his senior.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Habibie's moment of destiny began as a calculated
insult. Suharto, the man he called his best friend, had named him
vice president just two months earlier as a sort of slap at a
growing chorus of critics.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie was widely seen as an eccentric and a lightweight, and
when Suharto came under pressure to step down, one of the last
cards he tried to play was to point to the clearly unqualified man
who would take his place.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when he capitulated, he refused even to speak to Habibie,
who said he was still stunned and bewildered as he took the oath of
office two years ago, on May 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, he said, Suharto still refuses to see him.
</P>
<P>
   The only time they have spoken, he said, was on Suharto's
birthday later that year, when he was allowed to place a telephone
call to his former friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him and I told him, `Happy birthday, I want to see
you,''' Habibie said. ``And he told me, `No, you are not going to
see me. It is not good for the country or for you or for me. You
have to stop all of this. You cannot see me.'
</P>
<P>
   ```But you are just like my own father and my friend. Why should
I not see you? I have the right to see you and to talk.'
</P>
<P>
   ```No. But you should try and contact me through spiritual _
through telepathy.' He told me like this, and then I forgave him,''
Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Suharto has suffered a third stroke, this one
apparently so debilitating that he has trouble understanding and
communicating.
</P>
<P>
   And so, as Habibie looks back at his unexpected moment in
history, it appears that he will never learn why Suharto, his old
friend, turned over to him the leadership of the nation without
saying a word.

   Religion Loses a Round to Women in Israel
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Supreme Court ruled that women can hold group
services, wear prayer shawls and read aloud from Torah scrolls at
the Western Wall, a part of the Jewish temple complex that was
destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70, and Judaism's most revered
shrine.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with strict Orthodox Jewish tradition, men and women
worship at the wall in separate areas divided by a partition, and
only the men hold services. The court gave the government six
months to arrange for women's services.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've come out of the Middle Ages,'' said Anat Hoffman, a
leader of the women's group. ''Today the Western Wall became part
of the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was condemned by Orthodox officials and rabbis.
Deputy Religious Affairs Minister Yigal Bibi, a member of the
National Religious Party, said the Supreme Court had issued yet
another ruling that would ``nullify the state of Israel as a Jewish
state and turn it into a state of all its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard is Hiring
</P>
<P>
   Neil Rudenstine, the 26th president of Harvard University _ and
only the sixth appointed since the Civil War _ plans to step down
next spring after a decade leading the nation's oldest and most
prestigious university.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine, who took a three-month leave because of exhaustion
in 1994, said he is not too tired to continue. Rather, having
completed a $2.6 billion capital campaign _ the largest ever in
higher education _ he thinks it is time for a new regime to plan
for the next round of fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Water Standards
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed revising its
standards for arsenic, a cancer-causing pollutant, in drinking
water. The new standards would cut the maximum allowable from 50 to
5 parts per billion.
</P>
<P>
   Water utilities objected that going below 10 parts per billion
would be too costly, while environmentalists said the agency was
not going far enough, since the risks of cancer under the new rule
would still be 1 in 10,000. The agency estimated that annual
household water bills could rise $85 in small communities, where
most of the problems are found.
</P>
<P>
   A Flying 800 Pound Gorilla
</P>
<P>
   UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, the world's largest
airline, bid $4.3 billion in cash to acquire US Airways, the
nation's sixth-largest carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating problems with regulators, United said it will sell
more than 200 US Airways routes out of Ronald Reagan National
Airport in Washington to Robert Johnson, the founder of Black
Entertainment Television.
</P>
<P>
   United said it will not raise domestic fares for two years after
completing the deal. Antitrust experts said they expect Washington
to take a hard look at the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Hour
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court struck down a 1996 law requiring cable systems
to limit sex channel transmissions to late-night hours, when
children would be less likely to watch, if they could not prevent
signals from those channels from ``bleeding'' through to
nonsubscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The justices all agreed that shielding children from graphic sex
on cable TV was a valid goal, but split 5-4 over what limits the
First Amendment placed on achieving it.
</P>
<P>
   Under another section of the law, cable systems must provide
individual blocking devices on request, and the majority said this
was more respectful of individual choice and less burdensome on
free expression.
</P>
<P>
   Lose Some, Win Some
</P>
<P>
   A disciplinary committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court
recommended that President Clinton be disbarred for ``serious
misconduct'' connected to his sworn testimony about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Through his lawyers, Clinton vowed to fight to keep his law
license during disbarment proceedings before a state court judge in
Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   By midweek, the presidential pall lifted, as the MCI Center in
Washington was packed with 13,625 people, who donated $26.5
million, at the biggest political fund-raiser ever held. Donors
gave between $50 and $500,000 each, and the elaborate affair
cemented the president's legacy as the most prolific political
fund-raiser in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Famous for 24 Seconds
</P>
<P>
   After decades of rejection, Danny Biasone, the bowling alley
proprietor from Syracuse, who invented professional basketball's
24-second shot clock, was finally elected to the Basketball Hall of
Fame last week.
</P>
<P>
   Biasone, who owned the Syracuse Nationals from 1946 until 1963,
created the shot clock in 1954 in an attempt to speed up the pro
game, which had been suffering from low scoring and dwindling
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in the National Basketball Association's 1954-55
season, the 24-second clock revived both scoring and attendance in
the fledgling league. Biasone died in 1992.

   Editors: The following scheduled items from The N.Y. Times Week
in Review for Sunday, May 28, have all moved.
</P>
<P>
   Moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   TRADE-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Support for normal trading
rights for China was based in part on the argument that free trade
can foster democracy. Around the rest of Asia, there is a clear _
if sometimes tenuous _ connection between the growth of market
capitalism and the growth of some kind of democratic institutions,
although there are exceptions. Free markets don't equal freedom,
but they make it a lot harder for the government or corrupt
bureaucrats to rule over everyday choices. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-HISTORY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Israel is engaged in a
national debate over new histories of Zionism and changes in the
school curriculum. These revise the standard Zionist self-image _
the righteous, selfless pioneer _ in favor of a more complicated
and less heroic one. These new histories portray early Zionists
both as humans drawn into the inhumanity of war and as calculating
European colonialists. An assumption of much of the new historical
scholarship is that Israel shares the blame for the conflict with
its adversaries and should come to terms with them as moral and
cultural equals. The fight over history is in the background as
Israel stakes out a new strategy for confronting Syria and Lebanon,
its remaining Arab adversaries to the north. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-EUROPE-REVIEW (Berlin) _ The Cold War has been over for a
decade, and the big questions _ Euromissiles, Soviet divisions,
global peace itself _ have disappeared from U.S. relations with
European capitals. Beyond the intermittent flaring of Balkan
crises, their place has largely been taken by genetically altered
food, banana trade, capital punishment and even child custody.
America's apparent determination to build a national missile
defense system could still spur a major confrontation with Russia
that would be deeply troubling to Washington's European allies.
But, in general, how to live, what to eat and whether to accept the
death sentence seem to have become the stuff of trans-Atlantic
tiffs. The recurrent rows over such questions are sometimes viewed
as a sign of the fraying ties between Europe and the United States.
By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   SCHORK-JOURNALISM-REVIEW (Berlin) _ Journalism, it is said,
provides a first draft of history. It is a cliche, yet sometimes an
unlikely combination of war and a witness illustrates the hallowed
truth that lurks behind a hollow phrase. I write this sitting in
Berlin, dreaming of Bosnia, and thinking of Kurt Schork, the
Reuters correspondent whose dispatches from Sarajevo helped shape
the world's view of a war as morally indelible to my generation of
correspondents as Vietnam was to another. Schork, 53, was killed
Wednesday in an ambush in Sierra Leone. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ARMS-CONTROL-REVIEW (Undated) _ New frontiers in arms control:
For the first time in many years, arms control experts are
exploring new, potentially better ways to actually control them.
Top thinkers of the political left and right are declaring
traditional arms control all but dead and calling for deep cuts in
remaining arsenals, for building anti-missile defenses against
rogue states, and for finally getting serious about stopping the
spread of missile technology and nuclear arms. It's thinking about
the unthinkable in a new way. By William Broad.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-LEBANON-REVIEW (Undated) _ The question hanging over the
abrupt Israeli departure is whether, in the absence of any other
force, Hezbollah will bring quiet or if they will attempt to
transfer their war of attrition across the border. The unknown
answer will reverberate across a spectrum of Middle East issues,
but none more than the attempts by Israel and its neighbors to
erect some form of workable peace. By Neil Macfarquahar.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH-CLOSURE-REVIEW (Atlanta) _ When prosecutors in Birmingham,
Ala., charged two former Ku Klux Klansmen with the 1963 bombing of
a black church, there was talk about closure. But what is closure?
Is it merely a psychological phenomenon or a political one or some
melding of the two? Has the word become so overused and applied to
so many disparate circumstances as to become all but meaningless?
Can a judicial resolution really soothe the agony endured by
victims, families and other wounded parties, or does it only serve
to revive pain that had long ago subsided? Across the world, from
South Africa to Chile to Neshoba County, Miss., to cities like
Washington and New York that have built Holocaust museums, the
search for closure has become a driving force in politics, law and
even culture. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   HYPERCONVENIENCE-FOODS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Everyone knows America
is a nation in a hurry _ especially the makers of packaged foods.
First there was the TV dinner. Then came fast food for meals on the
go. Now, with the pace of modern life approaching warp speed, it's
time for something marketers call hyperconvenience food, portable
comfort cuisine and dashboard dining. By Constance L. Hays.
</P>
<P>
   NRA-RESTAURANT-REVIEW (New York) _ In a city aswarm with new
restaurants clamoring for attention, the National Rifle Association
plans to open a theme restaurant, the NRA Sports Grille, in Times
Square. Can it win the hearts, minds and, most important, the
stomachs of a city filled with picky eaters? If nothing else, the
Sports Grille will give them plenty to talk about. By William
Grimes.
</P>

   SPREWELL-REDEEM-REVIEW (New York) _ A look at the rehabilitation

By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   CARTLAND-NOVELS-REVIEW (Undated) _ When Dame Barbara Cartland,
the romance novelist who was the world's best-selling author, died
May 21 at the age of 98, she had written 723 books. Some of her
staggering array of titles are listed. By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   ANTITRUST-REMEDIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ As Washington ponders the
recommendations for Microsoft, all involved parties should be
reminded that the track record of antitrust remedies is decidedly
mixed. By Steve Lohr.

   Editors: The following scheduled items from The N.Y. Times Week
in Review for Sunday, May 28, have all moved.
</P>
<P>
   Moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   TRADE-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Support for normal trading
rights for China was based in part on the argument that free trade
can foster democracy. Around the rest of Asia, there is a clear _
if sometimes tenuous _ connection between the growth of market
capitalism and the growth of some kind of democratic institutions,
although there are exceptions. Free markets don't equal freedom,
but they make it a lot harder for the government or corrupt
bureaucrats to rule over everyday choices. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-HISTORY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Israel is engaged in a
national debate over new histories of Zionism and changes in the
school curriculum. These revise the standard Zionist self-image _
the righteous, selfless pioneer _ in favor of a more complicated
and less heroic one. These new histories portray early Zionists
both as humans drawn into the inhumanity of war and as calculating
European colonialists. An assumption of much of the new historical
scholarship is that Israel shares the blame for the conflict with
its adversaries and should come to terms with them as moral and
cultural equals. The fight over history is in the background as
Israel stakes out a new strategy for confronting Syria and Lebanon,
its remaining Arab adversaries to the north. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-EUROPE-REVIEW (Berlin) _ The Cold War has been over for a
decade, and the big questions _ Euromissiles, Soviet divisions,
global peace itself _ have disappeared from U.S. relations with
European capitals. Beyond the intermittent flaring of Balkan
crises, their place has largely been taken by genetically altered
food, banana trade, capital punishment and even child custody.
America's apparent determination to build a national missile
defense system could still spur a major confrontation with Russia
that would be deeply troubling to Washington's European allies.
But, in general, how to live, what to eat and whether to accept the
death sentence seem to have become the stuff of trans-Atlantic
tiffs. The recurrent rows over such questions are sometimes viewed
as a sign of the fraying ties between Europe and the United States.
By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   SCHORK-JOURNALISM-REVIEW (Berlin) _ Journalism, it is said,
provides a first draft of history. It is a cliche, yet sometimes an
unlikely combination of war and a witness illustrates the hallowed
truth that lurks behind a hollow phrase. I write this sitting in
Berlin, dreaming of Bosnia, and thinking of Kurt Schork, the
Reuters correspondent whose dispatches from Sarajevo helped shape
the world's view of a war as morally indelible to my generation of
correspondents as Vietnam was to another. Schork, 53, was killed
Wednesday in an ambush in Sierra Leone. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ARMS-CONTROL-REVIEW (Undated) _ New frontiers in arms control:
For the first time in many years, arms control experts are
exploring new, potentially better ways to actually control them.
Top thinkers of the political left and right are declaring
traditional arms control all but dead and calling for deep cuts in
remaining arsenals, for building anti-missile defenses against
rogue states, and for finally getting serious about stopping the
spread of missile technology and nuclear arms. It's thinking about
the unthinkable in a new way. By William Broad.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-LEBANON-REVIEW (Undated) _ The question hanging over the
abrupt Israeli departure is whether, in the absence of any other
force, Hezbollah will bring quiet or if they will attempt to
transfer their war of attrition across the border. The unknown
answer will reverberate across a spectrum of Middle East issues,
but none more than the attempts by Israel and its neighbors to
erect some form of workable peace. By Neil Macfarquahar.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH-CLOSURE-REVIEW (Atlanta) _ When prosecutors in Birmingham,
Ala., charged two former Ku Klux Klansmen with the 1963 bombing of
a black church, there was talk about closure. But what is closure?
Is it merely a psychological phenomenon or a political one or some
melding of the two? Has the word become so overused and applied to
so many disparate circumstances as to become all but meaningless?
Can a judicial resolution really soothe the agony endured by
victims, families and other wounded parties, or does it only serve
to revive pain that had long ago subsided? Across the world, from
South Africa to Chile to Neshoba County, Miss., to cities like
Washington and New York that have built Holocaust museums, the
search for closure has become a driving force in politics, law and
even culture. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   HYPERCONVENIENCE-FOODS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Everyone knows America
is a nation in a hurry _ especially the makers of packaged foods.
First there was the TV dinner. Then came fast food for meals on the
go. Now, with the pace of modern life approaching warp speed, it's
time for something marketers call hyperconvenience food, portable
comfort cuisine and dashboard dining. By Constance L. Hays.
</P>
<P>
   NRA-RESTAURANT-REVIEW (New York) _ In a city aswarm with new
restaurants clamoring for attention, the National Rifle Association
plans to open a theme restaurant, the NRA Sports Grille, in Times
Square. Can it win the hearts, minds and, most important, the
stomachs of a city filled with picky eaters? If nothing else, the
Sports Grille will give them plenty to talk about. By William
Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   SPREWELL-REDEEM-REVIEW (New York) _ A look at the rehabilitation
and redemption of controversial basketball star Latrell Sorewell.
By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   CARTLAND-NOVELS-REVIEW (Undated) _ When Dame Barbara Cartland,
the romance novelist who was the world's best-selling author, died
May 21 at the age of 98, she had written 723 books. Some of her
staggering array of titles are listed. By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   ANTITRUST-REMEDIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ As Washington ponders the
recommendations for Microsoft, all involved parties should be
reminded that the track record of antitrust remedies is decidedly
mixed. By Steve Lohr.

BATTLE BREWS AS IRAN'S REFORMERS TAKE OVER PARLIAMENT
</HEADLINE>
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Iran's new reformer-dominated parliament opened
on Saturday in Tehran, the first since the Islamic revolution to
include a majority of members who appear eager and ready to
challenge the conservative clergy's dictates over daily life.
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulties facing the young reform movement, which has
seen 18 independent newspapers closed and several of its liberal
activists jailed by hard-line judges, were clearly visible during
the opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Only 249 of the 290 seats in the parliament were filled. The
empty seats represented districts where the conservative Council of
Guardians either has not yet certified election results or has
voided the victories of reform candidates who won in the first
round of voting on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The council only recently approved partial results of the
heavily pro-reform vote in the capital, Tehran, and then only at
the command of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. New
elections for vacant seats have not yet been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The machinations over the composition of the new parliament, the
sixth since the Shah was overthrown and replaced with a theocratic
regime in 1979, reflected the broader conflict between entrenched
religious conservatives and the impatient pro-democracy movement
supporting President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, a moderate cleric elected in a landslide vote in 1997,
has advocated democratic reforms, a free press and depoliticizing
the judiciary and security forces, which are dominated by
hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   While he has been able to form a liberal cabinet to his liking,
he has accomplished little in the way of legislation. The previous
parliament was controlled by conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The new parliament, which includes a record low number of only
37 Muslim clerics, will also have to take conservative resistance
to any reforms into account. The Council of Guardians, in addition
to its power over elections, also must approve all legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatami told the legislators on Saturday that they have the
responsibility to debate and look into all areas of Iranian life
and government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a parliament that has a heavy responsibility and must
play a fundamental role in stabilizing the system,'' Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts in Iran estimate that up to 70 percent of the
new members of parliament are sympathetic to Khatami or directly
allied to him, although they represent a variety of views on such
matters as press freedom, or how to rescue the economy and reduce
unemployment in the overwhelmingly young country.
</P>
<P>
   Some, although not all, reformers have said they want to ease
restrictions on books, music, satellite television receivers and
the press, for example. Others have said the first priority for the
new parliament should be to help expand political activity.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's aides have said they want to move slowly to avoid
further antagonizing conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parliament must amend the laws in such a way as to pave
the way for democratization of the country,'' said Abbas Abdi, a
reform activist and writer. ``It must pass laws that provide
security and political stability. Without these, economic reform
will not be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential disputes that lay ahead remained in the background
at the opening session, which became instead a moment of defiant
celebration for Khatami forces.
</P>
<P>
   Abdolvahab Massavi Lari, the Minister of Interior and an ally of
the president, gave a long speech in which he openly expressed
irritation with the way the Council of Guardians handled the
parliamentary elections. Criticism of the council, appointed by the
country's supreme religious leader, had long been taboo.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the new members also demonstrated their iconoclastic
leanings. All 11 women members appeared in headscarves and
shapeless long coats, as required of Iranian women in public
places.
</P>
<P>
   But two of them, Tahereh Rezazadeh from Shiraz and Elaheh Koulai
from Tehran, did not cover themselves with the additional black
square of fabric _ called the chador _ that has been the
established uniform for women who are members of parliament and,
indeed, any woman entering a government building, since the
revolution.

   One is a single mother who was thrown out of high school in the
1980s and nearly killed herself, only to be reborn in college as a

   Taking notes, passing tests, writing papers and going to classes

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Drug Addiction: Writer Discovers Her Own Voice &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Christine Lincoln's journey to Washington College, a small
liberal arts institution in Chestertown, Md., was as circuitous as
it was perilous.
</P>
<P>
   And she is as amazed as anyone that she is alive, let alone the
recipient of one of the best-endowed literary prizes bestowed on an
undergraduate. The award, which she received from a faculty
committee at commencement May 21, is for $54,266 and named for
Sophie Kerr, a pioneering female journalist and author.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to recall her adolescent self, Lincoln, who is 34, said:
``I was getting into fights. I was using drugs. I started out with
marijuana and alcohol, probably at 13. By the time I was 17, I was
using anything _ cocaine, uppers and downers, diet pills.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, which should have been her senior year at Baltimore
City College High School, she was expelled. Though she would attend
and graduate from another school the next year, her drug abuse
would not abate.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling she needed to escape ``the streets, and my friends,''
Lincoln enlisted in the Air Force. She worked as a radiology
technician at Andrews and Dover Air Force Bases, and secured an
honorable discharge in 1991. But the next year she grew so
depressed that, one night, she swallowed ``every pill that was in
my house and took all the alcohol I could get my hands on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so angry when I woke up,'' she said, ``that I was
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   A 30-day stay in a rehabilitation center in Texas was followed,
a year later, by the birth of her son, Takii, who was beset with
medical problems and required several operations in his early
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, her son healthy and her sobriety holding, Lincoln began
thinking about her life. And, like the memory of a soft breeze from
a long-ago vacation, she remembered being a 9-year-old who was told
by a teacher, ``Chris, you're a writer,'' after she submitted a
short story in which she had bestowed human qualities on a house.
</P>
<P>
   And so she began taking English courses at Baltimore City
Community College. While there, Lincoln read a newspaper article
about the writing program at Washington College, and its Sophie
Kerr prize. She decided on the spot to apply, and resolved to
obtain scholarship money to cover the $20,000 annual tuition.
Captivated by her spirit and history, the college agreed.
</P>
<P>
   At Washington, which is two hours from Baltimore, Lincoln
discovered Somerset Maugham (```Of Human Bondage,' God, I loved
that''), Toni Morrison (``Everything she's ever written''), and, to
her surprise, Sylvia Plath (``When I took that poetry class, I
thought, `Man, I'm not a poet,' but she blew me away. She's so
real.'')
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, she found her own voice, spinning yarns of
rural life that increasingly centered on struggling black survivors
like herself. Her first story, ``The Music,'' tells of a family
reeling in denial amid persistent physical abuse. In ``Sap
Rising,'' a young woman agonizes over whether to accept the hand of
a downtrodden farmer not unlike her father, or follow the clarion
call of a faraway land.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, her bank account newly flush, Lincoln intends to pack
up her son and begin her own adventure, moving to South Africa,
which she first visited on a college trip. She will study African
literature and work in a program in Johannesburg that uses creative
writing to ``heal teen-agers traumatized by violence.'' She is also
working on a novel, and hoping that a publisher will purchase her
collection of short stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibilities for my life are endless,'' she says.

<P>
   &UR; A Late Start: Long, Hard Climb to Academic Peak &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At 90, Elizabeth Eichelbaum has had enough experiences to fill
several lives, and has earned nothing if not a rest. But she had
other ideas, and this month was awarded a Ph.D. in education from
the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   Eichelbaum arrived in the United States in 1921, an 11-year-old
who had narrowly survived the ravages of the Russian Revolution and
who had been separated from her mother for more than a decade,
until the two were reunited in New York. She has little memory of
her father.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to attend school in Russia during World War I, she
finally entered public school in the fifth-grade in Harlem. But in
eighth-grade she felt she had to drop out to work in a dress shop.
</P>
<P>
   After that, her life strayed further from the classroom. She
married and raised four sons, including twins; ran a delicatessen
in Detroit; and nursed her husband through battles with diabetes
and heart disease, to which he succumbed in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   She herself has lived with a brain tumor that doctors diagnosed
early in the 1970s as not life-threatening. Undaunted, she went on
to earn a high school equivalency diploma in 1975. Eager to pursue
a lifelong love of painting, she then enrolled as an art student at
Wayne State University in Detroit. She was 65, and would later
receive a bachelor's degree and a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, despite having macular degeneration, which has left
her nearly blind, Eichelbaum donned a graduation robe once again
and stepped onto a Knoxville stage to accept her doctorate. Her
thesis focused on the value of art therapy to older adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad when I had no education,'' said Eichelbaum, her
voice unwavering. ``I had people I met who'd ask me what university
I went to, when I didn't even have more than four years of grade
school.''
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, she said, it was her own opinion that weighed
more heavily than the judgments of others. ``I thought, this is
what I needed and didn't get and I'm going to get it,'' she said.
``It never left my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   All her sons went to college before their mother did. The twins,
now 67, live in New York City, where one, Stuart, is an artist, and
the other Edward, is a sex therapist who has appeared on
``Geraldo.'' Her third son, Marvin, 61, owns several clothing
stores in Savannah, Ga. And her youngest, Stanley, 54, is an
international real estate developer.
</P>
<P>
   All four were in the audience when she received her doctorate,
joined by most of her four grandchildren and eight
great-grandchildren. One grandson wrote a letter to ``Dear Abby''
in April, extolling his grandmother's accomplishment. Abby
responded: ``Readers, Elizabeth has proved it can be done, so
what's stopping you? Go back to school if that is your dream.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent, unusually hot afternoon, Eichelbaum provided a
ready example of her endurance and perseverance. With the energy of
someone decades younger, she prepared a lunch of homemade vegetable
soup, turkey sandwiches and fresh fruit salad for herself and two
visitors in her Knoxville apartment. She insisted on serving and
clearing, as she says she does at the dinner parties she often
throws for 20 or more guests.
</P>
<P>
   In describing her marathon quest to reach the pinnacle of higher
education, Eichelbaum said: ``It wasn't a case of maybe. I just
waited for the opportunity and I'm finally finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son Marvin remembers an aphorism of his mother's that seems
to have guided her life: ``If we ever complained that we could not
get on a sports team, or get into a certain college, my mother
would say, `The only thing you can't do is live when it's time to
die.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ahead of His Class: Finishing College When Most Begin &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Forgive Michael Lanham, but the idea that anyone would take
eight decades to progress from fifth &UR; - &LR; grade to doctorate is
unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up on a cattle and tobacco farm in Gravel Switch, Ky.,
population about 100, Lanham finished kindergarten, first &UR; - &LR;  and
second &UR; - &LR; grades in one year, all before he turned 6. He skipped
ninth &UR; - &LR; grade and graduated from high school at 14.
</P>
<P>
   Though it did not hurt that Lanham's mother, Jan, was the
coordinator of the gifted students program for the Marion County
school system _ ``She oversaw the accelerations,'' he says _ his
mind was clearly racing faster than his peers'. He began reading
when he was 2, his family says, was able to do simple math by the
time he was 5, and had mastered high school geometry, English and
French by age 10.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, at 18, he is to graduate from Centre College, a liberal
arts institution of about 1,100 students in Danville, about 65
miles southeast of Louisville. In the fall, he will begin studying
at Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship, among the youngest recipients of
the scholarship in at least two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``For as long as I can remember, it's just been the person I've
been,'' Lanham said. ``Because I skipped grades so young, I've been
used to being with people who are three years older. My family has
played a large role in keeping me down to earth and realizing that
there is always more I can be doing _ and that I don't need to
coast on my reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall after he finished high school, Lanham enrolled at
Centre College. His baby-soft face had yet to sprout a whisker. But
at well over 6 feet, he fit in.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first day on campus,'' he said, ``a girl who I've since
become friends with came up to me and said, `Do you know there's a
15-year-old on campus?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Yes. It's me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lanham found dorm life easy, having attended several sleep-away
camps and study programs, and was never especially tempted to
indulge in alcohol. He also dated several older girls, but they
have usually been from his hometown and were still in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his height _ he now stands 6 feet 9 inches tall _
Lanham seemed destined for the basketball team. But it was not to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer dancing as a physical activity to any sport,'' he
said. ``I enjoy the dancing part of the musicals I've been in.''
They include ``Cabaret,'' in which he was in the chorus, and ``A
Little Night Music,'' for which he oversaw all musical direction.
</P>
<P>
   Lanham, to no one's surprise, concentrated on multiple
disciplines in the classroom. He took enough pre-medical courses to
apply to medical school, as well as a double major in music and
mathematics. At Oxford he intends to study mathematical biology,
which tries to create models to explain and predict the way
diseases spread or populations grow.
</P>
<P>
   He imagines growing up to be a scientist, or a conductor, or
maybe both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really feel I push myself to do any more than I am
able to do,'' he said. ``I've tried to do the best in everything I
apply myself towards.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest Lanham appear superhuman, consider the denouement of a
long-scheduled telephone interview with him. In an audible panic,
he suddenly realized that he had forgotten to charge the battery on
his cordless phone, the only phone in his dorm room. Seconds later,
before he could even finish asking a reporter for his number, the
phone was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home several days later, his father, Kevin, laughed.
``He's just as typical as any 18-year-old,'' the father said.
``He's very mature, but he messes up, just as we all do, from time
to time.''

   An Immigrant: Citadel Cadet Came to the U.S. at 14 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Despite being born and reared in Prague, Petra Lovetinska said
she felt surprisingly prepared for life at The Citadel, the
tradition-steeped military college in Charleston, S.C. Until she
sat down to breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't eat the school grits,'' she said. ``Those could
kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovetinska's unusual path to The Citadel, from which she
graduated this month with the rank of cadet major, began in the
fields near her family's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was as girl as a girl can be, with all the pretty dresses my
mom made for me,'' she said. ``The next day I'd be running in
camouflage, hiding in bushes, playing soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   When her father, who worked for the Czech State Department as a
chauffeur and housekeeper, was transferred to the republic's
embassy in Washington in 1992, Lovetinska moved there, too, at 14.
Unable to say much in English beyond, ``My name is Petra'' and ``I
don't understand,'' Lovetinska enrolled at Woodrow Wilson High
School in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The granddaughter of a lieutenant colonel in the Czech Army,
Lovetinska found herself gravitating toward the Junior ROTC
program, where she rode in a helicopter and spent hours on the air
rifle range.
</P>
<P>
   ``From then, my life sort of changed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on a military career but not yet an American citizen,
Lovetinska learned that The Citadel had no such citizenship
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the first female cadet class _ the trailblazing
first female cadet, Shannon Faulkner, had survived less than a week
before withdrawing, a year earlier _ Lovetinska said she was not
immune from ribbing from her classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to me wasn't really any different than what
happened to the guys,'' said Lovetinska, 22. ``Sometimes the guys
punch each other in the chest, as an acknowledgment of something
good happening to them. For me, they'd sort of hit me in the back
or the leg.''
</P>
<P>
   She took more good-natured abuse, she said, for her heavy
accent. ``It sort of added to the mystique,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her background even won her a role in the annual talent show as
``someone who knocked down the Berlin Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she says she was too young when the wall came down to
really reflect on communism, she has since realized that it was
oppressive for people to ``have to watch yourself and make sure you
have the right friends.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Citadel, Lovetinska said she delighted in studying
political theory _ ``from Plato and Aristotle, all the way to Marx
and Hegel'' _ as well as taking classes in naval science and
history. She was also awarded the Palmetto Medal, for good service.
But she said she absorbed some practical lessons outside the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm getting the y'all and I reckon down,'' she said. ``The
guys tried very hard to teach me how to speak Southern.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Michael Cribb, of Georgetown, S.C., became her
fiance. They are to marry on Dec. 15, 2001, but life is sure to be
difficult: He is in the Army, assigned to Fort Stewart, Ga.; having
attained her citizenship, she is to be commissioned into the Marine
Corps later this year, her assignment unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Among the greatest challenges for Lovetinska was finding the
money to pay The Citadel's tuition and fees, which grew to $18,500
from $15,200 while she was there.
</P>
<P>
   For that, she had some help: Langhorne Motley, an alumnus and
former assistant secretary of state, drafted 113 alumni and other
friends to serve as ``Petra's Plank Holders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like one of the things that only happens in the
movies,'' she said. ``I don't think the Plank Holders realize they
gave me more than just money to go to school. They gave me a whole
life.''

RISK OF ARMS RACE SEEN IN U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON and STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As President Clinton nears a decision on whether to build a
limited national missile defense, U.S. intelligence officials are
warning that such a system could set off a Cold War-style arms race
among China, India and Pakistan, administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. officials have repeatedly said an anti-missile
defense would not be aimed at Beijing, they acknowledge that the
system being designed would significantly undercut or even
neutralize China's small nuclear force.
</P>
<P>
   That could lead China to add to its nuclear arsenal. And if
China built up its force, its regional rival India could do the
same, as could India's rival Pakistan, heightening tensions along
the world's newest nuclear frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario, which intelligence officials are expected to
outline for Clinton in an official intelligence estimate due in
June, has raised questions about the administration's own efforts
to slow the spread of nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles
needed to launch them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China increases the number of missiles it has, would India
think it has to increase its missiles?'' asked a senior U.S.
official familiar with the analysis being prepared. ``And if India
increases its missiles, then Pakistan does.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he plans to decide later this year whether to
proceed with a missile defense based on four criteria: missile
threat, technological viability of the program, effect on arms
control, and cost. The response from China and Russia is an
important factor in Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   While newly disclosed defense documents indicate that in the
mid-1990s the Pentagon was researching ways to counter a limited
Chinese missile attack, defense officials say that is no longer the
U.S. policy. The system under consideration, they insist, is
intended to counter relatively small, unsophisticated missile
threats from countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, says
Beijing's concerns may be eased not only by reassurances about the
intent of the system but by general progress in economic and
political relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other dimensions to the relationship with the
Chinese that are of far more long-term importance than national
missile defense,'' Berger said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has expended enormous diplomatic energy _
unsuccessfully so far _ trying to persuade the Russians that a
missile defense system would not threaten its much larger strategic
forces. It has made even less headway with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons. Unlike Russia, which still maintains
a force of more than 5,000 warheads from the Cold War, China has
deployed a minimal nuclear force, which consists primarily of 18
single-warhead land-based CSS-4 missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The argument that the Clinton administration has used with the
Russians _ that a limited missile defense is not a threat, because
it could be easily swamped by a major Russian missile attack _ does
not apply to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   China's old liquid-fueled CSS-4 missiles are kept at a low state
of alert, with the nuclear warheads stored separately from the
missiles. It also has 12 missiles on a submarine that rarely strays
far from its port, from which it cannot reach the United States.
And China seems convinced that the system would come closer to
neutralizing its current nuclear force than has been publicly
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't deny to the Chinese that the system has some
capability against Chinese missiles, but that is not what it is
designed to do,'' the undersecretary of defense for policy, Walter
Slocombe, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is China's apprehensions about the future course
of relations with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. defense officials make plans according to a rival's
perceived capabilities, not its intent. The Chinese make the same
point, and complain that despite the assurances of the Clinton
administration, they cannot be certain that a future administration
will continue this policy, especially since China has often been
cast as a threat by conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official said: ``The Chinese tell us,
`You may not be directing the system against us, but what about the
next guy? How can we be confident that the next administration may
not have a different policy? It could use the system against us,
just as it does against North Korea.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese fear that the Clinton administration could adjust
and expand its limited defense, which in its first phase will
consist of a battle-management radar site in Alaska and 100
interceptors. And George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, has
said the United States will develop a far more ambitious defensive
system if he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Still another reason for the Chinese suspicions is that the
Pentagon has previously worked on defensive systems to counter the
Chinese arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   During the Bush administration, the Pentagon instructed TRW
Corp., a U.S. military contractor, to develop ground-based
interceptors that would stop ``limited attacks by China'' using
CSS-4 missiles, according to a 1993 document prepared by the U.S.
Army.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon insists that countering China is no longer a goal,
and its Ballistic Missile Defense Organization declined to say
whether it is still studying ways to intercept Chinese warheads.
</P>
<P>
   But defense officials acknowledge that the planning documents
are constantly updated with the latest science and intelligence
estimates of ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond a direct threat from China, there are other reasons the
Pentagon might want to develop the means to thwart its missile
systems. U.S. intelligence officials cautioned in a 1999 analysis
of ``foreign missile developments'' that Russia and China might
sell countermeasures that the United States is explicitly trying to
counter _ like decoy warheads _ to developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's missile-defense organization has also
acknowledged that the new U.S. defense would have the ``residual
capability'' to defend against the ``unauthorized launch by an
established nuclear power of a few missiles with simple
countermeasures,'' a definition that includes the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system has to be able to respond to more than just North
Korea,'' a defense industry official said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to ease China's concerns, the Clinton administration has
argued that while an anti-missile system might be effective against
China's current arsenal, it would be less so against the updated
arsenal that China has long planned to build.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Clinton administration began seriously
considering anti-missile defenses, the Chinese were planning to
deploy a solid-fuel land-based missile of intercontinental range
that could be moved around on a truck, as well as a new
submarine-launched missile.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials project that by 2015, under
Beijing's current modernization plan, the Chinese will have
``several tens'' of new and old missiles that can reach the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A missile defense, then, would have little effect on the Chinese
strategic modernization, Pentagon officials assert. China, they
add, is more anxious about the provision of anti-missile technology
to Taiwan than it is about a defense to protect the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these arguments, however, Pentagon officials acknowledge
that they know very little about the missiles, warheads and
countermeasures that the Chinese plan to deploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume the Chinese plan to modernize their force,'' a
senior Pentagon official said. ``It's impossible to say how much it
would be affected by a national missile defense of the kind we're
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Some senior intelligence experts nonetheless believe that a
missile defense would prompt the Chinese to build up their
strategic forces beyond what they had previously planned, in order
to ensure that it remained viable.
</P>
<P>
   Such a response by China would be consistent with orthodox
arms-control theory, which holds that the construction of a missile
defense generally prompts an adversary to build more missiles in
the hope that at least some can get through the defense.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. intelligence community's assessment will be contained
in a new official intelligence report on the responses of foreign
governments to a U.S. missile defense. The White House asked in
December that the report be prepared, so that Clinton could
consider it in making his decision on a missile defense. Officials
caution that the estimate is still being prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would expect them to continue and perhaps even enhance
countermeasures,'' a senior U.S. official said. ``We have projected
that they will have several tens of missiles by 2015. National
Missile Defense might prompt them to do more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be likely,'' the senior official added.
</P>
<P>
   One way for the Chinese to extend their build-up would be to add
new warheads to their old 18 CSS-4s, transforming them from
single-warhead missiles into four-warhead missiles. They might also
double the size of their projected land-based mobile missiles.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Chinese could have more than 100 warheads by
2015, that is more than the 100 interceptors that the United States
plans to deploy in the first phase of its missile defense. The
Chinese, the administration official said, might even deploy more
than 200 warheads if the United States continues to expand its
missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   China's expanded force of nuclear-tipped long-range missiles
might not be directed at India, they say. But it would be a
possibility that the Indians could not ignore, and as a result
India might build up the short-range missiles it used to direct at
China.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials are divided over whether India would
respond in such a way, but the emerging analysis has dramatically
raised the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to balance its concerns over stability in South Asia
with its interest in missile defense, the Clinton administration is
likely to redouble its negotiating efforts with the Chinese and
perhaps even explore new forms of arms control with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, however, Washington has a difficult job ahead.

SPORTS COLUMN: SPORTSWORLD, MEET SHRINKWORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because our Bob Knight problem was framed as either a moral
question _ Is it wrong to throw chairs, talk dirty and choke your
players? _ or as a pragmatic question _ Is it imprudent for a
university president to jeopardize major donations by dumping an
iconic coach? _ we will probably have to deal with the blustery
bully for a while. Until he slugs someone who really matters, such
as a rich Indiana booster, or has three losing seasons in a row,
Knight will continue to have an impact on young lives in formation
and offer an affirming role model to abusive coaches and corporate
managers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Had our Bob Knight problem been properly framed as a
psychological question _ does this man have a personality disorder
and is it having an adverse emotional impact on others? _ we might
be a lot closer to getting rid of him, or at least getting him into
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But that would entail having in place an objective, competent
mental health presence in SportsWorld. At the moment, what we have
is a gaggle of performance enhancers, personnel evaluators and the
head-shrinking equivalent of the stereotypical orthopedic surgeon
who thinks he is a coach with an M.D. (``Snap out of that
depression, Jimbo; this is the seventh game.'') No brain, no gain.
</P>
<P>
   This current grist for thelipsite(at)aol.com comes from a week
at the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting, in
Chicago, earlier this month. The key symposium for me, numbingly
entitled, ``Psychopharmacological Approaches to the Athletic and
Exercise Population,'' was provocative and groundbreaking, and
poorly attended. Just as psychiatry has yet to crack SportsWorld's
taboos against athletes appearing emotionally needy, so jock
culture has yet to become an area of serious study in ShrinkWorld.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Ronald Kamm of New Jersey, who led the symposium, thinks
that a bridge between the two worlds can be built by the likes of
Julie Krone, the recently retired Hall of Fame jockey; Cincinnati
Reds pitcher Pete Harnisch; and Jack Farrell, a champion skeet
shooter, talking unselfconsciously about their therapy and
psychiatric drugs. They were all paid by the drug companies to talk
about their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch was in spring training with the Mets in 1997 when he
became depressed. Interviewed by Kamm in a 16-minute video,
Harnisch said that Mets management responded poorly to his illness,
but that after seven months of talk therapy and antidepressants (he
started with Prozac, was helped by Paxil) he got his game back.
Since then, he said, a number of players have approached him for
advice and to share stories.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell, 67, a retired engineer, went into depression after he
quit smoking cigarettes. Anger management was one of his main
problems, he said; Paxil made him a better shooter because ``I'm
calmer and I don't flinch.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone's story of her reluctance to ask for help even after she
felt suicidal and her eventual return to self after talk therapy
and Zoloft evoked dozens of phone calls and e-mail messages to
thelipsite(at)aol.com. Most were from other athletes, elite and
recreational, sharing their stories. They were thrilled that she
called her condition a ``mental illness,'' a step toward
de-stigmatizing it. There were quibbles. A noted
psychopharmacologist, Dr. Arthur Rifkin of Hillside Hospital in
Queens, N.Y., thought that two years of talk therapy before taking
drugs was too long (Krone's psychiatrists had vainly urged her to
start sooner). Bob Carolla of the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill pointed out that the football players Alonzo Spellman
and Earl Campbell have also spoken out publicly about their
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago symposium was sponsored by the International Society
for Sport Psychiatry, a nine-year-old group of about 80 members
searching for its place in an arena dominated by the aggressive
marketing of psychologists who promise to raise your batting
average and lower your golf score. In papers that were presented,
Dr. Antonia Baum of George Washington University, Dr. Ira Glick of
Stanford and Dr. Robert Burton of Northwestern called for research
into the effect of psychiatric drugs on ``finely tuned'' elite
athletes, and a re-examination of the banning of substances that
might treat mood or anxiety disorders. Burton is also co-editor,
with Dr. Daniel Begel, of the newly published book ``Sport
Psychiatry'' (Norton).
</P>
<P>
   A sexier symposium, on Coach Knight or even Latrell Sprewell,
might have drawn better against such competing offerings at the
same time that night as the movies ``Life is Beautiful'' and ``Good
Will Hunting,'' followed by psychiatric evaluations. And a
Knight-Spree entry might have been more on the mark; the emotional
impact of jock culture is incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there was an independent body of SportsWorld therapists
available to help the needy, one can assume that neither Knight nor
Indiana would sit for a session. Psychiatrists tend to be too lofty
to give distant diagnoses, probably a good thing, but some general
speculation about Knight's lack of control (or calculated use of
abuse?) might be instructive. There is good video available.
</P>
<P>
   No video exists of Sprewell choking P.J. Carlesimo, but that
would have been a perfect episode for analysis, assuming the
National Basketball Association could stand the psychiatric
spotlight on what might have been the case of an emotionally
troubled player pushed too far by a coach with unresolved issues of
his own. &QL;

ULSTER UNIONIST BACK JOINT ROLE WITH IRA ALLIES
</HEADLINE>
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Northern Ireland's largest
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, voted on Saturday by a
narrow margin to return to a power-sharing administration with
their Catholic rivals in Sinn Fein, the political representatives
of the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome meant that governing of the province, which had been
shifted back to London reluctantly in February with the suspension
of the new home rule government, will revert to Belfast within
days, and that the continually imperiled Northern Ireland peace
accord will have survived another precarious lapse.
</P>
<P>
   A motion that was deliberately drafted to be a vote on the
continuing leadership of the Unionists' leader, David Trimble, won
the support of 53 percent of the 862 delegates of the party's
ruling council. Trimble, under attack by a growing number of
hard-liners, had said the balloting would not be a ``back me or
sack me'' vote, but that is what it became when the wording of the
resolution asked simply whether people did or did not support ``the
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is perfectly obvious, as you can see, that we have
stretched ourselves remarkably,'' Trimble said at a news conference
as delegates streamed out of the modern glass-walled Waterfront
Hall on the Lagan River, which boosters hold up as a symbol of a
future in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble had had to wage a strenuous campaign to overcome
resistance in his party, and he told reporters, ``It is obvious
there are limits to how much more we can be stretched.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the disappointment the last time he had held a news
conference at the same spot, in November, after winning his party's
support for agreeing to joint rule with Sinn Fein the first time.
That government was suspended by Britain after only nine weeks when
the IRA failed to respond to the Unionists' decision with expected
moves to begin disarming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have operated in reliance on promises made by the
republican movement, and let there be absolutely no doubt this time
that my colleagues and I will hold the republican movement to the
promises they made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The promise was a pledge by the IRA on May 6 to permit
inspections of its secret arms dumps and to ``completely and
verifiably'' put its arms ``beyond use.'' The earlier failure by
the guerrilla organization to address disarmament had blocked
progress in putting into place the provisions of the peace
settlement of April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the growing opposition in Trimble's own party, bolstered by
the hard-line Democratic Unionists led by the Rev. Ian Paisley,
mounted a successful challenge that obliged Trimble to postpone the
meeting, originally scheduled last Saturday, to this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the vote, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary,
Peter Mandelson, signed the order to restore home rule. The 10-man
cabinet is to meet on Thursday, and the first session of the
Northern Ireland Assembly on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,600 people have died in the past three decades of
sectarian violence. The 1998 accord is an effort to balance the
interests of pro-British Protestants and pro-Irish Catholics and
turn their dispute from a violent one into a political one.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble on Saturday said he expected to see action ``within
weeks'' on the IRA's pledge to open its hidden arsenals to
inspection. The two monitors, the former Finnish president, Martti
Ahtisaari, and the former general secretary of the African National
Congress, Cyril Ramaphosa, visited Belfast earlier this month for
briefings on their duties.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would make repeated trips to arms dumps to verify
that weapons are locked away and disassembled, and would report
their findings to John De Chastelain of Canada, a retired general
and head of an international commission overseeing the disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, there has been fevered campaigning by
Trimble supporters and opponents, who saw in Saturday's decision
not only a reckoning for the peace process but a crossroads for
their party.
</P>
<P>
   Across the province there were door-to-door visits, saturation
telephone canvassing and leafleting that left rural mailboxes
bulging. Some party members from farm areas complained of the
aggressive tactics of the anti-agreement campaigners and said they
preferred the quiet persuasion of Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional appeal to the delegates at the closed meeting,
Trimble warned that a ``No'' vote would consign the party to the
political wilderness and turn the province over to republicans and
nationalists. He urged self-confidence, and a test of the IRA
promises.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-agreement faction, unable to base its opposition solely
on the arms issue once the IRA had made its offer, broadened its
demands by focusing on cherished symbols of national identity: A
debate that had been confined to weapons widened to embrace issues
like whether the British or Irish flag flies above government
buildings, what name the new police force bears and what emblems
appear on police badges and caps.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly sensitive is the matter of what to call the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, which is 93 percent Protestant and enjoys
little trust from Catholics. An international commission headed by
Chris Patten, the former governor of Hong Kong, recommended a new
force with more balanced recruitment and the name Northern Ireland
Police Service, but the hard-liners insisted that the RUC title _
whose reference to ``Royal'' denotes allegiance to the United
Kingdom _ be kept.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson tried to help Trimble's cause by saying that he would
keep the RUC name in the incorporation deeds of the new force; he
also promised other refinements to the Patten report to meet
Unionist objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who attacked the agreement played on the fears that it
would diminish their identity and undermine their tradition,''
Mandelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did no such thing. It cherished diversity, securing British
identity while recognizing and respecting nationalists and
republicans who did not share that identity.''
</P>
<P>
   In the political nomenclature of Ulster, republicans and
nationalists, almost all of whom are Catholic, are those who want
to see the province ultimately become part of Ireland, while
unionists, who are largely Protestant, want to see it remain part
of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's concessions to Trimble on these points has cost the
current support of the Sinn Fein, whose president, Gerry Adams,
said he could no longer recommend the formation of the new police
force to his members. It is a crucial consideration for the future,
because whatever the new service is called, it will not be
effective unless it can attract Catholics and start to redress the
imbalance in its members.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Polling by Belfast newspapers showed the membership of the
Ulster Unionists at the district level to be more accepting of
political coexistence with Catholics than the membership of the
ruling council. Trimble has said he plans reforms to do away with
bloc votes on the council held by a militant youth wing and the
traditional Orange Order, who have sided with the hard-liners.
Saturday's personal endorsement should give him the freedom to take
those actions and reduce the opposition to his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The rejectionists' challenge gained strength this time because
it was led openly by Trimble's most forceful opponent in the party,
Jeffrey Donaldson, 37, a member of parliament who has coveted
Trimble's leadership position and appeared to be seizing this
opportunity to wrest it away. But Saturday the delegates did not
warm to his criticisms of Trimble, and persuaded him to withdraw an
amendment proposing an alternative plan.
</P>
<P>
   The final tally showed that Trimble lost the support of some
people who had voted with him in the past, but also picked up
backing in surprising places.

   Sean O'Callaghan, a convicted former IRA killer who is the
guerrilla army's highest-ranking defector, came forward to tell
Unionist gatherings this past week that he was convinced that the
IRA's new promises on arms constituted the long-awaited pledge from
the republican side that ``the war is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the power of a history lesson among the
tradition-minded Ulster Protestants, O'Callaghan said, ``If in 1940
Churchill had allowed foreign inspectors to inspect Royal Air Force
planes and various installations and report back to Nazi Germany, I
don't think anyone in Britain would have believed that he seriously
intended to go to war.''

 GORE CRITICIZES BUSH FOR POSITION ON MISSILES
</HEADLINE>
  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ Vice President Al Gore, speaking Saturday at
the U.S. Military Academy, criticized Gov. George W. Bush's support
for a national missile defense system along with a reduction in
nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``An approach that combines serious unilateral reductions with
an attempt to build a massive defensive system will create
instability and thus undermine our security,'' Gore told the West
Point graduates at the academy's Michie Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuclear unilateralism will hinder, rather than help, arms
control,'' Gore said before handing out diplomas to the 944
graduates in dress uniforms and white gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reductions alone do not guarantee stability,'' he said. ``It
is how reductions are made and how they interact with defensive
systems that makes the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who became a specialist in arms control after he was
elected to Congress in the mid-1970s, said: ``Reductions have to be
carried out in a way that reduces the risk of confrontation. If
you're not careful, you could have a reduction of missiles and a
more dangerous world.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Feurth, Gore's longtime national security adviser, said
that Gore's comments Saturday were based on his long-standing
principles and the fact that President Clinton was going to Russia
next week, and that they were not intended as a response to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Feurth told reporters after Saturday's speech: ``Everything he
said about strategic stability and so on came straight out of
things that he was writing and talking about in the House of
Representatives and as a senator when he first began to enter the
field of arms control, and it is mainly triggered by the fact that
the president is about to leave for Moscow in a matter of a few
days to engage in exactly this set of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speech is not political, the speech is policy-based. The
ideas that the vice president presented have been in his record for
a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not mention Bush, his rival for the presidency, by
name. But Bush proposed just such a plan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was invited to the academy in his capacity as vice
president and his commencement speech was billed an official
vice-presidential event, not a campaign appearance. As such, he
told reporters on Friday night, his remarks on the academy grounds
would not be ``political'' in nature.
</P>
<P>
   But in a discussion with reporters on Friday night on Air Force
II on his way to Newburgh, N.Y., from Memphis, Tenn., Gore sharply
criticized Bush's proposal. He said it would reignite the arms
race, and by saying so, he seemed to ensure that his differences
with Bush would be part of the news media's coverage Saturday. His
comments Saturday were less pointed, but against the backdrop of
his comments on Friday night, his message was unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   His comments on Friday constituted Gore's first public reaction
to Bush's proposal, which the governor delivered in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing Bush for opposing the comprehensive test ban treaty,
which the Senate defeated last fall, Gore said on Friday: ``If you
kill the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that our country wrote and
tested all over the world and give a green light to more nuclear
testing all over the world and then send a signal that we're going
to concentrate not on deterring an attack with retaliation but
rather this hugely expensive Star Wars approach, that is a formula
for encouraging more offensive missiles aimed at the United States,
more nuclear testing around the world and a reignited arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at the graduation exercise, Gore outlined the Clinton
administration's efforts toward creating a national missile defense
system that would protect all 50 states from a limited attack. ``We
believe, however, that it is essential to do this in a way that
does not destroy the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,'' Gore said.
``The ABM Treaty is the cornerstone of strategic stability in our
relationship with Russia.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What Bush proposed would almost surely entail violating the ABM
Treaty of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in his speech on Tuesday at the National Press Club:
``While deterrence remains the first line of defense against
nuclear attack, the standoff of the Cold War was born of a
different time. Yet almost a decade after the end of the Cold War,
our nuclear policy still resides in that already distant past.''
</P>
<P>
   He proposed measures that would include building a defensive
system that would cover all 50 states and could be extended to
protect allies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In addition to
holding out the possibility of large unilateral arms cuts, he said
most American nuclear weapons should be removed from hair-trigger
alert status.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the cadets, Gore said of Clinton's Moscow
visit: ``This is an historic meeting. The president should leave
with the full support of the American people,'' a subtle reminder
to Republicans that partisan differences over national security
historically stop at the water's edge when the president travels
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The stage at Michie Stadium is one of the most prestigious
forums in military history, and the only political figures allowed
to speak from it are the president, vice president and the speaker
of the House of Representatives. This has drawn criticism in recent
days from former Sen. Bob Dole, who had announced his presidential
candidacy in 1995 and was invited _ then disinvited _to speak
because his appearance was deemed political.

<P>
   EMBALAM, India _ In this village at the southern tip of India,
the century-old temple has two doors.
</P>
<P>
   Through one lies tradition. People from the lowest castes and
menstruating women cannot pass its threshold. Inside, the devout
perform daily pujas, offering prayers. Through the second door lies
the Information Age, and anyone may enter.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare social experiment, the village elders have allowed one
side of the temple to house two solar-powered computers that give
this poor village a wealth of data, from the price of rice to the
day's most auspicious hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can get a job through this, I'll be happy,'' said V.
Aruna, 14, who pestered her father, a farmer, until he agreed that
she could come here each day to peck at a computer keyboard, where
she learned Word and PowerPoint. ``I want to work instead of
sitting in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time of growing unease about the global gap between
technology knows and know-nots, India is fast becoming a laboratory
for small experiments like the one at the temple that aim to link
isolated rural pockets to the borderless world of knowledge. Local
governments and nonprofit groups are testing new approaches to
provide villages where barely anyone can afford a telephone with
computer centers that are accessible to all.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, these experiments are still small and there are many
obstacles. The vast majority of Web sites are in English, a
language that more than 95 percent of Indians do not speak. Routine
power failures and overloaded telephone lines make connecting to
the Internet a frustrating proposition.
</P>
<P>
   And there are serious questions about whether countries like
India, weighed down by high rates of illiteracy and illness, should
spend heavily to provide villages that desperately need schools and
health clinics with what most would consider a luxury.
</P>
<P>
   But others say a well-placed computer, like a communal well or
an irrigation pump, may become another tool for development.
</P>
<P>
   Information from the computers in this area, where people live
in thatched mud huts, has saved the life of a milk cow named
Jayalakshmi, prevented blindness in an old woman named M. Minakshi
and routinely warned fishermen of stormy weather that could claim
lives.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet cafes have sprung up quickly even in small Indian
cities, it is in rural areas, where most people live, that
computers must spread if developing nations like India are to close
the yawning technology gap with rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   North America, with less than 5 percent of the world's
population, has more than half of its Internet users. South Asia _
home to more than a fifth of humanity _ has less than 1 percent,
according to the 1999 Human Development Report sponsored by the
U.N. Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem of making computers available to villagers has
led to divergent approaches. Two of the most intriguing efforts are
in the former French colony of Pondicherry and in the central state
of Madhya Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
   The Pondicherry project was created by the Madras-based M.S.
Swaminathan Research Foundation, a nonprofit organization that uses
science and technology to tackle poverty, with a $120,000 grant
from the Canadian government. The foundation provides villages with
free technology and information in exchange for the villages'
promise to house the computers and staff their operation.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of this approach to more of India's 600,000 villages
would ultimately require government money and manpower, with
support from nongovernmental organizations and philanthropies.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Madhya Pradesh approach is more entrepreneurial
and market-driven. Villages have bought computers with money from
their own budgets, and then franchised their operation to a local
person who charges 10 to 35 cents for government records and other
services available at the click of a mouse. The operators, who
receive no regular salary, keep most of the money but give a
portion back to the village and state governments.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the cow and the computer shows that sometimes the
simplest information is the most valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Some months back, Subrayan Panjaili, a round-faced woman who
cannot read or write, sat in the courtyard of her small home in the
village of Kizhur, in Pondicherry, with the family's only milk cow,
Jayalakshmi. For five days and nights, the cow moaned while in
labor. Something had gone wrong and she was unable to deliver her
calf. Panjaili grew ever more fearful that the cow would die.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only good income we have,'' she said, explaining
that the four gallons of milk the cow produced each day paid the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Panjaili's woebegone cow soon spread to Govindaswami, a
public-spirited farmer who uses only one name. The village's
computer, obtained through the Swaminathan Foundation, is in the
anteroom of his home. The computer is operated full time and for no
pay by his 23-year-old, college-educated daughter, Azhalarasi, who
used it to call a list of veterinarians in the area.
</P>
<P>
   One doctor arrived that night and, by the light of a bare
electric bulb, stuck his arm into Jayalakshmi, pulled out one of
the calf's spindly legs, tied a rope to it and dragged the calf out
into the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Swaminathan Foundation has sought to give the four villages
in its network other practical, local information, which is
distributed through the village computer network in the local
language, Tamil. Generally that kind of information is not on the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The network distributes the dates that roving medical camps will
be set up in various villages. M. Minakshi, 70, who said she felt
as if a sari had been draped over her right eye, went to one and
discovered that she needed cataract surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, the project's staff also download a map from a U.S.
Navy Web site that shows the wave heights and wind directions in
the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon in the fishing village of Veerampattinam,
loudspeakers fastened to poles along the beach blared out that
daily weather report. Bare-chested fishermen in loincloths who were
mending nets, repairing homemade wooden boats or just snoozing in
the sultry heat perked up to listen.
</P>
<P>
   The four villages taking part in the project are linked to the
foundation's hub through an ingenious wireless system. It was
dreamed up by V. Balaji, a graduate of the Indian Institute of
Technology at Kanpur, who oversees the project for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   While the foundation's model is relatively costly and may prove
difficult to replicate on a large scale, the government of
Pondicherry plans to expand the project to 50 more villages.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One immediate obstacle, as Balaji notes, is that local
bureaucrats have often been reluctant to give up their monopoly on
information, which can be a source of power used to extract bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping the bureaucrats will become public servants,''
said M.S. Swaminathan, the internationally known geneticist who
leads the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   One such public-spirited civil servant is Amit Agarwal, the
creator of the model computer project in the state of Madhya
Pradesh. It is Agarwal who has taken power out of the hands of
bureaucrats and given it to village entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Agarwal, 29, the chief executive of the Dhar district council,
said he believed that while low-level bureaucrats might be tempted
to demand bribes, an entrepreneur being paid to provide the records
retrieved on a computer would be more inclined to work hard.
</P>
<P>
   He has set up a model project in his district, one of India's
poorest, where young men have a franchise from the state to
distribute daily crop prices and commonly needed state records for
a small fee.
</P>
<P>
   Agarwal predicts that revenue-generating computer projects like
his will spread more quickly than those that depend on scarce state
funds. ``This is the paternalistic welfare model that the country
has been slowly discarding over the past decade as not having
worked,'' Agarwal said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the project was set up in January, 22 villages have each
bought a computer, a modem, a printer and a battery for $1,500 with
their own money and agreed to provide a small booth to house the
setup.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the state then picked a young person from the
village with at least a 10th-grade education to operate the
computer and gave him a franchise to sell information from the
state's computer network.
</P>
<P>
   For 25 to 35 cents, villagers buy printouts of documents that
they might have spent days trying to get from local bureaucrats:
land records, caste certificates and proof of income, among others.
</P>
<P>
   For another 25 cents, any citizen can send a complaint to the
state by e-mail _ ``My pension didn't arrive,'' ``My child's
teacher didn't show up,'' ``My village hand pump doesn't work'' _
and the state guarantees a reply within a week.
</P>
<P>
   And for 10 cents, a farmer can get a printout listing the prices
of any agricultural commodity sold at surrounding markets.
</P>
<P>
   At Bagdi village, wizened, sun-beaten farmers filed in to
collect the day's price lists for wheat, garlic and whatever other
crops they had to sell. They all said their knowledge of the rates
improved their negotiating leverage with middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the price he offers suits me, I'll sell it to him,'' said
Satya Narayan Khati, who grows wheat on his three acres.
``Otherwise, I'll take it to market myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bagdi, the computer booth is operated by Deepak Patel, 20, a
gaunt, lanky son of a farmer. Patel still helps milk the cows and
bring in the harvest, but he prefers his computers. After just a
few months, he is already making a good living from the long hours
he spends selling printouts.
</P>
<P>
   When people come in to e-mail a complaint to the state, Patel
writes out their grievances for them, since most residents of the
district are illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   In his booth, as in every computer center visited in Madhya
Pradesh and Pondicherry, children crowd in, clamoring for a chance
to play on this machine that their elders call a magic box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than farming,'' Patel said. ``Through this you
feel connected to the rest of the world.''

<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. _ Of all the things he is being called lately by
his critics, ``liberal'' and ``dove'' make Gov. Tom Ridge laugh out
loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet the only combat ever seen by the guy who wrote that
has been in front of a Nintendo machine,'' said Ridge, his
credentials as a Bronze Star combat veteran of Vietnam unsullied by
the slings and arrows now pelting him from within his own
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam-fighting experience in Vietnam of the husky,
55-year-old Pennsylvania governor comes in handy these days. He is
being targeted by the social conservative right for being a Roman
Catholic who unapologetically favors a woman's right to choose
abortion, yet remains prominently featured on a list of potential
running mates of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the putative
Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor says there is no litmus test, and I believe
him,'' Ridge said, referring to the simmering abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   But social and religious conservatives see things differently,
and have issued stern warnings to Bush of dire consequences in
November if he picks someone like Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The base in the Republican Party is pro-life,'' James C.
Dobson, the conservative religious leader, said on Wednesday. ``You
can't win without that base.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, his abortion rights stand firmly defying party platform
dogma, remains the most mentioned prospective running mate. He set
a Republican record for this heavily Democratic state with a
780,000-vote victory margin in his 1998 re-election. A Bush-Ridge
ticket might well deliver this critical battleground, the
fifth-largest state in electoral votes, to the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In two elections, Ridge has shown considerable crossover
attraction among Democratic voters. He has the power to garner up
to 30 percent of them, according to polls _ a factor that Bush must
weigh as he charts a centrist strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans also note that Bush had to be more sensitive
to the nation's large Catholic vote after his controversial speech
in the South Carolina primary at Bob Jones University, a campus
that critics denounce as anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ridge's support of abortion rights might signal a
harsh party split for some Republicans, others said his candidacy
as vice president would draw more women to the Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this wonderful speculation,'' remarked Ridge, his smile
broad but fatalistic as he noted that the decision on a running
mate was entirely Bush's to make after a long process involving ``a
lot of other people,'' in the Texas governor's words.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if? What if?'' asked Ridge, happily teasing himself as
much as his boosters and critics. He seems to be enjoying the
freedom of having no say in the matter as he looks forward to being
the state host at the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But as the vice-presidential question is debated, conservative
critics in National Review and other publications, nettled by his
support of abortion rights, are busily vetting Ridge's 12-year
record in Congress to argue that, even beyond the abortion issue,
he is not an authentic conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protectionist,'' another charge made against Ridge, brings
more open laughter here in the executive chamber of the governor,
who noted that he was a card-carrying member of the hod-carriers
union when he was a college student who worked in construction
during the summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for Nafta, in Congress,'' Ridge said, bemused at what
he was reading lately from conservative polemicists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, this gets comical,'' he continued. He repeatedly used
the word ``conservative'' to characterize himself in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Only the November election, he said, with all the variables
brought to the voters by the candidates and their campaigns, might
settle the question of whether the Republican Party is ready for an
abortion rights candidate on the ticket beside the anti-abortion
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the decibel level may be going down a little bit on
this issue,'' said Ridge, whose political career in Pennsylvania
has not measurably suffered from his support of abortion rights,
even after his being obliquely criticized by his bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think we're done with the very important struggle
we're having within the party as to how to deal with it,'' he
continued. ``Certainly, my friend Governor Bush disagrees with me,
and a majority of the delegates at the convention probably disagree
with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're not going to change the platform. But it's
interesting to note there are some people in the party who, instead
of defeating Al Gore, would suggest that if the No. 2, whether me
or somebody else, doesn't share their belief on abortion, they
might abandon the party.''
</P>
<P>
   One quarter where Ridge is bolstered in his insistence that he
is a true-blue conservative is across the Statehouse, within the
Democratic minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Ridge is a perfect fit for George Bush,'' said state Sen.
Christine Tartaglione, speaking in her role as the state Democratic
chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``His actions speak louder than his words,'' Tartaglione said,
contending that Ridge, in the state's recent tax cuts of more than
$1 billion, favored big business interests at the expense of needy
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all wait for Tom Ridge's leadership,'' she said scornfully.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's supporters quickly cite a raft of new social
welfare and education laws to argue that he is the very model of
the ``compassionate conservative'' that Bush has proclaimed as the
cornerstone of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And Ridge has just the sort of paradoxical touches in his resume
that politicians dream of.
</P>
<P>
   His parents were postwar strivers; his father, a Navy veteran,
worked two jobs to finance his children's parochial school tuition.
Up from public housing, the family bought a modest house in Erie,
that is still home to the governor's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My DNA is a little confused,'' Ridge said lightly in noting
that his father was a fervid blue-collar Democrat while his mother
was a no less fervid Republican ward worker. The family dinner
table was a forum that respected politics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Harvard after winning a needs-based
scholarship and, while studying at Dickinson Law School in
Pennsylvania was drafted into the Army and served in the infantry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dwell on Vietnam; I draw on it,'' said Ridge who, with
a similar margin of removal, recalls the feverish anti-war protests
at Harvard as a fascinating backdrop that did not draw him away
from his studies.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As the attacks by social conservatives heighten, the governor
does not hesitate to defend his view on abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult personal decision that has enormous
emotional, psychological, intensely physical and oftentimes
religious dimensions to it,'' he said. ``This is a tough decision
for people to make. One of the things I talk about is trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to whether I would place ultimate responsibility
in that very difficult personal decision, with so many dimensions
to it, in the hands of government _ I mean, some of the people in
my party would criminalize it! _ or leave it up to the individual,
leave it up to the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the intramural sniping, the old combat sergeant admits
he enjoys the extra political notice and power that seems to come
with the vice-presidential speculation, however fruitless it may
prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the what-if factor,'' Ridge said, describing a state of
``irrational exuberance'' that he is experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heck of a ride,'' the governor added. ``I've already
got a great job, and I'm going to help my old friend George Bush
get elected president. And you know? I think he can carry
Pennsylvania without me.''

CELL PHONES PROLIFERATE ON HIGHWAYS, RAISING SAFETY CONCERNS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Pa., N.Y.)  By JON NORDHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As millions of Americans travel this Memorial Day weekend they
are joined by family, friends and what has become for many an
indispensable companion on a car trip, the cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of other drivers will also be on the highways
equipped with wireless and Internet hookups in vehicles that can
deliver faxes to the driver's seat, provide maps to neighborhood
streets or faraway destinations, or route hungry travelers to good
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The information highway is merging with the nation's highways at
breakneck speed, and safety experts fear that with so many
distractions _ even television _ the devices may lead to an
increase in traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Some law enforcement officials say cell phones have become the
latest, and most common, distraction on the highway, and some have
begun to note an increase in the number of accidents caused by
drivers using cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   But safety researchers say no reliable data exist that show cell
phone usage by motorists to be any more distracting than tuning car
radios or drinking coffee.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the proliferation of cell phone use by drivers has
raised the concerns of public safety officials and the
telecommunications industry. A few communities, but no states, have
banned the use of phones while driving.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in a report
two years ago, recommended more research about cell phones in cars,
more education of drivers about their use and tracking by the
police when phones are thought to be involved in accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers say their experience tells them that
drivers are violating common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the communications found in the office and home are
becoming commonplace in cars and trucks and there's no question
they can be very distracting,'' said Col. Charles C. Hall, director
of the Florida Highway Patrol. ``Put a telephone in the hand of a
very aggressive driver and you have a greater problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry estimates that Americans now own more than 92
million cell phones, up from 69 million in 1998 and about 6 million
10 years ago. Surveys show that four out of five cell phone owners
will place or receive calls while driving. One out of four,
however, phone frequently while driving and a high percentage of
these are heavy, daily users.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the wireless industry and state governments need to do is
to constantly reach out to consumers and tell them that when they
get behind the wheel of a car they must drive responsibly,'' said
Tom Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, a trade organization in Washington representing about
400 manufacturers and providers of wireless equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my pet peeves is when individuals apply for a driver's
license they have to know how many feet they have to park away from
a driveway but absolutely nothing about the safe use of a phone
while driving,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said state governments have rightly rejected legislation
to restrict the use of hand-held phones by drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need more laws,'' he said. ``But we do need a lot
more in the way of public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Bills have been prepared in more than 20 states, including New
York, to limit cell phone use on the roads but all have failed.
</P>
<P>
   But similar measures keep popping up in pockets of local
government. Hilltown Township, Pa., a suburb north of Philadelphia,
is one of only a handful of communities that have laws controlling
phone calls from a car. Louis A. Mosiello, a Westchester County,
N.Y., legislator from Yonkers, is pressing for an ordinance in the
county to ban hand-held phones while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Public awareness and political action are temporarily heightened
at news of isolated incidents that link cell phones with highway
accidents. Robert Carratelli, 43, of West Palm Beach, Fla., was
convicted this month of six counts of vehicular homicide in
connection with an accident involving cell phone use last year in
Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   Phone company records showed Carratelli, an advertising
executive, was on his cell phone at the approximate time when his
speeding Mercedes ran a red light at 76 miles an hour and plowed
into a car carrying three retired couples on their way to a
concert. All six, who had retired to Florida from the New York City
area, died.

BASEBALL NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Superstar Pitcher Who Might Have Been a Yankee
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of November 1993, general managers were
meeting in Naples, Fla., and the Yankees' general manager, Gene
Michael, was there in quest of a starting pitcher. Among others,
Michael had an eye on a young right-hander employed by the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene Michael was one of the guys most interested in Pedro,''
recalled Fred Claire, who was then the Dodgers' general manager.
``He really was the only one who was inquiring. He had a great
interest. I said: `Gene, I don't want to talk to you about who you
might offer. I'm not going to trade him. He's a great young man and
has a great upside.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No pitcher ever had a greater upside than Pedro Martinez, the
dominating pitcher, who is scheduled to start for the Boston Red
Sox against the Yankees Sunday night. Had Michael been successful
in prying Martinez from the Dodgers, he could have been pitching
for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   As the Dodgers' plans developed, they did trade Martinez, less
than three weeks after Michael expressed his serious interest. They
traded him to the Montreal Expos because the Expos offered them a
second baseman, Delino DeShields. Jody Reed, who had been
Montreal's second baseman in 1993 and had become a free agent,
rejected an offer he shouldn't have refused. To his great regret,
Reed said no to a three-year, $7.8 million contract and later had
to accept a contract with Milwaukee for $350,000 for one year. As
much as Reed's decision hurt him economically, it hurt the Dodgers
competitively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, it turned out to be a terrible deal for us,''
Claire said. Had they not needed a second baseman, he added, he
would, as he told Michael, not have traded Martinez. But even given
that need, Claire said: ``What I didn't put enough weight on was
the spirit of Pedro. I recognized it but didn't put a high enough
value on it. This young man has something that few people I
encounter has and I should have recognized that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duquette, the general manager who acquired Martinez for the
Expos, left Montreal about two months later and became the Boston
general manager. He reluctantly left Martinez behind but was intent
on getting him again. He did, four years to the day after he
obtained him from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro has always been my favorite player,'' Duquette said,
``because of his unique skills and his personality and his
competitiveness. We are so lucky to have him. We owe a great debt
to the Expo organization. He was a gift to the franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beattie, Duquette's successor in Montreal, didn't want to
trade Martinez, but he explained why he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably could have paid him,'' Beattie said, ``but he
wasn't going to sign with us until we did other things to show we
were going to be competitive. We couldn't afford to do those other
things. We couldn't convince him, so we felt the best thing to do
was move him before he became a free agent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox won the arm of the right-hander by offering Carl
Pavano, a good young pitcher, and Tony Armas Jr., a minor league
pitcher they had received from the Yankees for Mike Stanley three
months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple clubs turned us down when we asked for their
players,'' Beattie said. ``I'm sure some of those organizations
look at it now and say, `How could we say no?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees wouldn't trade Eric Milton for Martinez (they sent
him to Minnesota for Chuck Knoblauch less than three months later),
and Cleveland declined to give up Bartolo Colon, who is in their
starting rotation now.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie can still feel the pain from trading Martinez. ``I
definitely would have loved to have kept him,'' he said. ``He's got
quality pitches, he's a great competitor, he's an intelligent
player and he works hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette credited Martinez with turning the Red Sox into a
legitimate contender. The Red Sox have reached the postseason in
each of the pitcher's first two seasons with them and appear to be
headed there again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who has won the Cy Young award in each league, gained
a permanent spot in postseason lore last October by pitching six
hitless innings of relief against Cleveland in the fifth and
deciding game of their division series. He followed that remarkable
performance by holding the Yankees to two hits in seven innings
after the Yankees had won the first two games of the league
championship series. The Yankees, however, won the next two games,
assuring that they wouldn't see Martinez in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a situation we certainly wanted to do everything we
could to avoid,'' David Cone said. ``I don't think any team in
baseball would want that scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's playoff performance wasn't even his best against the
Yankees last year. In September he struck out 17 and allowed just
one hit, a home run by Chili Davis. That gave him a two-start
record of 29 strikeouts and three hits allowed in 16 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could've won without any fielders behind him that night,''
Paul O'Neill said of the September game.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez enters Sunday night's game with the lowest earned run
average (1.19) and the lowest opponents' batting average (.167) in
the major leagues. Last season he had the majors' lowest ERA and
was three points away from having the lowest batting average
against.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what Sandy Koufax was like during his incredible
five-year run that everyone talks about,'' Cone said, ``but Pedro's
having that type of run, maybe even better. He's having arguably
one of the best runs of all time. One year, two year, three year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi of Oakland, one of this season's most productive
hitters, called Martinez's pitches ``electric.'' Larry Rothschild,
the Tampa Bay manager and a former pitcher and pitching coach, said
Martinez's fastball, curve and changeup are outstanding
individually and collectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an at-bat against him,'' Giambi said, ``you get one pitch
to hit and if you don't hit it, you're heading back to the
dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Giambi said that he likes to face Martinez. ``It's such a
challenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild, too, acknowledged that he enjoyed watching Martinez
work even if he beats the Devil Rays. ``I almost hate to admit
that,'' the manager said, ``but he's so good at what he does you
have to sit back and realize you're watching one of the best there
is and take solace from that.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Making Baseballs
</P>
<P>
   Major league officials were in Costa Rica last week touring the
Rawlings factory that makes major league baseballs. Orlando
Hernandez was there two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited twice, once before I signed and once after I
signed,'' said the Yankees pitcher, who lived in Costa Rica
immediately after defecting from Cuba. ``I've never seen anything
like that. I saw it in Cuba, but it wasn't the same. The quality of
the materials is better in Costa Rica. What impressed me the most
was the way they make a baseball. It took me 35 minutes to make a
baseball myself. The boss said to me, `You may be a good
ballplayer, but you don't know anything about making baseballs.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who apparently is the only major league player who
has visited the factory, was asked if the ball he made was juiced.
He laughed and said through a translator, ``If the baseballs were
made the way I made it, there would be no home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians' Pitching Woes
</P>
<P>
   For several years the Cleveland Indians tried unsuccessfully to
secure a No. 1 pitcher. Last winter they finally succeeded, luring
Chuck Finley into the fold as a free agent. The pitching gods,
however, are still laughing at them.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day earlier this month, two starters, Charles Nagy
and Jaret Wright, and a reliever, Ricardo Rincon, went on the
disabled list. Last week another reliever, Paul Shuey, joined them.
Wright was scheduled to return and start Saturday night, but Nagy
had bone chips removed from his right elbow and is expected to be
out for eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians used two rookies in their place last week. Paul
Rigdon dazzled the Yankees, shutting them out on two hits in his
seven-inning effort, but Tim Drew, brother of J.D., lasted only
three batters into the second inning against Detroit, giving up
five runs (three earned).
</P>
<P>
   Vidro's Hitting Soars
</P>
<P>
   When Jose Vidro first reached the major leagues, in 1997, he
replaced an injured Vladimir Guerrero on the Montreal roster. Last
week he supplanted the highly talented Guerrero as the Expos'
leading hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The unheralded second baseman, who in his first full major
league season last year batted .304, reached .399 last week and
then entered Saturday night's game in San Diego at a league-leading
.391 to Guerrero's .381.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked him as a hitter,'' Jim Beattie, the Expos'
general manager, said. ``He reminds me of Edgar Martinez in his
knowledge of hitting, the way he uses his hands to hit, the way he
uses the whole field to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Vidro had hit eight home runs, Beattie added,
``Edgar didn't have a lot of power when he came up, but he
developed it at the big league level. Jose has a chance to hit 20
to 30 home runs depending on how hot he gets. He has a great
approach to hitting and he's a smart player.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old switch-hitter also was leading the league in
hits (70) and multihit games (22) and was tied for the lead in
doubles (17). &QL;

FURIOUS DEBATE RAGES ON SLEEPING IN PUBLIC

<P>
   SANTA CRUZ, Calif. _ Every night, the people with no roofs to
sleep under sit on the benches along downtown Pacific Avenue. They
wait until the neon signs in the pubs go dark and the stream of
cars cruising down the street becomes a trickle. Then they take
their nighttime places.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe up against a doorway or behind the Safeway supermarket
trash bins, or, after a bit of a hike, in the woods, deep enough so
that the unleashed dogs won't sniff them out.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out where to sleep, an old-timer named Daryl said the
other day, is hard work. Not only must you be up and out by dawn.
``Where you start out,'' he said, ``isn't necessarily where you end
up the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because like so many cities all over the country, Santa
Cruz bans sleeping on the streets _ or, in fact, in cars, in parks,
under trees. But the police let the sleepers alone unless someone
complains. Still, spend a few days in one spot, Daryl said, and the
complaints come.
</P>
<P>
   But now Santa Cruz is defying the national trend in moving
homeless people out of public places. The City Council has voted to
create ``safe sleeping zones'' for homeless people in two
industrial parks. The sleeping zones, where people could sleep in
their vehicles or on the ground with their blankets or sleeping
bags, will have trash bins, portable toilets and a police officer
dedicated to patrolling those areas.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council passed the measure on Tuesday on a preliminary
4-2 vote (with one member absent) and is expected to pass a final
vote in two weeks. The measure will then take effect on a trial run
in mid-July, height of this beach-and-boardwalk town's tourist
season. In November, city voters will decide a ballot measure that
seeks to make the zones permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, proposed by Mayor Keith Sugar after intense public
pressure from a group that has been trying to have the sleeping ban
lifted for years (most recently by waging a five-month hunger
strike) comes with some restrictions. People could legally sleep in
the zones between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. Structures, tents, or other
camping accessories like stoves would continue to be illegal.
People would not be allowed within 300 feet of any home. And after
three nights in any one spot, they would have to move to another
spot at least 500 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities, including Berkeley and Eugene, Ore., have tried to
designate sleeping zones, only to abandon efforts when the zones
became unmanageable. But Santa Cruz, Sugar said, will be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a situation where people can come from out of town
and bed down,'' Sugar told skeptics after the vote. ``It will give
the homeless a place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are not so sure. Michael Rotkin, a self-described
``socialist-feminist'' who was absent for the vote but would have
voted no, said the measure will only undermine support for homeless
people. ``I've knocked on three-quarters of the doors in Santa
Cruz,'' he said, ``and the single biggest issue that people bring
up spontaneously is, what are you going to do about all the bums on
the streets? And these are political progressives.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Cruz, which is at least as politically left-wing as
Berkeley, has publicly agonized over its public sleeping ban for
years. Time and again the City Council has discussed the idea of
softening the law. Each time, people have objected. Business owners
here would complain that customers would be scared off by
panhandlers or drug users or the merely truly needy, tattered and
torn. Others wondered whether legalizing public sleeping would make
Santa Cruz one big camping ground.
</P>
<P>
   Still others objected on philosophical grounds. Shouldn't Santa
Cruz be helping these people off the streets rather than helping
them stay on them?
</P>
<P>
   The city, with 52,000 residents, offers an array of services for
its homeless population of 750 to 1,500 people, including a center
with free showers, meals, voice mail and lockers, schools for
homeless children. A number of churches and other nonprofit
organizations also provide services.
</P>
<P>
   But the city lacks shelter beds. David Norse, a proponent of
ending the sleeping ban, said that recent studies showed that
homeless people were four to 12 times as likely as housed people to
be the victims of attacks. The sleeping ban puts the homeless
``physically in peril,'' and ``throws all law into disrespect,'' he
said, because it means that the homeless are encouraged to break
laws in order to sleep at night.
</P>
<P>
   The measure to ease the ban, proponents say, will also clear the
homeless people out of downtown, making it easier on the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But summer seems to have a way of doing that too. The tourists
on their long Memorial Day weekend were out in force on Pacific
Avenue on Friday night, spilling out of the bars and hanging out on
the benches, and for some reason no one could say, there was not a
homeless person to be found.

<P>
   Pacers Are Taking Steps to Secure Their Future
</P>
<P>
   With each jab step, each shot from beyond the arc, Reggie
Miller's future grows more secure, just as the future of his
Indiana Pacers teammates grows more secure.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, who appeared to need a roster overhaul after the
younger, athletic Knicks jumped over them in last season's Eastern
Conference finals, have aged more gracefully than Dick Clark; more
gracefully than even Donnie Walsh could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of laughing about it,'' said Walsh, the Pacers' team
president, ``because everybody has been telling me for three or
four years, you know, `You guys are going to have to break up the
team.' I never really felt that way. That's why I'm really proud of
how they played, because I wasn't as sure this year as I was in
years past.''
</P>
<P>
   The playoff performances of Miller, Mark Jackson, Jalen Rose and
Austin Croshere have all but ensured Indiana's makeup for the next
few seasons. Walsh held off signing Miller and Jackson to
extensions, a development that caused a rift between the team and
its veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Only a month ago, Jackson's return was thought to be a huge
question mark. But as the Pacers try to advance to the finals for
the first time in the team's NBA history, the improvisational point
guard seems a good bet to return as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to re-sign Reggie,'' Walsh said. ``I just
didn't want to do an extension before I saw what the team was
because we had too many free agents. I've already made up my mind
on that. I would bring them all back.''
</P>
<P>
   With six of his top eight players eligible for free agency, the
notion of detonating the roster in the off-season was a
possibility. ``I didn't want to sign up a bunch of guys and then
the team goes down and you're stuck,'' Walsh said last month.
</P>
<P>
   But with Miller putting up impressive numbers in the playoffs _
he shot down Milwaukee in Game 5 of the first round, erupting for
41 points, and hit almost every important shot he needed to against
Philadelphia in the second round _ the likelihood of the All-Star
swingman finishing his career with the Pacers is almost guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   One overlooked fact in Indiana's run toward the finals was that
the Pacers were not only chasing an elusive championship, but many
of them were also playing for contracts. In the cases of Miller and
Jackson, they were playing for perhaps the last big money deal they
will sign in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   As the Knicks can attest to when Patrick Ewing put up monster
numbers during his free-agent-to-be season in 1996-97, financial
incentive can often make old legs look young again.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Miller, who is in the last year of a four-year, $36
million contract, had warranted the most lucrative deal possible
after this season under collective bargaining agreement rules,
Walsh said: ``You'd have to give it to him, because he's been
successful. I've always tried to pay guys their value, no matter
what their leverage is. So I don't go by where else he could go and
all that. When we sit down, my intention is to re-sign him.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller most likely won't sign for the absolute maximum, but
he'll get a deal close to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie has earned the right to finish his career in Indiana,''
said Arn Tellem, the agent for both Miller and Jackson. ``We have
every intention of working out a deal. They've shown, as a team,
they can play together and compete for a title for a few more
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh has one other major detail: finding Larry Bird's
replacement. Bird has said he would retire after three seasons as
coach, with the possibility that he might remain in the front
office. The more likely scenario has Bird serving as a consultant
from his Florida home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is he won't stick around after it's over,'' Walsh
said. ``I hate losing Larry. It's been as good a time as I've had.
This has been special. After he leaves, people will step back and
go, `You know, we were all writing that this guy could never be a
head coach.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Jordan Factor
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan attacked the game with ferocity when he played,
outmaneuvering opponents before he conquered them. He was so
competitive and driven, he wanted to bury you, whether the game was
basketball, golf or cards on the team charter.
</P>
<P>
   But in the world of contract negotiations, if the other side
thinks it lost and it thinks you have won handily, you have made a
bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   As he continues his coaching search for the Washington Wizards,
the franchise's head of basketball operations has talked with Lenny
Wilkens, St. John's coach Mike Jarvis and John Paxson, Jordan's
former teammate, and others.
</P>
<P>
   While the meetings begin in an amicable and cordial manner, they
often evolve into: This is how Michael does things, according to at
least two people with knowledge of his coaching search. It is not
that he bullies his prospective employees but that he almost
insultingly lowballs them, offering a pittance for arguably one of
the toughest, no-win jobs in the National Basketball Association,
according to the two people. Jordan was unavailable for comment.
Jarvis' contract demands exceeded what Jordan was willing to pay.
Somehow, agents have put into their clients' heads that they need
to be making at least what John Calipari made _ $3 million a season
_ to jump from a college to a pro job.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Jordan should not be blamed for his intransigence, the
idea that his candidates should be so giddy and thankful to be
working under the greatest player in history. After all, he is
constantly reminded of his exalted status by those close to him.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was in Chicago federal court last Tuesday over a
disagreement with his partners in a bankrupt restaurant. He is
asking that he be allowed to put his name on a future Chicago
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   His partners, Gene and Joseph Silverberg, a pair of Chicago
clothiers who developed Michael Jordan's Restaurant, say their
contract gives them control of the name in Chicago. The trial was
muddled with monotonous legalese. But how about that star witness,
David Falk?
</P>
<P>
   ``In marketing, Michael Jordan's name is like magic in a
bottle,'' Falk, the leadoff witness, told the court. He also
testified, ``Michael Jordan is the most popular human being on the
planet,'' conveniently leaving out Pope John Paul II and Muhammad
Ali, among others.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Associated Press, Falk also testified that the
Silverbergs made statements to the news media that denigrated
Jordan once the legal battle got under way, and thus failed to
adhere to provisions of the contract requiring them to protect the
superstar's ``clean-cut, Americana image.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan visited companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald's when he
emerged as a marketing giant, Falk said. Falk said that ``in
keeping with John Kennedy's inaugural, we told them, `Ask not what
Michael Jordan can do for you but ask what you can do for Michael
Jordan.'''
</P>
<P>
   You know what? Whoever takes the Washington job should kiss
Michael's Gucci loafers and work free. Shame on anyone who would
dare ask for more.
</P>
<P>
   Time to Open the Books
</P>
<P>
   First, it was the San Antonio Spurs shamelessly using Tim
Duncan, David Robinson and a recovering Sean Elliott to campaign
for a new arena last fall, essentially asking taxpayers to forgo
education and other civic needs to help an owner who could not
afford a new luxury-boxed, technodrome by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ray Wooldridge, the Charlotte co-owner, said the Hornets
would continue losing $1 million a month until the Charlotte
Coliseum was replaced. He proposed that the Hornets pay about 25
percent of the cost of a $250 million uptown arena, with the rest
coming from public sources.
</P>
<P>
   To the city's credit, Wooldridge has been asked by city council
members to prove that his team is losing nearly $1 million a month
by opening the team's accounting books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would assume they are losing money, but if we are coming
down to a significant amount of public money, then I think we need
to see their books,'' said Joe White, a council member who
advocates a public referendum on arena funding.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Graham, another council member, said: ``One of the
things they definitely don't have is public confidence. They have
to win the public-relations war, and right now they're losing
badly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets have lost money the past two seasons. Fewer than
12,000 fans attended a playoff game against the Philadelphia 76ers
last month, barely more than half of the building's capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But with new owners with deep pockets buying into the league _
like the billionaire Mark Cuban, who purchased the Dallas Mavericks
_ isn't it time the league took a harder look at luring more
financially solvent businessmen into the fold, instead of people
who ask their ticket-gouged fans to subsidize new buildings? &QL;

NFL NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reed, Rice and Irvin Near the End
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin was never an angel.
Away from the field, Irvin and trouble were often good pals. But as
a player, he was one of the toughest, at times most spectacular,
pass catchers of the past decade. Now he faces retirement because
of a spinal injury.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco wide receiver Jerry Rice is considered by many to
be the best ever at his position. But he has been in a battle with
his longtime team, which has considered cutting him for salary cap
reasons. A deal will probably be worked out soon, but the fact that
the team even contemplated releasing Rice is surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Reed played for the Buffalo Bills for 15 seasons before
recently being cut. He is second on the career reception list with
941. He is also looking for a job.
</P>
<P>
   This is the tough part of football, watching great players at
the end of their careers struggle with their mortality. Irvin, Rice
and Reed have had spectacular professional lives, yet all three are
now wondering how things will end, in some cases struggling
physically, and in others, getting little interest from teams
because of their ages.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was one of the main reasons the Cowboys won three Super
Bowls. He holds every significant team receiving record and is
among the top 10 in National Football League history in receptions
and yards.
</P>
<P>
   Then came that disastrous day in Philadelphia last season. On
Oct. 10 at Veterans Stadium, Irvin's head hit the turf awkwardly
after he was tackled, and doctors later discovered that he has a
narrow spinal cord that makes him susceptible to serious injury if
he takes a blow to the head or neck. He has not played since that
game.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recently advised Irvin that he should never play again
and he is mulling retirement. One Cowboys team official said in an
interview last week that Irvin had had a difficult time reaching
his decision and had been extremely emotional. The official also
said that even though Irvin planned to announce his retirement in
the coming weeks, there were still days when he went back and forth
and considered trying to play next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's hard on him,'' Dallas running back Emmitt Smith
said. ``It's hard on any man that has to put down the game in the
fashion that he has to put it down. It's a tough situation. Nobody
wants to go out like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice is fighting a similar battle. He wants to finish his career
in San Francisco, and he probably will. But it has not been easy.
The 49ers wanted Rice to take a serious pay cut or they threatened
to release him. Since then both sides have neared a compromise, but
once the season begins, Rice will have to deal with another
difficult aspect.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers will have to find a way to both satisfy Rice, who
still believes he is a first-option pass catcher, as well as their
other younger receivers. Rice is prone to complain if he does not
get the ball enough, and will probably do so again if not enough
passes are thrown his way.
</P>
<P>
   Reed did his share of complaining last season with the Bills as
his role diminished. This off-season the team decided to cut the
cord with Reed, who was Buffalo's fourth round pick in 1985. His
career numbers are dazzling. He has 941 catches for 13,095 yards
and 86 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But now he cannot catch on with another team, and he is trying.
Chances are another team will pick him up later this summer, but
right now teams want to wait until after the June 1 cut day and see
if other wide receivers, younger ones, are available. Reed could
end up with his former general manager, Bill Polian, now in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, fans may be forced to watch the three men go through some
uncomfortable times. Irvin will probably retire, and Rice and Reed
will try to play with declining skills. Still, the place in history
of Irvin, Rice and Reed is assured, especially for the latter two,
who are locks for the Hall of Fame. And Irvin has a good chance of
joining them in Canton, Ohio, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Owners Reward Assistants
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's owners meetings last week produced some interesting
news. Among the topics:
</P>
<P>
   _ When the league expands to 32 teams in 2002 with the addition
of the Houston franchise, the number of playoff teams will most
likely swell from 12 to 14. The last time the league increased the
size of its playoff field was in 1990, from 10 to 12 teams.
</P>
<P>
   _ The NFL expanded its ``violent crime policy'' _ now called the
``personal conduct policy.'' The additions make good sense. The
league's screening process of incoming players will now include
testing, interviewing and evaluating at the annual scouting
combine. There will also be a mandatory intervention process to
support and counsel at-risk players as well as the training of
coaches by professional counselors to identify at-risk players.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hundreds of assistant coaches, through the NFL Coaches
Association, for months have been negotiating with the league for
improved benefits. The main goal of the coaches was to lower the
retirement age from 65. Coaches wanted to use a formula that would
allow them to receive retirement benefits once a combination of age
and years in service reaches 75. In other words, if an assistant is
50 years old, and has coached in the league for 25 years, he would
be eligible to retire and receive benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches got their wish. Owners approved that new retirement
formula by a vote of 30-1. That is a victory for the assistant
coaches who were seriously contemplating a lawsuit against the
owners. This also shows that owners will at least listen to a
convincing argument, which the assistants had.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just happy the owners have done something significant
for the coaches,'' said Larry Kennan, executive director of the
coaches association. ``The owners were very gracious and we are
appreciative of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The assistant coaches believe that the NFL might set up a
committee of owners and head coaches to address the future concerns
of assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Incomplete Hostility
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shanahan was coach of the Oakland Raiders over a decade
ago, fired by the owner, Al Davis, after just 20 games. Shanahan
became coach of the Denver Broncos in 1995 and since then is 9-1
against the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   The current hostility between Shanahan and Davis was rooted in
Shanahan's dismissal and never subsided. One example of the
animosity, from several years ago, was when Shanahan asked
quarterback Elvis Grbac during warm-ups to throw a pass in the
direction of Davis. The ball barely missed Davis' head. Davis then
turned and made an obscene gesture toward Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between the two men and their organizations escalated
last weekend. Davis publicly complained that Denver circumvented
the salary cap by deferring $22 million in total payments to
running back Terrell Davis and the retired quarterback John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Bowlen, the Denver owner, contends he did not know the
payments had to be made immediately, and once informed otherwise by
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, made those payments at once. Bowlen
said Davis was making the charges because the Broncos consistently
beat Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of salary-cap violations goes beyond the Broncos and
Raiders and is a hot topic in the league right now. The Pittsburgh
Steelers were recently fined $150,000 by the NFL for secretly
agreeing to pay offensive tackle Will Wolford $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is also under investigation for possible
salary-cap abuses.

FROM THE SHELTERED LIFE TO THE POLE POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Greg Ray is a rebel, albeit one who wears mousse
and crisply pleated pants.
</P>
<P>
   His parents fiercely prohibited him from racing cars or doing
anything remotely dangerous growing up in Plano, Texas. They told
him he could not have Go Karts, Jet Skis or even the sports car he
had saved money for by working throughout high school.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ray could not have speed, of course he craved it all the
more. He was addicted to watching the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   At 25 he had a wife, a successful career in the family business
renting and chartering yachts, and two Porsches in the garage. But
watching reruns of Indy races on cable at 2 a.m., yelling at the
drivers making mistakes, Ray had an early midlife crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think you are so good,'' the voice inside him said,
``why don't you try it?'' Eight months later, without telling his
parents, Ray went to driving school. He won the race there, and
then nine of his next 10.
</P>
<P>
   From daydreaming about being Racer X sneaking into the back row
of the Indy 500, Ray, now 33, is sitting on the pole Sunday for the
84th Indianapolis 500. He is the reigning Indy Racing League
champion and is no longer anonymous. His father, Benny, is no
longer critical. His mother, Ginger, is still petrified whenever he
gets behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had started racing go carts earlier, maybe I would have
won Indy a few times by now, but who knows?'' Ray said. ``I think
it came at the right time. I feel more blessed to have lived 25
years on the other side of the fence as a spectator. And then when
I got involved, to find I had natural ability, I think I had a lot
more respect for it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ray bought a $250,000 truck, trailer and car to jump-start
his career in 1991, his father rebuked him for making an
irresponsible business decision. ``He called me five different ways
of stupid,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   The two barely spoke for his first year in racing. But with his
father in attendance for the first time the next year, Ray went
from starting last to passing the champion on the final lap of a
race at the Texas Motor Speedway, and his father was converted.
``We laugh about it now,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray had more trouble proving his worth to sponsors when he moved
up to the IRL in 1997, after winning championships in smaller
series. It was at Indy in 1998 that he made his breakthrough:
driving for the low-budget Thomas Knapp Motorsports, Ray was the
second-fastest qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one car, two engines, four mechanics and one driver,''
Ray recalled. And little else. Fans were handing him $20 and $50
bills to finance his ride, and he tacked one to the inside of his
car.
</P>
<P>
   Ray led 18 laps that year before he fell out of the race with
gearbox problems. But his aggressive style was enough to get him
noticed, and he signed with the high-profile Team Menard at the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday Ray will make his fourth start at Indy, having edged
the driver from the rival Championship Auto Racing Teams series,
Juan Montoya, by a tenth of a second in qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya, driving for Chip Ganassi, began racing when he was 5 in
Colombia. His early success is in stark contrast to Ray's late
development, and the two drivers represent an underlying story to
this year's race.
</P>
<P>
   Ganassi is the only CART team at Indy, ending a five-year
drought but not the political feud with the IRL. The better known
open-wheel racers are associated with CART, which has unofficially
boycotted the race since 1996 when the Indianapolis Motor Speedway
president, Tony George, formed the IRL and required different
engine specifications.
</P>
<P>
   While the Indy 500 has been depleted of stars the last four
years, there is a sense of excitement pulsing through the Brickyard
this year. With Montoya, Jimmy Vasser and Al Unser Jr., in the
race, winning would be much more significant, Ray said. ``By
bringing all the drivers together, it allows you to assess,'' Ray
said. ``You want the biggest challenge you can get, so if you are
able to come out on top, it means something.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray commented on the significance of the two series' coming
together. ``I would like to see everybody in the same arena on a
weekly basis,'' he said. ``But CART, IRL, whatever, I'm just a
driver. I want to win; it's not one series versus the other. It's
drivers versus the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but the mechanics did not see it that way when Ray
snatched the pole from Montoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came in after qualifying, I saw just about every
mechanic from every Indy Racing League team high-fiving my car,''
Ray said.

ON TENNIS: BEYOND AGING STARS, U.S. TALENT IS SCARCE 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Take a cursory look at the men's draw for the French
Open, which begins here Monday, and U.S. tennis appears to remain
in fine shape and gifted hands. At the top is the No. 1-seeded
player, the defending champion and future Hall of Fame inductee
Andre Agassi. At the bottom is the second-seeded and future Hall of
Famer Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras and Agassi have been the world's most successful and
visible players over the last decade: winning 18 Grand Slam singles
titles between them and maintaining, with able support from Michael
Chang, Todd Martin and the recently retired Jim Courier, the United
States' place at the top of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   But if you look more closely at the handwriting on the wall in
Paris, a more troubling picture emerges. Agassi and Sampras are the
only Americans who are seeded, and of the eight other U.S. men who
will play at Stade Roland Garros, the majority are older than age
24 and no longer at the peak of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   As for the seven U.S. men who tried to play their way into this
Grand Slam event, not one made it past the first round in last
week's qualifying tournament. And in the last five Grand Slam
events, only two U.S. men have advanced through the qualifying
tournament for the main draw: 30-year-old Alex O'Brien at this
year's Australian Open and 33-year-old Richey Reneberg at last
year's Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras and Agassi are still motivated and intimidating, but
Agassi is now 30 and Sampras is 28 and increasingly injury prone.
Where is the next wave? And more important, is there a next wave?
</P>
<P>
   Nick Bollettieri, the coach whose academy in Bradenton, Fla.,
was the Darwinian place where Agassi, Courier and other top
Americans developed their forehands and attitude, is afraid he
knows the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in for a dry spell,'' he said. ``If you check the New
York Yankees out 10 to 15 years ago, they were winning everything,
and they forgot their farm team and then went into a tremendous
drought. And that is exactly what is going to happen to American
men's tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Solomon, another prominent U.S. coach and a former French
Open finalist, is similarly pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My true opinion, and I won't win any popularity contests with
this, is that our system is an antiquated system as far as
producing champions,'' he said. ``They say it's a cyclical thing.
But I say no. We have a gap, and it looks like it will be a big
gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon added: ``It's going to be an awful situation in three to
four years when all these guys stop. The USTA is going to have egg
on its face when it's the round of 16 at the U.S. Open and there
are no American players in it. And if there are no American guys
around, who in this country is going to want to watch it and follow
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the U.S. Tennis Association are well aware of the
risk, but they take heart from the excellent recent play of Andy
Roddick, a 17-year-old from Boca Raton, Fla., who is the world's
top-ranked junior and turned professional in March.
</P>
<P>
   They also point to a series of initiatives the organization has
begun in the last three years, which include increasing the number
of small professional events in the United States, tinkering with
the junior tennis system and creating a comprehensive regional
network staffed by instructors who have either played or coached at
the elite level.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came into this job 2 1/2 years ago, obviously the
question was, `Where are the next American stars?''' the USTA's
director of player development, Doug MacCurdy, said. ``I'm a little
more interested in the whole system of development and ensuring
that we have a lot of players to draw from. At our strongest point
in men's tennis as a nation, we had a lot of players battling each
other and by natural selection some moved into the upper ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a system does not produce a Sampras or Agassi or a Yevgeny
Kafelnikov. But a system can produce, like Spain and Sweden have
shown, an awful lot of good players, and we have to use that
numbers game to our advantage, because I would assume there are
probably still a lot more people playing tennis in the United
States than anywhere else and recent participation levels are
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   It also bears remembering what happened the last time there was
widespread concern about the U.S. men's game. That was in the late
1980s, when John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors were in decline. For a
three-year span _ from 1986 to 1988 _ no U.S. man reached a Grand
Slam singles final, and in 1987, amid gloomy predictions of a
long-term void, the USTA created its first player development
program to help foster and finance young talent at home.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the next wave was already preparing to break.
Agassi reached No. 3 in the world in 1988. In 1989, Chang became
the youngest man to win the French Open. Sampras became the
youngest man to win the U.S. Open in 1990, and the following year,
Courier broke through, beating Agassi in the French Open final and
soon reaching No. 1 in the world.
</P>
<P>
   End of crisis. End of concern. Until now, when the
highest-ranked U.S. man under the age of 25 is Jan-Michael Gambill,
currently 67th on the ATP list at age 22. Behind him are
23-year-old Paul Goldstein, who is 79th, and 23-year-old Justin
Gimelstob, 99th, followed by six young Americans ranked between 145
and 212: Cecil Mamiit, Michael Russell, Kevin Kim, Bob Bryan,
Taylor Dent and James Blake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I could certainly not say that here are three players
who will fill the shoes of Sampras and Agassi and the others at the
top of the game, I do think there will be a certain opening, and
somebody will walk through it,'' MacCurdy said.
</P>
<P>
   Chang agrees that there could be surprises. ``I don't think when
we came out that anyone ever thought we were going to do so well,
so I think time will tell a lot for the next bunch,'' Chang said.
``But all I know is that I don't think you're going to see a group
like our group for a long time. I'm not just talking about the four
of us who won Grand Slams. I'm also talking about Todd Martin, Mal
Washington, David Wheaton and Jeff Tarango. All these guys were
from the same class, and you just don't see that many coming in
such a large group behind us.''

<P>
   The volume of top U.S. players has been decreasing regularly
since the Open era began in 1968. At the U.S. Open that year, 48 of
the 96 players in the men's draw were Americans, as were 51 of the
64 in the women's draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at every decade after that, and it has been a fairly
steady decline to where it is now: about 20 percent of the women
and 15 percent of the men, and that includes wild cards,'' MacCurdy
said. ``I'd attribute that primarily to the growing popularity of
and involvement in the game in the rest of the world, and a lot of
steps federations and individuals took.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy was the first nation to begin a national tennis school in
the 1970s, but it has been in other European countries like France,
the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the Czech
Republic, Austria and Spain that the greatest developmental strides
have been made. Spain has been particularly successful in producing
top men's players. At the end of 1999, it had 12 players in the top
100 _ one more than the United States _ even though stars like Alex
Corretja and Carlos Moya had poor seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Spain has succeeded for a variety of reasons. By developing an
extensive system of satellite and challenger tournaments,
essentially minor leagues, it allowed plenty of chances for its
players to acquire experience and ranking points close to home.
Many young Spanish coaches were also willing to take financial
risks and sacrifice their personal lives by traveling with young
prospects on the circuit, and the fact that nearly all the best
facilities are in Barcelona meant that the top players could train
and develop together frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have each other to compete against, and that's what I had
with Andre and Michael,'' Sampras said. ``You need rivals, good
competitors at home. It seems to me every time you turn your head
in the locker room there's another young Spaniard coming up.
Unfortunately in our country, it's a little thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Another competitive advantage is that because of differences in
school requirements, top Spanish players can begin playing full
time earlier than Americans. Corretja and the newest Spanish star,
Juan Carlos Ferrero, who is seeded 16th in his first French Open,
have been playing satellite events since their midteens. The same
is happening in France and in parts of South America, which has
reassumed a prominent position in the men's game in the wake of the
success of Chile's Marcelo Rios and the Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the men's game, there are probably a couple of thousand
good players who are playing virtually full-time tennis at the ages
of 15, 16, 17,'' MacCurdy said. ``Obviously it doesn't work out for
a lot of them. But very few American kids at that age would take
the risk and say, `I'm going to just play tennis.' The young
professional is a problem for us.''
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, the USTA has increased the number of challenger
and satellite events in the United States from 46 in 1993 to 100
this year. It has also increased the number of International Tennis
Federation junior events in the United States from eight to 13 in
the last three years. Perhaps most significant, it has sent more
full-time coaches on the road with small groups of young
professionals who might otherwise lack the means to hire such
experts at a critical phase in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say my major goal would be to stop the bleeding that has
gone on for such a long while,'' MacCurdy said. ``And to begin to
add fairly slowly. I'd love to see one or two additional top 100
players a year.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Mamiit and Goldstein are still trying to break into
the top 70 on the ATP list at age 23, younger players like Lleyton
Hewitt of Australia, Marat Safin of Russia, Andreas Vinciguerra of
Sweden, Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina and Ferrero (all 20 or
younger) have already won tournaments and are considered major
threats in Grand Slam events.
</P>
<P>
   Precocious success is rarely a coincidence in tennis. Remember
Sampras, Agassi and Chang. And unless the Americans can make up
lost ground and time in a hurry, it will be very difficult for
their fans at home to forget Sampras, Agassi and Chang in the lean
years ahead.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENNINGTON, Vt. _ Bennington College, a tiny, quirky, hilltop
jewel box of liberal artsiness, is hardly a stranger to
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1932 as a women's college challenging educational
orthodoxy, the upstart developed a history of innovation, a
tradition of teacher-practitioners _ often cutting-edge figures in
art, drama, dance and literature _ working in close relationship
with their student-apprentices and, in recent decades, academic
politics of exceeding viciousness.
</P>
<P>
   But with the college having fallen on hard times by 1994, its
niche nibbled away by changes in the Ivy League and other
institutions, its student body reduced in quantity and quality, its
faculty lapsing toward mediocrity and its finances in peril, the
trustees, the administration and the faculty came up with a
restructuring plan called the Symposium after a two-year agonizing
reappraisal.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the faculty _ 26 of 79 professors _ was fired in a
single stroke in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people knew about Bennington was that it's the most
expensive college,'' said Elizabeth Coleman, the tough-minded
president who came to Bennington after serving as dean of the
undergraduate division at the New School University in New York
City. But, she said, that was ``the only thing'' they knew.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived, in 1987, she was shocked to discover that
College Board scores at the once highly selective school had fallen
to an average 1100 out of a possible 1600.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the college administration says, Bennington is on the road
to recovery, with money raised, admissions rising and three
dormitories planned. But the college is once again in turmoil with
dissident and dismissed faculty members casting Coleman as a
dictatorial figure who crushes any criticism. Two trustees have
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Hoagland, the distinguished nature essayist who is
perhaps the best-known faculty member, has publicly called for
Coleman's resignation, as has the writer Jamaica Kincaid, who has
taught at the college and is married to a member of the music
faculty, Allan Shawn.
</P>
<P>
   The infighting has been bitter. In an exchange of letters in the
local newspaper, The Bennington Banner, Mary Oliver, who holds a
Pulitzer Prize in poetry and an endowed chair at Bennington and
supports Coleman, told Kincaid, in so many words, to stick to her
gardening.
</P>
<P>
   The past academic year has been marked by the dismissal of four
faculty members _ one in the middle of the semester _ seen by their
supporters as critics of the administration and by Coleman as
having fallen short in their professional qualifications and
responsibilities. The novelist Roland Merullo, who had counted
himself a close friend of Coleman's, resigned his teaching job in
protest. There have been emotional meetings on campus, and a
protest demonstration was mounted by the American Association of
University Professors demanding tenure protection.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking is that nearly all of the critics, in their
next few breaths, give Coleman credit for having saved the college
six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did good for the college _ in fact, she may have saved it
_ in her first half-dozen years,'' Hoagland said in an interview.
``But her temperament is a warrior temperament _ it's not right for
the healing process that's needed now. She is vindictive; she has
proven that a number of times.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the trustees dated March 28, pecked out on one of
the old manual typewriters on which he has written 17 books and
more than 100 essays, Hoagland wrote, ``I have never seen a faculty
as intimidated and unhappy as Bennington's is now, nor autocratic
power exercised so quirkily and punitively by a college president,
at such a cost to academic freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Hoagland's characterization of her personality,
Coleman replied: ``I think it's silly. It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 Symposium changes, which had attracted national
attention _ not all of it favorable _ included abolishing
traditional departments like literature, which had become political
power centers, and setting up a new employment system. Bennington
had what was called ``presumptive tenure,'' with five-year
contracts that, in practice, were almost always renewed. Now there
would be shorter contracts and a faculty review process. Coleman
said she intended to restore a standard of high achievement in the
teachers' outside professional work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to create a continuum between the work they were
doing in the world and their teaching at Bennington,'' Coleman said
in a two-hour interview. ``The board said, `Let's make the most
exciting, compelling design possible. Let's go for the gold.' In a
funny way they could do this because they had nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall semester, Coleman declined to renew the contracts of
two teachers, Steven Cramer, a poet, and Tony Eprile, a South
African novelist, even though they had been recommended by the
faculty review committee.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the trustees' chairman, John W. Barr, an investment
banker and poet, wrote a memorandum to the faculty suggesting that
the review committee be scrapped because its ``tendency toward
uniform enthusiasm'' for rehiring teachers made its recommendations
``unilluminating and frequently interchangeable.'' All five
committee members resigned in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as spring semester began, Coleman told Derek E. Campbell,
a popular, 59-year-old drama professor who had taught here for nine
years and had been highly recommended by the review committee, that
his contract would not be renewed. She said he had not acted enough
in theaters outside the area.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell contends he was let go for criticizing Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dismissal has been a clear and unambiguous example of abuse
of power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, like others, he said he had been initially supportive of
Coleman's innovations: ``I thought the college was headed for
disaster. Her determination, her vision, her energy, saved us from
imminent closure. She kept this institution alive. Liz sees herself
as an educational visionary. But she cannot tolerate dissension or
dialogue.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's dismissal was ``the last straw,'' Merullo wrote in a
letter of resignation on March 4. ``In working so hard to rescue
Bennington and make it flourish, in putting in place your vision
for a different kind of higher education, you have, of late,
repeatedly crossed the line of basic human decency and are creating
a culture laced with quiet fear.''
</P>
<P>
   As controversy mounted, a philosophy professor, Carlin Romano,
was quoted in The Chronicle of Higher Education as calling Coleman
``a serial violator of academic freedom'' and predicting that he
would be fired.
</P>
<P>
   He was, almost immediately. But Coleman and other officials say
it was because he was chronically late with the evaluations
students get instead of grades and that he had made threats to a
dean.
</P>
<P>
   The college spokesman, David Rees, insisted that the process at
Bennington was actually a triumphant one. ``Separate incidents have
been bundled together,'' he said, ``to create the impression that
something dark and ominous is going on here.''

TURKEY UNWRAPS THE DARKEST HOURS IN ITS PAINFUL PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ When a Turkish prosecutor announced recently
that he wanted to indict Gen. Kenan Evren, who led the 1980
military coup, officials in Ankara were not amused.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly announced that the prosecutor had been placed in
semiretirement, and then said he would be investigated for abusing
his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years I waited for someone to open this case, but too much
time was passing so I decided to do it myself,'' said the
prosecutor, Sacit Kayasu. ``This army is my army, and it should
protect me, not repress me.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains highly unlikely that Evren, now an 83-year-old
retiree, will ever be called to account for his three unsuccessful
coup attempts, or for the one that succeeded in September 1980, or
for the excesses committed in the three years of military rule that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that a prosecutor could even consider indicting him
reflects a new climate in which the coup, along with other painful
episodes in modern Turkish history, can be discussed more openly
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving power in 1983, the military imposed a law giving
itself immunity from prosecution for crimes committed in the period
when it ran the country. A move to repeal that law is gathering
strength, though there is no immediate prospect of a repeal.
</P>
<P>
   According to the official version of the events of 1980, Turkey
had fallen into such chaos _ with people cowering in their homes as
cities were besieged by terror _ that the military was forced to
intervene. The arrest of thousands of people after the coup is said
to have been a regrettable necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to prosecute Evren are not the only signs that a
revisionist view is now emerging. Two new films portray the torture
that was widespread in military prisons.
</P>
<P>
   One of the films, ``Where the Rose Wilted,'' tells the story of
an innocent man who is arrested after the coup and, in intensely
graphic scenes, savagely tortured by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can they do this?'' one character wonders. ``Even beasts
wouldn't do such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The other film, ``After the Fall,'' tells the story of the coup
through the eyes of a 5-year-old boy whose family is shattered by
its effects. His parents are arrested and tortured, his grandmother
collapses and dies in an army raid on her house, and his
grandfather begins losing his mind as he wonders who is responsible
for the tragedy unfolding around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one family in a small village suffered so much from the
coup, imagine what happened to the whole country,'' said the film's
director, Atif Yilmaz. ``The effects of the coup are still with us.
A lot of people are still carrying scars after 20 years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some of those who were tortured after the coup have gone on to
become successful in business, journalism and academia. A handful
have even been elected to Parliament, including one man whose
glistening teeth are all false, replacements for the ones smashed
out in torture sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's finally becoming possible to acknowledge and discuss
these things,'' Yilmaz said. ``There's more openness and more
desire for honesty. Part of it comes from our moving closer to the
European Union, but a lot of it just has to do with Turkey starting
to grow up. What people like me are doing is trying to give this
country back its memory.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1980 coup is not the only sensitive subject that filmmakers
are beginning to confront. One much praised new film deals with the
``wealth tax'' that was imposed on Christian and Jewish Turks in
the 1940s with the intention of bankrupting them or forcing them to
emigrate. Another portrays Kurds as victims of discrimination and
military repression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say the military likes this,'' said a foreign
ambassador posted in Ankara, ``but they're letting it happen.''

AFTER GIULIANI: NEW STRATEGIES FOR THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Senate race has been transformed from a
narrow battle over a tiny number of undecided voters into a broad
and complex contest, with voting blocs and geographic regions that
had seemed fixed in place suddenly churned into play by Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's departure, Republican and Democratic strategists
say.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republican candidate, and Hillary
Rodham Clinton, the Democrat, said that since the political
calculus of the race has now been scrambled, they have been forced
to change tactics and abandon long-held assumptions _ that Clinton
would be an unusually strong candidate upstate, for example, or
that Giuliani would encroach on Democratic voting blocs.
</P>
<P>
   This is one reason that when Clinton made her first campaign
appearance after Lazio completed his announcement tour last week,
she did it in Westchester County, just north of New York City,
before an audience of elderly voters. The suburbs now seem at least
slightly more hospitable to Clinton with Giuliani out of the race,
and the elderly _ always among the most dutiful voters come
Election Day _ have been identified by Clinton's advisers as more
open to her appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Lazio, once he concludes his acceptance speech at the
Republican convention in Buffalo on Tuesday, plans to make a
theatrical departure in a bus caravan, which will roll through the
small towns and farmlands of upstate New York for two full days. It
will be the second time that the new candidate has turned up in a
part of the state where Giuliani had rarely been seen.
</P>
<P>
   And plans call for Lazio to make a concerted appeal to moderate
and even to conservative voters, who some upstate Republicans
feared had been alienated by Giuliani's manner and the public
unraveling of his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the calculations evident in the candidates'
schedules show how much this has reverted to a traditional race for
Senate, albeit one including a first lady. Both sides are relying
on historical models in trying to assemble winning coalitions,
based on appeals to different parts of the state and different
voting groups.
</P>
<P>
   But after months in which Clinton and Giuliani courted a state
in which most voters seemed firmly set in their positions, both
campaigns have concluded that Clinton and Lazio are now facing a
vastly more complex and fluid political picture.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to both candidates agreed, to a striking extent, on the
ways the political deck had been reshuffled. Not surprisingly, they
disagreed on which of the two candidates would benefit from it, and
both claimed the advantage. The advisers said that any polls taken
so early measuring the support of Lazio were almost certainly
unreliable, given the tumult caused by Giuliani's leaving the race,
and the short time Lazio has been on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest shift is in the changing assessments by Republicans
and Democrats of which regions favor which candidates.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani was in the race, upstate New York had seemed to be
unusually strong ground for Clinton, a matter of some concern for
Republican leaders, because upstate has always provided the
electoral base for Republicans, a counter to the advantage that
Democrats have in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Her appeal upstate was the result of Clinton's near-constant
visits upstate, as well as the problems inherent in running a New
York City mayor for office in a part of the state that has always
viewed the city with deep suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Several upstate Republicans said last week that Giuliani's
chances would have been further eroded by the revelations about his
marriage, and that before he quit, they had grown more pessimistic
about how he would do there against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is now planning what aides said would be a summer-long
charge to recapture that part of the state, and upstate Republicans
have cheered the end of the turmoil that had clouded the Republican
Party and are pleased that their candidate is a Long Island
congressman rather than a New York City mayor. ``There is almost a
sigh of relief,'' said state Sen. Thomas Libous, a Republican from
Binghamton and a senior adviser to Lazio. ``No question: upstate is
back in play.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of Clinton's advisers acknowledged that Lazio could be
much more attractive to upstate voters than the mayor, and that he
was already showing a level of interest in the contest that
Giuliani never had. Still, Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de
Blasio, said he was not worried. ``Hillary has spent so much time
upstate that Lazio will not find it easy to cut into her support
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may now find that opportunities lost upstate might be
opportunities gained in the suburbs. The counties around New York
City had been extremely supportive of Giuliani's candidacy _ a
testimony to his nightly dominance of television news and to the
credit that suburban voters gave him for the improved fortunes of a
city where so many of them go for work and pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Now the race has, however improbably, turned into a contest
between two suburban candidates, one from Suffolk County on Long
Island who is barely known outside his district, and the other a
first lady who lives, at least sometimes, in Westchester. Clinton
spent two days campaigning in the suburbs last week, and she plans
to return to Westchester on Monday for an event marking Memorial
Day.
</P>
<P>
   As a final matter of geography, Lazio is unlikely to have the
level of support that Giuliani would have drawn in New York City.
He will probably spend a minimal amount of time there, in deference
to the emerging political reality of this state and because he will
not want to do anything to remind Clinton's voters to turn out.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The roles of nearly all the major New York voting blocs _
blacks, women, Jews, and gays in particular _ have shifted almost
as suddenly, though not as clearly.
</P>
<P>
   Most obviously, advisers to both candidates have concluded that
Clinton cannot count on the large turnout among black voters that
seemed likely with Giuliani at the top of the ticket. Republicans
argued that Clinton would have to spend more time in New York City
to ensure that Democratic voters turn out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the race was against the mayor, there was a guaranteed
base of voters that would vote against him,'' said Zenia Mucha, the
senior adviser to Gov. George Pataki. ``That is no longer the case.
Mrs. Clinton will now have to spend an enormous amount of time and
energy making a case for herself with the voters that were against
the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Clinton may now have an opening to voters who have
tended to be Democratic but with whom Giuliani was competitive _ in
particular, Jewish voters, the elderly, gay voters and women. For
one thing, Lazio is a more traditional Republican than the moderate
mayor, and for another, Clinton's advisers hope to use Lazio's
voting record in Congress against him with those groups.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, Clinton noted Lazio's opposition to gun
control and to public financing of abortions for the poor, both
issues that could help the first lady's problematic standing with
female voters.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that in the weeks ahead she would point to cuts in
Medicare supported by congressional Republicans in an attempt to
challenge Lazio's position with the elderly, and to strengthen her
support among gay voters, Clinton would also note, they said, that
Lazio had not been a co-sponsor of federal gay rights legislation
or the hate crimes bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest single difference is that you now have somebody
with a voting record,'' one of Clinton's advisers said. ``Three
weeks ago we were trying to make the case that the Republican mayor
was going to vote with a Republican majority. But it was a
hypothetical argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, both sides believe that Jewish voters, whose support
for Giuliani had been a constant source of concern for Clinton, may
have shifted to at least undecided ground. ``Let's face it _ that
was a tough nut to crack,'' an adviser to Clinton said. ``I think
now it's a much more open situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be so easy. Giuliani's support among many Jewish
voters was a product of the perception that he was strong on
Israeli security, and of Clinton's perceived sympathy toward the
creation of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's advisers said that he had a long history in favor of
voting for Israeli security measures, and that they would make a
point of highlighting this record. ``Rick has a very strong
pro-Israel record, and we think that contrasts favorably with Mrs.
Clinton,'' said Mike Murphy, Lazio's senior adviser.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The merging of two branches of the jet stream over the northeast
quarter of the nation will lead to a variety of weather conditions.
In New England, clouds and sprinkles will linger over northern
sections as chilly breezes circulate around low pressure in Nova
Scotia. Across central and parts of southern New England, sunshine
and seasonable temperatures will be the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Along the axis where the two jet streams meet, a veil of clouds
will extend from western New York to Long Island, N.Y. Embedded in
the southern jet stream is a potent disturbance that will cause
heavy rain from sections of Ohio to Virginia, and strong to severe
thunderstorms in the southern Appalachians and eastern Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
   A slight shift in the anticipated position of these merging jet
streams could either make New York brighter and mild or turn Boston
dull and damp.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SPREADING HEAT
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the temperature topped 101 degrees at Columbia,
S.C., for a daily record. Myrtle Beach and Augusta also set record
maximums in the 90s. While some of the heat in the Southeast was
generated in Texas and blown into the region on sultry breezes,
part of the hot spell was locally grown. The area from northern
Florida to central South Carolina has been excessively dry,
allowing much of the sun's energy to be transferred from the heated
ground to the air. Drought and heat followed each other.

CHINA TRADE VOTE SPLITS LABOR MOVEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The American labor movement is badly divided on
political strategy after last week's vote in favor of the China
trade bill, which labor opposed. And some union leaders and
Democratic consultants say this split could hurt Vice President Al
Gore's electoral chances as well as Democratic hopes of regaining
control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Angry about the trade bill, two of the nation's most powerful
unions _ the Teamsters and the United Automobile Workers _ are
showing little inclination to embrace Gore, who backed the bill,
and have threatened to cancel endorsements of several House
Democrats who voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   But John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, is pushing the
labor federation's 68 member unions to line up behind Gore and
House Democrats to increase their prospects in November.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Sweeney acknowledged that many of the labor
federation's 13 million members may be so upset about the China
bill that they will sit out the November elections, a development
that could hurt Gore worst in the industrial swing states of the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the trade fight, Richard Trumka, the AFL-CIO's
secretary-treasurer, said, ``It's going to make a difficult job
more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the House Democratic whip who has
repeatedly said the trade battle could hurt his party's chances,
has consulted with labor leaders to try to rally union support
behind the Democrats, who need to pick up six seats to regain
control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the House voted 237-197 in favor of granting
permanent normal trade relations to China, with labor lobbying
against the bill and business and President Clinton backing it.
Seventy-three Democrats voted in favor.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said they opposed the bill because of violations
of human rights in China and because they feared the legislation
would encourage U.S. companies to move factories and jobs to China.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters' president, and Stephen Yokich,
the UAW's president, said last week that Gore's support of the
trade bill made it less likely that their unions would endorse him.
Yokich has even suggested his union might endorse Ralph Nader, a
prospect some political experts call unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   For all the complaining within the labor movement about the
Democrats, many union leaders say that labor does not have many
options in November because most Republicans supported the trade
bill. And when the dust settles, many labor leaders say, most of
labor will back Democratic candidates because they back unions on
many issues far more than Republicans do.
</P>
<P>
   Saying their members felt betrayed, the Teamsters have canceled
their endorsement of Rep. Lois Capps, a California Democrat who
supported the trade bill. She won in 1998 with 55 percent of the
vote, helped by heavy labor campaigning on her behalf. The
Teamsters and Auto Workers also said they would withdraw their
endorsement of another Democrat who backed the bill, Rep. Sander M.
Levin of Michigan, who is considered to have a safe seat. The
Steelworkers union is also reassessing support of several House
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will definitely be some districts where we go after some
people who voted wrong,'' said Michael Mathis, the Teamsters'
political director.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters have also warned that they might cancel
endorsements of three other House Democrats: Tom Sawyer of Ohio,
Diana DeGette of Colorado and Dennis Moore of Kansas. Although
Moore represents a rural area, labor unions played a major role in
bringing him a narrow victory in 1998 after they saw a seat the
Democrats could pick up.
</P>
<P>
   Many Teamster officials voiced little concern that their
strategy might jeopardize the Democrats' prospects. Teamster
leaders said labor should not reward Democrats who backed the trade
bill even if the Republicans running in those districts are less
friendly to labor.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Sweeney is pushing unions to back Gore and most
Democratic House candidates because in his view they are more
likely to back labor on issues like Social Security and the minimum
wage than are the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders say rank-and-file anger over the passage of the
North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 was a major reason the
Democrats lost control of the House in 1994. Some labor leaders say
dismay over the China fight could similarly help the Republicans
this November.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many union members for whom this is a really, really
serious and intense personal issue,'' said David Axelrod, a
Democratic consultant. ``These are some of the same people the
Democrats will be relying on in some swing districts and in some
swing states. There is a concern that some union members will walk
away in frustration over this.''
</P>
<P>
   If the trade fight had any silver lining for the Democrats, it
was that the support for the bill shown by President Clinton and 73
House Democrats could win them contributions from corporations that
favor normal trade relations with China. Since early 1999,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics, business has made
$520 million in soft money and political action committee
contributions to both parties, while labor unions have contributed
$35 million.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party,
predicted that the China battle would not hurt his party this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously members of labor disagree with the vice president
and some members of Congress on this,'' he said. ``But over all,
these union members understand that working families are better
served by making sure that Al Gore is the next president.''
</P>
<P>
   Capps and Levin said they hoped to minimize any loss of labor
support by continuing to work closely with unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the people who beseeched me not to support the bill
would be upset if I did,'' Capps said, acknowledging that her seat
was vulnerable, even before the Teamsters withdrew support. ``I
have a strong record on issues important to working families, like
the patient's bill of rights and safety and health at the
workplace.''

AMERICANS NEED BETTER DIET, NEW HEALTH STUDY REPORTS
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans are eating better than they were in the
1980s, but the diets of nine out of 10 still need improvement,
federal officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Americans should reduce their intake of saturated fats, seek a
healthy body weight, reduce sodium and choose foods and drinks that
``moderate'' their sugar consumption, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Those recommendations are contained in the government's new
dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years, and
determine, among other things, the nutritional content of lunches
served to 26 million schoolchildren every day.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton devoted his weekly radio address Saturday to
the guidelines, choosing a holiday weekend to address ``our family
and friends at picnics and backyard barbecues.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite progress in eating less fat and more vegetables, ``the
vast majority of Americans still don't have healthy diets,''
Clinton said. He faulted lifestyle changes for aggravating the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're eating more fast food because of our hectic schedules,
and we're less physically active because of our growing reliance on
modern conveniences, from cars to computers to remote controls,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Clinton said, more Americans are obese _ including
one in 10 children _ placing them at greater risk for heart
disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is 6 foot 2 inches and has a reputation for a
hearty appetite and a fondness for fast food, lost about 20 pounds
in the year before his 1997 physical examination. He later regained
it all, and last November his doctors reported that he weighed 218
pounds. As a result, the White House said at the time, his doctors
``recommended that the president focus again on a low-calorie diet
and focus more attention also to his exercise regimen.''
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, which are drafted by a joint advisory committee
of the Agriculture Department and the Department of Health and
Human Services, may seem tame, but twice a decade virtually every
phrase is cause for battle between public interest advocates and
food producers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, sugar growers and soft drink manufacturers scored a
victory by persuading the administration to alter a draft
recommendation from ``go easy on beverages and foods high in added
sugars'' to ``choose beverages and foods to moderate your intake of
sugars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate the government caved in to pressure from junk
food makers,'' said Margo G. Wootan, the director of nutrition
policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
nonprofit consumer advocacy group. ``The sugar industry was out in
full force.''
</P>
<P>
   Wootan, who has a doctorate in nutrition, nevertheless praised
the administration for ignoring pressure from salt producers and
issuing an explicit message on sodium, ``Eat less.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the key recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol.
Limit fatty meats and high-fat dairy products like cheese; opt for
fish and lean poultry, use vegetable oils rather than solid fats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aim for a healthy weight. One in three adults are overweight,
up from one in four just a decade ago. Choose sensible portions at
mealtime and get regular physical activity to reduce the risk of
heart disease and other maladies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cut salt intake. Substitute spices and herbs to flavor food;
go easy on soy sauce, ketchup, mustard, pickles and olives; choose
plain foods like grilled or roasted entrees when dining out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moderate intake of sugars. The No. 1 source of added sugars is
in nondiet soft drinks. Other sources include cakes and cookies,
fruit drinks and candy. Do not let such foods ruin an appetite for
healthful items like low-fat milk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Drink alcohol in moderation. That means no more than one drink
per day for women _ a 12-ounce beer or a 5-ounce glass of wine _
and no more than two drinks a day for men.
</P>
<P>
   The government offered guidance on exercise and handling and
storing food safely. Americans can improve their health by
exercising moderately every day, the guidelines said. Exercise that
speeds up the heart rate and breathing and that builds strength and
flexibility is particularly beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a brisk 30-minute walk five times a week, for instance,
can cut the chance of developing or dying from heart disease in
half,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   People can avoid food-borne illnesses by being careful with
perishable items like eggs, meats, fish, fresh fruits and milk
products. The government urged Americans not to drink unpasteurized
juices, raw sprouts and raw or undercooked meat, eggs, fish or
shellfish.
</P>
<P>
   Cooks should wash their hands, utensils and surfaces after
handling raw meat, poultry or fish and store them, if necessary,
apart from other foods.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``African women are everywhere, in the media, in
politics, in business,'' said Ergibe Boyd, an Eritrean-born
American diplomat who has given herself an unusual assignment in
the Rwandan capital, Kigali. ``But women are never at the peace
table.''
</P>
<P>
   In a new age of localized warfare that kills mostly civilians,
``women are running and children are the victims,'' said Boyd,
whose own family has been caught in the war between Ethiopia and
Eritrea. Those who suffer most, she said in an interview in Kigali,
must demand a role not only in peacemaking but also in rebuilding
communities that have been shattered by the brutality of war and
warlords.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, Boyd plans to assemble women from all over Africa,
as well as the Middle East, Northern Ireland and the Balkans, to
build strategies for making their voices heard in national
capitals, international organizations and the summit meeting of the
world's seven leading industrial powers and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   At the Center for Women's Global Leadership at Rutgers
University, the executive director, Charlotte Bunch, said that the
role of women in peacemaking ``is one of the issues that's reached
critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd discovered this quickly in Africa. But the trend is
worldwide, said Jessica Neuwirth of Equality Now, a New York
organization that supports women and projects to foster peace in
several African countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women suffer so much from war,'' she said in a telephone
interview, ``and they end up with so many of the daily
responsibilities of life that become harder because of war.''
Women, even under fire, are expected to feed, shelter and look
after their families.
</P>
<P>
   In Sudan, women have held meetings on how to get into the
efforts to produce peace. In Uganda, and elsewhere, women are
beginning to assert authority over some of the youngest soldiers,
often children, and are fighting the abduction of young people by
guerrilla bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Somalia, the most amazing process has taken place,''
Neuwirth said. ``A coalition of grass-roots organizations is
representing women from warring clans where men really can't talk
to each other. One woman in Marka, Starlin Arush, set up the most
remarkable and effective demobilization program. In exchange for
arms, she was taking young men and giving them food, shelter and
education, which is really what they want and don't have any other
way to get.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, women ``have not been able to get in through the
door to participate in the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kigali, Boyd did not have far to look for women eager to take
part in her campaign to raise women's part in peacemaking. Rwanda,
torn apart by genocide six years ago, has seen the emergence of
some strong women's organizations committed to rebuilding a
semblance of normality for their families.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Balikungeri, coordinator of the Rwanda Women's Network, has
been active not only in resolving conflict but in battling AIDS, in
part a legacy of war and the widening incidence of rape as an
instrument of abuse by the men with guns. She has been working, she
said, to remove the stigma of AIDS and teach women that it is
necessary to be tested for the virus that causes it.
</P>
<P>
   Balikungeri, who also runs a center for women who were victims
of rape in the genocidal Hutu-led attacks against mostly Tutsi
families in 1994, recently toured the United States as a guest of
the American government, traveling with 15 women from all over
Africa, including from countries at war with each other. As they
traveled, they shared stories _ and met some American women living
in poverty and distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come to realize,'' Balikungeri said, ``we need each other.
All of us, regardless of where we were from, saw that everywhere
women are the victims.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. _ Of all the things he is being called lately by
his critics, ``liberal'' and ``dove'' make Gov. Tom Ridge laugh out
loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet the only combat ever seen by the guy who wrote that
has been in front of a Nintendo machine,'' said Ridge, his
credentials as a Bronze Star combat veteran of Vietnam unsullied by
the slings and arrows now pelting him from within his own
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam-fighting experience of the husky, 55-year-old
Pennsylvania governor comes in handy these days. He is being
targeted by the social conservative right for being a Roman
Catholic who unapologetically favors a woman's right to choose
abortion, yet remains prominently featured on a list of potential
running mates of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the putative
Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor says there is no litmus test, and I believe
him,'' Ridge said, referring to the simmering abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   But social and religious conservatives see things differently,
and have issued stern warnings to Bush of dire consequences in
November if he picks someone like Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The base in the Republican Party is pro-life,'' James C.
Dobson, the conservative religious leader, said on Wednesday. ``You
can't win without that base.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, his abortion rights stand firmly defying party platform
dogma, remains the most mentioned prospective running mate. He set
a Republican record for this heavily Democratic state with a
780,000-vote victory margin in his 1998 re-election. A Bush-Ridge
ticket might well deliver this critical battleground, the
fifth-largest state in electoral votes, to the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In two elections, Ridge has shown considerable crossover
attraction among Democratic voters. He has the power to garner up
to 30 percent of them, according to polls _ a factor that Bush must
weigh as he charts a centrist strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans also note that Bush had to be more sensitive
to the nation's large Catholic vote after his controversial speech
in the South Carolina primary at Bob Jones University, a campus
that critics denounce as anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ridge's support of abortion rights might signal a
harsh party split for some Republicans, others said his candidacy
as vice president would draw more women to the Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this wonderful speculation,'' remarked Ridge, his smile
broad but fatalistic as he noted that the decision on a running
mate was entirely Bush's to make after a long process involving ``a
lot of other people,'' in the Texas governor's words.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if? What if?'' asked Ridge, happily teasing himself as
much as his boosters and critics. He seems to be enjoying the
freedom of having no say in the matter as he looks forward to being
the state host at the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But as the vice-presidential question is debated, conservative
critics in National Review and other publications, nettled by his
support of abortion rights, are busily vetting Ridge's 12-year
record in Congress to argue that, even beyond the abortion issue,
he is not an authentic conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protectionist,'' another charge made against Ridge, brings
more open laughter here in the executive chamber of the governor,
who noted that he was a card-carrying member of the hod-carriers
union when he was a college student who worked in construction
during the summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for Nafta, in Congress,'' Ridge said, bemused at what
he was reading lately from conservative polemicists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, this gets comical,'' he continued. He repeatedly used
the word ``conservative'' to characterize himself in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Only the November election, he said, with all the variables
brought to the voters by the candidates and their campaigns, might
settle the question of whether the Republican Party is ready for an
abortion rights candidate on the ticket beside the anti-abortion
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the decibel level may be going down a little bit on
this issue,'' said Ridge, whose political career in Pennsylvania
has not measurably suffered from his support of abortion rights,
even after his being obliquely criticized by his bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think we're done with the very important struggle
we're having within the party as to how to deal with it,'' he
continued. ``Certainly, my friend Governor Bush disagrees with me,
and a majority of the delegates at the convention probably disagree
with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're not going to change the platform. But it's
interesting to note there are some people in the party who, instead
of defeating Al Gore, would suggest that if the No. 2, whether me
or somebody else, doesn't share their belief on abortion, they
might abandon the party.''
</P>
<P>
   One quarter where Ridge is bolstered in his insistence that he
is a true-blue conservative is across the Statehouse, within the
Democratic minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Ridge is a perfect fit for George Bush,'' said state Sen.
Christine Tartaglione, speaking in her role as the state Democratic
chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``His actions speak louder than his words,'' Tartaglione said,
contending that Ridge, in the state's recent tax cuts of more than
$1 billion, favored big business interests at the expense of needy
families.
</P>
<P>

   And Ridge has just the sort of paradoxical touches in his resume
that politicians dream of.
</P>
<P>
   His parents were postwar strivers; his father, a Navy veteran,
worked two jobs to finance his children's parochial school tuition.
Up from public housing, the family bought a modest house in Erie,
that is still home to the governor's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My DNA is a little confused,'' Ridge said lightly in noting
that his father was a fervid blue-collar Democrat while his mother
was a no less fervid Republican ward worker. The family dinner
table was a forum that respected politics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Harvard after winning a needs-based
scholarship and, while studying at Dickinson Law School in
Pennsylvania was drafted into the Army and served in the infantry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dwell on Vietnam; I draw on it,'' said Ridge who, with
a similar margin of removal, recalls the feverish anti-war protests
at Harvard as a fascinating backdrop that did not draw him away
from his studies.

   As the attacks by social conservatives heighten, the governor
does not hesitate to defend his view on abortion rights.

   ``This is a difficult personal decision that has enormous
emotional, psychological, intensely physical and oftentimes
religious dimensions to it,'' he said. ``This is a tough decision
for people to make. One of the things I talk about is trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to whether I would place ultimate responsibility
in that very difficult personal decision, with so many dimensions
to it, in the hands of government _ I mean, some of the people in
my party would criminalize it! _ or leave it up to the individual,
leave it up to the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the intramural sniping, the old combat sergeant admits
he enjoys the extra political notice and power that seems to come
with the vice-presidential speculation, however fruitless it may
prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the what-if factor,'' Ridge said, describing a state of
``irrational exuberance'' that he is experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heck of a ride,'' the governor added. ``I've already
got a great job, and I'm going to help my old friend George Bush
get elected president. And you know? I think he can carry
Pennsylvania without me.''

   DALLAS _ By now, most of Eddie Slack's customers are accustomed
to paying $30 or more to fill their gas tanks. ``The big sticker
shock was several months ago,'' said Slack, owner of the Delwood
Chevron service station in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   After falling a good bit following a decision by the
petroleum-exporting countries in March to increase oil production,
gasoline prices have soared to the highest levels of the year in
many parts of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers now filling up are paying record prices for the Memorial
Day weekend. And analysts say tight supplies, particularly in the
Midwest, could push prices higher as demand increases with the
beginning of the summer driving season and as parts of the country
struggle to meet a June 1 deadline for using a cleaner-burning
reformulated fuel as required by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The average national price for regular unleaded is $1.53 a
gallon, the same level reached in March and almost 40 cents higher
than last year, federal officials said. In New York City, drivers
are paying $1.64 a gallon, compared with $1.27 last year, according
to AAA, the automobile association.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusted for inflation, of course, gasoline is still cheap, even
with the sharp rise of the last year. The 30 cents a gallon that
Americans paid in the early 1960s translates to about $1.75 today,
according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. And the $1.25 a
gallon that drivers paid in the early 1980s is equivalent to $2.50
today.
</P>
<P>
   In April, prices around the country fell almost a dime a gallon,
on average, after OPEC ministers voted in late March to increase
production. But the decline turned out to be short-lived, as
drivers everywhere learned this week when they gassed up for the
holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs so much that I don't even fill up the tank anymore,''
Tadd Balfour, a 25-year-old computer network engineer, said as he
added $10 worth of gas to the 20-gallon tank of his Montero sport
utility vehicle at Slack's station on Friday. Balfour, who commutes
more than 20 miles each day, says he has considered buying a
smaller car. ``If gas goes up another couple of points, I may have
to make a change,'' he said. ``But I'm closely watching what prices
do. Right now, it's out of control.''.
</P>
<P>
   Balfour and other customers at Slack's small but busy service
station on Interstate 35 near downtown Austin paid $1.41 a gallon
for regular gasoline last week, $1.52 for midgrade and $1.61 for
premium. That is less than in most other parts of the country, but
that did not stop customers from complaining about recent
increases. ``They were really hollering,'' Slack said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high prices, holiday driving is expected to eclipse
last year's rates. AAA said it expected more than 34 million
Americans to travel at least 100 miles from their homes over the
weekend, 3 percent more than last year and 31 percent more than
during the 1991 Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the blame for the recent price increase lies with the
low inventories of gasoline around the country, a factor that
played a big role in high prices earlier this year. But the latest
run-up has been accelerated by the scramble to introduce a new
reformulated fuel in most large metropolitan areas. Prices have
also moved higher because of worries that a legal dispute involving
the Unocal Corp.'s patents for certain reformulated gas is holding
back production at some refineries.
</P>
<P>
   The cleaner-burning fuel is being sold in the
Boston-to-Washington corridor, including much of New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut, as well as in much of California and in
Chicago, Milwaukee, Houston and Dallas. Worries over tight supplies
of the fuel have been particularly acute in the Midwest, where
prices are soaring. In Chicago, for example, drivers are paying an
average of $1.85 for regular unleaded, up 30 cents in the last
month and more than 60 cents over last year, according to AAA. Some
of the city's service stations have already raised prices above
$2.00 a gallon. Milwaukee drivers are paying $1.74 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers in Wisconsin have authorized the filing of a
lawsuit to block adoption of the new fuel rules there. And in St.
Louis, officials won a waiver from the Environmental Protection
Agency allowing use of the old gas until June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the EPA denied requests from both Chicago and
Milwaukee for waivers there. The agency said there was enough of
the reformulated fuel to make waivers unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The reformulated fuel is harder to blend, and Midwest refiners
are unlikely to be able to increase production soon, said Philip K.
Verleger, a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, a consulting firm
in Cambridge, Mass. Absent an EPA waiver, gas prices in Chicago and
Milwaukee could go much higher, even well above $2 a gallon, before
the situation stabilizes, Verleger said. ``There's no real way out
of it for the next three or four weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On top of pressure to meet the new fuel requirements,
inventories are low even for regular gasoline, and that leaves the
nation exposed to price spikes, said Daniel Yergin, president of
Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Stocks are so low, he said,
that ``any change in supply will reverberate in the markets right
away _ there isn't much of a normal cushion.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about a shortage of reformulated fuel helped push
gasoline futures to $1.026 a gallon on Friday, their highest level
since the Persian Gulf War, before settling back a few cents in the
shortened pre-holiday trading session at the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Oil futures closed at $30 a barrel, only a few dollars
short of the high for the year and at the top end of a trading band
in which OPEC ministers want crude to remain. Should oil prices
stay at these levels, or rise, analysts say the cartel could act to
increase production once more.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have more than doubled since early last year. OPEC
decided in March 1999 to cut back production, and cartel members
largely adhered to the new limits on output, which, combined with
stronger demand from Asia, caused prices to soar.
</P>
<P>
   At Slack's service station, Edward Wyndham, a 64-year-old
carpenter and part-time minister, remembers when gas stations gave
away glassware to attract customers. Now he says he and his friends
just seek the cheapest prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous, what they've done,'' Wyndham said as he
finished putting gas in his pickup truck. ``It's the poor people
who are suffering. I'm mad about it.''

   SHOOT-MAIN _ LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ A Lake Worth Middle School
seventh-grader shot and killed his popular English teacher during
the last period of the last day of school, police said. Honor roll
student Nathaniel Brazill, 13, who had been sent home earlier
Friday for his part in a water balloon fight, returned to campus
with a .25 caliber handgun in his pocket around 3:30 p.m. Brazill
shot Barry Grunow, 35, once in the face after the teacher refused

   TURKEY-HUNTING _ ATLANTA _ ``Gobble,'' he said. Silence. Far
away, a crow cawed. ``Gobblegobblegobble,'' he continued,
passionately, flogging a fallen tree trunk with his hat to make a
sound like the beating of large wings. Still no reply. Finally Doug
Benefield got to his feet, shaking his head in disgust. ``He's a
wise old bird,'' Benefield said. ``He's gone.'' Benefield is a
master of the art of talking to turkeys, but this time he was
unable to persuade an old tom to venture across the sights of his
shotgun. It tended to prove that the suburban South Fulton County
turkey is just as wily as his country cousin. (Warner, Atlanta

   SHOOT-MAIN _ LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ A Lake Worth Middle School
seventh-grader shot and killed his popular English teacher during
the last period of the last day of school, police said. Honor roll
student Nathaniel Brazill, 13, who had been sent home earlier
Friday for his part in a water balloon fight, returned to campus
with a .25 caliber handgun in his pocket around 3:30 p.m. Brazill
shot Barry Grunow, 35, once in the face after the teacher refused
to let him say good-bye to two girls in his classroom, Room 301,
said school district spokesman Nat Harrington. (Desmon and Barton,

   SHOOTER - LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ Nobody expected violence from Nate
Brazill, the 7th grader who smiled a lot and made good grades,
played the tuba and stayed out of trouble. But in the Lake Worth
Middle School cafeteria at breakfast a few weeks ago, schoolmates
say, the 13-year-old Brazill talked about getting his hands on a
gun. And on Friday, after an uncharacteristic brush with trouble,
police say Brazill used it. (Bennett, Palm Beach Post). MOVED

the U.S. Senate nearly voted to cut off funds to the operation _
effectively forcing their withdrawal unless Congress authorized an

<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ Nobody expected violence from Nate Brazill,
the 7th grader who smiled a lot and made good grades, played the
tuba and stayed out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Lake Worth Middle School cafeteria at breakfast a few
weeks ago, schoolmates say, the 13-year-old Brazill talked about
getting his hands on a gun. And on Friday, after an
uncharacteristic brush with trouble, police say Brazill used it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me his grandfather had a gun and he knew where it was
at,'' said Marc Lawerns, a sixth-grader at Lake Worth Middle
School. ``He didn't say what he was going to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, in the final minutes of the last day of the
school year, police say, Brazill shot 35-year-old teacher Barry
Grunow, killing him with a single shot to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill got As and Bs, seldom missed school and had no
disciplinary record, Palm Beach County school district spokesman
Nat Herrington said.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Brazill was sent home from school early for
throwing water balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, students and family members say they can't believe
what happened two hours later when Brazill came back to campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in total disbelief. Every indication points to the fact
that Nate was a good student and a good boy,'' said Frank Bermudez,
Brazill's band director the past two years. He said he saw no hints
that the 13-year-old was capable of killing.
</P>
<P>
   Bermudez called Nate a ``team player'' who switched instruments
from trumpet to tuba at the beginning of the school year to fill a
gap in the band. Added Bermudez, the father of an 11-year-old: ``I
would have had him hang out with my son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not Nate,'' said Elizabeth Koontz, the gym teacher
at Barton Elementary, where Brazill was a student until two years
ago. ``I would never have imagined this child to do something like
this . . . Out of all the kids that have passed through my field,
this is one that I would never have expected to be involved in
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nate walked the halls with a smile on his face,'' said Marc
Ariot, 14, another student.''This is really messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Near Brazill's apartment in a one-story gray stucco building on
South H Street, neighbors said they would often hear Brazill
playing his trumpet or tuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed like a good boy. He did,''' said neighbor Zenaida
Maldonado.
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Pastor Corey Jackson of the New Birth Family
Worship Center, said Brazill and his mother had planned to come
hear him preach Friday night at a church in Boynton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill's apartment is shared with his mother, stepfather and
2-year-old sister, neighbors said. Brazill's parents divorced and
his father lives in Daytona Beach. His mother, Polly, recently had
surgery for breast cancer, said her mother and Brazill's
grandmother, Everlina Josey.
</P>
<P>
   Josey, 75, came to the police station with Brazill's sister
after she saw reports of the shooting and arrest on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was the best boy in the world. We gave him
everything he wanted,'' Josey said. ``Everyone gave him the highest
praise.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazill took the gun he used to kill Grunow from a grandfather
in Boynton Beach about a week ago, Lake Worth Police spokeswoman
Lt. Rachel Houston said. She would not release the grandfather's
name.
</P>
<P>
   At Brazill's other grandfather's house, family members and
friends began arriving shortly after Brazill was named on
television as the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it,'' said Rena Brazill, an aunt, over the
sound of crying from inside the house.
</P>
<P>
   Family friend Marcy Hardemon, who said she has known Brazill
since he was a little boy at New Hope Baptist Church, also
expressed disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone called and said that was Nate, I said 'No, that
was someone else,' `` Hardemon said. ``The kind of guy he is, he
wouldn't even associate with people who would carry guns.''

bird,'' Benefield said. ``He's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Benefield is a master of the art of talking to turkeys, but this
time he was unable to persuade an old tom to venture across the
sights of his shotgun. It tended to prove that this suburban turkey
is just as wily as his country cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkeys can see 10 times better than we can,'' said Benefield,
a professional hunter and guide. ``They can hear better than we
can, too. If they could smell, you'd never be able to kill one.''
Mankind's only salvation, apparently, is that turkeys can't grow
opposable thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Turkeys are being hunted and killed only a handful of miles from
the shadow of the state Capitol. But
</P>
<P>
   it's no massacre. According to Benefield, only those toms who
throw caution to the wind in a fit of lust, jealousy, boastfulness
or mere stupidity meet their end that way. The others just fade
into the underbrush, clucking with amusement.
</P>
<P>
   On a weekday morning toward the end of the season, Benefield
took a reporter into the suburbs in search of a gobbler. The only
real difference in hunting turkeys there and those deeper in the
country is noise. It seems as though there's always a jetliner
overhead. ``I hate that,'' Benefield said.
</P>
<P>
   At first light the hollows were filled with a fog so dense that
Lon Chaney, hairy of brow and paw, might have slunk out of it at
any moment. This led to an explanation of the first rule of turkey
hunting: You Never Know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fog might be bad for us,'' Benefield said. ``But you never
know. I've known 'em to gobble in the fog.''
</P>
<P>
   A hunter neither tracks turkeys nor sits in a tree hoping one
will stumble along. He calls them up. He wanders around the woods
making noises like a hen turkey until a tom or a jake _ an immature
tom _ answers. Then the hunter hunkers down and tries to entice the
bird within gunshot.
</P>
<P>
   In a huge tract of forest whose owner had given Benefield
permission to hunt, Benefield drove slowly down dirt paths,
stopping on the hilltops to call. In addition to sounding like a
hen turkey, he can also imitate the barred owl. He has placed in
the top five in numerous turkey calling contests, but he is the
world champion barred owl caller. This is significant because toms
will often gobble at the sound of a barred owl.
</P>
<P>
   So will anyone standing next to him when he does it; at such
close proximity he sounds like the Owl that Ate Palmetto. But on
this chilly morning, suburban turkeys were indifferent to owls.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping the owl act, Benefield begins talking turkey. Imitating
the hen is called ``yelping,'' because a major component of their
vocal repertoire is exactly that. There are also demure clucks and
coos, loud, demanding ``kak-kak-kak'' calls, and a long, passionate
wail.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to whip the geese on a nearby lake into a frenzy of
honking, and from far, far away a tom gobbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like a turkey in a pen somewhere,'' he said, and moved
on.
</P>
<P>
   Between hen-yelping and owl-hooting from one vantage point after
another, Benefield described turkey hunting as a battle of wits
between man and bird. The hunter seeks that which will,
essentially, float the tom's boat, and as usual, it's sex, machismo
or gratuitous violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's really lovesick, he might just come running. But
usually he's more cautious than that. Lots of times, a tom won't
move at all when you call him. He'll gobble and strut and expect
the hen to come to him. If she doesn't, then that's it, because
he's not going to go to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other times, he'll come just so far and no further. It's like
he's drawn a line on the ground, and he might strut and demonstrate
along that line for hours, but he won't go any further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then sometimes a tom won't respond to yelps at all, but if you
gobble like another tom he'll come to investigate and maybe drive
him off. Gobbling and making a noise like a couple of toms
fighting, sometimes that'll bring another tom along real quick.
They love to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest sport there is,'' said Benefield, a tall,
wiry man of 30. ``You won't believe how loud a tom can sound when
he gobbles in the woods. It just sends a chill down my spine every
time. It's a wonder I haven't had a heart attack out here, I get so
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   But the excitement mustn't show. Once a turkey is located and
the calling begins, the hunter most remain as still as possible.
The tom is likely to scan the killing ground before the hunter sees
him, and the slightest movement may betray the trap. Sometimes a
hunter will set out a few decoys before he begins calling. There
are even decoys to be set up to represent a jake copulating with a
hen _ ``guaranteed to drive a tom wild with anger,'' according to
one catalog. That, Benefield believes, is going a bit too far.
</P>
<P>
   The fog lifted well after sunup, and for the 20th time,
Benefield got out of his big Ford truck to call _ this time in a
hollow. He has many ways of calling. There is the tube with a
diaphragm, a kind of simple accordion. There is a piece of clear
plastic set in metal, over which he scrapes a fancy stick of
hardwood to make the appropriate screeches and yelps. But mostly he
uses, in his mouth, a small bladder with three reeds attached. By
various combinations of blowing over it and tonguing it, he can
produce all the sounds of a lovelorn hen.
</P>
<P>
   He utters only a few yelps before there comes, from up the hill
somewhere, a mighty response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gobblegobblegobblegobble'' _ a commanding, masculine overture,
beginning with a harsh, metallic clash as though two copper pans
were banged together. Benefield ducked as though the turkey had
shot at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ruined!'' he hissed. ``He'll see the truck!'' In hopes
of avoiding ruin, Benefield pulled a camouflage mask over his face
and camouflage gloves over his hands and began creeping up the hill
at an angle to the sound of the turkey. Halfway up, he yelped
again, and received a quick answer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he reached a spot which seemed to be behind the turkey,
away from the truck, and settled down to business. He sat down,
back to a tree, shotgun at the ready on his knees.
</P>
<P>
   He called, tentatively. Not too aggressive to begin with. Some
toms don't like pushy hens.
</P>
<P>
   The tom answered. The exchange went back and forth a dozen
times, with the tom's gobble growing louder. Benefield began pawing
at the dried leaves on the forest floor as he yelped and squawked.
</P>
<P>
   The turkey gobbled twice more, sounding as though he was holding
his position, and his final gobble was more faint than the one
before. Desperate, Benefield switched genders.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing his neck exactly like a tom, he began to gobble. He even
imitated the snort and whirring sound of a strutting tom. No use.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have a hen with him,'' Benefield said, ``and she lured
him away. Hens are really jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it may just have been too much trouble. ``It's getting toward
the end of the season. The more established, dominant toms are
tired. They're not so interested in new hens.'' You Never Know.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, he was gone, reminiscent of a great old stomp
that Sonny Terry and Willie McGhee used to do, about a fellow who
realized he had overstayed his sentence on the county farm and
decamped forthwith.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, looka yonder, what I see . . .
</P>
<P>
   The woods at that point were open, and the old tom might have
gotten close enough to peer over a log and catch sight of
Benefield, even though everything about him _ even his shotgun _
was covered in camo.
</P>
<P>
   Ole red-eye cap'n,
</P>
<P>
   He's a-comin' after me . . .
</P>
<P>
   No use going after that old tom. A week later, Benefield went
back to that hill and called again. This time he got a glimpse of
The One that Got Away. ``Biggest turkey I ever saw,'' he reported.
``Head the size of a softball. So big he could hardly run.''
</P>
<P>
   But I'm lo-oo-ng gone,
</P>
<P>
   Long gone, long gone!
</P>
<P>
   Like a turkey through the corn.

 &HT;    ``Secret Cutting'' discloses reality of painful disorder
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Dawn Cottrell doesn't have any friends.
Classmates tease her constantly. Her musician boyfriend only wants
her for sex. She has an overbearing mother and a passive father.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Dawn isn't happy. But the only way the teen loner
knows how to deal with her gloomy existence is by harming herself.
She stabs herself with tools. Slices her wrists with glass. Burns
her arm with a cigarette lighter. Her body looks like a grotesque
human pin cushion. Dawn may not control her life, but, she reasons,
she can be in charge of her own pain.
</P>
<P>
   The logic may be twisted, but self-injury is a problem that
affects over two million Americans, including one in every two
hundred teens. It's a disorder in which people injure themselves to
secure relief from their emotional pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secret Cutting,'' a sensitive, thought-raising film, tackles
this thorny issue head-on. Disorders such as Dawn's (Kimberlee
Peterson) are often easily dismissed. After all, anyone who
constantly harms herself must be crazy, right? In Dawn's case,
she's crying out for help.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn's mom (Sean Young) doesn't help matters much. After her
daughter injures herself again, her first concern is the amount of
stress Dawn is putting the family through. Meanwhile, dad (Robert
Wisden) is no help. He buries himself in his work or just simply
ignores the warning signs. And Dawn's angry brother shouts things
like, ``The next time you slice yourself, I hope you die!''
</P>
<P>
   With seemingly no one to turn to, Dawn is finally able to
confide in a caring therapist (Rhea Perlman), who seems to
understand Dawn's inner torment.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to dismiss ``Secret Cutting'' as yet another
half-baked, victim-of-the-week TV movie. Indeed, the film barely
strays from the standard TV movie formula. Nevertheless, ``Secret
Cutting'' is a film parents should watch with their kids. Too many
parents fail to communicate with their kids or connect with them on
any level. That's at the root of Dawn's problem. All she really
needs is someone to listen to her. Kids should feel like they can
talk to their parents about anything. No wonder so many young
people are behind school shootings and violent outbursts. Often, so
much rage is pent up inside. Eventually, that anger has to be
released.
</P>
<P>
   As the emotionally disturbed Dawn, Peterson is eerily effective.
Her ghost-white skin, joyless eyes and painful expressions make
Dawn someone you pity and sympathize with. Young, who has had some
emotional problems of her own (actor James Woods once filed a
harassment suit against her) is also in fine form as Dawn's
self-absorbed mom.
</P>
<P>
   The subject matter certainly isn't pretty. And, at times, when
Dawn is stabbing herself, she looks downright possessed. But if
``Secret Cutting ``makes you a better friend _ and parent _ to your
kid, it's definitely worth your time. Remember, your child could be
screaming out for help and you don't even know it.

 &HT;    Trial evidence may shed light on events at Waco
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Like John F. Kennedy's last moments in the
convertible and the shattered shell of the Oklahoma City federal
building, the image has been seared into the national psyche: fire
engulfing the Branch Davidian compound with more than 80 men, women
and children inside.
</P>
<P>
   Before the flames were extinguished at the Mount Carmel compound
near Waco, ending the deadliest law enforcement action in U.S.
history, the questions began: How and why did this happen?
Attorneys Mike Caddell and Mike Bradford want to answer the
questions and dispel the conspiracy theories that have smoldered
since the April 19, 1993 FBI assault. From opposite sides of the
Davidians' wrongful death lawsuit against the federal government,
the lawyers want the truth revealed when the lawsuit goes to trial
June 19 in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The case is much more than a wrongful death lawsuit for Caddell,
a Houston lawyer representing surviving Davidians and families of
Davidians who died, and Bradford, a U.S. attorney from Beaumont
defending the government. It's an opportunity to help heal a
national wound.
</P>
<P>
   Both want to win and both have different interpretations of what
happened at Mount Carmel. But both say it's time for facts to be
aired and debated.
</P>
<P>
   The trial before U.S. District Judge Walter Smith _ who will
rule on the case instead of a jury _ will bring the events of Mount
Carmel to life again, as Davidians who survived the flames and
federal agents who took part in the confrontation tell their
stories.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, 1993, 76 agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms raided the Davidians' compound, seeking to
arrest the Davidians' leader and self-described prophet, David
Koresh, and search the compound for illegal guns. Gunshots were
exchanged, killing four ATF agents and five Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   That began a 51-day standoff that ended on April 19 when FBI
agents ordered the Davidians to surrender and assaulted the
compound with armored vehicles and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   As the armored vehicles began demolishing the structure, fires
broke out and quickly spread throughout Mount Carmel, where Koresh
preached end-of-the world predictions. Each side blames the other
for starting the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Koresh and 73 of his followers _ including 22 children _ died
inside from gunshots wounds or the fire. Both sides in the lawsuit
say some of the Davidians' wounds appeared self-inflicted. Nine of
the people inside survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in many respects, (the trial) will have a cathartic
effect for not only the participants but for a lot of the American
public,'' Caddell said. ``The truth is, most people feel like they
don't know what really happened, even today.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress held hearings on the incidents, Caddell said
the plaintiffs have ``found critical document after critical
document that was not revealed to Congress, that was not disclosed.
We now have a much clearer picture of the story. To me, the case is
about abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said plaintiffs also have found some evidence that
supports the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have investigated something and we have concluded that
there was no irresponsible action on the part of the government, we
say so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, a former state district judge, said he hopes the trial
will vindicate the federal agents and restore trust in the federal
agencies involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important case, and one of the reasons I agreed to
become a part of it is because I think it's important for the truth
to come out, and for the public to have confidence in the
government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Richardson, a researcher who has worked with the FBI to
prevent future incidents like Waco, said the Davidians' lawsuit has
brought new scrutiny to evidence that has sat in government offices
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the trial and the judge making the pre-trial rulings
that he has, we'd know a lot less than we know,'' said Richardson,
a professor of sociology and judicial studies at the University of
Nevada at Reno. ``So the legal process is working.''
</P>
<P>
   LAWSUIT TAKES AIM AT GOVERNMENT
</P>
<P>
   The Davidians' lawsuit claims federal agents shot
indiscriminately at the Davidians during the initial raid and fired
into the compound on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 100 plaintiffs claim the FBI ``created a death
trap'' at Mount Carmel by demolishing the building earlier than
planned, using devices that could have started the fire and failing
to have firefighters present.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who presided over the 1994 criminal trial of eleven
Davidians _ eight were convicted of manslaughter or lesser charges
_ first must decide whether the government is responsible for the
Davidians' deaths. If Smith finds the government liable, he then
will consider the plaintiffs' demand for monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   Smith could award whatever compensation he considered
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case was never about trying to collect a huge amount of
money,'' Caddell said. ``This case was about forcing the government
to accept its share of the responsibility for the deaths of the
people who died at Mount Carmel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford and Justice Department lawyer Marie Hagen will argue
the government's case. Bradford said he's confident the evidence
will put the responsibility on Koresh and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, law enforcement didn't handle everything perfectly,
but we think the evidence is clear that the cause of this tragedy
was the Davidians themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial has generated a mountain of evidence _ and allegations
by Caddell that the government has concealed, lost, or destroyed
key information.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Smith ordered all federal agencies to turn over any
Davidian-related evidence. The government initially fought the
order, then began shipping hundreds of boxes of documents,
videotapes, audio recordings, photographs, and Mount Carmel debris
to the Waco federal courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Caddell asked the judge to force the government to
produce ``missing'' evidence or hold the government's lawyers in
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Smith denied the request. He ruled that the FBI may have
mishandled or mislabeled some evidence, but ``there is nothing to
indicate that this was the result of anything more than mere
negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell will argue that negligence permeated every aspect of the
government's handling of its encounter with the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Each side has accused the other of pulling the trigger first
during the initial raid. Caddell said he isn't conceding that the
Davidians shot first, but will focus on how the agents fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``ATF agents were firing at the building even when they couldn't
identify a specific target, and consequently, we believe that
people who were not firing a weapon were killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also in question is whether FBI agents shot at people inside
Mount Carmel during the April 19 assault.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen Davidians died from gunshot wounds at close range,
according to a 1996 congressional investigation. It concluded that
the federal agencies botched the operation but laid the ultimate
blame on Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   Koresh died of a bullet wound to his head. He was found lying
next to his close friend, Steve Schneider, who apparently shot
himself in the mouth with a rifle according to an autopsy report.
</P>
<P>
   The government insists the agents did not fire at the Davidians
on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell argues that the FBI agents and leaders, tired and
frustrated after weeks of negotiations with a religious group whose
doctrine they didn't understand, sent a couple of agents in with
the armored vehicles to try to kill Koresh and other leaders _
under the theory that other Davidians were being held hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they were sent in to kill all the Davidians, I
think it was a misguided, unfortunate decision by people who were
frustrated and angry and became impatient,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO SPAWNS FURTHER QUESTIONS
</P>
<P>
   A key piece of evidence from the April 19 assault is the
infrared surveillance video filmed from an FBI aircraft. The video
shows bright flashes that the plaintiffs say are proof of
government gunfire that kept the Davidians from escaping the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that the flashes are sunlight reflecting
off the broken glass and other debris.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Vector Data Systems, a British subsidiary of a U.S.
defense firm, conducted a simulation at Fort Hood of conditions on
the day of the raid at Mount Carmel, using equipment similar to
what the FBI had used. Caddell had urged the simulation and former
Sen. John Danforth, the special counsel appointed by Attorney
General Janet Reno to investigate the events, agreed, suggesting
Vector for the job.
</P>
<P>
   The company concluded that flashes on the FBI infrared
videotapes were sunlight reflected off debris, not flashes
indicative of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   The report, Bradford said, ``was really favorable to the
government in all respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, who recently interviewed the Vector analysts in sworn
depositions, said at least one of the three people who signed the
company's report admitted he wasn't qualified to interpret the
infrared tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are going to be shocked when they read the
deposition testimony,'' he said. ``They don't even agree with each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he did not consider the simulation conclusive
evidence and will listen to experts from both sides before ruling
whether government agents fired at the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   HOW DID THE FIRE START?
</P>
<P>
   The government was listening intently to the Davidians'
conversations inside Mount Carmel, using bugging devices smuggled
into the compound. What they heard on April 19, 1993 also is
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   As the armored vehicles began their tear gas assault on the
compound, government agents monitored the conversations inside. The
government claims the voices were too garbled to know what was
being said at the time, but that later enhancement showed the
Davidians talked about ``spreading fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said the conversations, combined with the infrared
video that shows fire breaking out ``almost simultaneously in three
parts of the compound,'' suggest that the Davidians set the fires.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs say that the audio tapes show the government knew
of the potential for fire and did nothing. There were no
firefighters at the scene, and local firefighters didn't arrive
until 30 minutes after the fires started.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no plan at all to fight a fire,'' Caddell said.
``(The FBI) had even been offered, free of charge. . . an armored
firefighting vehicle, and they thumbed their noses at it. And I
think that's criminal. That's criminal negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the government agents involved face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said he's prepared to defend the FBI's decision to not
have firefighters at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision was made not to expose the firefighters to the
danger of being shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``WE DO NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT WACO.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the discovery of a tear gas canister in an evidence
room intensified the debate over who started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Johnston wanted to defuse
charges that the government was covering up what really happened at
Mount Carmel. So he allowed Michael McNulty _ the researcher whose
work anchored the Academy Award-nominated documentary ``Waco: The
Rules of Engagement'' _ to view evidence held by the Texas
Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty spotted a 40 mm cartridge later determined to be the
remains of a military round used to fire tear gas _ a round capable
of starting a fire.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery punched a hole in six years of government denials
that federal forces used explosive or flammable devices during the
assault. And it increased doubt about the government's honesty,
feeding conspiracy theories and spurring Reno to appoint Danforth,
of Missouri, as special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the evidence that the government started the
fire is at least as good as the evidence that the Davidians started
the fire,'' Caddell said. ``The myth that's been created, of
course, is that the Davidians wanted to commit suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who killed themselves apparently did so after fire began,
he said. Faced with the flames, Caddell said, the Davidians
thought, ``Here's my choice, burn to death or put a bullet in my
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, the University of Nevada professor, said the trial
may not answer once and for all how the fire started or whether the
FBI shot at the Davidians. But he said he hopes that by airing the
evidence _ from both the Davidians' and the governments'
perspectives _ the trial can give Americans enough information to
make their own judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need to know what happened at Waco,'' he said.

MEXICO'S OPPOSITION CANDIDATE REBOUNDS
</HEADLINE>
  By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Vicente Fox Quesada, the leading opposition
presidential candidate, gave a vigorous but level-headed
performance Friday night in a televised debate with two rivals that
helped him recover from embarrassing mistakes in his campaign last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who dissected the 90-minute face-off _ and telephone
polling _ agreed that Fox won the encounter by keeping his cool,
playing down attacks on his opponents and stressing proposals to
bring a wide range of Mexicans into his programs for change.
</P>
<P>
   A leftist opposition contender, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano,
made points by continually assailing his rivals, although his main
target was Francisco Labastida Ochoa of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The post-mortem consensus was that Labastida's bland showing,
and the fire he took from both rivals, put him in third place for
the debate.
</P>
<P>
   All three candidates had acknowledged that the debate, the
second and last televised meeting between presidential contenders,
was pivotal to their prospects in the July 2 balloting. Opinion
polls showed Fox ahead in the race briefly earlier this month, but
he has recently fallen back into a dead heat with Labastida.
Cardenas is a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   Because of electoral reforms since the last presidential vote in
1994, the field is more level for opponents to compete with the
PRI, which has held presidential power for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have made for the most dynamic race Mexicans have
ever seen as polls shift from week to week in response to the
campaigns. The candidates agreed to a free-wheeling format that
allowed for unusually spontaneous exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   In a national telephone poll conducted Friday night by the daily
newspaper Reforma, 47 percent of those contacted said Fox was the
winner, 19 percent named Labastida and 18 percent Cardenas.
Responding to a separate question that asked who was the loser, 43
percent named Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida sought to appear presidential by avoiding personal
attacks, ignoring his opponents' jabs and sticking with an upbeat
roster of his proposals to improve education and fight crime. But
his rhetoric was often vague, making him sound like a bureaucrat
instead of a man keen to prove himself against Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the voice of the system,'' said Enrique Krauze, a
political commentator on the Televisa network. ``His language was
too institutional and antiquated.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida did not stress that he would change the PRI to
eliminate the corruption that has alienated many voters, but
neither was he forceful in defending his party's accomplishments in
government.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was fighting for his political life. He needed to repair
damage he inflicted on himself with peevish behavior in
negotiations on live television where he tried to force the other
two contenders into an on-the-spot debate Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Fox started out by apologizing to viewers for the stubbornness
he revealed earlier, but he said it was the product of firm
character. ``Do you think a weak and gray person could stand up to
the PRI and its allies?'' he asked.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He trumped his opponents with a bit of theater when Cardenas
hammered at him about the support of his party, the right-of-center
National Action Party, for an unpopular $80 billion bailout of the
Mexican banks.
</P>
<P>
   Several political parties in the Congress are holding secret
codes needed to open a computer file that contains the names of
Mexicans who benefited from the bailout. Although the opposition
parties believe that the files will show extensive corruption in
the bailout, they have not agreed on opening them.
</P>
<P>
   With a flourish designed to show that he would not protect
corrupt bankers, Fox handed the secret codes belonging to his party
``for safekeeping'' to the moderator of the debate, Ricardo Rocha,
an independent journalist. Fox said he would open the bailout files
if he became president.
</P>
<P>
   When he did not get his way over the date of the debate, Fox
suggested petulantly he would not participate in it at all. After
emergency meetings with leaders of his party, he agreed to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, after siding with Labastida against Fox over when to
hold the debate, went out of his way to show that he is no friend
of the governing party candidate. He worked hard to link Labastida
to Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the disgraced former president who is
now in forced exile in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas sought to portray himself as a consistent crusader for
democracy. ``I'm still fighting the fight and I will always be just
as you have always seen me, as a man of principle,'' he said.

DANCE HAS AFRICANS SHAKING BEHINDS AND HEADS 
</HEADLINE>
   By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ The night was getting wild, the air tense
with expectation, as the crowd at a military academy waited for the
show's top act, three female Ivoirian dancers known as ``Les
Tueuses,'' or The Killers. Until last December, Les Tueuses, the
queens of a suggestive dance craze called the mapouka, had been
banned from television, judged too vulgar by the government, which
was subsequently toppled in a Christmas Eve coup.
</P>
<P>
   Their reputation rehabilitated under military rule, Les Tueuses
finally took the stage recently, quickly shedding their diaphanous
white robes in favor of blue sequined bikini tops and long skirts
with, of course, never-ending slits.
</P>
<P>
   As uniformed soldiers stretched to keep the crowd of hundreds
under control, Les Tueuses plunged into the audience, targeting a
cadet here, another there, leaving the young men, and women
spectators, dazed under a blur of gyration and wiggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I adore mapouka, but I especially like Les Tueuses,'' said
Eliane Meledje, a 25-year-old seamstress, who had traveled several
hours from her neighborhood of Yopougon to attend the show at the
academy outside Abidjan this Saturday night. ``With them, you feel
liberated.''
</P>
<P>
   The army is still in charge in this West African nation. The
military ruler, Gen. Robert Guei, has yet to announce elections or
say whether he will run, to the dismay of international donors who
are staying away.
</P>
<P>
   But as the political transition drags on in what was once the
most stable country in West Africa, an unexpected entry in the
winners' column has been mapouka, a dance that had been treated in
official corners as something like an infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
   Banned from Ivoirian television _ chased away by officials in
neighboring countries such as Togo, Niger, Burkina Faso and Benin _
mapouka has spread nevertheless along the West African coast, from
Dakar to Kinshasa, in the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   The dance _ which focuses on, but is not limited to, the
surprisingly difficult act of wiggling one's buttocks without
moving one's hips _ also became an endless source of discussions
and newspaper ruminations on culture, sex, women and men,
especially in the Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   It was perhaps a measure of the fallen government's
disconnection with its 16 million citizens that it tried to ban
mapouka, even as the dance grew so popular that many young women
desperately tried to gain weight _ the better to perform a dance
that works best with an ample backside. After the military took
power, it seemed that the new government's first major policy shift
was directed at mapouka.
</P>
<P>
   The dance popped up on television. Les Tueuses led a performance
for soldiers at the national stadium, and their photos appeared on
the front pages of newspapers, including the government-controlled
ones. Then, on the day before their recent Saturday show at the
military academy, Les Tueuses put on a private show for Guei
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president loves mapouka,'' said one of the dancers, known
as Victorine the Viper, before the show in the stadium. ``During
our show yesterday, we saw him move his head, his feet. But we have
to admit that we, Les Tueuses, have three kinds of shows: one for
TV, one for our regular show, and one for officials. In front of
the president, we couldn't show him our buttocks and shake them
under his eyes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mapouka became popular in the nightclubs of Abidjan before
catching on abroad. Congo has traditionally been the big exporter
of music and dance in Africa, so the mapouka was something of a
first for the Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The dance is believed to be the descendant of a far tamer,
traditional dance in the country's coastal regions. By the time it
had reached Abidjan, though, the dance was performed mostly by
young women who bent and shook in ways that men could never
duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Abidjan's fairly easy-going cultural climate, Ivoirian
national television yanked video clips of popular performers,
saying that the mapouka did not follow the ``rules of good
behavior.'' Some criticized mapouka dancers for supposedly debasing
the country's cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have turned it into a depraved dance to the point that
the Ivory Coast became notorious, known in the region because of
it,'' said Jacques Powply, a cultural critic at Le Jour, a
newspaper based here. ``To me, it's lewd pleasures sought by men
who want to corrupt our original dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Others pointed out that suggestive dancing was nothing new to
the region. But the mapouka had upset officials, they said, because
the dance left out men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem with mapouka,'' said Valen Guede, a
musicologist and director of the Ivoirian Office of Authors'
Rights, ``lies in the fact that this dance can be danced only by
women, and only by a plump woman with a generous behind. All of
sudden, men are pushed to the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the dance caught on. As young women sought to outperform
one another, a large posterior became de rigueur. Contrary to the
beauty standards of the West, fleshiness is regarded as attractive
in both women and men in Africa, a sign of wealth and health on a
poor continent. But mapouka made plumpness fashionable even among
Westernized young women who had toyed with slimness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women started saying that fleshy was beautiful, and that one
had to be at least chubby,'' said Konate Yacouba, an author and
member of the National Institute of the Arts. ``Some who had been
dieting made an about-face and even started taking vitamin pills to
fatten up.''
</P>
<P>
   With the military's relaxed, if not enthusiastic, attitude
toward the mapouka, success looms large for Les Tueuses _ at least
until the next dance craze. The trio has recently gone on foreign
tours, including to New York and Montreal, said their manager, John
Chahin Sombo.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage just before their recent performance, the dancers
defended the mapouka against criticism of lewdness and female
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, our fans are made up in great part of women,'' said
a dancer who goes by the name Julie the Supple. ``Women become as
delirious as men. The mapouka is a phenomenon for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   One 16-year-old girl who came to the show, Amie Gbane, said she
was a big fan of Victorine the Viper.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a wicked look and dances really well,'' Gbane said.
``I'd love to dance like them.''
</P>
<P>
   But a 43-year-old nurse, who gave only her last name, Kone, said
she had come only to keep an eye on her two sons in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why the cadets invited them, but they must
have their own reason,'' said Kone. ``Look at how delirious they're
becoming! I don't like it when the dancers leave the stage and come
provoke the men in their seats. It embarrasses me greatly, and it's
the reason why I preferred asking Mr. Kone, my husband, to stay at
home.''

 &HT;    Teen held in shooting of teacher
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon and Antigone Barton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ A Lake Worth Middle School seventh-grader
shot and killed his popular English teacher during the last period
of the last day of school, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Honor roll student Nathaniel Brazill, 13, who had been sent home
earlier Friday for his part in a water balloon fight, returned to
campus with a .25 caliber handgun in his pocket around 3:30 p.m.
Brazill shot Barry Grunow, 35, once in the face after the teacher
refused to let him say good-bye to two girls in his classroom, Room
301, said school district spokesman Nat Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   Several students and a teacher watched as Grunow fell to the
floor. His class had been watching a movie based on the book
``Killing Mr. Griffin,'' a tale of kids who plot to kill their
English teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh shit,'' Brazill said after firing the shot, fellow student
Ryan Otero told police.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Brazill waved the gun around, put it to the head of
teacher John James and ran from the building through an emergency
exit, students said. A school security camera recorded it all.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Brazill flagged down a police officer a
quarter-mile from the school and handed over the gun. He was in
police custody Friday night, charged with first-degree murder and
aggravated assault with a firearm, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a big pop,'' said 14-year-old Marc Ariot who passed by
just as the shot was fired. ``Everybody came running out of class.
They were shouting, 'He shot Mr. Grunow.' And instantly people
started crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked inside and I saw him laying there in a pool of blood
. . . I knew there was nothing I could do for him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a teacher has been killed inside a Palm
Beach County school.
</P>
<P>
   When word of the shooting spread _ some parents saw it crawl
across the television screen as they watched ``The Rosie O'Donnell
Show,'' others got frantic calls from their children _ parents
flocked to the school, crowding toward the street in front. They
cried. They used their cell phones. They tried to piece together
what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Students were locked down inside. Soon after the shooting,
Principal Sharon Walker came over the intercom and told students
and teachers to duck, to get away from the windows and to lock the
doors.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Lake Worth Police Chief William Smith shouted through a
microphone: ``Your children are safe. . . . No child in the school
is in any danger right now. No child has been injured. A teacher
has been injured by a gunshot.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene looked like pictures from Columbine High School in
Colorado, where last year two students went on a rampage and killed
12 classmates and a teacher before killing themselves. Since then,
schools across the country and in Palm Beach County have been on
heightened alert, extra wary of talk of guns and bombs and violence
in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the worst nightmare that could ever happen in
a public school,'' interim Superintendent Ben Marlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what, my son is not coming back to this
school,'' said parent Susan Wells. ``No way.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the gray walls of Grunow's classroom were empty
except for cut out letters that read, ``Welcome to Mr. Grunow's
Class.'' Grunow's cluttered desk offered clues to his life: A worn
brown briefcase, a golden apple paperweight, a half bag of Jelly
Belly's candy, a carnation. Still on the 39 student desks:
notebooks, hair brushes, purses, pens and old homework, a thumbed
copy of ``The Klutz Strikes Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Brazill had stolen the tiny gun, unloaded but with
bullets sitting alongside it, from a dresser drawer at his
grandfather's home sometime last week.
</P>
<P>
   So far, police don't know why Brazill brought the gun to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no information to support there was any plan or any
prior thought to this,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill had been sent home from school around 1:30 p.m. for his
throwing water balloons. Grunow had nothing to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill then walked the nearly 25 blocks from school to the home
of Everlena Josey, one of his grandmothers. He arrived hot and,
Josey thought, angry, around 2 p.m. or 2:30 p.m. He asked her for
the key to his apartment a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if anything seemed wrong with Brazill, Alfred Josui, an
uncle, said: ``He was the same old Nate. Just that he wasn't
smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazill went to his place and apparently took the gun he had
stolen a week earlier. He grabbed his green bicycle and started
back for school. No one noticed him as he came back on campus, said
Schools Police Chief Jim Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill wanted to see two girls in Grunow's classroom so he
knocked on the door. It was the last day of school, after all, and
he wanted to say goodbye, students said. Grunow answered and said
he had to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The two exchanged words. Brazill told police Grunow shoved him
and told him to return to class. Brazill took out the gun, firing
once. There were three more bullets inside, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he aimed the gun at teacher James and said, ``Don't bother
me, Mr. James.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazill surrendered quietly, putting his hands in the air a few
minutes later when a police officer spotted him on 17th Avenue
North. He told the officer, ``I shot somebody,'' according to a
police report.
</P>
<P>
   A father of two young children, a 5-year-old son and an infant
daughter, Grunow and his wife, Pam, had known each other since they
were 20 years old. Grunow loved to play basketball (he was an
All-Conference player at Jupiter High) and even coached the
after-school team. He was always seeking out those who needed extra
help, colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   Grunow started teaching at Lake Worth Middle in 1995,
transferring there from another middle school in suburban Boca
Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the bad kids, he'd find the good in them,'' said Ashley
Watson, a 16-year-old former student. ``He could do that. He saw
something in me. He knew I was looking for something and he
encouraged me to get into drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlin went to the teacher's home and met with Pam Grunow for
about 30 minutes Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's devastated,'' he said. ``Like she said, the question is
'Why? Why?' We don't have an answer for her.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cruz, a 15-year-old in eighth grade at Lake Worth Middle,
said Grunow had been riding Brazill pretty hard in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been saying for a while he don't like the teacher
(Grunow),'' said Cruz, who didn't attend classes Friday but stopped
by to pick up his previously confiscated cell phone. ``He's always
bugging him: Tuck in your shirt. What about your grades? You know.
He's been saying he's going to shoot someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz said he didn't take Brazill seriously because he didn't
think he'd do it. ``He's a goofball.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said teacher and student seemed to have a pretty good
relationship. Brazill's grades were A's and B's and he rarely
missed a day. He played the tuba in the band and planned next year
to be a peer mediator for kids in trouble. ``He told the
investigators that he liked the teacher,'' Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look that way to Loren Looney, 13, who was in the
classroom when Brazill came to the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get it out of my mind . . . Mr. Grunow said, 'Don't
point that thing at me,''' she said. ``And he shot him. I feel so
bad, I loved Mr. Grunow so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Gandolfo was also in Grunow's class when he saw Brazill
fire. ``I was 10 feet from the gun,'' the seventh-grader said.
``Everyone was screaming, crying, hysterical. One girl was on the
floor. She couldn't move she was so scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what Mr. Grunow could have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazill lives with his mother in Lake Worth and his father lives
in Daytona Beach. The father, also named Nathaniel Brazill, said he
had seen his son two weeks ago on a visit to Palm Beach County and
he seemed fine. He described his son as a quiet, respectful,
bright, articulate, church-going computer nerd.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragedy,'' the father said. ``I am so sorry for the
family of this teacher, so very sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   The father plans to drive to Lake Worth today. ``It's going to
be a long weekend. Let's face it _ the boy could be facing the
chair for this kind of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Grief counselors will be at school today for any students or
teachers who need to talk. Smith and Marlin may appear Monday on
ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Frank Bermudez, Brazill's music teacher at Lake Worth
Middle: ``I don't know who to pray harder for: Nate's family or Mr.
Grunow's
</P>
<P>
   family.''

EDITORIAL: THE SOFT MONEY EXPLOSION
</HEADLINE>
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, May 28:
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, at the MCI Sports Center in Washington, the
Democratic Party raised an astonishing $26.5 million at a dinner
headlined by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and
attended by about 12,000 loyal Democrats, some paying a
half-million dollars for the privilege. This staggering sum
surpassed what until then had been the record, the $21.3 million
raised less than a month before by the Republicans and George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion cemented Clinton's legacy as the most persuasive
and productive fund-raiser in American political history. Joe
Lockhart, his press secretary, suggested that his boss might end up
raising a cool billion before he is through. But it also dramatized
something less deserving of awe, namely the complete domination of
the campaign environment by soft money.
</P>
<P>
   At one time or another, Clinton and Gore have decried soft
money. Even so, the soft money race proceeds at a torrid clip,
without shame or remorse in either political party. As of last
week, the two parties had raised at least $200 million in soft
money, a record for this point in the election cycle, and they are
well on their way to doubling the $260 million in soft money raised
in 1996. Meanwhile, individual contributions are reaching nosebleed
altitudes when some dinner guests fork over $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money has been making a mockery of the post-Watergate
campaign finance laws ever since the parties began exploiting a
loophole that permitted unlimited contributions to the political
parties rather than individual candidates. But the new numbers are
so outlandish that they numb the mind and threaten to dull the
capacity for outrage. Yet this is the very same money that has
purchased not only overnight stays in the Lincoln bedroom, but
access to the congressional offices where legislation affecting
millions of people is written. The main difference now is that
there is more of it.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the post-Watergate system has come about for
several reasons. One is Janet Reno's political timidity and the
failure of her Justice Department to investigate the fund-raising
abuses of 1996 _ the illegal foreign money, the Lincoln bedroom
money and all the rest of it. Another is the unwillingness of the
Republican leadership in the Senate, notably Trent Lott, to allow a
fair up-or-down vote on the broad ban on soft money sponsored by
Sens. John McCain and Russell Feingold. But why should he? A system
that allows Lott and Republican big shots in the House like Tom
DeLay to shake down contributors in exchange for influence rewards
them every bit as much as it rewards the administration.
</P>
<P>
   A third reason is the spinelessness of the Federal Election
Commission, the government's main enforcement agency. The
commission has been as ineffectual as Reno in investigating abuses
and imposing restraints on the parties. But Lott and others, with
Bill Clinton's acquiescence, are determined to make it weaker
still. Last week, the Senate confirmed a Republican named Bradley
Smith for a seat on the commission despite Smith's sworn opposition
to the very campaign finance laws he is supposed to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   His approval was part of a deal in which the Republicans agreed
to unblock 16 of Clinton's judicial nominations. So just when the
fund-raising system is spinning wildly out of control, the country
is treated to a bipartisan sellout of the agency that is obliged
under the law to regulate it.
</P>
<P>
   The polls say that the public wants reform, and in recent months
dozens of corporations have decided to boycott what they see as
little more than a shakedown operation. But for the most part the
political leadership seems tone deaf. Bush would preserve the soft
money loophole. At the Democratic gala, Gore said that the next
dinner four years from now would not cost nearly as much because as
president he would bring ``meaningful'' change. But neither he nor
Clinton seemed the least bit embarrassed about dipping into the
trough one more time.

EDITORIAL: RUSSIA'S PROMISING TAX PLAN  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, May 28:
</P>
<P>
   Though Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin, has yet to chart
a clear course on most domestic fronts, he made clear last week
that he intends to move aggressively to mend the economy, ending
years of meandering policies. The Putin government asked parliament
to replace the country's progressive but largely dysfunctional
personal income tax with a simple flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   By radically simplifying the code and slashing rates, Putin
hopes to raise collections by cutting down on the corruption that
has left his government starving for revenue. If the plan works,
Putin would not only have the money to provide badly needed public
services, but also establish the credibility to push for further
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The government proposed to replace the current income tax, with
rates ranging from 12 percent to 30 percent, with a code with just
one rate, 13 percent. Many in the country, including the
Communists, want to hold on to progressive rates. But in a society
where few people pay anything close to their legally required
taxes, and wealthy individuals often pay no tax, the idea of a
progressive tax code is an illusion.
</P>
<P>
   By cutting rates and simplifying the code, Putin hopes to
encourage people to pay taxes and make it easier for the government
to track down those who do not. If Putin has the will, a flat tax
makes a crackdown feasible. A flat tax can also cut down political
corruption, removing layers of subsidies in the code that officials
like to shower on favored constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is right that tax rates are too high. A destructive
competition to raise revenue rages among Russia's local, regional
and federal authorities. Each sets rates high before the other
jurisdictions can do so. Indeed, local officials often help
businesses hide their local tax payments so that local governments
can avoid sharing the proceeds with Moscow as the law requires.
Russia has created the worst of all tax worlds: high rates and
little revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The government also announced other tax reforms, including
eliminating a regressive, ineffective business tax and raising
gasoline and tobacco taxes. Part of the motivation is economic
reform. But the package of reforms, depending on the details, might
also tilt tax collections toward sources that go primarily to
Moscow and away from those that feed local and regional coffers.
Putin is already engaged in a power struggle with regional
governors, warning them that he intends to rein in their autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be easy to make the flat tax and other reforms work.
Corruption and bureaucratic incompetence will not disappear
overnight. But Putin is starting his economic reform in the right
place. If Russia can get its tax system in order and the Kremlin
can begin to count on a steady source of income for government
programs, the country can at last begin to deal with some of its
chronic problems, including a failing health care system, erratic
law enforcement and the poverty of millions of elderly citizens.

COLUMN: A CHARMER FINALLY HAMSTRUNG IN A ROGUES BIATHLON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., N.Y., Fla.)   By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back when life was good, Robert E. Brennan had racehorses,
waterfront homes, helicopters, a plane and the tanned good looks
and hint of mystery that make for star quality. Financing it all
was his nationwide penny stock firm, First Jersey Securities, which
he promoted with televised commercials from his helicopter,
imploring investors to ``Come grow with us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, he always seemed headed somewhere exciting _ a
possible run for political office, the dedication of another
building his generosity made possible, a visit with an important
politician.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday he seemed headed for jail.
</P>
<P>
   An artist of the shady deal and a champion charmer, Brennan, 56,
was momentarily out of moves. In civil actions, a federal judge
ruled in 1995 that Brennan's operation was a ``massive and
continuing fraud,'' and last year a New Jersey judge called him ``a
big crook.'' He owes $120 million in restitution to state and
federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he surrendered his prized golf course in Monmouth
County to avoid jail on contempt charges. Creditors are also
seeking the palatial house in Juno Beach, Fla., where he lives and
the multimillion-dollar off-shore trusts they say he controls in
Gibraltar and Nevis.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes a bit bloodshot, the once-voluble Brennan was subdued
outside the courtroom in Manhattan, saying only: ``This is a
difficult time. I hope you'll respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Brennan may be downcast now, but for years he led the
crowded field of New Jersey's Rogues Biathlon _ winning respect
while outrunning investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you summed it up in a word, it might be audacity,'' said
James M. Smith, once chief of the New Jersey Bureau of Securities.
``The in-your-face way of operating, the open challenge to
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan created First Jersey in 1974 out of an investment firm
that had been suspended by New Jersey officials for securities
violations. It went nationwide even as authorities investigated
Brennan for fraudulently inflating the price of cheap stocks, often
in lackluster companies in which he had an interest. The stocks
were sold by more than 1,000 salesmen making cold calls and reading
from sales scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Government investigations rarely went smoothly. In 1980, an
entire filing cabinet of documents in a case against First Jersey
vanished from a Securities and Exchange Commission office in New
York. A federal judge, John E. Sprizzo, removed himself from the
case after learning that Brennan had named a racehorse Sprizzo. The
two-legged Sprizzo barred Brennan from ever again naming a horse
after a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan saw opportunity everywhere. When Forbes magazine ran an
article critical of him, he ripped off the cover, which featured
his picture, and sent it to clients, never mentioning the words
inside.
</P>
<P>
   If his money was ill-gotten, at least he was charitable.
Buildings at Seton Hall University, the Jersey Shore Medical
Center, and St. Benedict's Prep School in Newark bear the Brennan
name. ``He is a hero to our students, to their parents and to the
people of the city of Newark,'' the Rev. Edwin D. Leahy, St.
Benedict's headmaster, testified at Brennan's 1994 federal civil
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful people were drawn to him and his money. Richard J.
Hughes, the late governor of New Jersey, and John Degnan, a former
state attorney general, were on one of his corporate boards. W.
Hunt Dumont, the former U.S. attorney in Newark and now a state
judge, was First Jersey's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have charm up the gazoo,'' said Edward Koch, the
former mayor of New York, who attended parties at Brennan's home
and had him to Gracie Mansion. ``He had it. He would make you feel
comfortable. If he could send a car or his helicopter to bring you
to his home in South Jersey, he would do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for his business, all you knew was he never went to jail,''
Koch said. ``You had the feeling, here was this brave guy standing
up to government. I guess they finally got him and rightfully so, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever ``getting'' Brennan means. Although bankrupt and
adamant that he cannot pay the government, he ran up $2,000 in golf
fees and nearly $3,000 in liquor store bills in two months last
year, and $248,000 in private jet fees for an overseas trip last
summer, government lawyers say. Just after filing for bankruptcy in
1995, they say, he went to a Las Vegas casino looking to cash in
$500,000 in chips he neglected to report in the bankruptcy case.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's court agreement takes away the aptly named Due
Process golf course, formerly his horse farm, but allows him to use
his office and apartment there until the course is sold in
bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   He left court crushed. But there were reports Friday that back
at the golf course, he was flying high again _ in a helicopter.

KIYOSHI KUROMIYA, 57, FIGHTER FOR THE RIGHTS OF AIDS PATIENTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Wyo., Ala.)  By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kiyoshi Kuromiya, who was born in an internment camp for
Japanese-Americans and spent much of his adult life battling for
civil rights and relief for AIDS patients, died on May 10 in
Philadelphia, where he lived. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   When Kuromiya was told he had AIDS in 1989, he became a
self-taught expert on the disease. Patients fare best, he believed,
when they understand the illness, explore treatment options and
participate in medical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   He ran a community chest to help patients get free drugs,
published a newsletter and ran a 24-hour information line. He even
accepted collect calls from prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   He also provided free Internet access to AIDS patients in the
Philadelphia region and ran an underground buyers' club that
supplied marijuana free to patients who found that it helped
alleviate nausea from their other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Kuromiya, a short man with a pony tail and a wry wit, never
forgot his beginnings at the Heart Mountain internment camp in
Wyoming, and kept a large picture of it on his apartment wall.
Several years ago, he and his mother, Amiko Kuromiya, revisited the
site.
</P>
<P>
   His activism began with the civil rights movement, when he was a
student at the University of Pennsylvania. He was beaten by
sheriff's deputies on a voter registration march in Montgomery,
Ala. In 1965, he marched in front of Independence Hall in an early
rally for gay rights, and he was one of the founders of Act Up, a
protest group concerned with AIDS issues.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, he assisted R. Buckminster Fuller, the architect and
thinker, in writing ``Critical Path'' (St. Martin's Press). The
book sketched a vision of a bountiful future created by
technological advances. In what James Traub in The New York Times
Book Review called ``a bizarre and often revelatory volume,'' the
authors suggested that the blossoming of new technology had the
potential to end war.
</P>
<P>
   Kuromiya called his program of free Internet access the Critical
Path Project after the book, and his blending of social activism
with the Internet was seen by some as a realization of his prophecy
of the power of information.
</P>
<P>
   He sat for hours at his computer in his tiny apartment making
connections with patients, advocates, researchers and policy-makers
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a role in framing the use of the new technology. He
was one of the lead plaintiffs in the successful 1996 challenge in
federal court in Philadelphia to the Communications Decency Act,
which made it a crime to circulate ``patently offensive'' sexual
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone might find material that we find important
offensive,'' he said in court. ``I don't know what `indecent'
means. I don't know what `patently offensive' means in terms of
providing life-saving information to people with AIDS, including
teen-agers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuromiya was also a nationally ranked Scrabble player. He is
survived by his mother; a brother, Larry, and a sister, Merijane,
all of whom live in the Los Angeles area.

 &HT;    Prosecutors hope to restore public's trust
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ For six-and-a-half years, the Branch Davidians
were someone else's problem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when the world first learned about David Koresh and his
Branch Davidian followers, Michael Bradford was a state district
judge in Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bradford, the well-respected U.S. attoney for the Eastern
District of Texas, is serving as co-lead counsel in the Branch
Davidian civil trial with Assistant Attorney General Marie Hagen, a
20-year government attorney from Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   While their personalities and courtroom styles are drastically
different, Bradford said he and Hagen are committed to restoring
the government's tarnished image by defending it against what they
consider false accusations by the Davidians and their attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``At stake is public trust in law enforcement,'' Bradford said.
``With the allegations that have been made and put out to the
public about the incident, it has undermined confidence in law
enforcement. Those allegations are not true and I thought it was
important to have an opportunity to show that those allegations are
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hagen works at keeping a low profile, Bradford, 47, is
popular and well-known around Beaumont in southeast Texas, where he
has lived since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Before his appointment in 1994 as U.S. attorney, Bradford was in
private practice, served as a federal prosecutor, a federal
magistrate and as a state district judge. He also is active in
Beaumont civic organizations and works with the Boy Scouts, friends
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very well-thought of,'' said Beaumont attorney Lum
Hawthorn. ``No one is going to say anything bad about Mike
Bradford.''
</P>
<P>
   James Mehaffy, judge of Beaumont's 58th State District Court,
hired Bradford, who had clerked at the Court of Criminal Appeals in
Austin, straight out of the University of Texas law school to work
at his law firm in 1979. Mehaffy now is judge in the same courtroom
that Bradford presided over before he was named U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anybody on earth who could handle a case this
controversial and this complex with dignity and aplomb and achieve
a result which is just and in the best interest of both the
government and the other parties, it would be Mike Bradford,''
Mehaffy said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford stood out among UT law grads, Mehaffy said, and there
was no question even then that Bradford would be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has an air of quiet authority about him and that was
immediately attractive,'' Mehaffy said. ``He didn't try to oversell
himself and he has a dignity and a sense of purpose about him that
were very attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehaffy had a general law practice, but Bradford leaned toward
criminal law, he said. Mehaffy remembers getting a letter from a
court reporter in a criminal district court when Bradford had been
practicing law for about eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter said, 'We just wanted to tell you how highly we all
think of Mike Bradford. Most young lawyers fumble around and seem
unsure of themselves and want a lot of help. But Mike Bradford, to
the contrary, seems like he has been practicing law for a long
time. He did a great job on the armed robbery case he did last
week.' I didn't even know anything about it. Here is a guy who is
so sure of himself that it didn't occur to him to tell his employer
that he was going down to try his first criminal case. That is the
story of his career.''

   When he learned that Bradford had agreed to serve as co-lead
counsel in the Davidian case, Mehaffy said he talked to him to make
sure his friend had not made a terrible mistake. He said he told
Bradford that he surely would not emerge from the case ``without
some serious battle scars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Look, somebody has to do it and everybody deserves a
good representation in court, and it looks like this is just my
job. I am not particularly happy with the kind of criticism that I
might be exposed to, but it is my job and I am the man who has to
do it.' I don't think he is seeking glory. I don't think he is
seeking fame. I don't think he is seeking to change the world. I
think he is simply looking to do a good job as a lawyer. He is the
consummate professional,'' Mehaffy said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, 47, admits he didn't leap into the case instantly or
blindly. He has a 6-year-old son at home and he knew the extra
duties would take him away from home and his office, which already
keeps him very busy. He also knew that he would be required to be
in Washington several days a week and that his young son could not
fully understand his absence or the missed childhood events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I thought about it for several weeks before I agreed
to do it,'' Bradford said. ``The hardest part is the family
sacrifices. And I already had so many responsibilities running the
Eastern District. But I felt it was a very important case and it
was important that the government be given a fair opportunity to
get the truth out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford served on an advisory commitee for Attorney General
Janet Reno for two years and met monthly with Reno to discuss
departmental issues. That familiarity with Bradford led top Justice
Department officials to pick him to step into the high-profile
case, said Patrick Black of Tyler, head of the federal public
defender's office for the Eastern District of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have 94 U.S. attorneys in the United States, yet she chose
Mike Bradford, not only because of the geographical location, but
because she knew him personally and values his opinion,'' Black
said. ``Mike has exceptionally high ethics. He is very diligent,
both as a lawyer and as a judge. He is very thorough, but I also
think he is very fair. If Mike Bradford gives you his word, I don't
need it reduced to writing. I believe it. I take it as a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Some attorneys who have dealt with Hagen deride her
win-at-all-cost philosophy about defending lawsuits and say many of
her tactics have added fuel to the public's growing mistrust about
how the government handled the entire matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government's philosophy is that any plaintiff who
dares to sue the government is scum and should be treated
accordingly,'' said Houston attorney Mike Caddell, lead plaintiff
attorney in the Davidian wrongful-death lawsuit. ``That is the
message I get. They think that anyone who dares challenge the FBI
or the Justice Department deserves every game, every trick, every
delay or obstruction that they can throw at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You encounter that fairly often in civil litigation with
various defendants. But ususally it's the chemical companies or the
tobacco companies that use those tactics. You don't expect that
from the Justice Department,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen, 44, a graduate of Cornell Law School in New York, shuns
publicity and declined an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the Greta Garbo of this whole case,'' she said, referring
to the reclusive film star. ``Interviews are just not something
that I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagen, a senior trial counsel in the Justice Department's civil
division, has represented the government successfully in cases
ranging from the Tailhook sexual harassment scandal to a suit
involving the death of 47 sailors in an explosion onboard the USS
Iowa battleship in 1989. She drew criticism for her handling of the
Iowa case, just as she has become a lightning rod in the Branch
Davidian case.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr., who is
presiding over the Branch Davidian lawsuit, to sanction government
attorneys for what he described as their ``dilatory'' tactics in
the production of documents and other evidence in the case. Smith
rejected that motion last month but has expressed impatience with
government attorneys during part of the pretrial discovery process.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said he is aware of the criticism that has dogged Hagen
throughout her career, adding that it was something he considered
in deciding if he would accept the appointment as special counsel
to the attorney general and head up the Davidian case with Hagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something, obviously, that you have to be concerned
about,'' Bradford said. ``So far, we haven't had any problems and I
am hopeful that we won't. Actually, we get along great. We have
worked together very well. Our personalities are pretty different,
but I think they mesh well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a very dedicated and hard-working lawyer and has really
devoted a great deal of time to this case. She is a very
high-energy person, and I am a little more laid-back personality,
but we are both devoted to getting this case presented to the court
in the best way possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike criticism she has received for her handling of the
Branch Davidian case, Hagen also drew complaints in the USS Iowa
case.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland attorney Kreig Brusnahan filed suit against the
government on behalf of the family of Clayton Hartwig, a sailor
initially thought to have sabotaged the warship guns because he was
despondent over a homosexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a formal apology by the Navy for wrongfully placing
the blame for the explosion on Hartwig, Hagen continued to assert
that the Justice Department still considered him responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie Hagen is aggressive, disingenuous, mean-spirited and
controversial,'' Brusnahan said. ``...She doesn't care what the
truth is. She won't let the truth stand in her way. It doesn't
matter whose feelings she tramples on if it gets in the way of what
is right for the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate Judge David Perelman criticized Hagen for withholding
documents in the case that dealt with ``lessons learned'' by the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were the lessons learned by the Navy from the Iowa tragedy and
its aftermath the positive ones to be more vigilant and precise ...
as to modes of operation aboard war vessels?'' the judge asked.
``Or were they perhaps less laudable ones, such as not to engage in
a cover-up after a screw-up, to be more circumspect in choosing a
scapegoat when attempting a whitewash; ... or that it is not quite
as easy to mislead the public as might be assumed?''
</P>
<P>
   Hagen also has been accused of holding back important
information in the Branch Davidian case, particularly the FBI's use
of a pyrotechnic tear-gas device on the final day of the siege.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hagen and former Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston of
Waco, who helped prosecute the criminal case against the Davidians
in 1994, have said that they had not realized that the tear-gas
device could cause a fire and were unaware that when government
agents referred to ``military gas'' they were talking about
pyrotechnic devices.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston allowed filmmaker Michael McNulty access to an evidence
room where items collected from the fire at Mount Carmel were
stored. McNulty discovered a pyrotechnic tear gas canister among
the evidence, exposing what many considered another government lie.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the use of the pyrotechnic device prompted
Reno to appoint former Missour Sen. John Danforth to investigate
government actions on April 19, 1993, the final day of the 51-day
siege with Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   It also prompted an angry Hagen to telephone Johnston to berate
him for allowing McNulty into the evidence room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Hagen and I had a disagreement regarding public access to
that evidence, but beyond that, I don't really want to comment with
the case pending,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department memos uncovered in August revealed that an
FBI agent had told Johnston in a 1993 interview that a ``military
gas round'' had been used during the early part of the Mount Carmel
tear-gas operation on April 19, 1993. That was contrary to
government claims that no incendiary devices were used on the day
that 76 Davidians perished in a fire at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's former boss, U.S. Attorney Bill Blagg of San Antonio,
faxed the memos to Johnston, who considered them a ``shot over his
head,'' as Blagg describes it. Johnston then dashed off a letter to
Reno, warning her that Justice Department officials could be
withholding pertinent information from her.
</P>
<P>
   The rift resulted in Blagg's office being recused from the case
and led to Bradford's involvement.

 &HT;    Reynolds running out of time
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before a recent morning workout, Butch Reynolds
ponders what has lured him to the track at Life University. Why
bother with the aggravating 45-minute trek from his Spartan
apartment in Stone Mountain? Why, at 35, put the body through the
torture that is the 400 meters? Why solicit contributions for his
training fund?
</P>
<P>
   A guy his age should be through with chasing the dream. Others
in his shoes are living large in the 'burbs, using their name to
secure a cushy job, if not simply living off their winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds has a historian's sense of where he has been _ of
battles won and lost _ but what stirs him from the past more than
anything is Michael Johnson, hero of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and
the sport's current leading man. The same character who last summer
covered 400 meters in 43.18 seconds, trampling a world record
Reynolds clocked 11 years earlier on the night of his life in
Zurich, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a love for running, and I still think I can
really give him a race,'' Reynolds said. ``We know who the favorite
is, of course. But I don't see him as invincible.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds fancies himself a threat to Johnson later this summer
at the Sydney Olympics, although his spot on the U.S. team is far
from a sure thing. That's why he headed south from Ohio almost two
years ago, to ready himself for one last go at Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
   And to regain his world record, implausible as it might seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``August 17, 1988, at 8:40 in the evening, I knew that that was
my day,'' said Reynolds, reflecting. ``I was the man, Harry `Butch'
Reynolds. . . . Oh man, that was a quarter-of-a-million-dollar day
_ $100,000 bonus from the meet promoter, shoe bonuses, everything.
I did all that, then in 1990 I went to running for $200 and $300 (a
race). It was never about the money, but obviously money pays the
bills and makes the house payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look back at my bank account, I say, `Man, what
happened?' But that's what happens when you pay legal fees and you
live to a certain standard, and you're not making money for three
years (during a suspension).''
</P>
<P>
   If ever a man had reason to be ticked, to swear that he had been
cheated by the running gods, he is Reynolds. A month after his
blistering 43.29 record, he settled for a silver medal in the Seoul
Olympics behind 19-year-old upstart Steve Lewis, only the
third-fastest American at the trials. An Ohio State graduate,
Reynolds did return to Columbus with a gold after anchoring the
1,600-meter relay in a time that equaled the world record.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two years later, at 26 and in his prime, Reynolds was
busted by the International Track Federation for alleged use of the
steroid nandrolone. After a series of legal fights, it eventually
required a last-minute order from U.S. Supreme Court Justice John
Paul Stevens to clear Reynolds to run in the 1992 Olympic Trials in
New Orleans, where he finished fifth, making him an alternate.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Reynolds successfully fought the drug charges
and cleared his name. His lawyers argued that the urine samples
producing the positive test result had not been kept safe from
tampering, suggesting even that the samples tested belonged to a
female German athlete.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. courts later ruled in his favor, awarding a lottery-like
sum of $27 million as compensation for the false accusation.
Reynolds has not seen a dime, however, because U.S. courts have no
jurisdiction over the Monaco-based International Amateur Athletic
Federation. ``I'd have been cool with half of it,'' he said with a
laugh. ``I'd take a cool million, even.''
</P>
<P>
   The chances aren't good. ``I haven't come across an attorney yet
that said I'm going to get that money,'' Reynolds said, shrugging.
``I'm fought out when it comes to that. I can't fight no more. That
would make me sick, because I fought so long to clear my name.''
</P>
<P>
   The redemption he so desperately sought at the Atlanta Olympics
dissolved into pain when he crumpled to the red-rubberized track
with a hamstring injury during the 400-meter semifinals. The man
considered Johnson's only real threat for the gold was done for the
Games. Another gold medal on the relay was gone, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the new-and-improved Harry ``Butch'' Reynolds is back for
another run, and what matters most is that he has found peace of
mind. So what if the odds are badly stacked against him. Or if
Olympic history tells us that the average age of the past four
400-meter champions is 25, and the oldest of the bunch _ Johnson,
28 in Atlanta _ appears not to have lost a step as he readies for
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't always just trying to beat Michael. I was trying to
beat the world,'' Reynolds said. ``I was fighting the world
governing body. I was racing everybody _ athletes, federations and
their leaders. I haven't just raced the competition since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has been fortunate enough that a lot things have been
given to him. The only person he's really beaten for four or fives
years (in the 400) was Butch Reynolds, when I was out there. I've
been taking second to him. So who knows what I could have achieved
without all the little anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you run, you want to run free. I ran with lot of
redemption on my mind, a lot of bitterness. I'm tired of running
like that. I want to come this time and run because I want to
run.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Reynolds functions on prayer and a shoestring
budget. Gone are the corporate sponsors and the entourage of
massage therapists and coaches. Reynolds covers his rent and
grocery bills with a modest paycheck from Olympic sponsor Home
Depot, where he works part-time in the inside-gardening department.
(``Welcome to Home Depot, can I help you? Want to buy a lawn mower?
Want to buy an edger?''). Fitness instructor and health specialist
Anita McGhee, chiropractor Michael Hatrak, coach Chad Black and his
support staff don't receive a paycheck. Fitness International
allows him free use of its Stone Mountain facility.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Akron, where he often has pitched in to help the
community, several businessmen have established a fund that is
accepting donations to help cover his training expenses of more
than $25,000 leading up to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds qualified for the trials with a 45.1 clocking early
last season, but he rarely has ventured into competition since.
Instead, he has spent most of his time on the Life University track
working out with Olympic hopefuls Kevin Braunskill, Kevin
Jefferson, Milton Campbell and Torrence Zellner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butch is stronger than he's ever been,'' said Black, the
group's coach. ``Physically, he should be ready to go. We're
working on his strength and power _ trying to peak him for the
Olympic Trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether his dream has a prayer will be determined after he opens
his season next month in Europe, followed by the Olympic Trials in
July. ``My job is to make the (Olympic) team,'' Reynolds said.
``Then, I have another two months to beat Michael in Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, if the longshot were to come home, Reynolds finally might
gain redemption.

AL SIMON, 88, SITCOM CREATOR WHO PAVED THE WAY FOR RERUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Simon, who helped create some of early television's most
successful sitcoms as well as the technical wherewithal to save
them on high-quality film for summer reruns and syndication, died
on Tuesday in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Simon joined the world of television in 1946, working on the
production of live programs shot in Hollywood. He got his real
start when Ralph Edwards took his radio show ``Truth or
Consequences'' to television and hired Simon as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   The show's sponsors pressed its producers to deliver an East
Coast audience at a time when coast-to-coast transmission was
technically impossible. The program was live and could be
rebroadcast only by kinescopes of dubious quality.
</P>
<P>
   Refining a technique introduced some years earlier in the motion
picture industry, Simon had Edwards record his show with three
motion-picture cameras on 35-mm film and two-track audio. The
resulting film equaled the picture quality of a live broadcast, and
``Truth or Consequences'' became the first program filmed regularly
before a live audience.
</P>
<P>
   Desi Arnaz asked Simon to adapt the three-camera system for ``I
Love Lucy,'' starring himself and his wife, Lucille Ball. In the
1950s Simon also worked on the production of ``The George Burns and
Gracie Allen Show.''
</P>
<P>
   As president of Filmways Productions, Simon played a central
role in the presentation of popular 1960s sitcoms like ``The
Beverly Hillbillies,'' ``Petticoat Junction,'' ``Green Acres'' and
``Mr. Ed.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon, who grew up in New York, was a graduate of Columbia
College. He also received a law degree from New York University,
but preferring the life of a writer, he began contributing to
several national magazines. After serving in the Army in World War
II, he moved to Hollywood to work in television.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Caro Jones Simon; a son, David, of
Los Angeles; and a granddaughter.

EMILY W. REED, 89, LIBRARIAN IN A RACIAL DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Md., N.C., Ind.)  By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emily W. Reed, who in 1959 enraged Alabama segregationists by
allowing a book about a fuzzy white rabbit marrying a fuzzy black
rabbit onto the shelves of the state's central library, died on May
19 at a retirement community in Cockeysville, Md. She was 89.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation came as blacks were fighting to be allowed in
public libraries throughout the South and a segregationist in
Florida was demanding that ``The Three Little Pigs'' be removed
from library shelves because the pigs were depicted in different
colors. Such disputes, mirroring the struggle for access to schools
and public libraries, were widely covered in the press.
</P>
<P>
   In Reed's case, the book in question was ``The Rabbits'
Wedding,'' written and illustrated by Garth Williams and published
by Harper &AMP; Brothers in 1958. The book, which described a moonlit
wedding attended by all the animals of the forest, was intended for
children 3 to 7 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   The book was attacked by The Montgomery Home News, a publication
of the Montgomery, Ala., chapter of the White Citizens Council, on
the ground that it promoted racial integration.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Reed, who was the director of the Alabama Public
Library Service Division, which lent books to local libraries
throughout the state, ordered the book to be put on the agency's
reserve shelves. This meant that local librarians visiting
Montgomery could get the book by requesting it, but could not find
it on the open shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Harpers issued a statement from Williams saying the book had
``no political significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was completely unaware that animals with white fur, such as
white polar bears and white dogs and white rabbits, were considered
blood relations of white human beings,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that his tale of rabbits ``was not written for adults,
who will not understand it because it is only about a soft, furry
love and has no hidden messages of hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said at the time that she liked the book and that her
action was not tantamount to banning it. In an interview with The
New York Times, she said that some local libraries in Alabama
continued to put the book on their open shelves but that the state
agency had some difficulty with it. State Sen. E.O. Eddins of
Marengo County, who led the fight against Williams' book, said Reed
had refused to answer when he asked her if she believed in racial
integration. She said this had nothing to do with running the
library service.
</P>
<P>
   A measure was then introduced in the Alabama Legislature to
require the state library chief to be a native of Alabama and a
graduate of the University of Alabama or Auburn University. That
would have disqualified Reed, who was born in Ashville, N.C. But in
1960 she left Alabama to become coordinator of adult services for
the Washington, D.C., library system.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Wheelock Reed grew up in Indiana and graduated from
Indiana University. She worked in libraries in Detroit, Hawaii and
Louisiana and taught library science at the University of Florida
before becoming Alabama's library director in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   After six years with the Washington library system, Reed moved
to Baltimore, where she was coordinator of adult services at the
Enoch Pratt Free Library until she retired in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   She was cited for her work in Alabama by the American Library
Association, and this year received the scroll of honor from the
Freedom to Read Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   She had no immediate survivors.

DESPITE CRIMES, NEW YORKERS GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 By RANDY KENNEDY and ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In recent months, even a statistician could be
forgiven for feeling as if the bad old New York crime days weren't
so far away after all: Seven Wendy's employees herded into a
walk-in refrigerator in Queens and gunned down mercilessly, shot in
the head. Nine livery-cab drivers killed in four months. Mother
robbed in a subway by a gunman holding a pistol to a toddler's
head. Woman pushed into an oncoming train. Woman attacked with a
brick on Midtown street.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was exactly these kinds of
violent crimes that made the city seem like a dark, cartoonish
Gotham _ a town of mayhem completely beyond the control of the
police. The hallmarks of those days have not faded from memory _
the random attacks, the bystanders caught in crossfire, the gunmen
taking money from victims and killing them anyway, gratuitously,
almost for sport.
</P>
<P>
   So one might expect that the recent headlines _ especially when
combined with a surge in the murder rate, the first jump in a major
crime category in eight years _ would be dredging up some old
feelings. Feelings, maybe, that the reliable downward march of
crime, like the reliable upward march of the stock market, cannot
last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Feelings like the ones voiced by Mohammed T. Abboud, a clerk at
a Harlem bodega, who remembers the jittery days when he kept a ice
pick in the cash register. ``There is nothing inside but money
now,'' he said. ``But you never know. There may come a time to put
it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in dozens of interviews across the city, it turned out to
be difficult to catch many people _ especially affluent people _ in
the act of worrying about the return of crime. As New Yorkers do,
most start out conversations by saying reflexively that, of course,
``you have to keep your antennas up,'' as one Bronx resident put
it. But after a few minutes, it becomes apparent that they are much
more preoccupied with a long list of more prosaic issues that seem
to affect their lives more directly than gnawing fears of crime:
their children's education, their sky-high rents, street-side
parking, even getting a seat on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises some questions: Why does it seem that high-profile
crimes do not resonate in the city the way they used to? Wasn't
there a time when five people slain in a fast-food restaurant would
cause people to think twice before venturing from home? A time when
nine related killings, five of them in one month, would have been
seen as something of a crime wave?
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and police officials certainly worry
about New Yorkers seeing it that way. When several hundred officers
were assigned last month to protect independent taxi drivers, one
official explained that the police were under pressure from City
Hall to safeguard the perception, not just the reality, that crime
is down.
</P>
<P>
   But if the views of Sandra Frierson, 55, a painter and sculptor,
are in any way reflective of the mood of New York, City Hall does
not have much to worry about.

   Frierson lives in Brooklyn, and has rented apartments in every
borough except for Staten Island. She remembers the days when she
was so unnerved by the city's sense of imminent danger that she
often had her husband walk her to the store.
</P>
<P>
   Although she said that the killings in Flushing, Queens, were
``despicable'' and proved ``how sick we've all become,'' she went
on to make this admission: ``As bad as I feel for the people who
were killed, I never think something like that could happen to me
these days. It's like it's outside the realm of my world.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Repetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, a
police watchdog group, said he thought those feelings were
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think New Yorkers have certainly become more concerned about
crime over the last few weeks as these high-profile crimes have
been happening,'' Repetto said. ``I don't think that they are
necessarily more fearful about crime because it hasn't touched them
like it once did, unless you're a livery-cab driver or part of
another group that's been affected.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems striking is that this localized sense of fear has
apparently not percolated through the city at large.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, experts say, is simply a matter of context.
Crime remains at 30-year lows in New York, and despite the rise in
homicides, violent crime overall was down 7.5 percent during the
first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just that the volume of crime is much lower, they
say. It is also that the kinds of violent crime that were peaking a
decade ago, mostly associated with the crack trade, seemed more
random and thus more threatening. Both periods were marked by high
numbers of livery-cab shootings, but it was other kinds of
shootings back then _ drive-bys, gunfights on street corners and in
playgrounds _ that created the real fear and amplified the effects
of livery shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was more randomness,'' said Jeffrey Fagan, director of
the Center for Violence Research and Prevention at Columbia
University. ``Two kids bump into each other in the subway station
or the street and just shoot each other, and that's a crime that
could affect anyone. Or at least there was a subjectively plausible
possibility that it might affect any citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, while there were about 13 percent more killings in
the city from January through March, the police say that most of
those homicides occurred indoors and involved people who knew one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that the lack of widespread anxiety is a kind
of flip side of the ``broken windows'' theory popularized by James
Q. Wilson, a professor emeritus at the University of California in
Los Angeles, and George Kellingof Rutgers University in a 1982
article in The Atlantic Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   The theory, a big influence on the style of policing that
evolved under Giuliani, holds in part that crime and low-level
civic disorder are closely linked. A fear of crime can sometimes
actually just be anxiety caused by a ``sense that the street is
disorderly, a source of distasteful, worrisome encounters,'' as the
article stated it.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps now, with the police still vigorously pursuing
quality-of-life crimes and low-level criminals, a perception of
greater orderliness has contributed to a more unassailable feeling
of general security and manageability, a feeling that could
withstand even a sizable jump in the crime rate before it eroded.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in some neighborhoods, the crime rate _ or, at least
the fear of crime _ never really eroded at all.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Lawrence spoke of those feelings while washing his
10-year-old Buick sedan on the streets of East New York, Brooklyn.
Lawrence, 47, worked as a cable television installer until 10
months ago when he lost his left eye in a scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledged that crime had dropped in his
neighborhood, he insisted that there were still problems.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the recent crimes in the headlines then? Did they
augur a return to the chaos of the past?
</P>
<P>
   ``Return to what?'' Lawrence asked. ``We ain't never left
nothing behind to return to.''

 &HT;    Seeing is believing for many top athletes who have opted for
laser eye surgery
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At times, the hole looks bigger to Tiger Woods. Laura
Davies no longer squints while asking her caddy, ``Where did that
shot go?'' and actually recognizes who she's waving to in the
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Joyner and Jeff Bagwell don't swing blindly at blurs
anymore. Danny Kanell now can see, and read, a defensive back's
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Buchanan? He's positively eagle-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing like a bird,'' the Atlanta Falcons' cornerback said.
``I can see an ant walking along and what food he's carrying to his
hideout.'' That's a far cry from the not-so-distant Dark Ages, when
football was still a contacts sport for Buchanan. When one of his
contact lenses would slip or pop out and he would squint into the
backfield at the receiver he had to cover and wonder, ``Is that 88
or 89?''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's ol' Two Eyes himself. It's been nearly 11
months since his procedure, but Greg Maddux still finds himself
wide-eyed at the wonder of it all. The wonder of LASIK, the laser
eye surgery that has given Maddux, Woods, Buchanan and a multitude
of other professional athletes a most precious gift. A sight for
poor eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still something I think about almost every day,'' Maddux
said. ``I'm still noticing things, playing little eyesight games
with myself. Reading a license plate. Reading a billboard. Watching
TV.'' Maddux's eyesight is doing even better since getting lasered
in July. Hoping for Mad Dog 20/20 vision, Maddux wound up with
20/15. So did Joyner and Kanell. Buchanan improved to 20/10. They
are just a few of hundreds of athletes _ and several million
Americans _ who have undergone LASIK, an acronym for laser-assisted
in situ keratomileusis and an increasingly popular procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting more and more common among athletes,'' said Dr.
Alan Kozarsky, the Atlanta eye specialist who performed LASIK on
Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   For some, improved eyesight has directly improved performance.
For others, it is the convenience of no longer having to use
contacts; it, too, often yields better results on the playing
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I'm normal, the slopes are bigger, objects are
bigger,'' Woods said. ``The hole is bigger, the ball is bigger,
clubs are bigger.'' He was a long-time contacts wearer who suffered
badly from irritation during allergy season, had LASIK in October
and won his next six events. The world's No. 1 golfer now does
promotional work for TLC Laser Eye Centers, which did his surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubbage,'' was Davies' description of her eyesight. In
February, the English golfer had LASIK on a Thursday afternoon,
awoke the next morning, saw ``everything I couldn't see before''
and shot 67 in the first round of the LPGA Los Angeles Women's
Championship. Davies led the whole tournament and won.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Adkins, the ex-Georgia Tech star, had a contact lens
fold up in his eye 10 minutes before the 400-meter hurdles final in
the 1996 U.S. Olympic Trials. ``So I ran with good vision in one
eye and bad in the other,'' said Adkins, who finished second in the
trials but won the gold in Atlanta. A week after LASIK surgery in
January 1997, Adkins won in the Millrose Games in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it because I was blind,'' said Joyner, the first baseman
who had LASIK in November 1998 while with San Diego. His old
eyesight was ``20/3,000,'' Joyner said jokingly. ``Any improvement
toward 20/20 was an improvement. I went in for a tuneup and they
got me perfect.'' With contacts, Joyner said, ``The wind and
blinking and something getting in your eye affected maybe 50
at-bats. I'd have to take a pitch because of blurring from
blinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell reacted differently. When one of the Houston Astros
slugger's contacts moved and caused his eye to blink or twitch
while at bat, he instinctively swung at the pitch. He, too, felt he
lost 50 at-bats a season before having LASIK in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent athlete who has had LASIK is Hale Irwin, who
earlier this month won the Senior PGA Tour Nationwide Championship
at the Golf Club of Georgia, three months after the procedure.
Another golfer, Jesper Parnevik, had LASIK in April and won the
Byron Nelson Classic two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other golfers who had it are reigning U.S. Women's Open champ
Juli Inkster, Se Ri Pak, Tom Kite, Fred Funk, Steve Elkington and
Bob Tway. Among other athletes are basketball players Patrick Ewing
and Matt Geiger; football's Troy Aikman, Gus Frerotte and Rodney
Peete; and a number of baseball players, including Bernie Williams
and Jose Cruz Jr. MADDUX, THE PERFECT CANDIDATE
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Maddux, the four-time NL Cy Young Award winner
who never wore glasses, or contacts, until coming to Atlanta in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing about LASIK from a golfing buddy who had the
surgery, Maddux researched it and wanted to have the procedure in
spring training of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe for a second that it was going to make me any
better, or worse, a pitcher,'' Maddux said. ``I did it for selfish
reasons.'' He hoped to ``see the signs from the catcher clearly,''
but he also wanted to dispose of his contacts for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really needed to rub your eyes (when lenses irritated),
and you knew you couldn't,'' Maddux said. When he left a game, he
would remove his contacts first, even before taking off his spikes
and then going to ice his pitching arm.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had told Maddux to wait until after the season to
have LASIK. ``Then, I was pitching bad,'' he said, smiling. ``I had
a very bad May.'' He was 0-3 in six starts and was hit hard in five
of them. ``I got a little shove, a little push that if I wanted, to
go ahead and do it now.'' A little shove from whom? ``The Braves,''
Maddux said, still grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux had 20/40 vision in his left eye, 20/200 in his right. On
the advice of Braves orthopedist Dr. Joe Chandler, he went to be
examined by Kozarsky on July 4. It was hoped that the surgery could
be performed promptly and Maddux would have the All-Star break to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't pick a better candidate than Greg,'' said
Kozarsky, who has performed LASIK for six years and has had the
procedure himself. ``He's right in the range you can easily correct
with LASIK, just two or three diopters _ units _ of
nearsightedness, with some astigmatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox saw Kozarsky that day, too. Older
people _ Cox turned 59 last Sunday _ with bad vision often are poor
LASIK candidates, but Cox said he was approved. ``I chickened
out,'' said the manager, who still wants to have the surgery. No
athlete's career has been damaged, or ended, by complications
caused by LASIK. So far. ``It's a remote possibility,'' Kozarsky
said. He says that LASIK is ``extremely safe,'' but he doesn't
advocate using athletes to do paid endorsements for LASIK.
</P>
<P>
   For most athletes _ indeed, for most any patients _ there still
are varying degrees of trepidation. ``I was a little concerned,''
said Buchanan, who underwent the procedure in March 1999.
``Whenever you're messing with your eyes and facing the possibility
of going blind with a mistake, and with my income, what I'm making
now, it was a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan forged ahead. Where once the football moved on him in
flight _ ``Everything used to shake a lot. I couldn't focus.'' _ he
now can see the stripes on the ball as it approaches. He made one
interception last year ``that was so quick, I couldn't believe
it,'' he said. ``I jumped in front of the tight end and boom! the
ball was right there for me. Before, I'd have dropped it, or batted
it away. If I drop a ball now, it's because I got bad hands, not
because of my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kanell, the Falcons' backup quarterback, LASIK meant no
longer staring at the sideline with a contact dislodged.
``Sometimes, I couldn't even get the (hand) signals from a coach on
the sideline,'' said Kanell, who researched LASIK on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   When Maddux had the procedure performed, on July 9, teammate
John Smoltz drove him to the Emory Vision Correction Center.
Kozarsky took eye measurements and then put numbing eyedrops in
Maddux's eyes before using the laser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing he didn't tell me was it was going to smell,''
Maddux said. ``When the laser started, I said, `Is that my eye
burning?' He said, `Yeah.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At first, it was ``hard to see,'' Maddux said. ``I couldn't
focus.'' Smoltz drove him home. Maddux turned on the TV to the
Braves-Red Sox game. ``I could tell Bruce (Chen) was pitching,'' he
said. He watched an inning or two, then fell asleep. When he awoke
in the seventh inning, he said, ``I could read everything on the
TV. I said, `Oh, cool, it's working.' ''
</P>
<P>
   During a followup visit to Kozarsky the next morning, Maddux,
who intentionally walked into a wall, asked, ``Alan, when can I
pitch again? Bobby says I can pitch tomorrow, if I want.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux wanted to, even if he and Kozarsky had agreed that he
would take the All-Star break off and pitch the Thursday after.
``There was no medical background for this, if Greg Maddux could
pitch within 48 hours,'' Kozarsky said. ``We're used to letting
people play golf, but pitching major league baseball? There's no
way that's been done in the history of the world. I figured, well,
he's a smart guy. What the hell?''
</P>
<P>
   So Cox juggled the rotation and Maddux went out Sunday, worked
eight innings and allowed Boston one run on six hits. It was the
first of nine victories in his next 10 decisions, and he finished
with a 19-9 record after a 4-3 start.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even now, Maddux doesn't think LASIK has directly affected
his performance. ``It doesn't have any effect on how I throw a
baseball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who had 20/400 vision before LASIK surgery in February,
is 20/15 now. ``My far vision out there (on the course) is
excellent,'' said Irwin, whose astigmatism is gone in one eye and
nearly gone in the other. ``I thought if LASIK brought things into
a little better kilter, it'd help my golf game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I haven't seen any difference in my golf. It hasn't made
my golf better,'' Irwin said. He marvels at the laser technology
but wonders, ``Would I do it again? I don't know. I don't miss
contacts at all. But I'm nearly 55. I think I'd learn to live with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BEST GIFT
</P>
<P>
   One superstar who has resisted the LASIK urge: Mark McGwire,
whose eyesight is about 20/600 without the special contacts that
let him see 20/10. McGwire might have LASIK after retiring, but not
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a successful professional athlete who's doing well
wearing contact lenses with no problems at all, an eye doctor
shouldn't go out of their way to convince him to have eye
surgery,'' Kozarsky said. ``When you consider the risk-benefit
situation, if you can hit 70 home runs with your contacts, you
don't mess with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of other athletes, however, have turned to LASIK.
Nearly all are pleased. More will follow and see the light of the
laser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you'll appreciate as much as any car you drive,
any home you own, any round of golf you'll ever shoot,'' Maddux
said. ``It's something you appreciate whenever you're awake. It's
the best thing I ever bought myself.''

 A TROUBLED TRAIL, BEHIND THE SUCCESS OF TOUR BUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS and JUAN FORERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It seemed an almost comic gamble, bringing red
double-decker buses from Britain and setting them loose on New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the man behind the idea, Harry Grant, a New Jersey
developer, in bankruptcy proceedings, but New York in 1991 was
saddled with a staggering crime rate and a sour economy. Times
Square, where the buses were to pick up passengers, was a haven for
vagrants and sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   Grant's leap across the Hudson River turned serendipitous. Crime
rates fell. The economic downturn reversed itself. Times Square was
transformed from grit to gaudy commercialism. As more tourists came
to the city, the company, New York Apple Tours, prospered, growing
from two used buses to an operation with $10 million in annual
income.
</P>
<P>
   But as tourists flocked to the used British buses, so did city,
state and federal regulators. The company amassed hundreds of
thousands of dollars in fines for falsifying records and
sidestepping inspectors, and drew the ire of neighborhood groups
and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how intense the scrutiny, though, the company
survived, even thrived, until last Monday, when a bus operated by a
driver who police said did not have a proper license turned onto a
crosswalk at West 45th Street and fatally struck Randolph Walker,
71.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, Apple Tours was in the fight of its life in an
administrative hearing at the City Department of Consumer Affairs,
facing a city effort to immediately suspend its license. Susan
Kassapian, a department lawyer, contended that the company had shed
even the veneer of decency and accumulated a list of civil and
criminal violations that was remarkable for its scope and scale.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials have strenuously objected to the hearing,
calling it a naked violation of due process. ``What they're doing
to us here is completely unacceptable,'' said Hayim Grant, company
president and Harry Grant's son.
</P>
<P>
   But hearing the city's case, critics were left to wonder how a
company of that description could have survived for so many years
in the law-and-order climate established by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a company flagrantly violate the law on this
scale,'' said John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation
Alternatives, a watchdog group. ``How much evidence do they need?''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and business associates offer a two-word answer as one
possible explanation for the bus company's resilience: Hurricane
Harry, the nickname given to the company's patriarch and organizing
force.
</P>
<P>
   They say Apple Tours is a company made in Grant's image, and
that Hurricane Harry is a man undeterred by adversity, even
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who immigrated to the United States from Israel with his
wife and three children in 1975, penetrated New Jersey's
construction industry and was a quick success, so quick that after
building houses in Bergen County, he began proposing projects of an
enormous scale.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Grant said he would build the tallest building in the
world, a 121-story office tower in Newark, N.J. He never did. He
proposed digging a tunnel from Bergen County to the Bronx. It never
happened. He said he would open the Newark Renaissance Mall. All
that remains of that venture is an uncompleted shell.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, a bank started foreclosure proceedings on two of
Grant's properties, saying his companies had defaulted on loans in
excess of $17.5 million. The federal Environmental Protection
Agency was pursuing another of his companies for 119 violations of
the Clean Air Act stemming from the illegal demolition of
asbestos-laden buildings in Hoboken, N.J. The case eventually
resulted in a $60,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, under pressure from banks and regulators, Grant
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for at least four of the
companies under his control. But he insisted he was not done. In
bankruptcy court, he promised he would recover within three years.
</P>
<P>
   His resurrection came through Apple Tours.
</P>
<P>
   Walter F. Timpone, one of his lawyers, said the idea for the
company came to Grant when he saw double-deckers on a trip to
London.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1991, New York Apple Tours was incorporated. Grant
built the company in his vision of salting the city with stops,
giving riders the chance to hop off one bus and, whenever they
wished, board another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This opened it up to tourists and let people see places around
their city at their leisure,'' Timpone said. ``It was, and is,
fantastically successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and business associates say that if Harry Grant was
stung by his long run of setbacks in New Jersey, he did not show
it. He was driven, they say, and resourceful. No job was beneath
him. He turned wrenches in the motor yard. At times he flew to
London and returned with luggage crammed with spare parts.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Gelber, who was with the company in 1993 and is now manager
of tour services for a rival, Gray Line, recalled Grant's work
ethic. ``Harry would do everything,'' he said. ``He'd be up to his
elbows in grease.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Grant's leadership, the business flourished, growing from
a fleet of two double-deckers to 63 today, according to state
records and the company's office. Mike Alvich, vice president of
marketing and development, said that as the company grew, it
provided a public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've helped the city in a number of ways,'' he said.
``Tourism is a big part of the New York City economy, and we think
that we've contributed to the growth of that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But as the company grew, it attracted doubters, then enemies,
who said its problems were pervasive, affecting all aspects of the
business, from environmental compliance and public safety to
record-keeping and customer service. Gelber, for instance, said
that from its earliest days, Apple Tours regularly sent out buses
staffed by unqualified guides. ``Even for part of the high season,
I was the only one there who had a license,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Tours also angered residents and community leaders, many
of whom said it illegally took empty buses down residential
streets, made curb-side stops in unauthorized places, idled buses
under apartment houses, irritated residents with diesel smoke and
routinely double-parked, clogging byways already inundated with
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, residents from West 22nd Street protested after
discovering that the company was using a rented parking area as a
repair yard without proper permits. Under pressure from the city,
the company moved its repair operations to Long Island City,
Queens. Tom Kirkland, who lives on West 22nd, said that neighbors
concluded that Grant and Apple Tours deliberately played outside
the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't do anything by the book,'' he said. ``The idea was
to do it his way.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1995, the Department of Consumer Affairs accused the
company of switching licenses on 43 occasions, apparently in an
effort to use buses that had not passed state safety inspections or
might not be insured. The entire fleet was temporarily taken off
the streets. A settlement agreement required that the company pay a
$100,000 fine and, among other things, remove Harry Grant as an
officer in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and lawyers say that although Harry Grant may have
severed his formal ties with the company, he has remained a
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very much involved,'' said Frank Lucianna, one of Grant's
lawyers and friends. ``He's the guiding light.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Grant, who lives in Alpine, N.J., did not return three
phone calls last week. And in an interview Friday, Hayim Grant
declined to comment on his father's role in the company, except to
say that the company had grown more responsible since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our record is very good,'' he said. ``The company has really
developed into a mature, professionally run, deep-management
company. It's not a fly-by-night operator.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever that role, Harry Grant's troubles, and the company's,
did not stop after his removal as vice president. During the late
1990s, new problems mounted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, an inspection team audited the company's compliance
with a state law that mandates driver fitness and training and
found more than 200 discrepancies, according to testimony on
Thursday from Thomas Fullington, an assistant director of the State
Department of Motor Vehicles. Apple Tours was fined $6,500,
Fullington said.
</P>
<P>
   Fullington also said the department was investigating Apple
Tours again. According to his testimony, its initial review found
similar problems, including an absence of documentation for driver
training and medical exams.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1998, Harry Grant was indicted on charges of
first-degree sexual abuse, accused of attacking a female employee
at the company's bus yard in Queens. He pleaded guilty to
third-degree assault and was sentenced to counseling and one year
of probation, a law enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
   And in December of that year, a group of employees filed a
class-action lawsuit against the company, claiming it had failed to
pay overtime to as many as 700 workers from 1992 to 1998. The suit
is in settlement negotiations, said Adam T. Klein, a lawyer for the
employees.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, inspectors from the State Department of
Transportation began noting that the company's fleet had safety
problems. In a series of inspections in 1998 and 1999, Apple Tours
buses failed 42.5 percent of the time, according to state data. The
state sets an inspection failure goal of less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The state's data also show that the company's most frequent
violations were in the most serious category, including deficient
brake systems, steering or suspension components and emergency
exits. Subsequent inspections have found that the company's
inspection failure rate is improving, to 24.5 percent, but that is
still 2.5 times the state's compliance goal.
</P>
<P>
   Hayim Grant said the failures did not affect safety or the
accident last Monday. ``There's no bus that's on the road operated
by us that has not passed New York State Department of
Transportation standards,'' he said. ``Our safety record is
excellent. This is the first serious injury that we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judy Shotwell, vice president of the Midtown North Precinct
Council, a neighborhood organization that works with the Police
Department, said that for a long time, she and others also thought
that it would take a pedestrian fatality to force the city into the
current fight. ``We all knew it,'' she said. ``It was going to take
a catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was a federal case that set in motion the city's
efforts to close the company. Last week's fatality merely
accelerated the action.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Apple Tours pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in
New Jersey to falsifying documents submitted to three federal
agencies _ the Customs Service, the Department of Transportation
and the Environmental Protection Agency _ to avoid meeting federal
safety and environmental standards on 70 buses it imported from
1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   By admitting to a sustained deception, city officials said,
Apple Tours gave the Department of Consumer Affairs the evidence it
needed to try to revoke the company's licenses. ``They were
convicted of a crime of essentially dishonesty,'' Giuliani said,
adding that the evidence allowed ``the extraordinary step of trying
to remove their license for reasons that would usually be
considered beyond the Department of Consumer Affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   With the death last week, the city filed an emergency motion
asking Administrative Law Judge Judith Gould to suspend the
company's license immediately, pending the outcome of the case. And
as Gould was beginning her hearings, the company faced another
action.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the board of NYC &AMP; Co., the city's tourism agency,
voted unanimously to terminate the membership of New York Apple
Tours. Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas, the agency's president, said the
board had acted with knowledge of the pattern of problems, but had
based its vote primarily on letters from disgruntled tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complaints against this company exceed those against any
of our other members,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the licensing fight still undecided, Hayim Grant remained
resolute as the hearing ended on Friday. The tourists were pouring
into the city for Memorial Day weekend. And though Hayim Grant said
the police were cracking down on their buses, the company that
Hurricane Harry founded was still in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking to hurt this city,'' Hayim Grant said. ``We
love this city. We show it to thousands of people.''

F.G. WANGEMAN, 88, INNOVATOR IN HOTEL INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa., Wash., Nev., Germany, Puerto Rico)  By ERIC V. COPAGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Wangeman, one of the first hotel managers to integrate
modern business management techniques with Old World attention to
guests and a mentor to a generation of hotel managers, died Monday
at his home in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   In his 39 years with the Hilton Hotels Corp., Wangeman helped to
create what was the world's largest hotel chain from the mid-1950s
through the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Clark, a professor at the Cornell School of Hotel
Administration, said Wangeman's influence was far-reaching. If you
were in the hotel industry, he said, ``Somewhere along the way
you'd know someone who has worked under him or trained under him,
and he had made an impact on their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank George Wangeman was born on April 20, 1912, in Frankfurt.
His father, Franz, was the manager of Frankfurter Hof, one of the
top hotels in Europe at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Wangeman graduated from the Lausanne hotel school in
Switzerland, and worked at top hotels in Paris and London before
moving to New York in 1932 to become assistant manager at the
Waldorf-Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, his attention to detail caught the eye of a frequent
guest, Conrad Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank noticed that Hilton had been assigned a room, rather
than a suite,'' said Wangeman's wife, Marie. ``He saw the mistake
and corrected it, and Hilton said, `I need a young man like you,
who watches for mistakes.'''
</P>
<P>
   After five years of managing various Hilton hotels, Wangeman was
sent to open the Caribe Hilton in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, there was no service industry on the island, so
Wangeman devised tests to decide who had aptitude for certain jobs.
The test for dishwashers, for instance, consisted of moving pegs on
a pegboard on a table. The applicant who moved the pegs fastest and
with the most dexterity got the job.
</P>
<P>
   To forestall workers' resentment over being assigned work that
might be considered demeaning, Wangeman enlisted Conrad Hilton's
brother, Carl, to empty trash at the hotel for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Wangeman participated in the Advanced Management Program at
Harvard University, and in 1960 took over the reins of the
Waldorf-Astoria, which had been purchased by the Hilton
organization in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family lived in an apartment on the 41st floor for 22
years, and he played host to celebrities like Frank Sinatra, Dwight
D. Eisenhower and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife of 54 years, the former Marie Moyle, he
is survived by two sons, Henry, of Oaxaca, Mexico, and Conrad, of
Pittsburgh; two daughters, Alberta Lamson of Seattle, and Marie
Sheppard of Las Vegas; and nine grandchildren.

ASPIRIN, CHAI AND SYMPATHY AT CABBY CENTRAL
</HEADLINE>
  By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mosharaf Sarder was bleeding money as he stepped out
of the bathroom and looked around for his fish sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should charge you one dollar for every minute,'' he said to
Maqsood Ahmad, who was standing behind the counter of Lahore Deli.
Ahmad pulled the sandwich out of a microwave and shoved it toward
Sarder.
</P>
<P>
   The cabby from Bangladesh ripped into his dinner. Every minute
spent in the deli was a minute he could have been getting a fare.
For him, time was measured in the shifting display of red digits on
his meter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are out there in Brooklyn, in Queens, in the Bronx,''
he said. It was Saturday night, usually a good time for picking up
riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you do tonight?'' asked a cabby who was sipping chai
on a vinyl bar stool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started at 8 o'clock,'' Sarder said. ``One fare Queens, one
fare Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're comparing what's in their pockets,'' Ahmad, the
deli owner, said to a visitor who was watching the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad has listened in on hundreds of conversations like this.
The cabbies have been stopping in since 1995, when he opened the
24-hour deli. They come for the samosas and the dhal, the basmati
rice and the cool lhassi drinks. The meat is halal, and nothing
costs more than $3. Not even the hundreds of cassettes of Hindi and
Urdu pop music stacked against a wall, or the videotapes of dance
numbers from those epic-length, Bombay-produced movies called
Bollywood musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Above the door hangs a hand-painted wooden sign with the deli's
name scrawled in red Roman letters and flowing Urdu script. At any
time of day, a couple of yellow cabs wait outside on Crosby Street
in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between lofts and boutiques, the tiny shop stands
across from the Gaseteria at Houston and Broadway, where cabbies
hand off their cars during shift changes. Culinary connoisseurs
would never mistake its cuisine for that of the Savoy or Balthazar,
both down the block. But this is a place that the drivers can call
their own, a four-stool joint where a Bollywood video always plays
and packets of aspirin are sold at the counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have headaches,'' Ahmad said. ``They use a lot of
painkillers.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sells rolls of meter paper, batteries for cell phones
and pagers, and paper towels for wiping windshields _ one-stop
shopping for cabbies. Some drivers post signs looking for day- or
night-shift partners. Others buy lentils to cook at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to keep them happy,'' the deli owner said. ``Give them
a smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad knows that smiles are rare in the taxi business. He worked
as a cabby on and off for three years before opening the deli.
Driving was tough, but it was better money than the odd jobs he
held after moving to New York in 1990 from Lahore, Pakistan:
security guard, textile factory worker, newsstand salesman. Then in
1995, his wife joined him in New York and told him that if he
opened a deli, she would do the cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``She makes home-style food,'' Ahmad said. ``Not like restaurant
food.''
</P>
<P>
   More home cooking is on the way. Ahmad's parents are moving to
the United States before the end of this month, and his mother
insists on helping out.
</P>
<P>
   For Ahmad, running the deli beats driving a cab. In the taxi
business, for every 10 good customers, there was one bad one, he
said. Like the man who once told him to run a stop sign because he
was in a rush. Ahmad did so, only to get slammed by another car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the good drivers survive,'' he said. ``There's a lot of
tension because they have to pay their lease, and a lot of stress
from their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   A driver who had just walked out of the bathroom, his hands
dripping water, heard Ahmad telling this to a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they are outside the cab, they are polite,'' the driver,
Zafar Ali, said. ``When they get in, they think they are the
boss.''
</P>
<P>
   That was on top of the other headaches, he said. No parking
spaces on the street. Fifty-five dollar fines for double parking.
No public bathrooms. Ali pointed over his shoulder, where there was
a line six deep just to get into the deli bathroom. It had been
like that all night.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the recent spate of cabdriver murders. Ten men
had already been killed this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about 10 to 15 percent of the drivers have quit their
jobs because of the dangerous situation in this city,'' Ahmad said
as he threw chick peas into a blender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say it is 25 percent,'' said an Indian driver known as
Clinton. ``A lot of my friends have gone to limousines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, maybe 25 percent,'' Ahmad said. ``That sounds right.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton nodded. He shoveled another spoonful of rice and dhal
into his mouth. No one here knows his real name. Everyone calls him
Clinton because he once had a girlfriend named Monica.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly catchy Bollywood tune called ``Kuch Kuch Hota
Hai'' began playing on the television. It had been the most popular
song last summer on the Indian subcontinent, heard from Karachi to
Katmandu. Sarder finished the last bite of his fish sandwich and
stared at the beautiful dancing actors, his thoughts seemingly lost
amid the heat and dust of another land.
</P>
<P>
   Then he hopped off the stool and walked out into the
rain-slicked streets of a night that was already half over, a
packet of aspirin in his hand.

THE AD CAMPAIGN: SOME TIMELY HELP FROM FRIENDS OF FLORIO 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This 30-second commercial, titled ``Wall Street,'' was released
by the Camden County Democratic Committee, which has endorsed
former Gov. Jim Florio in his bid for the Democratic Senate
nomination in New Jersey against Jon Corzine. It is a classic
``soft money'' ad, in that it does not explicitly advocate voting
for or against anyone. The commercial began running on Wednesday on
television stations in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER
</P>
<P>
   Murphy Putnam Media.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN
</P>
<P>
   New York's financial district _ introduced with the caption
``Greed is good'' _ is made to look as sinister and intimidating as
possible. Photographed looking up from street level, through a blue
filter, the New York Stock Exchange and other imposing Wall Street
buildings roll by. An unflattering photo of a squinting Corzine
takes up one corner of the frame, as printed warnings sidle across
the screen: ``$250 Million Penalty for Raiding Pension Funds.''
``Supports Republican Plan to Privatize Social Security.'' ``Good
for Goldman Sachs, Bad for Seniors.'' The commercial ends with the
admonition to ``Tell Jon Corzine to Leave Our Retirement Funds
Alone,'' along with the phone number of Corzine's campaign
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT
</P>
<P>
   Narrator: ``Wall Street. A place where some say greed is good. A
place Jon Corzine feels right at home. When he was chairman of
Goldman Sachs, the firm paid a $250 million penalty for raiding
employee pension funds. Now, Jon Corzine supports the Republican
plan to privatize Social Security. Good for Goldman Sachs. Bad for
seniors. Raiding pensions and privatizing Social Security. Tell Jon
Corzine to leave our retirement funds alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY
</P>
<P>
   As Florio has done less artfully in his own ads, this commercial
flatly misrepresents Corzine's position on Social Security. In
fact, it brazenly cites as a source a Business Week article that
actually makes clear Corzine's opposition to individual investment
accounts, the heart of the Republican plan. Goldman Sachs did pay
$253 million in 1995 to settle charges that it had conspired with
Robert Maxwell, the British publishing magnate, to defraud
pensioners of hundreds of millions of dollars. It is debatable
whether a settlement of a lawsuit, under which Goldman did not
admit wrongdoing, amounts to a ``penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD
</P>
<P>
   Florio's campaign, which began running $900,000 worth of
commercials on Wednesday, is now essentially out of money, and the
former governor's friends in Camden County, his political base,
have done him a tremendous favor by buying $500,000 in television
time to run this commercial. Conveniently, because it does not
explicitly urge voters to back Florio or reject Corzine, the ad can
be paid for with soft money, which has much larger individual
contribution limits. The ad is arguably more effective than any of
Corzine's attack ads and is as polished as his positive ones. It
manages to paint Corzine as a pension robber out to cheat the
elderly, and a New Yorker running for office in New Jersey _ all in
an economical half-minute.

EDWARD L. BERNDS, 94, DIRECTOR OF SHORT FILMS FOR THREE STOOGES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward L. Bernds, one of Hollywood's first sound effects
producers and a director of comedy shorts starring the Three
Stooges, died on May 20 at his home in Van Nuys, Calif. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Bernds began his career as a radio operator in Chicago. He went
to Hollywood in 1928 as a sound mixer for some of the first talking
pictures and worked with such directors as Frank Capra, Leo McCarey
and Howard Hawks. By the late 1930s he was at Columbia Pictures,
writing scripts for the Three Stooges. He soon began directing as
well as writing their films, working steadily with them from 1945
through the mid-60s on ``Monkey Businessmen,'' ``Fright Night,''
``Out West,'' ``The Three Stooges in Orbit'' and other films.
</P>
<P>
   During that time he also directed shorts featuring Hugh Herbert,
Sterling Holloway, Billie Burke and other actors.
</P>
<P>
   He directed his first feature film, ``Blondie's Secret,'' in
1948 and went on to direct four other films in the popular series,
which starred Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake as Blondie and
Dagwood Bumstead. Bernds moved to the Allied Artists studio in the
1950s to direct several films in the Bowery Boys series.
</P>
<P>
   His other directorial credits include ``Quantrill's Raiders,''
``Queen of Outer Space'' and ``Valley of the Dragons.'' He also
directed episodes of several television series, including ``Colt
.45.'' He retired in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Edward Jr., of Van Nuys, Calif., two
grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: A TIME FOR DIALOGUE AT CUNY  

</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, May 28:
</P>
<P>
   The 20-campus City University of New York was in chaos when the
board of trustees hired Matthew Goldstein as the new chancellor
last summer. Political infighting among the trustees had paralyzed
the administration, driven out some of the institution's most
talented minds and further demoralized a faculty that was already
embittered by hiring freezes and disrespect from a few trustees who
put politics ahead of academics.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions between the faculty and the administration seemed
to subside when Goldstein was installed as chancellor. But the
faculty and the administration were at loggerheads again last week
over proposed curriculum changes that the trustees voted for,
including a plan to consider a systemwide core curriculum, in the
style of elite institutions like Columbia and the University of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The board chairman, Herman Badillo, says the faculty will be
consulted on the details of the new curriculum, which he says is
aimed at raising standards across the system. But the faculty union
president, Barbara Bowen, charged the trustees with conspiring to
usurp faculty powers, forcing through a curriculum dictated by
conservative groups like Change New York and the National
Association of Scholars, two organizations that have long sought,
in the faculty's judgment, to commandeer the university. Both sides
will need to proceed rationally _ and in good faith _ to avoid yet
another destructive round of intramural warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The master plan put forward by the trustees has many commendable
aspects. For starters, the plan is aimed at eliminating program
duplications, and augmenting each campus' strength in order to
produce flagship campuses with higher admissions standards, in the
style of the California system. The plan also calls for
strengthening teacher education and for more systematic relations
between CUNY and the public schools that provide most of the
system's students.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees realized that none of this can be accomplished
unless CUNY rebuilds its faculty, which is far too dependent on
poorly paid part-timers, who dash from one part-time job to
another, leaving little time for student counseling or for other
activities that sustain a vibrant university. The trustees want at
least 70 percent of the four-year college faculty to be full-time
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The faculty applauds the rebuilding effort but fears that
conservatives outside the university will have undue influence over
the shape of the proposed core curriculum, making for a narrower
selection of course offerings at CUNY. Goldstein and the trustees
dispute this emphatically, saying that the entire program is up for
discussion. It is incumbent upon both sides to work this through.
The last thing CUNY needs is more of the intramural warfare that
ravaged the system for much of the last decade.

POLICE SAY SUSPECT'S PISTOL WAS USED IN WENDY'S CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Story is Page One in city editions; will be updated with
arraignments.) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police ballistics tests confirmed Saturday that a
handgun found in the possession of one of two suspects now in
custody was used to kill five Wendy's restaurant workers and wound
two others who had been bound, gagged and shot execution-style in a
gruesome robbery-massacre in Queens last week.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the ballistics tests added another piece of
evidence to the case against the suspects, John B. Taylor, 36, and
Craig Godineaux, 30, who were arrested on Friday less than 48 hours
after the shootings at the fast-food outlet on Main Street in
Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   The gun, a .380-caliber semiautomatic, was found in a belt pack
on Taylor when he was arrested at his sister-in-law's home in
Brentwood, on Long Island. A senior law enforcement official said
it appeared that only one gun was used to shoot all the victims in
a walk-in basement refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   While the two suspects, in videotaped statements to
investigators, accused each other of being the gunman, the senior
law enforcement official noted that accomplices in a murder are, in
most cases, equally guilty in the eyes of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Taylor has worked at, and robbed, a series of
fast-food restaurants in recent years, including the Wendy's where
last week's massacre took place, while Godineaux, they said, has
served three prison terms for robbery and drug offenses in the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   The two were to be arraigned in Queens late Saturday on charges
of armed robbery and first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   If the suspects are convicted of those charges, they would
potentially face the death penalty or life in prison, prosecutors
said. The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, has 120 days
to decide whether to seek the death penalty. The decision would be
based on factors like the nature of the crime, the defendants'
criminal records, their state of mind at the time and the wishes of
the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, in their videotaped statements to investigators,
gave almost identical accounts, except for accusing the other of
being the gunman, one senior law enforcement official said. Still,
the suspects implicated themselves as they described planning the
robbery in advance and giving step-by-step details on how the
robbery and shootings were carried out, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, in his statement, told investigators that Godineaux had
been adamant about shooting the victims. ``No witnesses! No
witnesses!'' he quoted Godineaux as saying, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators, while emphasizing that they did not know who
fired the shots, were leaning toward Taylor as the more likely
shooter. It was his gun, and it was found in his possession, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Godineaux, in his statement, suggested that, besides robbery,
Taylor had another motive, the official said. Taylor had worked at
the Wendy's in Flushing last fall, but had been dismissed by the
manager, Jean Dumel Auguste, for stealing receipts, police said.
Auguste was one of the five slain workers.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the statements described how Godineaux bound
most of the victims with duct tape, how plastic bags were placed
over their heads, apparently to catch the blood as each was shot,
and how, when it was all over, the two men walked out and took a
bus to an apartment, where they split $2,400 in cash taken from the
Wendy's basement office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are saying, `I got nothing,' or `I only got a little,'''
the senior law enforcement official said. ``Both are attempting to
minimize their part in the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ballistics tests and the videotaped
statements the suspects made to investigators, the senior law
enforcement official said that a key item of evidence would be a
videotape taken from a surveillance camera in the Wendy's dining
area on the night of the killings. It was found at the house where
Taylor was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape does not show the carnage in the basement, but
both suspects appeared on it in the dining area, proving they were
there, the official said. ``I understand they are both visible in
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An unspecified amount of cash _ believed to be taken from
Wendy's _ also was found in the Brentwood house, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's palm print also found on a box in the basement where
the shootings took place, the official said. He added that
investigators hoped to recover more finger and palm prints from the
duct tape used to bind and gag the victims, and from plastic bags
that had been placed over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the tape and the plastic bags were to be tested for
moisture, like sweat, that might be linked through DNA testing to
the suspects, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, a woman waiting at a bus stop, identified Taylor as
one of two men who emerged from Wendy's about the time of the
shootings, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, 22, who was shot through the cheeks and left for dead,
managed to free himself from his bonds and call 911 on a phone to a
fax machine. The police said he did not identify either suspect
from photos.
</P>
<P>
   The other survivor of the massacre, Jaquione Johnson, 18, who
had a bullet wound to the head, remained in critical condition
Saturday at the New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Funerals were being planned by the families of the dead _ Anita
C. Smith, 22, of South Jamaica; Ramon Nazario, 44, of Flushing;
Jeremy Mele, 18, of Neptune, N.J.; Ali Ibadat, 40, of Ridgewood,
Queens; and Auguste, 27, the night manager, who lived in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials attributed the swift arrests and the
strength of the case against the defendants to a combination of
circumstances _ a tip, a bit of luck, and legwork by more than 100
detectives on the job around the clock.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The investigators said the two entered the restaurant last
Wednesday shortly before the 11 p.m. closing time _ not at closing
time, as previously reported _ and sat in the dining area for a
time. At least one ordered food. Taylor then asked for Auguste, and
was directed to the basement office. He went down while Godineaux
waited in the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after closing time, Auguste, using an intercom, called
the six members of his staff to the basement. They went down,
followed by Godineaux, and were confronted by Taylor, who had a
gun. Godineaux then bound most of the victims, who were herded into
the refrigerator, made to lie on the floor and methodically shot.

A COMMENCEMENT FOR A CLASSMATE BELOVED BY MANY
</HEADLINE>
 
 (With GRAD) By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Instead of caps and gowns, the graduates wore
basketball and soccer jerseys. Instead of ``Pomp and
Circumstance,'' the crowd swayed to ``Stand by Me.'' And instead of
conferring 1,000 degrees, Brown University presented only one on
Thursday, to Casey Shearer, a beloved member of the senior class
who died less than a week before he was to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Shearer, 21, suffered a sudden shutdown of his heart, brought on
by an undetected viral infection, after a basketball game with
friends on May 19, his family said. He never regained consciousness
and died four days later.
</P>
<P>
   His classmates, determined that Shearer should still graduate
with fanfare, organized this commencement four days before their
own, which is Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There were as many laughs as tears at the gathering, as friends
and family praised Shearer's quick smile, poked fun at his penchant
for giving everyone a nickname (his was ``Case,'' or ``Case Dog''),
and maligned his mediocre jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his magna cum laude degree in economics, Shearer was
remembered foremost as a sports lover who covered games for Brown
Student Radio and wrote a sports column for ``The College Hill
Independent,'' a weekly college newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Derek N. Shearer, a longtime friend and economic
adviser to President Clinton, said he was amazed by the 80 friends
who kept vigil at the hospital while his son was in a coma. He said
the service typified all the things his son loved about Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chose Brown because it was his sense that this was the most
friendly and diverse mix of kids,'' said Shearer, a fellow at the
Woodrow Wilson International Scholars Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Shearer's network of friends stretched from Providence to
southern California, where he grew up, to Finland, where he
attended high school while his father was ambassador. Through his
father, he made friends in the White House, as evidenced by
Clinton's attendance at the service.
</P>
<P>
   The president, his arm around the first lady, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, recounted how Shearer had tried to tutor him in rap music
before an appearance on ``The Arsenio Hall Show'' in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But politics was not in his game plan. Nearing graduation, he
had already mailed out tapes of his broadcasts of Brown games, in
hopes of landing a broadcasting job.
</P>
<P>
   Politics did not seem to matter much to his friends, either, who
remembered him more for his ability to memorize the statistics of
every Brown athlete and his inability to eat his usual morning bowl
of Cheerios without dribbling milk down his chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of you who belong with Casey to the Class of 2000 will
know that he marches by your side on Monday,'' said Sheila E.
Blumstein, the interim president of Brown. ``You will hear his
laugh and see his smile.''

   MARJAYOUN, SOUTH LEBANON _ The bearded Hezbollah guerrilla puts
down his load of stolen Israeli grenades and turns to admire the
view. ``See how they go?'' the guerrilla asks, waving towards the
fleeing Israeli soldiers who have occupied southern Lebanon for 22
years. ``They leave everything and go like dogs.'' Despite the
denials of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, his army certainly
seemed this week to leave Lebanon with its tail between its legs. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Ehud Barak's election promise to end Israel's
22-year occupation of a slice of southern Lebanon was brave as well
as popular. Israel's dark military adventure into Lebanon was never
its proudest hour. This week's dramatic events, which turned an
orderly withdrawal into a disorderly rout, should not detract from
the wisdom of the decision to get out. Still, the chaos adds
markedly to the tribulations of Barak as he battles to make peace
with his Arab neighbors. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ After threats of war, the dangers of peace... When
Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian, took office on May 20, it
marked the first democratic transfer of power in 5,000 years of
Chinese history. Taiwan, he proclaimed, has stood up. Yet the event
provoked no new crisis in China, which still insists that there is
but one China, that Taiwan is part of it, and that the government
in Beijing is in charge. It has long threatened to invade if Taiwan
declares independence. As ever with Taiwan and China, however, it
is hard to tell which is the phonier: Beijing's threat of war, or
this week's hope for peace. &QL;

eager to become the next Cisco or Amazon believe _ and it why
American investors are putting more cash than ever into
venture-capital funds. Yes, venture capital deserves some credit
for transforming America's economy from the industrial dinosaur of
the 1980s into today's high-growth, high-tech animal. But as the
venture-capital industry grows bigger and more global, more may not
always prove merrier. &QL;

you would think that the result of the May 21 referendum, in which
67 percent of the voters approved a deal to open Switzerland up to
the European Union, was nothing less than an end to Swiss
isolationism. That would be overstating its significance, yet the
surprising strength of the pro-European vote does suggest that
something is stirring in this stubbornly independent-minded
nation. &QL;

Clinton's opponent for the U.S. Senate. Some New York Republicans
are distraught by the withdrawal of the bare-knuckle-fighting
Giuliani. But they need not be so downcast; Lazio may have a better
chance of slaying the demon than Giuliani. For a start, Lazio will
pick up a ton of votes for the simple reason that he is not

   AUSTIN _ The Rio Grande forms an 800-mile border between the
United States and Mexico. Under a treaty of 1944, Mexico is meant
to give Texas access to at least 350,000 acre-feet of water each
year from the river and its tributaries. Now Mexico has fallen so
far behind in its promised deliveries that it owes the United
States more than 1 million acre-feet. The situation has left
thirsty Texas farmers high and dry _ and angry. &QL;

to disbar President Clinton from practicing law in Arkansas. So
much for ``favorite son.'' &QL;

   AUSTIN AND LOS ANGELES _ Ricky Martin's hips and Jennifer
Lopez's bum have done more to raise temperatures around America
this past year than global warming. Popular culture embraces all
things Latino, from callipygian pop stars to taco-touting
chihauhuas. Given that, it was inevitable that Latinos would become
a politically powerful group. Whether they are an interest group is
another matter, and depends on where you sit. The two main
political parties certainly believe they are a block to be wooed
and won; Latinos themselves are less sure about it. &QL;

whose anger over the country's isolation and poverty is reaching
the point of no return. Bernard Kouchner, the Frenchman who runs
Kosovo for the United Nations, this week described the Milosevic
regime in Belgrade as a ``fascist island in the Balkans, counting

   ALMATY _ Listen to the talk of huge oil discoveries off the
coast of Kazakhstan, and you might think that this impoverished
country is about to turn into a Saudi Arabia. Perhaps it will, but
it is too early to be sure. Oil has been found beneath parts of the
sea controlled by Russia and Azerbaijan, so it is not so
unreasonable to expect a big field on the other side in Kazakhstan.
If true, it would be the biggest oil find anywhere in the world for
20 years. A real gusher there would have an enormous effect on the
pipeline politics that have bedevilled the region.

arrest. But when the rain falls noisily a few brave ones dare to
speak up: ``It is very bad here, very bad. Yes, we have rice every
day, but we have no jobs. the government is very bad.'' Such talk,
however muted, is particularly risky at the moment: like the
country's innumerable pagoda bells, the junta's nerves are

   NEW YORK _ Anybody surprised by the hostile reaction to the bid
on May 24 by UAL, operator of United Airlines, for US Airways must
not fly much. In the two decades since the American industry was
deregulated, it has seen wild expansion, with more than 100 new
carriers launched in the 1980s, followed by equally manic
consolidation, with more than 100 failures and takeovers in the
1990s. Even if the deal can be done, there is good reason to
question whether it should be. Whatever the outcome, the benefit to
consumers may come from the antitrust scrutiny that such a deal
will inevitably bring. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ As the trade imbalance between the two blocks
widens, the most serious trade war of all time is surely looming.
American and Japan? No, their trade gap is modest compared with
this. According to official statistics, the whole world is now
running a massive current-account deficit. It appears that we are
importing much more from Mars than we export to it. Could it be
that the Martians have been dumping cheap exports in world markets?
Come to think of it, some of those ``green'' protesters in Seattle
last year did seem rather other-worldly. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Ehud Barak's election promise to end Israel's
22-year occupation of a slice of southern Lebanon was brave as well
as popular. Israel's dark military adventure into Lebanon was never
its proudest hour. This week's dramatic events, which turned an
orderly withdrawal into a disorderly rout, should not detract from
the wisdom of the decision to get out. Still, the chaos adds
markedly to the tribulations of Barak as he battles to make peace
with his Arab neighbors. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ After threats of war, the dangers of peace... When
Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian, took office on May 20, it
marked the first democratic transfer of power in 5,000 years of
Chinese history. Taiwan, he proclaimed, has stood up. Yet the event
provoked no new crisis in China, which still insists that there is
but one China, that Taiwan is part of it, and that the government
in Beijing is in charge. It has long threatened to invade if Taiwan
declares independence. As ever with Taiwan and China, however, it
is hard to tell which is the phonier: Beijing's threat of war, or
this week's hope for peace. &QL;

eager to become the next Cisco or Amazon believe _ and it why
American investors are putting more cash than ever into
venture-capital funds. Yes, venture capital deserves some credit
for transforming America's economy from the industrial dinosaur of
the 1980s into today's high-growth, high-tech animal. But as the
venture-capital industry grows bigger and more global, more may not
always prove merrier. &QL;

you would think that the result of the May 21 referendum, in which
67 percent of the voters approved a deal to open Switzerland up to
the European Union, was nothing less than an end to Swiss
isolationism. That would be overstating its significance, yet the
surprising strength of the pro-European vote does suggest that
something is stirring in this stubbornly independent-minded

to give Texas access to at least 350,000 acre-feet of water each
year from the river and its tributaries. Now Mexico has fallen so
far behind in its promised deliveries that it owes the United
States more than 1 million acre-feet. The situation has left

   ALMATY _ Listen to the talk of huge oil discoveries off the
coast of Kazakhstan, and you might think that this impoverished
country is about to turn into a Saudi Arabia. Perhaps it will, but
it is too early to be sure. Oil has been found beneath parts of the
sea controlled by Russia and Azerbaijan, so it is not so
unreasonable to expect a big field on the other side in Kazakhstan.
If true, it would be the biggest oil find anywhere in the world for
20 years. A real gusher there would have an enormous effect on the
pipeline politics that have bedevilled the region.

however muted, is particularly risky at the moment: like the

   NEW YORK _ Anybody surprised by the hostile reaction to the bid
on May 24 by UAL, operator of United Airlines, for US Airways must
not fly much. In the two decades since the American industry was
deregulated, it has seen wild expansion, with more than 100 new
carriers launched in the 1980s, followed by equally manic
consolidation, with more than 100 failures and takeovers in the
1990s. Even if the deal can be done, there is good reason to
question whether it should be. Whatever the outcome, the benefit to
consumers may come from the antitrust scrutiny that such a deal
will inevitably bring. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ As the trade imbalance between the two blocks
widens, the most serious trade war of all time is surely looming.
American and Japan? No, their trade gap is modest compared with
this. According to official statistics, the whole world is now
running a massive current-account deficit. It appears that we are
importing much more from Mars than we export to it. Could it be
that the Martians have been dumping cheap exports in world markets?
Come to think of it, some of those ``green'' protesters in Seattle
last year did seem rather other-worldly. &QL;

fleeing Israeli soldiers who have occupied southern Lebanon for 22
years. ``They leave everything and go like dogs.'' Despite the

seemed this week to leave Lebanon with its tail between its legs. &QL;

   SYDNEY _ The Sydney Harbor Bridge, one of the city's two grand
symbols, will be closed to cars on May 28 for only the third time

   NEW YORK _ Anybody surprised by the hostile reaction to the bid
on May 24 by UAL, operator of United Airlines, for US Airways must
not fly much. In the two decades since the American industry was
deregulated, it has seen wild expansion, with more than 100 new
carriers launched in the 1980s, followed by equally manic
consolidation, with more than 100 failures and takeovers in the
1990s. Even if the deal can be done, there is good reason to
question whether it should be. Whatever the outcome, the benefit to
consumers may come from the antitrust scrutiny that such a deal
will inevitably bring. &QL;

GORE CRITICIZES BUSH'S STATEMENTS ON MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Revisions throughout, adds material, rearranges.) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ Vice President Al Gore, speaking Saturday at
the U.S. Military Academy, criticized Gov. George W. Bush's support
for a national missile defense system along with a possible
one-sided reduction in American nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``An approach that combines serious unilateral reductions with
an attempt to build a massive defensive system will create
instability and thus undermine our security,'' Gore told the West
Point graduates in a sun-splashed ceremony at the academy's Michie
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuclear unilateralism will hinder, rather than help, arms
control,'' Gore said, before handing out diplomas to the 944
graduates who trooped across the stage in their dress uniforms and
white gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning Bush by name, Gore issued the most detailed
rebuttal yet of the foreign policy address that Bush delivered in
Washington on Tuesday. Again and again, Gore assailed the notion of
one-sided arms reductions, a prospect that Bush had raised at an
appearance with a cast of well-known Republican foreign policy
leaders. Gore emphasized that reductions should be pursued within
negotiations and the framework of existing arms control treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that the Clinton administration was already
negotiating for bilateral cuts in nuclear arms and was considering
a limited missile defense but called the kind of approach Bush
recommended misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reductions alone do not guarantee stability,'' Gore said. ``It
is how reductions are made and how they interact with defensive
systems that makes the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who became a specialist in arms control after he was
elected to Congress in the mid-1970s, said: ``Reductions have to be
carried out in a way that reduces the risk of confrontation. If
you're not careful, you could have a reduction of missiles and a
more dangerous world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks were unmistakably pointed in criticism of the
Bush speech, which called for a reduction _ possibly unilateral _
in American nuclear weapons combined with an expanded missile
defense system. Bush has said he would pull out of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty if the Russians do not agree to
adjust it after ``a reasonable amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was invited to the academy in his capacity as vice
president and the speech was billed as an official vice
presidential event, not a campaign appearance. As such, he told
reporters on Friday night, his remarks on the academy grounds would
not be ``political'' in nature. ``I will not make a partisan
remark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his comments Saturday were Gore's first in public since Bush
made his proposal on Tuesday, and they were being written by the
vice president and his longtime national security adviser, Leon
Fuerth, as the vice presidential entourage flew to the Hudson
Valley on Friday night aboard Air Force II from a campaign
appearance in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's speech, Fuerth and Army Secretary Louis
Caldera, who is a political appointee of the president, asserted
that Gore's remarks Saturday had not been political.
</P>
<P>
   Fuerth told reporters that the vice president's comments were
based on his long-standing principles and the fact that President
Clinton was going to Russia next week and that they were not
intended as a response to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he said about strategic stability and so on came
straight out of things that he was writing and talking about in the
House of Representatives and as a senator when he first began to
enter the field of arms control and it is mainly triggered by the
fact that the president is about to leave for Moscow in a matter of
a few days to engage in exactly this set of issues,'' Fuerth told
reporters after Saturday's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speech is not political, the speech is policy-based,''
Fuerth said. ``The ideas that the vice president presented have
been in his record for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Caldera, asked if the remarks did not violate West
Point's policy of barring political speeches, said: ``Absolutely
not. I think there was great care taken to make sure that this was
not a political speech.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's discussion with reporters on Friday night on Air Force
II, he sharply criticized Bush's proposal. He said it would
reignite the arms race, and by saying so, he seemed to ensure that
his differences with Bush would be part of the news media's
coverage Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at the graduation exercise, Gore outlined the Clinton
administration's efforts toward creating a national missile defense
system that would protect all 50 states from a limited attack. ``We
believe, however, that it is essential to do this in a way that
does not destroy the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,'' Gore said.
``The ABM Treaty is the cornerstone of strategic stability in our
relationship with Russia.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What Bush proposed would almost surely entail violating the ABM
Treaty of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed measures that would include building a defensive
system that would cover all 50 states and could be extended to
protect allies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In addition to
holding out the possibility of large unilateral arms cuts, he said
most American nuclear weapons should be removed from hair-trigger
alert status.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he wanted to reduce the size of the U.S. nuclear
arsenal to the ``lowest possible number consistent with our
national security'' and below the levels called for under the Start
II accord with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also noted in his speech to the cadets that President
Clinton was headed for Moscow next week. ``This is an historic
meeting,'' he said. ``The president should leave with the full
support of the American people,'' a subtle reminder to Republicans
that partisan differences over national security traditionally stop
at the water's edge when the president travels abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech on military preparedness, delivered in Washington
as he was flanked by foreign policy experts from four Republican
administrations, earned the governor widespread news media coverage
on a topic on which the Gore campaign had hoped Bush would appear
inexperienced and politically vulnerable. Gore advisers have
believed that the vice president's expertise in international
affairs and particularly arms control will give him an edge in
November.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats had expected Bush to try to bolster his foreign
policy credentials in the campaign, few expected the kind of speech
that Bush delivered on Tuesday. It was hailed by some foreign
policy experts as a ``breakthrough'' in Republican thinking _
particularly the unilateral reduction of warheads _ and seemed to
put arms control squarely on the debate agenda for the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The graduation ceremony at West Point, one of the most
prestigious forums in the nation's military culture, offers an
almost irresistible platform for anyone who wants to influence the
national debate. But for just that reason, the military academy
limits its speakers who are officeholders to the president, the
vice president and the speaker of the House and bars political
activities by them, according to Maj. James Whaley, a West Point
spokesman.

DEVILS AWAIT THEIR NEXT OPPONENT
</HEADLINE>
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now that they have overcome a seemingly
insurmountable obstacle by rallying from two games down in the
semifinals, an achievement unmatched by any team in the history of
the Stanley Cup since expansion in 1967, the Devils are taking aim
at hockey's ultimate prize.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils seem to have everything in place going into the
Stanley Cup finals. They have a coach who has his finger on the
pulse of his team, a goaltender who has raised his play to the
highest level at the right time, a captain who has been the
dominant player in the first three rounds of the playoffs and a
first-line threesome that has been no match for anyone thus far.
</P>
<P>
   All these ingredients converged to help the Devils rally from a
three-games-to-one deficit and eliminate the Flyers in the Eastern
Conference finals on Friday night in Philadelphia with a 2-1
triumph. This seventh and deciding game of a physical series also
may have marked the end of Eric Lindros' career.
</P>
<P>
   By eliminating the Flyers, the Devils have reached the Stanley
Cup finals for the second time. In 1995, with Jacques Lemaire at
the helm and Larry Robinson as his assistant, the Devils swept the
favored Detroit Red Wings in a memorable series.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike 1995, when they opened the finals on the road, this time
the Devils will play host to the first two Cup games, starting
Tuesday night. And this time, Robinson, who replaced Robbie Ftorek
with eight games left in the regular season, is behind the bench as
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were awaiting the outcome of the seventh and deciding
game of the Western Conference finals in Dallas between the
defending champion Stars and the Colorado Avalanche to determine
their opponent in the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Savoring their comeback against the Flyers, the Devils had no
interest in talking about next week's opponent. They politely said
that it didn't matter whether they faced the Stars or the Avalanche
because, in the words of Bobby Holik, ``either team is a great
team.'' The Devils were given the day off on Saturday and will
practice on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Western Conference teams have captured the Stanley Cup every
year since the Devils won it in 1995. As they were against the
Wings then, the Devils must again be considered the underdogs
because the elite teams in the Western Conference have been
superior in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Against Western Conference teams that made the playoffs, the
Devils posted a regular-season winning record only against the Los
Angeles Kings (1-0). Detroit swept the Kings in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Devils have Robinson, who has become their X-factor.
Robinson's tirade after the Devils fell behind by 3-1 in the series
with the Flyers was so perfectly timed that it drew the admiration
of his players as well as outsiders. The Devils gave Robinson the
bulk of the credit for their comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it from the heart,'' was the phrase almost a dozen
players used about Robinson's fusillade after the third consecutive
loss put the team on the verge of elimination. Robinson's reaction
to his inspirational ploy was almost a shrug. ``Sometimes it works
and sometimes it doesn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, this time it worked to perfection because it
obviously touched a chord in the hearts of the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   They responded. Scott Stevens' dominance of the opposition's top
players in each of the three rounds, starting with Florida's Pavel
Bure and Toronto's Mats Sundin, culminated with his crunching check
on Lindros that took the heart out of the Flyers Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur's brilliant saves in a second period dominated by
the Flyers on Friday night gave the Devils the chance they needed
going into the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty gave us a chance to win in the third period,'' said
Patrik Elias, who scored the winning goal with 2 minutes 32 seconds
left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Elias also scored the first goal, and both scores came on passes
from Jason Arnott, who has combined with Elias and Petr Sykora to
form the team's top line. The threesome combined for eight goals in
the series, four by Elias and two each by Arnott and Sykora, and
was a constant threat to the Flyers. Philadelphia simply failed to
come up with a solution for the combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone had to come through for us and Patty was the one,''
Sykora said of Elias' winning goal. ``It's unbelievable how
satisfying it is to come back like that and go to the finals.''

DEVILS BELIEVE, AT LAST: FLYERS SADDENED BY LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ There was a sense of disbelief in both dressing
rooms at First Union Center late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   For the stunned Philadelphia Flyers, it stemmed from their
inability to close out an Eastern Conference semifinal series that
they had once led, three games to one. For the elated Devils, it
was because they had somehow come back to win the series in seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say that we completely believed we could,''
said defenseman Ken Daneyko, the only player to appear in all 125
of the Devils' postseason contests.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott, who assisted on both of Patrik Elias' goals in the
series-deciding 2-1 victory, was more succinct when asked if he
honestly thought the Devils could come back after losing Games 3
and 4 at home. ``No,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils did it the hard way. Three of their four victories,
including two of the last three, came away from home. No team had
ever erased a 3-1 series deficit this late in the playoffs, but the
Devils did so with a nail-biting Game 7 victory on Elias' second
goal of the night, only 2 minutes 32 seconds away from sudden
death.
</P>
<P>
   That Elias provided all of the Devils' offense was fitting. He
led New Jersey in goals, points and game-winning goals during the
regular season. That came after he sat out the first month in a
contract dispute with the team president, Lou Lamoriello.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a weird feeling,'' Elias said. ``But it's a great
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other dressing room, the mood was predictably subdued.
``It stinks,'' said Brian Boucher, the rookie goaltender who had
powered the Flyers in the playoffs. ``Up three games, we had three
cracks at it.''
</P>
<P>
   But all three times, Philadelphia came up short. And the Devils
will begin the Stanley Cup finals at home on Tuesday against the
winner of the Dallas-Colorado series. The Devils won the cup in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   In a series that was tied through six games, two periods, 17
minutes and 28 seconds, the most enduring image was the Flyers'
Eric Lindros slumped on the ice 7:50 into Game 7, with what turned
out to be another concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' head crashed against the ice in his second game since
returning from post-concussion syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sickening to see something like that,'' said Lindros'
teammate John LeClair, one of two skaters who helped carry Lindros
off the ice. Lindros walked out of the building Friday night under
his own power, accompanied by his father, Carl. Today, the Flyers
confirmed their hulking 27-year-old center had sustained a
concussion, his third this season and fifth in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Stevens, who was responsible for the clean but vicious hit
at the Devils' blue line that knocked Lindros out, felt about the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely thinking about his career,'' said Stevens,
who at 36 has imposed his physical stamp on each of the Devils'
three playoff series this spring. ``I don't want to be anybody who
ends someone's career. I went into the dressing room all by myself
and I was upset. It takes a bit away from this win.''
</P>
<P>
   While his teammates headed home to ponder what could have been,
Lindros spent the evening at Pennsylvania Hospital. ``You don't
want to lose Eric Lindros,'' Flyers coach Craig Ramsay said. ``And
we don't want to see this young man get hurt again.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Lindros does return next season, Friday's game was
probably his last for the Flyers, given his family's bitter
relationship with general manager Bob Clarke. But that did not stop
the Flyers from bringing Lindros back for the end of the series
with the Devils. He returned for Wednesday's Game 6, after one
practice; he had been medically cleared to play.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Ramsay approached his mentor, Roger Neilson,
about joining him on the bench for Friday's game. Ramsay replaced
Neilson as Philadelphia's head coach this season, while Neilson has
battled cancer. The succession process was strained. And like the
continuing Lindros saga, it was a distraction to the team. In the
end, Ramsay and Neilson decided against having Neilson return
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   During the second intermission, Devils coach Larry Robinson,
upset with his team's performance during the period, replayed the
tirade he had delivered to the team after Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in and gave us an earful again,'' Randy McKay said.
``Maybe not quite as much, but he was pretty loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Robinson said, it worked. ``After Larry gave us that
little rant, it seemed to light a spark under us,'' Daneyko said.
</P>
<P>
   That made Lamoriello look like a hockey genius. He replaced
Robbie Ftorek with Robinson with eight games left in the regular
season, while the Devils were in the midst of losing the points
title _ and the ensuing home-ice advantage in the playoffs. ``In my
mind, I didn't think we were going anywhere,'' Lamoriello said.
</P>
<P>
   And now, for only the second time in the franchise's history in
New Jersey, the Devils are going to play for the Stanley Cup. &QL;

OUTDOORS: BLUEFISH SEASON ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD 
</HEADLINE>
   By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ The day was dark and dank, a stiff near gale
from the south hurling good-sized combers against the outer beach
of Martha's Vineyard Island, when, with Nelson Sigelman and me on
board, Cooper Gilkes nosed his four-wheel-drive vehicle out onto
the strand and headed west toward Wasque Rip on Chappaquiddick.
</P>
<P>
   Coop had already been there several times this spring, but it
was the first visit of the season for Nelson and me. We were after
the northward-migrating bluefish that year after year in recent
times have arrived at Wasque Rip off Chappaquiddick shortly before
mid-May. This year, the first bluefish was caught from shore at
that location on May 1, and by May 11 bluefishing at Wasque Rip was
well under way.
</P>
<P>
   Scanning the water as we drove, we were about halfway to Wasque
when we thought we saw a different wave pattern on the water,
perhaps indicating feeding bluefish even though no gulls or terns
were about.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped and began casting metal jigs: Hopkins, Kastmasters,
Krokodiles and others of that genre. Within 10 minutes, Coop had a
couple of hits and Nelson and I were each fast to a fish that
subsequently pulled free. Nothing more occurred after that flurry,
so we kept on to the west to where we could see more than a dozen
vehicles parked on the beach. When we got closer, Coop said, ``I
don't see any bent rods.''
</P>
<P>
   It was true. About half the anglers were casting and the others
were sipping coffee or working on gear or sitting on tailgates and
gamming.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped about 100 yards short of them and resumed fishing.
Ten minutes later, bent rods were the rule rather than the
exception, and all hands were catching fish ranging from five to
eight pounds.
</P>
<P>
   At first, most of the fish were taken on the aforementioned
metal, but some casters switched to popping plugs, which also
worked. Many anglers prefer to go after bluefish with poppers, the
surf fisher's equivalent of the flyrodder's floating fly, because
it's exciting to see the wind-blown spray from a smashing strike.
</P>
<P>
   At one point some of the blues were right against the beach, and
that reminded me to shorten my casts. There's little point in
hooking a fish 90 yards offshore when you can accomplish the same
thing with a 30-yard toss. This has particular merit when a strong
tide _ for which Wasque Rip is famous _ is running, greatly
reducing the time needed to bring your quarry to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   A classic bluefish blitz was soon under way, rods bent, fish
flopping on the sand, an occasional angler frantically striving to
remove a deeply embedded hook from a fish without getting part of a
finger bitten off, all the while glancing over his shoulder at the
action. A bluefish minuet developed: anglers fast to fish moving
downtide with them, a maneuver that requires the casters in their
path to reel in and get out of the way. With a big rod and heavy
line, you can usually stand your ground and bring the fish to you,
but it's a different ball game with light tackle, particularly if
the blue was hooked at the end of a long cast.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Janet Messineo, a Vineyard taxidermist and a
talented angler who was catching bluefish at a furious rate, asked
if I would help her put an elastic bandage on her wrist to
alleviate her tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, such is the camaraderie among surf casters,
Don Mohr, a longtime regular at Wasque, took pity on me as I was
trying to extract a popping plug's treble hook from the upper jaw
of a bluefish and offered me his pliers. I asked him how he was
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My replacement parts seem to be wearing out,'' he said
cheerfully and limped away to resume casting. Don, a former semipro
football and baseball player, has had a series of operations that
include two hip and two knee replacements, but that doesn't keep
him from his beloved Wasque.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Sigelman, who is a reporter for the weekly Vineyard
Times, couldn't focus solely on fishing. He needed photographs of
the event, which were hard to get because spray kept dashing over
his camera, but he did beach a couple of blues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to catching that evening's supper, I wanted half a
dozen or more fish to put in my smoker, a once-sacrosanct ritual
for me with the first bluefish of the season. Coop took the
pressure off me by saying I could have his fish.
</P>
<P>
   Coop, who runs a tackle shop in Edgartown, is also a well-known
fishing guide. He was taking a busman's holiday with Nelson and me
and hinting that he might return to Wasque that evening. Keeper
striped bass _ in Massachusetts the minimum length this year is 30
inches _ are already being caught at Wasque and the area east of
it, East Beach.
</P>
<P>
   We were fishing the latter part of the falling tide at midday on
our bluefish caper, but Coop said that he had been doing well with
stripers on the rising tide, particularly at night.
</P>
<P>
   Back home by midafternoon, I began fileting my fish and
discovered that the stomachs of most were empty. Those that had
been feeding recently had been dining on squid, sea robins and
something that appeared to be from the herring family. I was
delighted to find that the bluefish were still stiff and firm.
Bluefish deteriorate rapidly after capture.
</P>
<P>
   I was still busy at my task when Ruth, my companion, returned
from a trip to the supermarket, squealed with delight and confessed
that she had purchased a pound of hamburger just in case I had
failed in my quest, a purchase that, if nothing else, reveals
something about my angling prowess.

OPPOSITION RALLY IN BELGRADE DRAWS RELATIVELY LOW TURNOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Some 10,000 people showed up Saturday for
an anti-government rally, a relatively low turnout reflecting
popular disappointment with the leaders of the political opposition
here.
</P>
<P>
   They heard Vuk Draskovic, the head of the main opposition party,
the Serbian Renewal Movement, describe a city and a country
``paralyzed by fear, despair and a feeling of helplessness'' in the
face of the power of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic, in a wandering speech, seemed unable to
articulate a clear strategy to alleviate that paralysis, other than
a united push for early democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democracy Party, the main element of
the Alliance for Change coalition, preached unity, patience and
collective self-defense. ``We can't checkmate Milosevic in one
move,'' he said. ``We have to pressure him, surround him and drain
out his political life drop by drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic ``is most afraid of 3 million people who will come to
the polling station and say, `We don't want you,''' Djindjic said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous rallies, this one heard only three opposition
leaders speak _ not all 16 _ and there were more speakers from
other parts of Serbian society, including academics, women's
activists and the spreading student movement, Otpor, or Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, said Zarko Korac, a political leader in the alliance,
is to present a wider social front of solidarity against the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition right now is not capable of making a very
consistent, clear program,'' Korac said. ``It's not just that the
big parties are not up to the situation, but what you need is a
wider front to confront the dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Ognjen Pribicevic, a Draskovic adviser, said: ``We are doing
what we can at the moment. And we are more united than you think,
especially the big parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the opposition would concentrate more on meetings
and retail politics in the countryside, where feelings run higher
than in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But an Otpor speaker named Nemanja, from Krusevac, criticized
the politicians for disunity and squabbling. ``For seven days, dear
leaders,'' he said, ``you were wasting time on useless meetings.''
He said Otpor had drawn up a plan for hunger strikes, then tried to
give it to Draskovic, who kept his hands to his side. Djindjic
finally took it.
</P>
<P>
   With declining numbers _ a rally in mid-April drew more than
100,000 people, but one on May 15 drew only about 25,000 _ this
rally is likely to be the last of its kind for now.
</P>
<P>
   It followed a dispiriting 10 days for the political opposition
here.
</P>
<P>
   On May 17, the Serbian government seized control of the Belgrade
television station Studio B, controlled by Draskovic's party. But
fearing a wider crackdown on all opposition-run cities and
independent media, Draskovic urged other opposition leaders not to
attempt outright confrontation with the government, bringing
accusations that he was capitulating without a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Otpor in particular has been urging a program of civil
disobedience, but at the same time, nightly rallies here for Studio
B have shrunk to fewer than 500 people. To blunt Otpor, the
government closed universities a week early, allowing students to
enter only for final exams.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a rally of 3,000 people in the southern city of Nis Friday
night, Goran Svilanovic, head of the Civic Alliance, said his
opposition colleagues were not rising to the new challenge by the
government. ``If we do not resist now, they will come into our
houses, burn them and chase us away,'' Svilanovic said, referring
to Serbian tactics against Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has wide support in Serbia as the only
alternative to Milosevic, but polls indicate that the support can
be shaky and is not growing. A poll just done for the National
Democratic Institute shows the Alliance for Change in early May _
before the seizure of Studio B _ recovering some of the support it
had lost earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the alliance plus Draskovic's party get about 46 percent
of the vote, with the ruling coalition getting about 30 with 18
percent still undecided and 7 percent saying they will not vote,
with a margin of error of 2.9 percent. The problem with all polls
here is that they underestimate support for the Radical Party of
Vojislav Seselj, part of the ruling coalition, whose voters are
more suspicious of pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of undecided indicates deep uncertainty about the
credibility of the opposition, since 63 percent of those polled say
they are unfavorable toward Milosevic and some 70 percent say
``it's time for someone new.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, 38 percent say Milosevic ``may not be perfect, but he's
better than the opposition,'' and he remains the only single leader
whose ratings are larger than the ``don't knows.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of those polled say opposition leaders
spend so much time ``fighting among themselves that they don't
accomplish as much as they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, in yet another court case by an official against the
independent media, the newspaper Danas and its editor were fined
570,000 dinars (about $14,300 at the unofficial rate of exchange)
for printing a letter from a law school professor to his dean
accusing Seselj of plagiarizing Lenin. It was the seventh such case
Danas has lost.

EARNHARDT IN SPOTLIGHT ON A DAY TO HONOR PETTY
</HEADLINE>
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ The specter of Adam Petty will be evident on
Sunday when Dale Earnhardt Jr. tries to expand on a distinguished
rookie season and Robby Gordon goes for an usual racing double in
the Nascar Winston Cup series' longest race of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A flag honoring Petty _ the 19-year-old driver killed in a wreck
on May 12 _ will fly over Victory Lane at Lowe's Motor Speedway,
site of the Coca-Cola 600.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Petty, Adam's father and head of Petty Enterprises, will
not be there. He is taking off until next weekend's race in Dover,
Del., to mourn his son's death.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr., the only driver to win more than one Winston Cup
race this season, understands the potential peril that comes with
every race.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to Adam puts everything in perspective,'' the
25-year-old Earnhardt said. ``You never know when you're going to
be here or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has certainly been driving as if there were no
tomorrow. He has two victories and recently became the first rookie
to win the series' all-star race, The Winston, and has been taking
a lot of the spotlight away from his legendary father, Dale Sr.
</P>
<P>
   After Earnhardt Jr. won in Richmond, Va., his father gave him
congratulatory hugs, but then the seven-time series champion
whispered to his son that he was leaving and to find his own ride
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's happy and proud when his son and his car win,''
Earnhardt Jr. said. ``But at the same time, if his son and his car
win, he doesn't, and that's got to be a little tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. collected $516,410 for his victory in The Winston,
not bad for a guy who was working in the service department of his
father's auto dealership several years ago. He bought a 25-foot
boat and pickup truck with recent winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the real gravy may lie ahead. Earnhardt Jr. is blossoming
into a crowd favorite. He received the warmest applause of the
night on Wednesday when he qualified for the Coca-Cola 600 pole
with a lap of 186.034 miles an hour, breaking the track qualifying
record established in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' he said of the crowd's reaction. ``I just
hope I don't get tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gordon wants to attempt a racing double accomplished
by just two men: driving in the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola
600 on the same day. John Andretti (1994) and Tony Stewart (1999)
are the only to do so. The Indy 500 starts at noon today, the
Coca-Cola 600 at 6:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon plans to leave Indy by helicopter from the track infield,
head to the airport for the flight to Charlotte, then take a
helicopter to Lowe's. A nurse will be on the plane to make sure he
is not dehydrated.
</P>
<P>
   If Gordon cannot make it to Concord, Bryan Reffner will be
standing by to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who went without food for much of the day in performing
his double, said Gordon should make it barring rain or a victory in
the Indy race. A victory would likely require him to stay for a
celebration and news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll probably fare better physically than I did last
year,'' Stewart said. ``I think nutrition-wise he'll know what to
do to keep his energy up during the day.''

THE MANY SIDES OF SIDING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While there are many ways to enhance the appearance of a house _
installing a new front door, adding shutters, painting the window
frames, sprucing up the landscaping _ few improvements provide the
metamorphosis that results from installing new siding.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few years, the siding market has exploded,'' said
Bruce Herlitschek, president of American Home Exterior Design, a
siding company based in Yonkers, N.Y. Herlitschek said that the
growth relates both to the number of homeowners calling to have
their existing siding replaced and to the range of choices of
replacement materials now available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homeowners have more options now than ever before,'' he said,
explaining that in addition to traditional siding materials like
cedar-shake shingles and wood clapboard, homeowners can choose from
various styles, shapes, colors and even thicknesses.
</P>
<P>
   And while many homeowners still install aluminum siding, he
said, the most common siding material for new installations in the
Northeast is vinyl. ``Vinyl siding is molded into different shapes
and sizes in the factory,'' he said, adding that since the color of
vinyl is imbedded in the material itself _ as opposed to being a
surface finish, as it is on aluminum _ scratches are virtually
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional vinyl panel, Herlitschek said, is called a
``single-eight,'' which means that the panel is 8 inches high. Most
vinyl panels come in standard 12-foot lengths.
</P>
<P>
   The panels most commonly used today, however, are known as
``double-fours'' _8-inch-high lengths of vinyl that are molded to
appear as two 4-inch clapboards, one above the other. Panels are
also available in a style called shiplap or Dutchlap, a 9-inch-high
panel that looks like two 4{-inch-high boards that are beveled on
the edges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody else on your block has double-fours, using
shiplap will give your house a unique exterior detail,''
Herlitschek said.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible to buy vinyl panels that look like
3-inch-high clapboards, said Joseph J. Horan, an owner of
Vinylseal, an East Meadow, Long Island, contractor. ``If you have a
one-story ranch, oftentimes we'll recommend going with three-inch
panels because it makes the house look taller,'' Horan said, adding
that such panels on a two- or three-story colonial, on the other
hand, could make the house look too busy.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular style of vinyl siding mimics the look of cedar
shingles. ``There are rustic shakes, scallops and even
gingerbread,'' he said. ``And there are also a lot of accessory
items that can enhance the look of a house.'' Among the
accessories, he said, are shutters and decorative moldings that can
be installed around windows and doors.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Horan said, before new vinyl siding can be
installed, the existing siding should be removed. Failure to remove
it will result in an uneven base for the new siding and make it
impossible to assess the condition of the surface underneath the
old siding, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make sure you have a sound subsurface,'' he said,
explaining that it is not uncommon to find rotted wood near where
the foundation meets the sheathing and around windows and doors.
</P>
<P>
   The sole exception, he said, is shingle-type siding that
contains asbestos; such siding is generally left in place so that
no asbestos fibers are released into the air. ``Then you install a
plastic vapor barrier and a layer of foam insulation underneath the
new siding that's being installed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of installing standard vinyl siding, including removing
the existing siding and installing a vapor barrier and insulation,
should run from $500 to $700 for every 100 square feet of surface
to be covered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Horan said that an average house would cost $12,000 to $15,000.
Vinyl shakes, he said, typically cost somewhat more.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want the very best in vinyl, however, Gerald
Damora, president of Seamless Siding Management in Randolph, N.J.,
said he has just the thing. ``Installing siding is like putting a
suit on the house,'' Damora said. ``And if you want a custom-made
suit, what you want is seamless siding.''
</P>
<P>
   Damora said that since the longest standard vinyl panels come in
16{-foot lengths, and since house walls are often wider than that,
it is generally necessary to install one or more panels to cover
the span from one end of a wall to the other. That results in a
number of unsightly seams where the ends of adjacent panels
overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Seamless vinyl, however, comes in panels up to 40 feet long,
permitting most spans to be covered without overlapping the ends
and allowing Damora's franchisees to install the thickest vinyl
available. ``We can make it thick because there are no seams,'' he
said. ``If you were to make conventional siding as thick as we make
ours, the seams would stand out like pickles in a mayonnaise jar.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another advantage of using thicker vinyl, Damora said, is
that it can be produced with a smooth surface. ``The reason
ordinary vinyl usually comes with a wood-grained surface is for
structural stability,'' he said, explaining that the embossing of
relatively thin vinyl is necessary to keep it shaped properly and
to keep it from sagging and bowing.
</P>
<P>
   Thicker vinyl, on the other hand, needs no such internal support
and can be manufactured with a smooth surface that looks more like
wood than does thinner vinyl with an artificial grain pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seamless is smooth, perfectly straight, and makes a house look
like it's supposed to look,'' Damora said, adding that there is a
price to be paid for such quality: Seamless siding generally costs
15 percent to 25 percent more than traditional siding.
</P>
<P>
   Another option for those who want a custom look is to have a
specially designed masonry finish. ``Anywhere you can put siding,
you can put our finish,'' said Larry Landes, president of Garden
State Brickface, Windows and Siding in Roselle, N.J. Among the
various finishes the company can apply are stucco, limestone,
brownstone and brickface.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the city, you're certainly not going to put vinyl siding on
an old brownstone,'' he said, adding that masonry buildings that
have deteriorating facades _ as well as wood-frame buildings that
have had the old siding removed _ can be resurfaced with masonry
using the company's hand-sculptured process.
</P>
<P>
   The process generally involves attaching a galvanized steel lath
to the building and then applying two coats of cement to the lath.
Once the cement has dried, one or more layers of colored stucco are
applied to the surface. Then, depending on the type of finish
desired, the stucco is hand-carved to simulate brownstone,
limestone, brick or stone.
</P>
<P>
   While a simple stucco finish can cost about the same as a
premium vinyl siding job, Landes said, most other masonry finishes
are from 20 percent to 25 percent more expensive than siding.

<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ Vice President Al Gore skirted dangerously
close to partisan politics Saturday in an address to graduating
West Point cadets that included indirect criticism of Texas Gov.
George Bush's recent nuclear defense proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in an interview with Cox News Service that followed the
roughly 15-minute address, emphatically denied that his remarks
were aimed at Bush. He also insisted that he scrupulously adhered
to the tradition of avoiding partisan politics at the U.S. Military
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I defy you to find anything political in them,'' he said of
his graduation remarks, his first at the historic campus. He said
his comments reflected nuclear disarmament positions ``I have held
for 15 years,'' beginning with his career in Congress in which he
became an acknowledged expert on nuclear arms reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Feurth, Gore's longtime national security adviser, told
reporters that Gore's comments were timed to precede President
Clinton's upcoming trip to Russia, not in response to last week's
policy proposals by Bush. Clinton's trip is expected to center on
talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin about further arms
reductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is mainly triggered by the fact that the president is about
to leave for Moscow in a matter of a few days to engage in exactly
this set of issues,'' Feurth said in a hastily arranged session
with reporters. ``The speech is not political, the speech is
policy-based. The ideas that the vice president presented have been
in his record for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no protest from West Point officials. Lt. Gen. Daniel
Christman, the academy's superintendent, said the vice president's
speech was ``an apt description of the environment'' in which West
Point's graduating class of 943 cadets will find themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to defending the administration's nuclear defense
policies, Gore also reaffirmed his commitment to upgrading defense
readiness and improving the life of military men and women through
increased pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also proposed strategies in which the United States aligns
itself with those nations moving toward freedom and ``still
pressing for reform,'' while at the same time modernizing its own
weaponry and strategies for a ``Global Age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have ... to transform today's armed forces into tomorrow's
information-age force, one that fully invokes America's strategic
advantages, talent and technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not mention Bush in his address. Yet many of the vice
president's comments alluded to stands staked out by Bush last week
and echoed comments the vice president had made about Bush's
proposals on Air Force II Friday night en route to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any effort to go back in time to the Star Wars proposal ...
is, in the opinion of most experts that have talked about it,
wildly optimistic,'' he said on his way to New York. ``I'm
persuaded by their arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, surrounding himself with GOP foreign policy luminaries
last week, called for building a national missile defense system
while simultaneously beginning unilateral cuts in the U.S. nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``An approach that combines serious unilateral reductions with
an attempt to build a massive defense system will create
instability, and thus undermine our security,'' Gore said in his
address Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuclear unilateralism will hinder, rather than help, arms
control,'' he said. ``Reductions have to be carried out in a way
that reduces the risk of confrontation. If you're not careful, you
could have a reduction of missiles and a more dangerous world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore outlined the Clinton administration's efforts toward
creating a national missile defense system that would protect all
50 states from a limited attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe, however, that it is essential to do this in a way
that does not destroy the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,'' Gore
said. ``The ABM Treaty is the cornerstone of strategic stability in
our relationship with Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have suggested that Bush's missile defense
proposal, which he envisions being extended to European, Asian and
Middle Eastern allies, would violate the 1972 ABM Treaty with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush himself has said he is willing to scrap the pact to
make room for the development of technology that could protect the
country against missile strikes from a growing number of nuclear
threats.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in unveiling his proposal at the National Press Club last
Tuesday, suggested that the nuclear policies of the Clinton
administration ``still resides in that already distant past'' of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, before handing out diplomas to the graduating cadets,
noted that ``the classic security agenda is still with us,'' and
that ``we still face competition among nations that can lead to
war.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the upcoming meeting between Clinton and Putin is ``an
historic meeting.'' And, in an apparent reference to the tradition
of muting political differences over national security issues while
the president is traveling abroad, he added, ``The president should
leave with the full support of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   West Point is one of the most prestigious forums for discussions
of national defense issues, and the only politicians invited to
speak at graduation ceremonies are the president, vice president
and Speaker of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Inviting politicians to speak at West Point grew into a
controversy in 1996 when the service academy withdrew an invitation
to then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole after he became a candidate
for president.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Dole has complained about West Point's
invitation to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, in responding to Gore's speech, did not
repeat Dole's criticisms, but rather alluded to the friction
between the Pentagon and the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the Texas governor would work
to ``renew the bond of trust between the president and the
military.''
</P>
<P>
   The last vice president to deliver remarks at West Point was the
father of the Texas governor, George Bush, in 1984 and again in
1988. In 1988, the elder Bush was a candidate for president when he
spoke at West Point.

BRYANT GIVES THE LAKERS QUALITY LEADERSHIP JUST WHEN THEY NEED IT
MOST
</HEADLINE>
  By TOM SPOUSTA

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ He launched the ball toward the Rose Garden
rafters with as much relief as joy. In those desperate, final 29.9
seconds of Game 3 on Friday night, Kobe Bryant had amazingly swung
the Western Conference finals in his team's favor and defined his
young career.
</P>
<P>
   His was a single-handed sequence that transcended the box score.
Although seemingly impossible for the All-Star guard, Bryant played
beyond his 21 years in the Lakers' 93-91 victory. These were not
the raw, unpredictable playground instincts that have highlighted
and hindered Bryant during his four seasons in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   These were championship moments delivered when his team
absolutely needed a leader. First, Bryant set up the game-winning
basket, driving toward the middle to draw defenders his way, then
flipping a pass to Ron Harper for a 18-foot jump shot that the
Portland Trail Blazers never had a chance to contest.
</P>
<P>
   On the Trail Blazers' next possession, as Rasheed Wallace took a
pass and positioned himself near the free throw line, Bryant
slapped the ball away, creating a wild 20-second scramble that
ended with Portland center Arvydas Sabonis lumbering down the lane.
The 7-foot-3-inch Sabonis was met by the 6-7 Bryant, and with one
swat, Bryant put the Lakers ahead, 2-1, in this best-of-seven
series.
</P>
<P>
   An assist. A steal. A block. Fittingly, Bryant grabbed the last
rebound, too, and was immediately met with a high-five from
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time since we've been together that we've
had to lead a team together in playoffs,'' Bryant said of O'Neal.
``We're up to the challenge. We're not going to let the team down;
we're not going to let the fans down. We're going to give it our
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant assumed command of the Lakers with 25 points on 11-of-18
shooting, seven rebounds and seven assists to squelch whispers that
the Portland Trail Blazers were making him look like an ordinary
player. In the first two games of this series, Bryant averaged only
12.5 points and was doing little to lift the burden on O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided to score,'' Bryant said. ``They can send one
guy, two guys, three guys, it doesn't matter. You have to pick your
spots. It's not something you can do for the full 48 minutes. But
you have to make them pay at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant kept the Lakers from being blown out in the first half
Friday night. He scored 14 of his team's 22 points in the first
quarter and had 18 at halftime on eight of 13 shooting while O'Neal
was still trying to figure out how even to get a shot off against
Portland's defense.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal took only one shot in the first quarter and didn't score.
At halftime, he had only eight points and obviously needed help
breaking loose from Sabonis and help from Scottie Pippen and
Rasheed Wallace, who again roamed freely on defense, buzzing along
the perimeter, then dropping down to harass O'Neal in a game of
human bumper cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe had a fantastic game,'' O'Neal said. ``Everybody was
ragging on him, saying he was nine shots a game. He was more
aggressive tonight, and his shots were falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, the NBA defensive player of the year, also kept Pippen
under wraps, holding the Trail Blazers' leader to 12 points on five
of 13 shooting. Bryant was assigned to guard Pippen for Game 3
instead of Glen Rice, who was nursing a sore knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come out and set the tone,'' Bryant said. ``I
wanted to send a message not only to us as a ballclub, that we can
win here. But also to Portland, that the team you are facing now
isn't the team you faced'' in Game 2, which the Trail Blazers won,
106-77.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' statement included a 20-6 run in the third quarter
to complete a rally from a 14-point deficit in the second quarter.
Bryant ended the Trail Blazers' comeback attempt with his play
against Sabonis. Replays clearly showed that Bryant blocked the
ball and did not foul Sabonis. In hindsight, Sabonis should
probably have taken the 15-foot jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't have been able to take it,'' said O'Neal, who had
come out to try and put a hand in Sabonis' face. ``I was on the
fly, and I was high.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen said that Bryant had hit Sabonis. ``We didn't get the
call,'' Pippen said. ``The officials just aren't going to call it
in that situation.''

REWRITING RENT REGULATIONS CREATES NEW BATTLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a new battlefront between tenants and
landlords. It is 200 pages of dense legalese quietly created by New
York state officials to rewrite the rent regulations that cover 2.4
million residents, most of them in New York City, and that document
has caused a furor.
</P>
<P>
   The state Division of Housing and Community Renewal says that it
is simply updating the rules to conform to laws, court decisions
and regulatory directives.
</P>
<P>
   But tenant groups accuse the state of making changes that favor
landlords and undermine key protections for renters; changes for
which, they say, there is no statutory authority. They say the
changes will enable owners to raise rents improperly and to evict
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   But the housing agency's general counsel, Marcia P. Hirsch,
denies those claims. The updating is required by law, she said, and
the proposal clarifies numerous issues, including some that are
being contested in court.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state has not yet formally adopted the revised
regulations, tenant leaders say they are preparing to challenge
them in court. ``There's no question that we're going to be suing
to stop this,'' said Michael McKee, associate director of the New
York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, which represents 17,000
individuals and 144 affiliated groups.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp debate characterized public hearings on the issue Thursday
in Manhattan, White Plains and Manhasset. Most of the
rent-regulated apartments are in New York City, but about 70,000
are in Nassau, Westchester and Rockland counties.
</P>
<P>
   Landlords gave qualified supported to the proposal, but called
for more changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For both owners and tenants, this codification is an extremely
valuable and useful process'' because it consolidates all the rules
in one place, said Joseph Strasburg, president of the city's
largest landlord group, the Rent Stabilization Association, which
represents 25,000 owners and managers. ``The bottom line is that
there is nothing new here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Strasburg urged several changes, including removing the time
limit on when an owner can challenge whether the tenant whose name
appears on a lease is really living in an apartment, and allowing
owners to charge more than one month's rent as a security deposit.
</P>
<P>
   Tenant advocates adamantly opposed the changes in the revision,
and accused the state of pushing the changes through without
sufficient public review.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McKee linked the state agency's changes to an effort three years
ago by state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno to eliminate rent
stabilization. Gov. George Pataki eventually forged a compromise
between Bruno and tenant groups that was perceived as a defeat for
Republicans. But McKee called the latest move an attempt ``to
achieve pro-landlord changes that George Elmer Pataki could not win
from the state Legislature in 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponents of the changes said that under the proposal,
owners could use illegally high rents charged in the past as the
basis for computing current rents, ignoring the correct amounts
filed with the state. Landlords could also prohibit tenants from
charging roommates more than their ``proportionate share'' of rent,
a term that was not defined. And tenants would be barred from
seeking lower rent for certain reduced services, like staffing
levels, that go back more than four years.
</P>
<P>
   The tenants' advocates said that the hearings were not well
publicized, that the proposal was not advertised and that copies of
the draft were not available at the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I comment on your proposed code when I don't have a
copy?'' asked Pat McGovern, a tenant from Manhattan. ``I asked for
a copy at the desk, and they said they would mail me one.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the proposal's length, speakers were limited to five
minutes each and were barred from proposing further changes,
although that rule was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a landlord's wish list,'' said David Robinson, a
lawyer for Legal Services for New York City, a nonprofit advocacy
group. ``I looked through 125 pages and found one page of
protection for tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Stanley E. Michels said: ``This is a travesty.
You are trying to destroy what's left of rent control and rent
stabilization.''
</P>
<P>
   One surprise speaker at the Manhattan session was the head of
the union that represents the housing agency's 475 employees in New
York City, Ralph F. Carbone, president of Local 1359 of District
Council 37. Carbone said that he was impartial in disputes between
between landlords and tenants, but that he felt compelled to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that the proposals were slanted significantly toward
owners,'' he said, ``going beyond what I believe the current state
law and judicial precedents are.''

GREENBRIER PLANS TO ADD RESORT HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By LYN RIDDLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. _ The Greenbrier hotel, the
luxurious resort in this Appalachian Mountain valley town, and
Dolan, Pollak &AMP; Schram, a Georgia developer, are planning a
community of vacation houses on the hotel grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, Pollak, which built a similar development near Savannah,
Ga., at a plantation once owned by Henry Ford, expects to begin
selling the first of 500 lots at the Greenbrier in July. Prices
will range from $250,000 for cottage-sized lots of 60 feet by 100
feet to $1 million for three to five acres at the base of the
mountains that surround the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The focus will be a sporting-club atmosphere, with golf, tennis,
riding and other activities, and the developers will handle grass
cutting and yard maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Ted J. Kleisner, who has been the president of the Greenbrier
since 1987, said the resort had embarked on a real estate venture,
Greenbrier Village, in the 1980s but discontinued it because
company officials were not confident they could successfully
develop the property. Thirty-eight cottages were built beside a
golf course, and 14 houses were constructed on larger lots nearby.
A 15th is now under construction.
</P>
<P>
   One limitation on the earlier sales effort was that a
significant piece of property _ a hillside tract surrounding the
hotel _ could not be touched until 1995, when the federal
government ended its lease on a once-secret underground bunker,
designed to house Congress in the event of nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   The 112,000-square-foot bunker had two meeting halls, one for
the House and one for the Senate; communications centers; a safe
room with copies of documents that would be necessary to keep the
government running; a hospital; 18 dormitories with 30 metal bunk
beds in each; and enough food to last for a month or more.
</P>
<P>
   A wing of the hotel was built over the bunker to conceal it, and
it remained secret until 1992, when newspaper articles about it
appeared. It is now open for tours.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland Hill will be the site of the first cottages to be built
as part of the sporting club. The property now has 10 tennis courts
on it, the only use the federal government would allow.
</P>
<P>
   Kleisner said that after the government lease ended, the company
decided to take another look at development. ``But we had to do it
right,'' he said, explaining that most developers wanted to build
tightly spaced houses along the resort's three golf courses,
creating ``fairway canyons.''
</P>
<P>
   The resort, which is owned by CSX Corp., spreads over 6,500
acres, from the top of Kate's Mountain northwest across the valley
to the top of Greenbrier Mountain. ``This land has been maintained
in an almost pristine fashion, and it is unacceptable to do
anything less'' than to be a good steward of the land, Kleisner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kleisner had originally met two of the principals in the
development firm, Peter Pollak and Chip Dolan, when he was looking
for a vacation home several years ago. The third partner in Dolan,
Pollak is Steve Schram, a former investment banker who once ran the
Boston Celtics basketball team and other businesses it owns.
</P>
<P>
   Kleisner looked at Bray's Island Plantation, a former estate
turned vacation-home community near Beaufort, S.C., that Dolan and
Pollak were marketing. He chose a home in Savannah instead but
remembered the two salesmen, who moved on to develop the Ford
Plantation, 1,800 acres near Savannah on the Ogeechee River, which
has sold $60 million in building lots in the last 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   The partners are relying on the reputation of the Greenbrier as
a grand hotel with fastidious service and on its long history to
help market the real estate. AAA gives the resort five diamonds,
its top rating, and it has been designated a National Historic
Landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenbrier has about 90,000 guests a year, about half of
whom have been there before. Conventions make up about 50 percent
of its business, and in the last year it has been host to the
Business Council, the Grocery Manufacturers of America and the
Chemical Manufacturers of America.

<P>
   People have been coming to what is now White Sulphur Springs and
to the valley along Howard's Creek since 1778, when a woman now
known only as Mrs. Anderson is said to have found that the sulphur
spring cured her rheumatism.
</P>
<P>
   The spring house, built decades later when the property became a
full-fledged resort, still stands, but people wanting to take the
sulphur water, with its smell of rotten eggs, now dip from a
free-running spigot, not a hole in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The resort served as the summer White House for Martin Van Buren
in 1838. Dwight D. Eisenhower was the last sitting president to
stay at the hotel, and his visit has been the subject of much
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower came in 1956 to meet with the president of Mexico,
arriving by train and making no stops along the 250-mile route
between Washington and White Sulphur Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert S. Conte, the Greenbrier's staff historian, said that
many people believe this was a test run to see if it might have
been possible to move Congress to White Sulphur Springs if nuclear
war broke out. About the time of the Eisenhower visit, or perhaps
before, the federal government and Chesapeake &AMP; Ohio Railway, the
forerunner of CSX, began negotiations on building the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   It was completed just before the Cuban missile crisis in 1962,
and that was the only time in its history that the bunker was on
high alert, said Paul E. Bugas, its on-site manager from 1971 to
1995. He still manages the bunker, but for the Greenbrier, which
operates it as a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Some 14,000 guests each year pay $25 to see where their
legislators would have lived if the Cold War had ever turned hot.
The president and the judicial branch would have been evacuated to
another bunker, this one at Mount Weather near Berryville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The bunker cost the government $10 million. It also spent $4
million on what is now called the West Virginia Wing, an 86-room
hotel addition that sits atop the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Bugas, who is known as Fritz, said a six-word phrase _ ``The
lease agreement is being activated'' _ would have set his staff to
work. The bunker was supposed to be ready to run within a four-hour
time limit. Information on how the legislators would have been
transported is still classified, but the Greenbrier airport, 10
miles away, has a 7,000-foot runway, long enough to land a military
transport.
</P>
<P>
   This history is what Dolan, Pollak is counting on to help it
sell 100 lots a year, or about $300 million over five years, Pollak
said. A fourth golf course, a lodge and stables are to be built for
the sole use of the homeowners, Pollak said, but they will also be
able to use the Greenbrier's existing golf courses, tennis courts,
stables, indoor and outdoor pools, spa and Land Rover driving
course.
</P>
<P>
   The architectural plans for the homes' exteriors must be
approved by the developers, who, unlike many resort developers, do
not plan to turn over the operation to the homeowners once the
project is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The homes will be spread out over the property, and the goal is
to make them as unobtrusive as possible, Pollak said. Kleisner, the
Greenbrier's president, said the target market would be wealthy
families who enjoy the outdoors but also want to preserve the land.
</P>
<P>
   The partners hope to expand the sporting club idea to other
historic sites but say their standards will limit the choices.
``We've turned down opportunities,'' Schram said. ``Some things
won't work, and some things won't fit. It has to be a very special
place, one of historic significance.''

THE DOCTOR IS IN, AND SO IS THE TARANTULA 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Raise your hand if you want to get really close to a
big hairy tarantula, five giant cockroaches or a rat with a 10-inch
tail. Take one step forward if bugs and vermin give you sweaty
palms, weak knees and shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harvey Baker, a professor of psychology at Queens College,
who himself suffers from a mild cockroach anxiety, is struggling to
find enough highly phobic subjects willing to stare down the stars
of their worst nightmares in the name of science.
</P>
<P>
   If he could just get 100 volunteers, Baker said, he could
determine whether his rather unusual treatment for the intense fear
of rodents and insects _ which draws on self-esteem building,
psychotherapy and the principle of acupuncture _ holds up as a
genuine cure. But since he began seeking subjects in February, he
has come up with just six people.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be difficult to find New Yorkers who are afraid of
the urban critters that Baker keeps in glass boxes in his
laboratory on the college's campus in Flushing. This is a city that
has so many rats that exterminating them commands an annual budget
of $13.5 million, and where the price of living in a
rent-stabilized apartment is often rooming with a cockroach _ or
10.
</P>
<P>
   But Baker seeks the truly phobic for his experiment, which he
believes is the first of its kind in the United States. He needs
the people who can't move for hours after they see a spider on
their window sill or have to flee their apartment for weeks when a
rat crawls from behind the refrigerator. He has posted fliers all
over the campus urging students to sign up for the study and noting
that the treatment might help.
</P>
<P>
   But Baker is fully in touch with the feelings behind the low
turnout, and he said he was willing to wait for subjects. At the
rate he has been going lately _ one volunteer every other week _ he
will need an extra 188 weeks of research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people with specific phobias do not seek treatment,'' he
said. ``Instead, they rearrange their lives to avoid the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing helps, so they live with it,'' he added, speaking the
other day in the cluttered laboratory he shares with five
Madagascar hissing cockroaches, also known as water bugs, and a
Chilean rose-haired tarantula named Matilda. (The rat, Albert, is a
hooded rat, a ``friendlier'' species than the typical city rat. It
is kept at another spot in the science building and taken to the
lab for experiments, Baker said.)
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who has researched and taught in the Queens College
psychology department since 1974, said 6.1 percent of Americans _
almost 17 million people _ had a potentially debilitating phobia
about small animals, including rats, snakes, spiders and
cockroaches.
</P>
<P>
   With some encouragement from a friend who attends Queens
College, Baker's sixth subject, Joe Orsi, decided to tackle his
spider phobia and volunteered for a 90-minute session the other day
with Baker and the tarantula.
</P>
<P>
   Orsi, 24, who lives in Queens, works for a restaurant supply
company in Manhattan. He often sees dead spiders in his company's
basement, he said. It makes him panic.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's assistant, Michelle Guttman, a graduate student,
interviewed Orsi about his phobia for 15 minutes. Then she slowly
guided him into another room, where the tarantula was waiting. She
scored his level of fear during the approach.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Orsi opened the door to the other room, the
heart-rate monitor clipped to his ear lobe showed that his pulse
was racing. By the time he laid his eyes on Matilda, his pulse had
shot up 20 beats per minute. He could not take the final step of
what is known as the ``feared-animal approach task,'' in which he
was asked to touch the part of the glass cage closest to the
tarantula.
</P>
<P>
   Orsi returned to his seat to fill out a spider phobia
questionnaire about his experience and checked ``yes'' to all nine
symptoms of the phobia, from ``lump in throat,'' to ``hands feel
cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a 45-minute treatment, known as the Emotional Freedom
Technique. Baker said he learned about it at a conference a year
ago and decided to apply it to the rat, spider and cockroach
phobias.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the silly business,'' Baker said as he began the
treatment. Then he asked Orsi to tap various parts of his body
while saying, ``fear of spiders,'' to hum, count aloud and say
things like ``I forgive myself for anything I might have done to
cause my fear of spiders.'' The tapping, drawn from acupuncture, is
aimed at pressure points that, when struck, are supposed to release
negative energy from the body, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Orsi seemed to have a lot of negative energy toward Matilda.
</P>
<P>
   When the session was over, Orsi went through a second interview,
and again approached the tarantula. This time, his pulse was 15
beats slower than when he first looked at the spider, and he took
the final step, touching the glass near the tarantula, and
lingering for a moment to look at the spider.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of Baker's six subjects have undergone the full
treatment, because some are randomly placed in a control group, but
all three have shown signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Baker acknowledged that it might be years before he could
draw any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's something to it,'' he said. ``For the first 80
years they used aspirin, no one knew why it worked. Something can
work without our knowing why.''

ISRAEL MAY LOSE OUTSIDER STATUS AT U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After decades of exclusion from all regional groups in the
United Nations, Israel has been accepted on a temporary basis by
the Western Europeans, ending its virtual disenfranchisement in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's ambassador to the United Nations called the long-sought
invitation, issued on Friday, a turning point in his country's
relations with the organization, where a voting bloc of Arab and
Third World nations has perennially attacked and isolated the
Israelis in the General Assembly and other bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Only two nations, Israel and Estonia, have never belonged to one
of the regional groups, formed 40 years ago to decide on candidates
for many council and committee positions at the United Nations and
its agencies and programs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Estonia chose not to join the Eastern European group, holding
out for membership in the Western European caucus, which also
includes Australia, New Zealand, Canada and sometimes the United
States. But Israel has been barred by Arab and other opposition
from the Asian group, which covers all nations from the eastern
shores of the Mediterranean to the Pacific. Membership in the Asian
group is still Israel's goal, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been lobbying hard over the last year to
get Israel into the Western Europe group. The decision was bumped
from one level to another in the 15-member European Union for
months, before the Netherlands, which now holds the rotating
chairmanship of the group at the United Nations, pressed for
closure.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, U.S. diplomats said, the Dutch ambassador to the
United Nations, Peter van Walsum, circulated a letter to the
group's members saying that if there were no objections raised by
Friday, Israel would be invited to join the group, under certain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   One is that temporary membership will be extended initially for
only four years, after which Israel's relationship with the group
would be reviewed. Israel would also have to forgo seeking elected
positions for two years.U.S. officials say intense competition for
contested posts was a major factor in keeping Israel out of the
Western European group.
</P>
<P>
   Other positions in the U.N. system will be closed to Israel for
longer periods because of past agreements. Israel must formally
accept the limited invitation.
</P>
<P>
   There are five regional groups at the United Nations _ Western
Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Western Hemisphere,
which covers Latin America and the Caribbean.

EXCERPTS FROM GORE SPEECH ON ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GORE-WESTPOINT) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Eds: Following are excerpts from the prepared text of a speech
about national security that Vice President Al Gore delivered
Saturday at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.)
</P>
<P>
   We have made dramatic progress in reducing the number of nuclear
weapons. In the last decade, the United States and the countries of
the former Soviet Union together have taken about eight to nine
thousand strategic nuclear weapons out of commission.
</P>
<P>
   We need to continue on a course of deeper reductions. But it is
critical that we have the right approach in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   We are urging the Russians to tighten cooperation with us to
protect nuclear weapons materials and stop the transfer of
ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technologies to rogue states.
It is these states that represent the emerging threat to our
country.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been working on the technology for a
national missile defense system designed to protect all 50 states
from a limited attack at the hands of a rogue state. We believe,
however, that it is essential to do this in a way that does not
destroy the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The ABM Treaty is the
cornerstone of strategic stability in our relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It prevents either the Russians or ourselves from deploying
defenses powerful enough _ assuming anyone can solve the
engineering problems _ to neutralize the deterrent of either side.
The Russians have made clear that their response to a powerful U.S.
defensive system would be to halt arms control and increase the
numbers of their offensive nuclear weapons. Thus, the ABM Treaty is
a prerequisite for the deeper reductions in nuclear arms that we
are seeking in START III, which is under discussion with the
Russians even as we speak.
</P>
<P>
   We and the Russians agreed in Helsinki in 1997 that Start III
would involve reductions to totals in the range of 2,000 to 2,500
weapons. That is a cut of up to 1,000 weapons from Start II levels.
Such reductions are possible only through careful negotiation. ...
</P>
<P>
   An approach that combines serious unilateral reductions with an
attempt to build a massive defensive system will create
instability, and thus undermine our security. Nuclear unilateralism
will hinder, rather than help, arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Strategic stability can never be a one-way street. It either
exists for both the United States and Russia, or neither.
Reductions alone do not guarantee stability. It is how reductions
are made and how they interact with defensive systems that makes
the difference. That is why arms control and strategic
modernization have to be built upon planned and negotiated
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The national missile defense system that the president will
review this summer is intended to meet threats from proliferant
states like North Korea while preserving strategic stability. It
can co-exist with the ABM Treaty, if that treaty is adjusted. It
can be compatible with further arms reductions.

 &HT;    HIS CONFIDENCE (RE-)BOLSTERED, TOP MEXICAN PRESIDENTIAL
CHALLENGER RETAKES THE OFFENSIVE
 &HT;    (900&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With Photo.

<P>
   VERACRUZ, Mexico _ He's back.
</P>
<P>
   With characteristic brash confidence, Mexican presidential
challenger Vicente Fox Quesada emerged Saturday from the previous
night's three-way debate glowing with triumph and claiming that he
was once again on the road to an historic victory.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans are preparing for the most competitive presidential
election ever in this country, whose presidency has been controlled
by one political party for more than seven decades. The tall, rangy
57-year-old top opposition challenger is coming off of a week
embarrassing negative publicity that threatened to set his campaign
back.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and some quick independent polls indicated he may
have recovered much of his momentum during the Friday debate. After
being accused in much of the media of acting childish and stubborn
during televised negotiations over a debate with his rivals, Fox on
Friday admitted to being bull-headed.
</P>
<P>
   But he converted his blunder into something positive by telling
Mexicans that ``firm character'' is what Mexico needs to change a
country with an entrenched political monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   With five weeks to go before the July 2 election, Fox was met on
the streets here Saturday morning by throngs of supporters who were
cursing Mexico's ruling party and waving foam rubber hands with
Fox's V-for-victory sign. One supporter passed Fox a leaflet
through his bus window that said: ``If Fox is stubborn, I'm even
more so.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, candidate of Mexico's conservative National Action Party,
or PAN, has been criticized by some rivals for being arrogant. The
rancher and former Coca-Cola executive is unapologetic about his
behavior, which he says has been key to pushing him into a
neck-in-neck race against Francisco Labastida Ochoa, candidate of
Mexico's ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``A candidate who goes out on the street and acts like a loser
might as well stay at home,'' a relaxed, grinning Fox said in an
interview with the Cox News Service as he flew here Saturday
morning on his private jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I transmit this conviction to the Mexican people every day,
and they return it to me,'' Fox said. ``This is what produces
'Foxmania.'''
</P>
<P>
   This oil-rich region on the Gulf Coast has long been considered
a PRI stronghold. Fox will need to make inroads in enemy territory
like this to achieve a victory he says is just a few percentage
points away. Veracruz has the third greatest number of voters of
any state in Mexico and Fox claims he is now dead even here with
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see he's a man who has the guts to do what he says
he'll do,'' said Nyla Desgrennes, 18, a high school student who
will vote for the first time. ``All the students at school are with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox was also met by enthused crowds of working-class victims who
have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in a national bank
scandal that rocked Veracruz and other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to see (Mexican President Ernesto) Zedillo to
complain and all they did was send police out to block us,'' said
housewife Yolanda Arrevalo. ``We think Fox will listen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   All three candidates in Friday night's debate _ Fox, Labastida
and leftist candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano_ claimed
victory after the event. They sparred over Byzantine economic
policies and proposals. But both Fox and Cardenas lashed out at
Labastida, heaping blame in blunt language on the PRI for running a
country riddled with corruption and where half the population lives
in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Mexico City newspaper Reforma published an instant
telephone survey of 1,611 people nationwide that found that Fox was
considered the winner of the debate by 47 percent of those who
witnessed it. Only 37 percent of those polled had seen the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper pointed out that those surveyed were select urban
residents with an above-average education and enough income to own
a phone. But urban voters _ which comprise 60 percent of Mexico's
voters _ are the core of Fox's support and he appeared bolstered by
the findings.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   With five weeks to go before the election, Fox says he must
especially cut into votes that might go to Cardenas, a former PRI
politician who bolted to start his own leftist Democratic
Revolution Party, or PRD, 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Cardenas, who lacks the charismatic speaking style
of Fox, performed better than ever before in Friday's debate. But
even though Fox praised Cardenas at one point during the debate for
his ferocious attacks on Labastida, on Saturday he expressed no
affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's jealous,'' Fox said of Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I need the votes of the PRD, but I don't need
Cardenas.''
</P>
<P>
   For months _ even though the two men haven't spoken at length
for more than a year _ Fox has been publicly urging Cardenas to
join his campaign. He says polls are indicating that only Fox has a
chance of beating the PRI and he is promising to build a
pluralistic government.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago it seemed that Cardenas would become Mexico's
first opposition president. He won the race for Mexico City mayor
and enjoyed a reputation for being a fighter for more democracy and
justice for the poor. In 1988, Cardenas ran unsuccessfully for
president in an election that many Mexicans believe was stolen by
the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas is also the son of Mexico's most beloved president,
Lazaro Cardenas, a PRI politician who nationalized Mexico's oil
industry and earned affection for helping peasants with credit,
public works and land grants.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas ``can't accept the death of his father's PRI,'' Fox
said, referring to the PRI's decision to reduce subsidies to the
poor in recent years and adopt less nationalistic economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also said Cardenas had an ``obsession for power'' that
stemmed from his desire to follow in his father's footsteps and
become president.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also suggested that Cardenas has made a trade off with the
PRI. His theory is that Cardenas won't object to fraud in the
presidential election as long as the PRI doesn't try to prevent the
PRD's candidate for Mexico City mayor from winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``His heart still beats for the PRI,'' Fox said of Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, however, many analysts seemed to think that
Cardenas' trashing of the PRI was so strong it debunked Fox's claim
that Cardenas was in cahoots with the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Fox said his goal is to win the presidency with at least 51
percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he said, ``we should have a solid 46 percentage
points. I lack five. Those five are hard to take away from the PRI
because those are hard-core voters. I don't have any choice but to
fight for the undecided.''
</P>
<P>
   Sketching out calculations on a newspaper, Fox said he believes
about 15 percent of voters are undecided. Fox claims that when all
significant polls are considered, he leads Labastida 42.5 percent
to 39.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks that remain, he'll need to get to more poor voters
and PRD sympathizers in urban and rural areas. Fox acknowledges he
lags behind Labastida in rural provinces, where 30 percent of
voters live and the PRI get-out-the-vote machine is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's campaign has targeted the poorest, and what he believes
are the most corrupt voting districts in the country to send in
campaign workers and prevent voter fraud or vote buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dismantling the PRI machine,'' he said, referring to
the ruling party's alleged history of doling out gifts of money,
food or other supplies to lure the poorest voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense of the vote in the country is going to be very
important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acting sure of victory, Fox is already challenging President
Zedillo to make sure Mexico avoids a crisis if he becomes the first
non-PRI president since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will invite Zedillo to see that the transition will be
peaceful,'' Fox said. ``Zedillo, on July 3, becomes the key person
in this transition. He has to avoid any reaction by the hard-core
PRI supporters. He has to maintain order and peace.''

 &HT;    Witnesses gave only weak support to case against NFL star
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The three-day holiday weekend came in the nick of time
for Fulton County prosecutors, who are reeling from a turbulent
week of testimony in their murder case against NFL star Ray Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has been marred by flip-flopping witnesses,
confused witnesses, one who says he was racially slurred by
investigators and another who's a professional liar.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement as the trial began last week, Fulton
County District Attorney Paul Howard made several promises to the
jury _ and on several he's fallen short: The two witnesses who
originally said they saw Lewis strike a victim changed their
stories. And one of them _ the driver of the rented limo in which
Lewis and co-defendants Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting left
the crime scene _ didn't testify, as expected, that he heard Oakley
and Sweeting admit to the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the big question is, can the state salvage its case?''
said Alan Baverman, an Atlanta defense attorney who is providing
commentary on the case for ESPN. ``It's a bizarre trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Baverman might be understating it. On Friday, the prosecution's
case against Lewis featured a convicted con artist, Chester
Anderson, who said he has gone by seven names and lives to scheme
``to get something for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb County District Attorney J. Tom Morgan, who like many in
the legal community has been closely watching the case, said
Anderson is a bad witness because he's a ``new-found witness and
that's always suspect'' and because ``jurors don't like snitches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the worst kind of record; fraud and deception (charges)
go straight to his credibility,'' said Morgan. ``But Paul Howard
can only take witnesses as he finds them.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said that, as a prosecutor, ``you lead off with your best
witnesses.'' If so, Howard's team has a tough week ahead. ``There's
been four days of testimony and (Howard) has not planted guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Harvey, an Atlanta defense attorney who has commented on
the case for WXIA, said Howard needs to ``consider this week a
wash'' and try to regain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go back and try to get centered,'' he said. ``They should
go back and bring in the medical examiner. That should have a
sobering effect on the jury. It tells them what we're doing here
concerns the loss of life of two young men. That might have a
chilling effect on the havoc the defense has wreaked.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors have repeatedly shown photos of the
blood-stained Buckhead crime scene where Jacinth Baker, 21, and
Richard Lollar, 24, were stabbed to death after a night of
post-Super Bowl partying.
</P>
<P>
   And the prosecutors have been able to introduce evidence that
Oakely, and a lesser extent, Sweeting, attacked the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said he will try to finish his case by the end of the
week. He will probably call to the witness stand limo
passengerJessica Robertson, police investigators and some of the
victims' family members. Also, prosecutors are considering an
immunity deal in exchange for the testimony of another limo
passenger, Carlos Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the killings, Stafford and Robertson allegedly
helped dispose of a bag of items in a dumpster, a witness in the
trial has testified. Prosecutors are expected to contend that the
two threw away the suit Lewis wore the night of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   If they cut a deal with Stafford, prosecutors would finally get
testimony from a male limo passenger. But during jury selection,
Lewis defense attorney Don Samuel said he would be dumbfounded if
the state gave Stafford immunity because the defense teams contend
he was a participant in the deadly melee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state gives him a deal, I'll exit the courthouse
through that window,'' said Samuel, pointing to the window outside
the fourth-floor courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   All of the attorneys interviewed said Howard should have
augmented his case by charging Lewis with lesser crimes like making
false statements to police, hampering an investigation and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   But Keisha Bottoms, who has both defended and prosecuted cases,
said that window is closed. ``They can't do it now, it's too
late,'' she said.

PLAYER GOING TO SPAIN TO TRY TO CARVE ROUTE TO NBA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW R. TRIPALDI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darren Phillip has a goal: two years after his graduation from
Fairfield University in Connecticut this spring, the 6-foot-7-inch
power forward wants to be playing in the NBA. And like the
intelligent, persistent and resourceful fellow he is, Darren
Phillip has a plan to put firm foundations under his lofty
ambition. In fact, he has mapped out the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, two days before receiving his degree in
communications on commencement day at Fairfield, Phillip signed a
two-year contract with Malaga in the Spanish basketball league.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to play in the NBA sometime in the next two
years,'' said Phillip, the NCAA Division I leader in rebounding
last season with 14 a game. ``If I don't hook on with a team, this
opportunity gives me something to fall back on.''
</P>
<P>
   The chance to sharpen his skills overseas was too good for
Phillip to pass up, especially when weighed against the possibility
of starting his professional career as a bench warmer at home.
Phillip said he turned down more lucrative offers from teams in
Italy and Greece because he felt Malaga, an upper-echelon team in
the Spanish league, gave him the best opportunity to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will get to play a lot of minutes, which will give me a lot
of experience,'' said Phillip, who hopes to establish a more
consistent 15-foot jump shot in the more offense-orientated style
of play in Europe. ``I played at power forward in college, but I'll
probably wind up at small forward at the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   At Fairfield, appearing in 27 games this past season, Phillip
was named to the All-Metro Athletic Athletic Conference second
team. In addition to his strong work on the boards, Phillip
averaged 16 points, shooting 56 percent from the field. He led the
nation with 24 double-doubles, including 19 straight to end the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Fairfield finished the season with a 13-14 overall record, but
was 11-7 in the MAAC, good for third place. The Stags could not
match the success they attained during Phillip's freshman season,
when Fairfield qualified for the NCAA tournament, losing to North
Carolina in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we lost in the semis of the MAAC tournament to a
great Iona team,'' Phillip said. ``We played well, but we came up
short. These things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those things happened when Phillip was being recruited
out of South Shore High School in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn.
As a senior, he averaged 22.5 points and 14.2 rebounds, but the
more elite college basketball schools overlooked him. Fairfield did
not. Phillip credits Stags coach Tim O'Toole with his development
over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an extension of my parents,'' Phillip said of O'Toole.
``He taught us about basketball and life experiences and how to be
classy on and off the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Phillip moves on, from Canarsie and Connecticut, to Spain.
He will report with the rest of the Malaga players on Sept. 11. The
organization will provide him with the necessities: a residence, a
car, and per diem expenses. But he will be without the Brooklyn
support system that has sustained him through his four years at
Fairfield. His parents, Frederick and Margurite, and his brothers,
Ryan and Douglas, often made the one-hour trip to Fairfield to
watch him play. Now, they will be an ocean away. Phillip has
accepted that distance as a necessary part of his career plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Fairfield, I would be away from home for nine
months, so I am used to living by myself and being on my own,''
Phillip said. ``I'm trying to take things one step at a time, so
I'm not looking far into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillip points out that he has played in front of international
audiences before. In July 1998, he was a member of a MAAC all-star
team that toured Japan, playing the Japanese national team in a
series of exhibition games across the country. And, he added, he
was born in London; his family moved to the United States when he
was 3 years old. He still has several aunts, uncles and cousins
there and has visited them on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip also intends to get in touch with former NBA and NCAA
players currently playing in Spain, including Harper Williams, who
played at UMass-Amherst from 1989-1993 and Ken Cavanaugh, who
played at Manhattan from 1995-99.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of the plan. As Phillip said, he hopes to be back
home in two years. ``But if the only way I could get into the NBA
was to stay in Europe for six years,'' he said, ``then that's what
I'll do.'' &QL;

JETER'S IN THE LINEUP AS YANKEES BEAT UP ON RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees desperately needed Derek Jeter
back in their lineup, to restore potency in their offensive attack
and confidence for their minds. But before returning to shortstop
Saturday, Jeter rejected the notion that the Yankees were built
around him. They are the type of team, he said, that wins with
contributions from all corners of their roster.
</P>
<P>
   And they defeated the Boston Red Sox, 8-3, with a collective
effort. It was pot luck for 55,671 at Yankee Stadium: Jason
Grimsley, an emergency starter in place of Orlando Hernandez,
pitched in five solid innings, Mike Stanton added three innings.
Four different Yankees hit home runs, and in his first action since
May 11, Jeter had three hits and a stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   With the teams tied once more at the top of the American League
East with identical records of 27 victories and 18 losses, the
Yankees' Roger Clemens will pitch against Pedro Martinez Sunday
night in the final game of the series. Toronto beat Martinez last
Tuesday; the Red Sox right-hander has not lost back-to-back starts
since September 1998, when he lost three straight games, twice to
the Yankees in that streak.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was supposed to pitch this game for the Yankees, but
he felt spasms high in his back and had to stop, taking his hat off
and slumping against a bench in the bullpen disconsolately.
Grimsley hurriedly prepared to pitch in his place, before shutting
out the Red Sox in the first and second innings.
</P>
<P>
   In his relief role, Grimsley is accustomed to pitching about two
innings at a time, and he got into trouble in the third inning.
John Valentin pulled a home run down the left-field line leading
off _ the prominent response and presence of Red Sox fans was
striking in Yankee Stadium _ and Jason Varitek slapped a single to
left. Jeff Frye pulled a grounder down the third-base line, past
the base, the ball caroming off the front of the stands and into
short left field; on Frye's double, the Red Sox had second and
third and one out.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley lost his grip on a fastball and released the ball
perhaps 15 feet wide of the catcher Jorge Posada, allowing one run
to score, and Trot Nixon turned and bunted perfectly up the first
base line, his squeeze play surprising the Yankees and enabling
Frye to cross the plate. Grimsley hit Brian Daubach with a fastball
and walked Nomar Garciaparra, and with the Yankees trailing by 3-0,
it seemed as if they were unraveling in this series. Brian Rose
retired the first two batters in the bottom of the third _ before
Boston's strong adherence to an old-school baseball practice
probably helped to jump-start the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Rose drilled Ledee in the right leg with a pitch, and as Ledee
jogged to first, he probably wondered if this had been in
retaliation for Grimsley having knocked down Daubach in the first
inning and hitting him in the third.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Yankees came alive: Jeter singled, and Paul O'Neill
smashed a line drive through the middle to score Ledee. If, in
fact, Rose did plunk Ledee on purpose, then he violated another
traditional baseball credo _ do not wake the dead, do not give them
any reason to think they can come back.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did pick their way back into the game, one home run
at a time. Shane Spencer smacked a ball just inside the left field
foul pole in the fourth, his eighth home run. Ledee launched a shot
deep into the right field stands in the fifth, his third home run
of the season, tying the game at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   John Wasdin relieved for the Red Sox in the bottom of the sixth
inning, and the Yankees attacked. Posada bashed a lead-off homer,
giving the Yankees a 4-3 lead; Posada has 10 this season, after
hitting 12 all of last season. There were two out when Clay
Bellinger singled and stole a base, the third of the game for the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee drew a walk. Jeter _ who earlier in the game had snapped
an 0-for-14 streak that began before he was placed on the disabled
list _ dropped a single into right field, and Bellinger crossed the
plate. The left-hander Tim Young was summoned to pitch to O'Neill,
who was handled well last year by Boston's left-handed relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. O'Neill swung, made loud contact and ran toward
first, something he does when he hits the ball very well. It landed
in the lower deck in right field, his sixth homer of the season
counting for three runs. The Yankees had an 8-3 lead and were in
control of this game, and when O'Neill jogged to play his position
in the top of the seventh, fans in the bleachers _ quite dry on a
day of mixed clouds and sunshine _ stood and cheered him.

DESPITE CRIMES, NEW YORKERS GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (CORRECTS spelling of ``Reppetto'' in 11th and 12th grafs)  
 By RANDY KENNEDY and ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In recent months, even a statistician could be
forgiven for feeling as if the bad old New York crime days weren't
so far away after all: Seven Wendy's employees herded into a
walk-in refrigerator in Queens and gunned down mercilessly, shot in
the head. Nine livery-cab drivers killed in four months. Mother
robbed in a subway by a gunman holding a pistol to a toddler's
head. Woman pushed into an oncoming train. Woman attacked with a
brick on Midtown street.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was exactly these kinds of
violent crimes that made the city seem like a dark, cartoonish
Gotham _ a town of mayhem completely beyond the control of the
police. The hallmarks of those days have not faded from memory _
the random attacks, the bystanders caught in crossfire, the gunmen
taking money from victims and killing them anyway, gratuitously,
almost for sport.
</P>
<P>
   So one might expect that the recent headlines _ especially when
combined with a surge in the murder rate, the first jump in a major
crime category in eight years _ would be dredging up some old
feelings. Feelings, maybe, that the reliable downward march of
crime, like the reliable upward march of the stock market, cannot
last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Feelings like the ones voiced by Mohammed T. Abboud, a clerk at
a Harlem bodega, who remembers the jittery days when he kept a ice
pick in the cash register. ``There is nothing inside but money
now,'' he said. ``But you never know. There may come a time to put
it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in dozens of interviews across the city, it turned out to
be difficult to catch many people _ especially affluent people _ in
the act of worrying about the return of crime. As New Yorkers do,
most start out conversations by saying reflexively that, of course,
``you have to keep your antennas up,'' as one Bronx resident put
it. But after a few minutes, it becomes apparent that they are much
more preoccupied with a long list of more prosaic issues that seem
to affect their lives more directly than gnawing fears of crime:
their children's education, their sky-high rents, street-side
parking, even getting a seat on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises some questions: Why does it seem that high-profile
crimes do not resonate in the city the way they used to? Wasn't
there a time when five people slain in a fast-food restaurant would
cause people to think twice before venturing from home? A time when
nine related killings, five of them in one month, would have been
seen as something of a crime wave?
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and police officials certainly worry
about New Yorkers seeing it that way. When several hundred officers
were assigned last month to protect independent taxi drivers, one
official explained that the police were under pressure from City
Hall to safeguard the perception, not just the reality, that crime
is down.
</P>
<P>
   But if the views of Sandra Frierson, 55, a painter and sculptor,
are in any way reflective of the mood of New York, City Hall does
not have much to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Frierson lives in Brooklyn, and has rented apartments in every
borough except for Staten Island. She remembers the days when she
was so unnerved by the city's sense of imminent danger that she
often had her husband walk her to the store.
</P>
<P>
   Although she said that the killings in Flushing, Queens, were
``despicable'' and proved ``how sick we've all become,'' she went
on to make this admission: ``As bad as I feel for the people who
were killed, I never think something like that could happen to me
these days. It's like it's outside the realm of my world.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, a
police watchdog group, said he thought those feelings were
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think New Yorkers have certainly become more concerned about
crime over the last few weeks as these high-profile crimes have
been happening,'' Reppetto said. ``I don't think that they are
necessarily more fearful about crime because it hasn't touched them
like it once did, unless you're a livery-cab driver or part of
another group that's been affected.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems striking is that this localized sense of fear has
apparently not percolated through the city at large.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, experts say, is simply a matter of context.
Crime remains at 30-year lows in New York, and despite the rise in
homicides, violent crime overall was down 7.5 percent during the
first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just that the volume of crime is much lower, they
say. It is also that the kinds of violent crime that were peaking a
decade ago, mostly associated with the crack trade, seemed more
random and thus more threatening. Both periods were marked by high
numbers of livery-cab shootings, but it was other kinds of
shootings back then _ drive-bys, gunfights on street corners and in
playgrounds _ that created the real fear and amplified the effects
of livery shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was more randomness,'' said Jeffrey Fagan, director of
the Center for Violence Research and Prevention at Columbia
University. ``Two kids bump into each other in the subway station
or the street and just shoot each other, and that's a crime that
could affect anyone. Or at least there was a subjectively plausible
possibility that it might affect any citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, while there were about 13 percent more killings in
the city from January through March, the police say that most of
those homicides occurred indoors and involved people who knew one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that the lack of widespread anxiety is a kind
of flip side of the ``broken windows'' theory popularized by James
Q. Wilson, a professor emeritus at the University of California in
Los Angeles, and George Kellingof Rutgers University in a 1982
article in The Atlantic Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   The theory, a big influence on the style of policing that
evolved under Giuliani, holds in part that crime and low-level
civic disorder are closely linked. A fear of crime can sometimes
actually just be anxiety caused by a ``sense that the street is
disorderly, a source of distasteful, worrisome encounters,'' as the
article stated it.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps now, with the police still vigorously pursuing
quality-of-life crimes and low-level criminals, a perception of
greater orderliness has contributed to a more unassailable feeling
of general security and manageability, a feeling that could
withstand even a sizable jump in the crime rate before it eroded.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in some neighborhoods, the crime rate _ or, at least
the fear of crime _ never really eroded at all.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Lawrence spoke of those feelings while washing his
10-year-old Buick sedan on the streets of East New York, Brooklyn.
Lawrence, 47, worked as a cable television installer until 10
months ago when he lost his left eye in a scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledged that crime had dropped in his
neighborhood, he insisted that there were still problems.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the recent crimes in the headlines then? Did they
augur a return to the chaos of the past?
</P>
<P>
   ``Return to what?'' Lawrence asked. ``We ain't never left
nothing behind to return to.''

MIHM TOPS NBA'S LIST OF SLIM DRAFT PICKINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who follow the NBA Draft claim this year's class is the
weakest in years, but don't tell that to New Jersey Nets owner
Lewis Katz.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who won last week's NBA Draft Lottery, appear poised
to select Texas center Chris Mihm on June 28, when the NBA will
conduct its draft in Minneapolis. Katz hopes the 7-foot, 250-pound
Mihm can help the Nets reverse their disappointing 31-51 record
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly a big man is a priority, an inside presence,'' Katz
said. ``We must have lost 30 or 40 games in the last two minutes
due to the lack of second shots, or getting defensive rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz knows the No. 1 pick could have a domino effect within his
organization. The Nets had a plethora of injuries to key players,
including former All-Star center Jayson Williams, and also must
hire a head coach and vice president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen what happened in the past,'' Katz said. ``\RTim\S
Duncan came out, and suddenly there was a new team in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orlando changed quickly when they had the first \Rand got
Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway\S. This could be a real boost
in the arm to get us where we need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vancouver Grizzlies are expected to select Cincinnati power
forward Kenyon Martin with the second pick. Martin played high
school basketball at Dallas Bryan Adams.
</P>
<P>
   With the third pick, the Los Angeles Clippers probably will take
Louisiana State forward Stromile Swift, who can start after Maurice
Taylor leaves via free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very satisfied with our position at No. 3, because we
know that we'll get a very good player,'' said Elgin Baylor, the
Clippers' vice president of basketball operations. ``We'll get a
player \Rwho\S will come in and make a good contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have the 12th pick in the draft, and they will be
searching for someone who has a passion for rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get bigger, that's for sure,'' said Mavericks
general manager Don Nelson. ``We need to rebound better; we have to
solve those issues. Size and rebounding.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Dirk Nowitzki's former German teammates _ 6-11 forward
Olumide Oyedeji _ has already worked out for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Oyedeji hails from Nigeria, and is another find by Amadou Gallo
Fall, who coordinates the Mavericks' international scouting
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Other players the Mavericks are looking at include Michigan
State swingman Morris Peterson, Syracuse power forward Etan Thomas
and UCLA center Jerome Moiso, who enters the draft after his
sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since no one is all that thrilled about paying guaranteed
money to a first-round pick in this year's draft, the Mavericks are
not against trading down for a lower pick or moving out of the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go down the board and it looks like there's a great
reason to keep it, we'll keep it,'' Mavericks owner Mark Cuban
said. ``If someone makes us a better offer, we'll trade it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a way that we can trade up because there's somebody
we want, that's the kind of thing that Nellie and I will sit and go
through _ and all of the coaches _ and make decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Front-office decisions are especially key during a weak draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This draft, I don't think they have a dominant player that's
coming out that's just going to turn the franchise around,'' Baylor
said. ``But I think they have players that can be productive and
who can come in here and help your team.''

   SHOOT-MAIN _ LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ A Lake Worth Middle School
seventh-grader shot and killed his popular English teacher during
the last period of the last day of school, police said. Honor roll
student Nathaniel Brazill, 13, who had been sent home earlier
Friday for his part in a water balloon fight, returned to campus
with a .25 caliber handgun in his pocket around 3:30 p.m. Brazill
shot Barry Grunow, 35, once in the face after the teacher refused

the U.S. Senate nearly voted to cut off funds to the operation _
effectively forcing their withdrawal unless Congress authorized an

   TURKEY-HUNTING _ ATLANTA _ ``Gobble,'' he said. Silence. Far
away, a crow cawed. ``Gobblegobblegobble,'' he continued,
passionately, flogging a fallen tree trunk with his hat to make a
sound like the beating of large wings. Still no reply. Finally Doug
Benefield got to his feet, shaking his head in disgust. ``He's a
wise old bird,'' Benefield said. ``He's gone.'' Benefield is a
master of the art of talking to turkeys, but this time he was
unable to persuade an old tom to venture across the sights of his
shotgun. It tended to prove that the suburban South Fulton County
turkey is just as wily as his country cousin. (Warner, Atlanta

played without injured center Patrick Ewing and also overcame the

prospective running mate for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Ridge, a
popular Republican leaving the Statehouse after signing a recent $1
billion tax cut, set a Republican record for the heavily Democratic
state of Pennsylvania with a 780,000-vote victory margin in his
1998 re-election. A Bush-Ridge ticket might well deliver this
critical battleground, the fifth-largest state in electoral votes,

   (NYT7) BENNINGTON, Vt. -- May 27, 2000 -- BENNINGTON-DISPUTE-2

labeled a dictatorial figure who crushes any criticism at the
college. Coleman says she is raising academic standards. ``What
people knew about Bennington was that it's the most expensive
college,'' says Coleman. But, she says, that was ``the only thing''
they knew. The past academic year has been marked by the dismissal
of four faculty members seen by their supporters as critics of the
administration and by Coleman as having fallen short in their
professional qualifications and responsibilities. (Keith Meyers/The

   (NYT5) EMBALAM, India -- May 27, 2000 -- INDIA-ONLINE -- At a

experiments. In the fishing village of Veerampattinam, children
play with with a computer, which some call a ``magic box.'' There
are serious questions about whether countries like India, weighed
down by high rates of illiteracy and illness, should spend heavily
on what most would consider a luxury. Still, others say a
well-placed computer, like a communal well or an irrigation pump,
may become another tool for development. (Celia W. Dugger/The New

Christine Lincoln's journey to Washington College, a small liberal

perilous. Lincoln, 34, with her son, Takii, at Washington College,
fought a long battle with drug addiction and depression, only to be
reborn in college as a short story writer. Now a graduate, Lincoln
says ``the possibilities for my life are endless.'' This fall,
Lincoln intends to begin her own adventure, moving to South Africa,
where she will study African literature. (Marty Katz/The New York

<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles County is so far behind in decentralizing its
sprawling health care system that waits at the San Fernando
Valley's only public hospital still can stretch for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to shift unnecessary hospital care to less costly
neighborhood clinics have not saved as much money as the federal
government demanded five years ago in exchange for bailing out the
nearly bankrupt health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out for Los Angeles County, which is urgently
seeking a renewal of a Medicaid waiver that would preserve health
care for thousands of poor people.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the county Board of Supervisors is scheduled to
consider freezing new hiring across the Department of Health
Services in a desperate effort to prepare for looming financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the board declared an impasse in negotiations with
state and federal officials over renewal of a critical element of
its $2.7 billion health care budget, the $1 billion federal
Medicaid waiver that kept the system afloat but expires June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors also froze payments to the 137 private health
clinics with county contracts if no agreement is reached by June
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have met certain goals, but it's an entrenched old system
that won't turn around on a dime,'' Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said
last week. ``I don't think we've done enough. The reason to extend
the waiver is to create a modern 21st century health care system
that serves the needs of today's population.''
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials canceled the last two meetings with
county officials and none is scheduled. The county has offered to
spend $60 million of its tobacco settlement, but the state has been
reluctant to contribute any of its $12.3 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Efforts to get the parties to the table for meaningful,
decision-making discussions have thus far proved unsuccessful,''
Yaroslavsky said. ``Frankly, we don't know what the holdup is.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last week to U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala, U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer and
Dianne Feinstein said the waiver is critical for the county to
``avoid service reductions and layoffs ranging from 1,500 to 4,000
health care providers.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County's dilemma comes down to a pledge it made five
years ago: It would reconfigure its health-care system so that more
patients received care in neighborhood clinics, except when
hospitalization was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The waiver saved the county from bankruptcy in 1995 when it
faced an unprecedented $655 million budget deficit and supervisors
were forced to lay off 2,500 health care workers.
</P>
<P>
   While the health re-engineering plan saved the county $43
million in 1998-99, the projected savings this fiscal year are $71
million.
</P>
<P>
   But officials say that is just not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Santiago, director of the county's Medicaid Demonstration
Project, said the program has succeeded in cutting nonurgent visits
to emergency rooms and the number of people in county hospital
beds.
</P>
<P>
   But more must be done, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have a lot more to do in ambulatory care
expansion,'' Santiago said. ``The area the federal government has
been critical of us is in meeting our savings target. Our original
target savings were not realistic, and we had the chief
administrative officer and auditor-controller set more realistic
targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials are more critical of the county's progress, or
lack of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we have fallen short and if we had a crystal ball
when we introduced the waiver, there are certain things we failed
to recognize,'' said Kathryn Barger, health deputy to Supervisor
Michael D. Antonovich. ``We didn't achieve the numbers we
originally anticipated.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &LR; Behind the numbers are patients like Jesse Armijo, a
32-year-old Sun Valley man who suffered head injuries during a fall
at a construction site last month. He came to the Olive View-UCLA
Medical Center in Sylmar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here three times,'' he said last week while waiting
in the emergency room. ``It's the same thing. You wait forever and
a day. They need more help and more facilities. I've been waiting
here since 10 a.m. and now it's 3 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Armijo said he didn't know the county had neighborhood clinics
now, staffed with doctors who could give him follow-up care.
</P>
<P>
   At the newly opened San Fernando Health Center, Panorama City
resident Ana Osorio said she first went to Olive View after
experiencing chest pains, but has been coming to the health center
since paramedics referred her there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy with the care here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando resident Jesus Saucedo, 31, said he chose the
center when he had chest pains because it's closer to his home and
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   At Olive View, the failure of the county's effort to send
nonurgent cases to the clinics is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our emergency room visits have not gone down, even though we
have expanded access in the community for primary care,'' said
Carolyn Rhee, chief operating officer at Olive View. ``That's
probably because there was an unmet need out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come to the emergency room, we try to refer them for
future visits to the health centers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The average Olive View emergency room visit dropped from seven
hours in 1994-95 to five hours in 1998-99 while the number of
visits to the emergency room has dropped from 85,868 in 1994-95 to
60,779 in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   But Rhee attributes the drop in emergency room waits mostly to a
campaign by private health providers to attract pregnant women and
pediatric patients because of lucrative government reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   Rhee says the Northridge Earthquake skewed the emergency room
visitor numbers in 1994-95 because many people sought treatment at
the hospital, noting that the number of visits in 1995-96 was
68,716. She said many people didn't come back as patients after the
earthquake, believing the hospital was closed because of extensive
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the waiver has done is increase the access people have to
primary care centers,'' Rhee said. ``We now have more locations
where people can get primary care. But that does not reduce the
need for the emergency room.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there hasn't been limited success: The goal of the
waiver was to cut the number of hospital beds by one-third and
expand outpatient clinics with a target of 3.9 million annual
visits.
</P>
<P>
   Under the waiver, budgeted hospital beds have fallen 28 percent
and inappropriate use of emergency rooms has dropped by 27 percent,
according to county statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The county has increased the number of community clinics from 45
to 170, including eight county health centers and 16 public-private
partnership clinics in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   However, the number of visits to the clinics was slightly less
than 3million in 1999-2000, missing the target.
</P>
<P>
   Community activists, patients and officials alike say the
county's efforts have helped a previously unserved number of
uninsured people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Valley has the highest number of uninsured people in
the whole county,'' said Ron Hansen, health services deputy for
Yaroslavsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen noted a number of projects and new facilities in the
Valley that are making the Valley a model for the county's health
care improvements. ``If the waiver was cut back, it would seriously
impede the progress we have made here,'' he said.!dlim!!end

 &HT;    Raining on his parade?
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Robby Gordon's chances for the history books may
be washed away today.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who is a regular in the Winston Cup Series, is trying to
become the third person to ever compete in the Indianapolis 500 and
Coca-Cola 600 on the same day, following in the footsteps of John
Andretti (1994) and Tony Stewart ('99).
</P>
<P>
   However, The Weather Channel is predicting a 60 percent chance
of rain at the 500, which starts at 11 a.m. today. The forecast for
the 6:15 p.m. race at Lowe's Motor Speedway is not much better,
with a 50 percent of showers.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Gordon's bid to do the same double-duty in 1997 was
ruined when the 500 was postponed until Monday because of inclement
weather.
</P>
<P>
   If the start of the Indy 500 is delayed today _ endangering
Gordon's participation in the 600 _ which race would he choose?
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I'm starting fourth in the Indianapolis 500 and at No. 42
(out of 43 cars) in the 600. Which one would you choose?'' a
grinning Gordon said. ``We have to be competitive in at least one
of the races.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon almost won at Indianapolis last year, leading the
historic open-wheel event before running out of gas with one lap
left. Gordon's return to Winston Cup this season has been a
struggle, with the No. 13 Ford at 36th in the circuit's point
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Doing the double-duty is more than just a publicity stunt,
Gordon claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big challenge for me,'' Gordon said. ``At Indy
qualifying (last week), that was my first time back in (an
open-wheel) car in seven months and I did so well. So why not
compete at Indy if you can compete at the level of winning?
</P>
<P>
   ``Winston Cup is definitely my future, but we're still learning
there. I don't think it makes a huge difference if we ran in the
600 or not. Now if we were in the top of points, we'd have to
reevaluate the situation. But right now, we are way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Stewart accomplish the feat last year, the toughest
part of the double-duty appears to be the physical abuse on a
driver's body. Stewart collapsed after the 600 and was treated for
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with some of the doctors that worked with Tony last
year,'' Gordon said. ``Tony didn't take his IV after Indy because
he said he was feeling so good. So he didn't get all of his fluids
and vitamins replenished. And then, the only thing he ate all day
was a Power Bar. You can't live all day off a Power Bar.''
</P>
<P>
   After running the past two years in open-wheel racing, Gordon is
always fighting for respect in the NASCAR garage area. He said
qualifying so high at Indy is not as easy as he made it look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe if Dale Earnhardt Jr. (wins the pole) here,
he'd be 33rd at Indianapolis,'' Gordon said. ``I'd love a couple
more of these NASCAR guys to go down there and play with us.''

WOODS CHARGES AHEAD, AND LEAVES FIELD BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ The Memorial Tournament is not supposed to end
until Sunday, but Tiger Woods tried to end the suspense Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Some race cars at the Indianapolis 500 will not start as quickly
as Woods did. After eight holes, Woods already had an eagle and
four birdies. He was in a zone of his own, pulling away from the
field and pulling off shots that even his playing partners were
forced to admire.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Woods held a six-stroke lead, and it appeared
he already had one hand on the championship trophy. Shooting a
seven-under-par 65, Woods stood at 17 under par for the tournament
(71-63-65, 199), six strokes ahead of Steve Lowery and seven
strokes ahead of Justin Leonard after Saturday's third round at
Muirfield Village Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has the biggest third-round lead on the PGA Tour since
March 1998, when David Duval led by six strokes after the third
round of the Tucson Chrysler Classic. And it was the biggest lead
of Woods' career since the 1997 Masters, when he led by nine
strokes after three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   So the question was this: Will the rest of the field be playing
for second place Sunday? The answers varied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can think we're playing for second, but I don't think we
as players can,'' said Leonard, who had a hole-in-one Saturday at
No. 8, using a 5-iron from 171 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You spot the No. 1 player seven shots for 18 holes, I'd have
to bet on Tiger,'' Lowery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want me to say?'' asked Ernie Els, who fell out of
contention with a 72, leaving him seven under. ``It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   What was Woods' reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't think it's over,'' said Woods, who will be
trying to win for the fourth time this year. ``I've got 18 holes
left. If it's over, I'd be talking with a trophy right here,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   There was little question that Woods was in command, taking
advantage of greens softened by morning rain, plus
lift-clean-and-place rules that allowed players to place their ball
in the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question after Woods' blistering start concerned
whether he would shoot 59. After making par on the first two holes,
Woods made a a 12-foot putt for birdie at No. 3, followed by a
10-footer for birdie at No. 4. Then at the par-5, 527-yard No. 5,
Woods made another birdie when he reached the green in two shots
and two-putted from 40 feet.
</P>
<P>
   After a par at No. 6, Woods eagled the par-5 No. 7, hitting a
huge drive and then a terrific 3-iron shot from 233 yards that
landed on the green and ran toward the hole, stopping 15 feet past
it. Woods converted the putt, followed by another birdie at the
par-3, 182-yard No. 8, where he hit a radar-like 7-iron tee shot
that landed a foot from the hole.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Woods was six under par through eight holes.
Going back to Friday, he was 15 under par over his last 22 holes.
Woods settled for par at Nos. 9 and 10; his 10-foot putt for birdie
at No. 9 stopped just short of the hole, and Woods angrily waved
his putter. He insisted, however, that he had not thought of
shooting 59.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're nine under through 14 or 15 holes, it's more
feasible,'' Woods said. ``But these finishing holes are playing
straight into the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods made another eagle at No. 11 and birdied No. 15 before
making his first bogey at No. 18, ending a streak of 48 holes
without a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Els and Harrison Frazar, who fell out of contention with a 78,
seemed distracted by Woods' early barrage. Frazar admitted that he
marveled at Woods' approach shot at No. 11, a 5-iron from around
220 yards that landed 8 feet from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit it straight up in the air, and it carried all the way
to the flag,'' Frazar said. ``I don't know any other players out
here who have that shot. I had not played with him for a long time.
Now I know why.''
</P>
<P>
   With rounds of 63 and 65 the past two days, it is safe to say
that Woods' experiment with the Nike ball is going quite well. He
used the Nike ball in competition for the first time last week in
Germany, where he finished third after leading by three strokes
heading into the final round.
</P>
<P>
   For him to lose a six-stroke lead would be shocking. Leonard was
not willing to concede, but he was also not surprised that Woods
was so far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazement has kind of gone away,'' Leonard said. ``A week
like this on a golf course that suits him well, you almost come to
expect it.'' &QL;

LEBANON FACES PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY

<P>
   BEIRUT _ As UN cartographers examined Lebanon's southern border
Saturday with maps and tape measures to determine whether Israel's
withdrawal complied with UN resolutions, one thing was certain: the
political and strategic landscape here has fundamentally changed
along with the physical.
</P>
<P>
   The chaotic pullback of Israeli troops after 22 years of
occupation silenced the last active war front in a half-century of
Arab-Israeli conflict. It could help define Lebanon's future and
create paths toward a regional peace agreement. But those paths are
narrow, and run along a precipice of potential conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first chance we have to unify Lebanon and truly move
forward with the rebuilding of this country, and it is the last
chance before we could blow everything up and lose it all,'' said
Gebran Tueni, editor of Beirut's An Nahar newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible change in the strategic topography is that
Israel's withdrawal and the collapse of its proxy militia leaves
Syria deeply isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, with 30,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, effectively
controls the country. It has long supported Lebanon's Shiite Muslim
guerrillas in their war against Israel as a way to exert pressure
for the return of the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from
Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has warned Syria that if it inspires any trouble along
the valleys and rocky hillsides of this new, raw border, Syrian
troops will be targeted for retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   A cache of heavy weapons confiscated from abandoned Israeli
military bases has been divided up by Hezbollah, the Shiite
fighters, and by a variety of less disciplined militias of
Lebanon's civil war, which began in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Some weapons also presumably ended up in Palestinian refugee
camps in Lebanon, where 400,000 Palestinians have remained since
they fled or were forced from their land in 1948, when war broke
out after Israel became an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   This new firepower, in a country that has never had a shortage
of weapons, raises a specter of conflict possibly created by a
fringe militia or splinter group, and possibly inspired by Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian frustration would seem likely to increase in this new
scenario. The Syrians are essentially hemmed in by Israel's move,
and it is likely that for Israel, the issue of the Golan Heights
will shift to a back burner.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Washington, Ehud Barak spent much of his first
five months as Israel's prime minister trying to woo Syria's
president, Hafez Assad, to the negotiating table. Barak said at the
time that he wanted to withdraw troops from Lebanon as part of a
regional peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But a summit meeting between President Clinton and Assad in late
March in Geneva did not restart the deadlocked Israeli-Syrian
talks. And Barak's sudden withdrawal, six weeks ahead of his stated
deadline, has left many Middle East experts saying that Assad had
miscalculated by not settling.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians arrived in Lebanon in 1976, a year after the civil
war began there. Their presence is not only military, but political
as well, and many in Lebanon have grown to resent the Syrian
meddling.
</P>
<P>
   Farid Khazen, a professor of political science at American
University in Beirut, said that the 1990 Taif agreements, which
ended the civil war, called for Syria to withdraw its troops to
positions closer to the Syrian border, in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
Syria has not done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of Lebanese would like to have good
relations with Syria, but there is an impatience that is setting
in. Many contest the army in Syria, and that feeling will increase
now,'' Khazen said.
</P>
<P>
   Few politicians and academics have dared to raise their voice
against Syria's presence; to do so had been seen as favoring
Israel. Such criticism in many cases brought threatsfrom the
Damascus regime's vast intelligence network.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, university students chanting ``Lebanon first! Syrian
Army out!'' have been brutally repressed, and some organizers have
been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Tueni, the An Nahar editor, who has spoken out against Syrian
dominance in Lebanon, said the ``next few days are critical'' to
the future of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   If the UN cartographers confirm that Israel has completely
withdrawn, Lebanese troops will deploy, they have said. Tueni says
the reason the Lebanese army has not yet deployed, leaving the
border crackling with tension between those seen as loyal to the
occupying forces and those who supported the resistance, is that
Syria wants to sustain a ``controlled chaos'' to keep Israel off
guard and insecure along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian-influenced politicians and Hezbollah leaders have raised
the issue of a rocky no-man's-land known as Shebaa Farms, which
they say is Lebanese soil that Israel is continuing to occupy.
</P>
<P>
   The UN has ruled that the area is part of Syria, and left many
observerers viewing the dispute as a pretext for Syria to create
instability in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Tueni says it is essential for the Lebanese government to play
this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lebanese army has to go in there as soon as possible,''
Tueni said. ``If they do not, then Christians will leave the south
and feel abandoned by their government. This will mean a
demographic rupture in a country that has a very fragile balance of
Christians and Muslims and Druze. We have seen that kind of rupture
cause disaster here before.''

   In Beirut, university students chanting ``Lebanon first! Syrian
Army out!'' have been brutally repressed, and some organizers have
been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Tueni, the An Nahar editor, who has spoken out against Syrian
dominance in Lebanon, said the ``next few days are critical'' to
the future of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   If the UN cartographers confirm that Israel has completely
withdrawn, Lebanese troops will deploy, they have said. Tueni says
the reason the Lebanese army has not yet deployed, leaving the
border crackling with tension between those seen as loyal to the
occupying forces and those who supported the resistance, is that
Syria wants to sustain a ``controlled chaos'' to keep Israel off
guard and insecure along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian-influenced politicians and Hezbollah leaders have raised
the issue of a rocky no-man's-land known as Shebaa Farms, which
they say is Lebanese soil that Israel is continuing to occupy.
</P>
<P>
   The UN has ruled that the area is part of Syria, and left many
observerers viewing the dispute as a pretext for Syria to create
instability in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Tueni says it is essential for the Lebanese government to play
this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lebanese army has to go in there as soon as possible,''
Tueni said. ``If they do not, then Christians will leave the south
and feel abandoned by their government. This will mean a
demographic rupture in a country that has a very fragile balance of
Christians and Muslims and Druze. We have seen that kind of rupture
cause disaster here before.''

POWER-SHARING TO RETURN TO NORTHERN IRELAND
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ A bitterly divided Ulster Unionist Party voted
Saturday to restore a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political representatives, giving the Northern Ireland peace
process a major boost and Protestant leader David Trimble a narrow
vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   According to one prominent unionist, the vote was ``a victory
for common sense,'' and represented a decision to test the Irish
Republican Army's word, following an IRA pledge to let
international inspectors check its hidden arms dumps.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton seemed to capture the sense of
relief, saying, ``The wind is back in the sails of peace in
Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Peter Mandelson, the British secretary of state
for Northern Ireland, signed papers that will restore home rule on
Tuesday. The power-sharing Cabinet could meet as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northern Ireland  &UR; today &LR;  has a second chance to get it
right,'' said Mandelson, who suspended the local government in
February after 72 days, when unionists threatened to walk out
because the IRA had refused to begin disarming or to say its war
was over.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, the Ulster Unionist leader, seemed relieved when he
emerged from a closed-door meeting of his ruling party council at
the Waterfront Hall, a concert hall with an elaborate glass facade
that would have been folly in the Northern Ireland of old.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Trimble met with the press to declare a victory of
459 votes to 403, or 53.2 percent to 46.8 percent, he referred to
the tower cranes and other signs of prosperity around him as
evidence that it was imperative for his party to accept the IRA
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belfast is booming,'' Trimble said. As he spoke, behind him a
tour boat crammed with passengers tooled by on the Lagan River,
something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The business community voiced strong support of the compromise,
despite misgivings among many Protestant unionists who want to
maintain the union with Britain and who deeply distrust the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   While downplaying the split in his party, Trimble said the
power-sharing government would face collapse again unless the IRA
took further steps to disarm voluntarily sometime in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stretched ourselves, remarkably in the
circumstances,'' Trimble said. ``But it is also obvious there is a
limit to how far we can stretch ourselves. We are operating in
reliance of promises made by the republican movement.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those promises, made by the IRA in a statement on May 6
that broke a stalemate, is that the IRA will eventually put its
weapons ``beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the IRA offered a confidence-building measure
in its promise to let the former Finnish president, Martti
Ahtisaari, and the African National Congress negotiator, Cyril
Ramaphosa, inspect some of its arms dumps. Most of those are in the
Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let there be absolutely no doubt that I and my colleagues will
hold the republicans to the promises they have made,'' Trimble
said. ``If there's any foot-dragging, if there's any delay, there
will be difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote Saturday was essentially a referendum on Trimble's
leadership. Had he lost it, his position as leader of the biggest
party in Northern Ireland would have been untenable, and the peace
process would have been thrown into another crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A palace coup led by Trimble's would-be successor, Jeffrey
Donaldson, narrowly failed. But those opposed to the Good Friday
Agreement of 1998, which mandates power sharing, equity between
Catholic nationalists and Protestant unionists, and reform of the
overwhelmingly Protestant police force, took solace from Saturday's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's comfort margin has narrowed considerably. Last
November, he received 58 percent of his party council's backing
when he proposed going into government with Sinn Fein before the
IRA began disarming. That support slipped by a percentage point in
March when he was challenged as party leader. It slipped a further
four points Saturday. The vote was close enough to require a
recount.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson and other hard-liners had insisted that the party
should not go back into government with Sinn Fein until the IRA
began disarming, and accused Trimble of being unprincipled.
Trimble's backers called him pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McGimpsey, a Trimble confidant and the soon-to-be
restored minister for culture, said Trimble's speech to delegates
had turned the tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``David spoke from his head, not his heart,'' said McGimpsey,
who speaks better Irish than many of the Sinn Fein officials who
consider respect for the ancient language proof of respect for
them. ``The heart says you can't trust these guys,'' he said,
referring to the IRA, ``but the head tells you you have to test
them at their word. That's what David asked us to do. Common sense
prevailed  &UR; today &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Another key to Saturday's vote was the decision of Trimble's
deputy, John Taylor, to back him. Taylor said he was going to vote
no until Mandelson assured him that Britain would retain the name
of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and would continue flying the
Union Jack over government buildings. Many unionists say that
eliminating such symbols of Britishness in Northern Ireland shows
disrespect for their identity.
</P>
<P>
   While Sinn Fein officials applauded Trimble's ability to get a
majority of his party to back him, they were furious when Trimble
suggested that Irish republicans ``aren't house-trained yet'' as
democrats. Republicans say such language, comparing them to
animals, proves that unionists are still not treating them as
equals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inclusivity, equality and mutual respect is the way forward,''
said Martin McGuinness, who was once the IRA's chief of staff, and
who next week will resume his job as the education minister in the
restored home rule government.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ian Paisley, the hard-line unionist leader, denounced
the vote as another example of Trimble's treachery.
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, the leader of the moderate nationalist Social
Democratic and Labor Party, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with
Trimble in 1998, urged people to look beyond the narrow victory and
focus on returning local government to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``For once,'' Hume pleaded, ``let's look at the positive.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left the Waterfront Hall, Alex McWilliams, one of those
who voted no, vowed that opponents of the Good Friday Agreement
would continue fighting until they toppled Trimble and the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning,'' said McWilliams, 45, from West
Belfast. ``We can't accept such treachery.''
</P>
<P>
   As McWilliams drove his car from the parking garage, workers at
the Waterfront Hall were preparing for Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's
performance of Verdi's ``Aida,'' whose main themes are divided
loyalties and treachery.

CAN ANYBODY SURPASS COMETS, ON AND OFF THE COURT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Houston Comets are not the WNBA's version of Microsoft, but
they're close, though.
</P>
<P>
   In three seasons, the Comets have won 78 percent of their games.
They are the top draw in the WNBA. They have two-time league MVP
Cynthia Cooper. They have former 1996 Olympic darling Sheryl
Swoopes. They have three-time coach of the year Van Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   The baby-faced WNBA is not about to divide and conquer its Bill
Gates. Remember, the league has cashed in on the Comets' dominance,
generating name recognition and making celebrities out of
relatively obscure players such as Cooper and Tina Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   As the WNBA begins its fourth season tomorrow with a rematch of
last season's WNBA Finals when Houston plays New York at 2 p.m. (
KXAS/Channel 5). The Comets are trying to become the second
professional basketball team since the Boston Celtics to win four
consecutive titles.
</P>
<P>
   However, some say a new champion would be best for the league,
its players and the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I think it would be great to have a different
champion,'' Washington Mystics coach Nancy Darsch. ``Either way,
it's going to be full of exposure. People are dying to see if
Houston can do it again. It's going to be worth talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Through three seasons, the WNBA's topic of conversation has been
the Comets. For good reason. They have led the league in victories
all three seasons. They have three of the best players in the
league, and one of its most marketable in Swoopes. And they draw
large crowds _ through the first three seasons they are averaging
around 10,000 per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``How in the world could that be bad?'' Chancellor said. ``You
go to Miami and people are wearing Comets jerseys everywhere. We
have been on a team that every fan in America can identify with.
... It has been a team that you either love or hate.''
</P>
<P>
   For an infant league, the Comets' success has been a gift not
even NBA czar David Stern could have planned. They were an
attraction _ a happening _ without a cheesy in-your-face marketing
gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of positives to having a team that has been so
celebrated,'' WNBA president Val Ackerman said. ``I don't think the
NBA suffered for having the \RChicago\S Bulls win the title as many
times as they did. I don't think the NFL ever suffered by having
the Dallas Cowboys win so many games or the \RSan Francisco\S 49ers
winning the Super Bowl multiple times and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they didn't. Those leagues were established in their
respective cities and the United States. The WNBA is faced with the
challenge of spreading the wealth without damaging its most prized
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Adding teams is one way to do it, and the WNBA added four
increasing the league total to 16. Adding more playoff games is
another way, and this season eight teams will reach the postseason.
The top four teams in both the East and West make the playoffs in
best-of-three series.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, if the WNBA wants to prevent one team from
dominating the league like Tennessee and Connecticut in college
basketball, teams must beat Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are the teams that can play with them and compete with
them, can they beat them?'' Miami Sol coach Ron Rothstein said.
``Those are totally different questions. They set the bar and
somehow we need to get to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teams are close. Los Angeles, with center Lisa Leslie and
forward DeLisha Milton, and Sacramento, with reigning MVP Yolanda
Griffith, are given the best chance at dethroning Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's bad when you have some dominance people can
recognize,'' Rothstein said. ``It's the age-old question, do you
want parity or someone that dominates? You can make a case on both
sides. Maybe it raises our level as players and coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't have any choice.

 &HT;    Raining on his parade?
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Robby Gordon's chances for the history books may
be washed away today.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who is a regular in the Winston Cup Series, is trying to
become the third person to ever compete in the Indianapolis 500 and
Coca-Cola 600 on the same day, following in the footsteps of John
Andretti (1994) and Tony Stewart ('99).
</P>
<P>
   However, The Weather Channel is predicting a 60 percent chance
of rain at the 500, which starts at 11 a.m. today. The forecast for
the 6:15 p.m. race at Lowe's Motor Speedway is not much better,
with a 50 percent of showers.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Gordon's bid to do the same double-duty in 1997 was
ruined when the 500 was postponed until Monday because of inclement
weather.
</P>
<P>
   If the start of the Indy 500 is delayed today _ endangering
Gordon's participation in the 600 _ which race would he choose?
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I'm starting fourth in the Indianapolis 500 and at No. 42
(out of 43 cars) in the 600. Which one would you choose?'' a
grinning Gordon said. ``We have to be competitive in at least one
of the races.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon almost won at Indianapolis last year, leading the
historic open-wheel event before running out of gas with one lap
left. Gordon's return to Winston Cup this season has been a
struggle, with the No. 13 Ford at 36th in the circuit's point
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Doing the double-duty is more than just a publicity stunt,
Gordon claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big challenge for me,'' Gordon said. ``At Indy
qualifying (last week), that was my first time back in (an
open-wheel) car in seven months and I did so well. So why not
compete at Indy if you can compete at the level of winning?
</P>
<P>
   ``Winston Cup is definitely my future, but we're still learning
there. I don't think it makes a huge difference if we ran in the
600 or not. Now if we were in the top of points, we'd have to
reevaluate the situation. But right now, we are way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Stewart accomplish the feat last year, the toughest
part of the double-duty appears to be the physical abuse on a
driver's body. Stewart collapsed after the 600 and was treated for
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with some of the doctors that worked with Tony last
year,'' Gordon said. ``Tony didn't take his IV after Indy because
he said he was feeling so good. So he didn't get all of his fluids
and vitamins replenished. And then, the only thing he ate all day
was a Power Bar. You can't live all day off a Power Bar.''
</P>
<P>
   After running the past two years in open-wheel racing, Gordon is
always fighting for respect in the NASCAR garage area. He said
qualifying so high at Indy is not as easy as he made it look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe if Dale Earnhardt Jr. (wins the pole) here,
he'd be 33rd at Indianapolis,'' Gordon said. ``I'd love a couple
more of these NASCAR guys to go down there and play with us.''

 &HT;    Auto racing promising investment for corporate sponsors
 &HT;    By Jim Dillon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON _ As Sarah Fisher races 200 mph around the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway during today's Indianapolis 500, another rookie to
this fabled auto race will be watching intently and wishing her
well.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo Francis is director of marketing for Mead Carbonless
Paper, a product division of Dayton-based Mead Corp. She is
investing thousands of Mead marketing dollars and an equally large
amount of faith this racing season in the 19-year-old driver from
Commercial Point, Ohio, just south of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Mead Carbonless is an associate sponsor of Fisher this year. The
undisclosed amount Mead is paying Walker Racing, the owner of
Fisher's car, buys the paper company prominent space on the sleek
blue-and-white car and Fisher's matching helmet and uniform. It
also buys Mead access to Fisher, the car and the Walker Racing
team.
</P>
<P>
   But big expectations come with the sponsorship, perhaps more so
for Francis than Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The onus is on myself and my department to make sure we're
realizing the most benefit for our money,'' Francis said last week
during a break in her hectic pre-race schedule. ``This really is a
test year. If we can prove that this is a venue that is worthwhile
for Mead Carbonless, then we will continue (to support Fisher as an
Indy Racing League driver.)''
</P>
<P>
   Mead is one of hundreds of major corporations trying to cash in
on America's fascination with motor sports.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400,000 people are expected to attend this year's
Indianapolis 500. Millions more will be watching on television and
listening on radio.
</P>
<P>
   Some 550 miles to the southeast in Charlotte, N.C., thousands
more will watch another Mead-sponsored driver, Rusty Wallace,
compete in the 41st Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR race.
</P>
<P>
   As the audience for motor sports grows, so does the amount
corporations spend to get their logos in front of all those
eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   Auto racing will earn $1.35 billion in sponsorship revenue from
North American companies this year, up 10 percent from 1999,
according to IEG Inc., a Chicago company that tracks sponsor
spending. In fact, corporate spending on auto racing will easily
surpass spending on golf, its nearest competitor, and dwarf
corporate spending on all professional sports teams, Olympic teams
and competitions, and tennis this year, IEG said.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL, which is sanctioning the Indianapolis 500 and eight
other races around the country this year, will take in an estimated
$143 million this year, up 18 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   CART, the other major open-wheel racing sanctioning body in the
United States, will receive an estimated $492 million in corporate
sponsorship money this year, up 8.6 percent from 1999, IEG said.
Meanwhile, NASCAR, the sanctioning body of America's most popular
form of auto racing, will take in an estimated $558 million, up 9.1
percent from 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auto racing is the No. 1 spectator sport in America now,''
Francis said. ``And to the extent the leagues can identify who
makes up their audiences, it makes it very attractive for potential
sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, research shows that race fans are remarkably loyal
to the companies that sponsor their favorite race teams and
drivers, Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's just too soon to say whether Mead's major investment
in Fisher _ it's somewhere below $1 million _ will pay off the way
Francis hopes it will.
</P>
<P>
   Francis and other Mead officials certainly have confidence in
Fisher. The company has a major mill in Chillicothe, not far from
where Fisher grew up, and supported her winning racing efforts as
she progressed from go-karts to midgets and sprint cars to Indy
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a local girl who has some ties to the community and the
mill,'' Francis said. ``I felt strongly it was the right thing to
do and that we could get a lot out of it this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mead probably would not have ventured into IRL racing with
another driver, Francis added.
</P>
<P>
   Francis said one of her primary objectives in sponsoring Fisher
is to generate business-to-business sales to other sponsors of the
IRL. ``The business-to-business opportunity has not proven itself
yet, but it's early,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unusual for a paper company to be an IRL sponsor because
the payoff is not as obvious as it would be for, say, an oil
company or automaker. ``But I don't think it's impossible to make
that work,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   Another objective is to entertain customers at IRL races. Last
weekend, for example, several Mead customers and employees watched
from trackside as Fisher and 32 other drivers qualified for today's
big race. Francis watched the tension-filled event from home and
focused hard on Fisher's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the whole thing,'' Francis said. ``I absolutely
watched her position, what her speed was, what the other drivers
were doing. And I was wondering what my customers were thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher qualified at 220.237 mph and will start today's race on
the inside of Row 7. She is youngest driver and one of two women in
the race. The other woman is 53-year-old Janet Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 25 Mead customers and employees will be at the
track to watch the race and root for Fisher. Few, however, will be
watching Fisher more intently than Francis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thrill. She's a very bright girl with a lot of talent
who is going to go far,'' Francis said. ``I'm just pleased we can
help her out.''

more will watch another Mead-sponsored driver, Rusty Wallace,
compete in the 41st Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR race.
</P>
<P>
   As the audience for motor sports grows, so does the amount
corporations spend to get their logos in front of all those
eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   Auto racing will earn $1.35 billion in sponsorship revenue from
North American companies this year, up 10 percent from 1999,
according to IEG Inc., a Chicago company that tracks sponsor
spending. In fact, corporate spending on auto racing will easily
surpass spending on golf, its nearest competitor, and dwarf
corporate spending on all professional sports teams, Olympic teams
and competitions, and tennis this year, IEG said.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL, which is sanctioning the Indianapolis 500 and eight
other races around the country this year, will take in an estimated
$143 million this year, up 18 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   CART, the other major open-wheel racing sanctioning body in the
United States, will receive an estimated $492 million in corporate
sponsorship money this year, up 8.6 percent from 1999, IEG said.
Meanwhile, NASCAR, the sanctioning body of America's most popular
form of auto racing, will take in an estimated $558 million, up 9.1
percent from 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auto racing is the No. 1 spectator sport in America now,''
Francis said. ``And to the extent the leagues can identify who
makes up their audiences, it makes it very attractive for potential
sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, research shows that race fans are remarkably loyal
to the companies that sponsor their favorite race teams and
drivers, Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's just too soon to say whether Mead's major investment
in Fisher _ it's somewhere below $1 million _ will pay off the way
Francis hopes it will.
</P>
<P>
   Francis and other Mead officials certainly have confidence in
Fisher. The company has a major mill in Chillicothe, not far from
where Fisher grew up, and supported her winning racing efforts as
she progressed from go-karts to midgets and sprint cars to Indy
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a local girl who has some ties to the community and the
mill,'' Francis said. ``I felt strongly it was the right thing to
do and that we could get a lot out of it this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mead probably would not have ventured into IRL racing with
another driver, Francis added.
</P>
<P>
   Francis said one of her primary objectives in sponsoring Fisher
is to generate business-to-business sales to other sponsors of the
IRL. ``The business-to-business opportunity has not proven itself
yet, but it's early,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unusual for a paper company to be an IRL sponsor because
the payoff is not as obvious as it would be for, say, an oil
company or automaker. ``But I don't think it's impossible to make
that work,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   Another objective is to entertain customers at IRL races. Last
weekend, for example, several Mead customers and employees watched
from trackside as Fisher and 32 other drivers qualified for today's
big race. Francis watched the tension-filled event from home and
focused hard on Fisher's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the whole thing,'' Francis said. ``I absolutely
watched her position, what her speed was, what the other drivers
were doing. And I was wondering what my customers were thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher qualified at 220.237 mph and will start today's race on
the inside of Row 7. She is youngest driver and one of two women in
the race. The other woman is 53-year-old Janet Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 25 Mead customers and employees will be at the
track to watch the race and root for Fisher. Few, however, will be
watching Fisher more intently than Francis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thrill. She's a very bright girl with a lot of talent
who is going to go far,'' Francis said. ``I'm just pleased we can
help her out.''

 &HT;    EDS: THIS IS AN UPDATED VERSION OF SHOOT-MAIN
 &HT;    Alleged teen shooter faces first degree murder charges
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ Manacles and leg-chains clinking softly,
13-year-old Nathaniel Brazill showed no more emotion than a
sleepwalker as he faced Judge Jorge LaBarga Saturday morning at the
Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office on Gun Club Road.
</P>
<P>
   The courtoom was as dull and nondescript as the classroom at
Lake Worth Middle School where Brazill allegedly shot and killed
his teacher, Barry Grunow, about 19 hours earlier. The wispy
accused youth, whom classmates described as a practical joker, was
clad in khaki prison garb. He blinked calmly, silently during the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   He could be charged with first-degree murder. If convicted, he
could spend the rest of his life in prison. He is too young to face
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first day of school vacation, after the last day of
school. Yet scores of Lake Worth Middle School students flocked
back to their campus Saturday morning, to wonder over the murder of
a popular teacher, by a well-liked student. There were 51 incidents
of criminal behavior reported at the school in 1999, well above the
Palm Beach County average of 32 incidents per middle school,
county-wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY LIFE MR. GRUNOW,'' read one tribute
put up on the schoolyard fence. A woman scraped with her fingers in
the dirt, to plant a bouquet of flowers at the edge of the
property.
</P>
<P>
   All of them talked among themselves, reliving the events of a
dry, hot Friday afternoon. When most students and teachers were
looking forward to summer and its lazy delights, Nathaniel Brazill
allegedly walked up to his teacher, Barry Grunow, and shot him once
with a tiny Raven pistol he took from the dresser drawer of a man
police described as a family friend last week. Grunow fell down,
coughing up blood from the gunshot. He died in minutes, as his
students watched in horror.
</P>
<P>
   By a melancholy coincidence, Grunow died 18 years to the day
after his father, Frederick E. Grunow of Monroe, Michigan, died of
cancer in Lake Park at the age of 55. The elder Grunow was a cable
splicer for Southern Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Interim Schools Superintendent Ben Marlin, at times angry, at
times near tears, on Saturday afternoon lay some of the blame on
the government's failure to take handguns out of the hands of young
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm saying is you lock them (guns) up,'' said Marlin, who
grew up hunting and handling guns in rural Pennsylvania. ``Handguns
are made to hurt people. There probably aren't a whole lot of other
things you do with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that gun had been locked up, we wouldn't be having this
conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning police allowed reporters to view the murder
scene. It was an ordinary, humdrum classroom with 39 desks, a bag
of Jelly-Bellies candy on the teacher's desk, a golden apple
paperweight, a carnation flower, a worn brown briefcase never to be
used by its owner again, and a poster that said ``WELCOME TO MR.
GRUNOW'S CLASSROOM.'' On the desks lay notebooks, hair brushes,
pens, old homework and a thumbed copy of ``The Klutz Strikes
Again.''
</P>
<P>
   At Grunow's modest home in Lake Worth, friends and relatives
came in twos and threes Saturday afternoon, attempting to console
his widow, Pam. Each arrival signaled the outbreak of a small storm
of fresh weeping. Sheriff's deputies controlled traffic on the
street, screening each new visitor carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Grunow was an avid gardener and native plant enthusiast. His
butterfly garden was flourishing in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of mad, sad people here this afternoon,'' said
a friend of the family who asked not to be identified. Grunow's
five-year-old son played innocently with friends. The slain
teacher's nine-month-old daughter, Lee-Ann, was cradled from arm to
arm, peaceful and content, unaware that she is now suddenly
fatherless.
</P>
<P>
   With Grunow's shooting, Palm Beach County unwillingly became
another talking-point in the nationwide debate over gun control.
The old end-of-term schoolyard rhyme, ``No more pencils, no more
books, no more teacher's crabby looks,'' took on a grim, humorless,
right-next-door reality. Grunow was shot in the face. Security
videocameras captured the impact of the slug as it crashed home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Brazill, you will be held in custody,'' Judge LaBarga told
the zombie-silent young defendant, as he ordered him sent back to
the secured, dorm-like Palm Beach Regional Juvenile Detention
Center on 45th Street where he spent Friday night. LaBarga also
told him to have no contact _ directly or indirectly _ with the
witnesses in this case.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to a grand jury to decide whether Brazill, a
promising student with an A-B report card, faces first-degree
murder charges. His case will be brought within the next three
weeks. Only then will it be determined whether he will be charged
as an adult, said state attorney's office spokesman Mike Edmondson.
</P>
<P>
   The youth will be back in court on June 6 at 9 a.m. Brazill's
mother stood up for him in court but would not comment as she left
the hearing, tears streaming down her cheeks, supported by a throng
of family members.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Rodgers, an assistant public defender, told a crowd of a
dozen reporters outside the Sheriff's Office on Gun Club Road that
he hopes Brazill will only be charged as a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's only 13 years old,'' Rodgers said.''He has no prior
criminal record and he's a good student. Facts are still coming
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson said investigators are considering whether to file
charges against the family friend whose gun police said was used in
the shooting. Police refused to name the man. Leaving a gun where a
child can get access to it can be a felony.
</P>
<P>
   As television cameras and satellite dishes converged here, and
as President Clinton telephoned Lake Worth Police Chief William
Smith to express his concern, the rest of Palm Beach County and the
wider world was still coming to grips with the murder. Amid the
expressions of grief and outrage there was also a certain air of
weariness and resignation, almost as if school violence were
becoming routine, as if the shot that killed Grunow were more echo
than bang.
</P>
<P>
   By noon Saturday most major networks were no longer mentioning
the Grunow murder as their lead news item. Gasoline prices and the
onset of the big Memorial Day weekend were edging the young teacher
off the national radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   But Lake Worth Middle School students had fresh, poignant
memories, both of the alleged murderer and his victim. They were
both well-liked, and appeared to have been on friendly terms with
each other. Indeed there is some evidence the youngster was looking
for another teacher, when he happened to run into Grunow.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Bradley, 13, said she had been warned about what was
about to happen to Grunow but she didn't realize it. After Brazill
had been sent home, he told one of her friends that he was ``going
to come back with a gun to get Mr. (Michael) Locke (the science
teacher) for suspending him,'' Bradley said. Locke had reported
Brazill to the principal earlier in the day for throwing water
balloons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went in one ear and out the other,'' she said.

 &HT;    Dayton's Salt Walther: Racer in free fall
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEBANON, Ohio _ A corrections officer led him through the
corridors of the Warren County Jail to a small room that had
nothing but a table and a few chairs, told him to take a seat and
then turned and left, making sure the door locked behind him.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Salt Walther didn't know what to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need a few minutes to get myself together,'' he said
with a quiet edginess. ``I'm a little worked up right now. I don't
care how strong you are, you sit in here and it messes you up.''
</P>
<P>
   He wore blue canvas deck shoes and a faded green jumpsuit with
short sleeves. He looked thinner and a lot older than he did in
those days of his 1970s stardom when he roared around race tracks
and life with a pedal-to-the-metal attitude. It made him _
according to a recent Dayton Dayton News poll _ one of this city's
100 most influential sports legends of the past century.
</P>
<P>
   It also nearly killed him.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat there with his arms uncovered, you could see the scars
and scaled skin that remain from his fiery 1973 crash at the
Indianapolis 500. To this day, it's considered the worst Brickyard
carnage that anyone has survived.
</P>
<P>
   His mangled right hand was still bent at odd angles and the left
_ where the fingers were burned down to nubs and mended paw-like by
some 30 operations _ was no longer hidden by the trademark black
leather glove he's always worn.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, he usually managed to take that old disaster and
dress it to the nines with nice threads, a few diamonds, some
outrageous talk and a big smile. All that is gone now.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the smile sometimes resurfaces, but it looks out of
kilter now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost parts of two teeth playing basketball here at the jail,''
he said. ``For the time being, I fixed 'em myself. Put 'em back in
with Super Glue.''
</P>
<P>
   He flashed a discolored smile that soon faded. While his teeth
are cemented in place, his knows his life is in free fall. It's
been that way for too much of the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old Walther has been in jail for more than two
months now. He's serving a six-month sentence after being convicted
of child endangering for returning his 5-year-old daughter to the
home of her mother, Cindy Heitman, who claimed Walther was under
the influence of drugs at the time. That charge and the claim by a
probation officer that Walther recently tested positive for
cocaine, has him awaiting a June hearing to see if he has violated
the terms of probation from a 1998 drug case in which he was
convicted of smuggling three prescription painkillers into jail in
the fingers of his black glove.
</P>
<P>
   If Walther is found to have violated parole, he could go to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm scared a little bit, but mostly, I'm disgusted the
way things have been distorted here,'' he said. ``Am I afraid of
going to prison? No. Do I want to go? My God, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of God, Walther carried a small book _ God's Words of
Life _ given to him by his current girlfriend, Jeannie Blevins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for jailhouse religion,'' he explained, ``but
there are some things to think about in this book.''
</P>
<P>
   He also held a packet of photographs of his daughter and he used
his workable hand to spread them out on the table. As he did, his
eyes began to brim with tears: ``Look at her, she's beautiful. . .
. I love her more than anything in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing he had was an Internet printout someone had given
him in the morning Alcoholics Anonymous meeting he'd just attended
in the jail. It was a rundown of the seven times he ran the Indy
500 _ from his 1972 debut to the crash in 1973, his ninth-place
finish in 1976 and his final race three years later. There was also
mention of his two aborted comeback attempts in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon as I get back to my cell,'' he mumbled, ``I know they'll
take this Indy stuff away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is _ paperwork or not _ he couldn't be much farther
away from the fabled race than he is right now. As the 33 drivers
in the 84th running of the 500 are introduced to a cheering crowd
of some 400,000 people today at Indianapolis Motor Speedway,
Walther will sit in his jail cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miserable way to live,'' he said. ``There's so much
tension in here. Some guys have been on suicide watch.''
</P>
<P>
   As for watching the race, he shrugged. There are two televisions
in the facility, but he doesn't know what will be tuned in. ``And
you can't hear either of them,'' he said. You just get the picture
with closed captions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might think that is apropos for him.
</P>
<P>
   David ``Salt'' Walther, they said, was the guy who never
listened anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The son of George Walther _ the wealthy Dayton foundry executive
who died two years ago _ Salt lived a life of privilege and, many
say, perceived entitlement. He was the wild child of the Walther
clan and his early days were filled with parties, pretty girls, big
talk and bigger action _ most notably, high-stakes racing. He ran
unlimited hydroplanes and some stock-car events, but the thing that
struck the chord with his dad was his pilgrimage to Indy.
</P>
<P>
   George Walther was a car owner at Indy from 1955 to 1980. During
the years, Elmer George, the father of IMS president Tony George,
drove for him, as did Dick Simon, Ralph Liguori, George Snider,
Phil Krueger, Rocky Moran and Larry Dixon. His best known
partnership, though, was with his son.
</P>
<P>
   After equipment failure ended Salt's 1972 debut with no fanfare,
he returned in 1973 for a race that would forever change his life .
. . for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had the race begun when Salt found his McLaren
Offenhauser launched skyward, spewing 80 gallons of methanol fuel
as it sailed upside down into a fence along the main straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   The battered car turned into a runaway Roman candle, bursting
into flames and spinning wildly in the first turn. The wild melee
that followed claimed 11 cars _ and everyone thought _ one life.
</P>
<P>
   Walther _ his legs protruding from the mangled car's
undercarriage _ was trapped upside down in the flames for 6
minutes. Much of the car melted and Walther _ badly burned about 60
percent of his body and suffering broken ribs, knees and elbows _
was given a 5 percent chance to live. Twice, he was given last
rites.
</P>
<P>
   For years, it's been whispered by some at Indy that Walther's
car was tapped from behind by A. J. Foyt. When asked about it now,
Walther shrugged: ``I've never admitted it publicly to anyone. But
I think we all know where the tap came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was Foyt, he started to nod, then thought better of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foyt bad-mouthed me in his book,'' he finally said, ``but
still, to me, A.J. was the greatest. That incident, that was just
part of racing.''
</P>
<P>
   His words sounded hollow. Heitman said she has known Walther for
seven years and while they are bitterly split now _ she asked the
judge to give him the maximum sentence in the child endangering
case _ she admitted one thing:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go through something as horrific as Salt did, who
knows what it does to you. It took a toll on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Walther endured terrible pain, suffered various organ failures
and had his body reject one skin graft after another. He said he
has had 109 operations since the wreck and to this day, his melted
left hand bleeds when barely touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the worst of it,'' he said. ``The worst thing was
the morphine that followed. When I was in the hospital, they
drilled two holes in my chest and mainlined morphine to me for
almost six months. I got addicted and in the long run, the drugs
did a better job of killing me than Indy did.''
</P>
<P>
   From morphine, Walther developed an affinity to cocaine, pain
killers, even heroin. And with the drug use came more and more
outlandish stunts. During the years, his troubles included
everything from passing bad checks, side-swiping a line of exotic
automobiles outside of a California party, obtaining illegal
prescription drugs and child support problems to stealing a golf
cart from IMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem was that Salt was his dad's favorite
child,'' Heitman said. ``His dad got him out of every jam he was in
and Salt never took responsibility. Even with all the drug rehab
programs he was in, he got to know what to say and how to play the
game. Every time he tried to clean himself up, it'd only last three
or four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``With him, when he's OK, the highs are the greatest highs in
the world. But the lows are the worst. I was naive to what he was
into.''
</P>
<P>
   Walther has said he met Heitman while they both were in drug
rehab and he claimed to have done drugs with her lots of times.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Saturday if that was true, she paused, then said: ``I'm
not going to get in arguments with him. He wants to discredit me in
the worst way.''
</P>
<P>
   Walther claims much of his problem with Heitman is sour grapes
on her part. He said because he has a new girlfriend and is happy,
she wants to get back at him. Blevins, Walther's new companion, has
three grown children and grandchildren of her own. She talked the
other day of ``the spiritual side'' she saw in Walther. She praised
his relationship with his daughter and said she knows nothing of
any drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Heitman disagreed: ``She's probably still into giving him one
more chance . . . like everybody has. As for me, I've given up
hope. And it has to do with our daughter. She had been taught that
her dad was this knight in shining armor. That she was his little
princess. Then he comes back into her life and he messes up. And it
depresses her. She can't understand `Why can't Daddy be good?'''
</P>
<P>
   Walther said he was not using drugs when he returned his
daughter to Heitman. He said he is clean and sober now. The
positive drug test the parole officer cited ``was not handled
properly,'' Walther said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Bill Knapp is representing Walther in the probation
violation hearing and may handle an appeal on the child endangering
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Salt has a good case,'' he said. ``The thing is, he's
like Ron Peters (of Pete Rose gambling fame), another client I
represented. They get reputations and then they're on the bubble
all the time. It's like they're wearing a scarlet letter. People
figure the worst even when it not the case. Salt has shown some
real positives. He's talked to young kids about the evils of drugs
and alcohol and he wants to pursue that as soon as he gets out of
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Walther said the young person he's most interested in is his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I've made so many mistakes. I've done a lot of stupid
things, but one thing I would not do is hurt my little girl. I was
not endangering her. She is everything to me _ everything.''
</P>
<P>
   As he studied the pictures, his face _ which still shows faint
burn marks from the 1973 crash _ started to tighten and crinkle and
all of a sudden he was sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   From outside the room, the guard signaled it was time to go.
Walther gathered up his things and before heading out the door, he
held out a bent hand and tried, but failed, to hold onto his smile.
His teeth be cemented in, but his life was still in free fall.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the guard led him back to his cell.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore pushed to define agenda
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service Gov. George W. Bush was praised this
<TEXT>
week for laying out a broad issues agenda that has driven the
campaign debate and thrown Democratic rival Al Gore's campaign on
the defensive. Political analysts have criticized Vice President
Gore for doing little to define his candidacy during the past two
months.
<P>
   On Thursday night, Gore met with Democratic leaders from around
the country to reassure them about his campaign. The meeting seemed
inconceivable to many, who months ago were questioning Bush's
intellec and preparedness for the White House. ``Bush is setting
the agenda right now,'' said Democratic pollster Fred Yang. ``He's
making us react to him.''
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY ADVOCATE CRITICIZING BUSH AND GOP PARTY
</P>
<P>
   James Dobson, president of the family advocacy group, Focus on
the Family, this week criticized the Republican Party and its
likely presidential nominee Bush for sacrificing dedication to its
core principles in an effort to be all things to all people. Dobson
said Bush and the GOP are trying to appeal both to religious
conservatives and to the moderate wing of the party. ``Some people
believe the only way to win the White House is to build a big tent,
but if you stand for everything you stand for nothing,'' Dobson
said. ``(Bush) sounds a whole lot more conservative when he is
talking to conservatives and a whole lot more moderate when he is
talking to moderates.'' Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said ``Bush
is uniting all wings of the party in reaching out to independents
and Democrats who support his compassionate conservative agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   `WARM-UP' DEBATES A POSSIBILITY
</P>
<P>
   Bush is kicking around the possibility of doing a couple of
early debates with Al Gore, perhaps as soon as late summer,
according to the New York Daily News. Some close close aides
believe one or two summer debates make sense, the Daily News said.
The rationale: Early debates would demonstrate that Bush isn't
afraid to duke it out and would lower the stakes for the three fall
debates. ``The more he does, the better he gets,'' one Bush aide
was quoted as saying. ``And it reduces the pressure on him for
October.''
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN BACKS WORK-PERMIT PROGRAM
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, the presumptive presidential candidate for the
Reform Party said he supports in theory a work-permit program that
would give some kind of temporary legal status to migrant workers
who now cross the border illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not an idea I would throw out on principle,'' he said
recently during a speech at the Arizona convention of the Reform
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan reiterated his support to severe limits to legal
immigration, an end to illegal immigration, an end to campaign soft
money and an end to U.S. participation in free trade agreements.

HOW CAN LAKERS GET BETTER NEXT SEASON?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While many Laker fans are busy converting Game 7
tickets into parade confetti, the truly fussy believers are casting
a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   An answer for Rasheed Wallace, Portland's lanky ``four'' man is
required, they say. As stunt doubles for Lakers' personnel king
Jerry West, these well-intentioned citizens continue exploring
options that could yield a superstar power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Please feel free to exhale.
</P>
<P>
   The answers for Wallace are Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.
Oh, the war effort also receives a considerable boost when
defensive pressure is applied to the entry pass needed to provide
Wallace -- the Blazers' top threat for exorcism -- with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In O'Neal and Bryant, the Lakers claim the league's premier
center and shooting guard. Don't be greedy, be thrilled. And
remember, the budget (in grim conspiracy with reality) will not
permit West to add Tim Duncan, Gary Payton and Grant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Those who fancy themselves astute followers of the Laker
``predicament'' believe the solution is free agent forward Glen
Rice. Don't re-sign him, they howl, and use the leftover loot as
bait for some available free-agent monster.
</P>
<P>
   Nice try. Even without Rice's current $7 million contract on the
books, the Lakers already are committed to a payroll of about $49
million for next season. That's $13 million more than the expected
salary cap for 2001 and just $6 million shy of the anticipated toll
both between generous teams and the dreaded luxury tax.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury tax penalty will be a million scoots for each million
spent in excess of that $55 million. West and sidekick Mitch
Kupchak may refuse to go on the record with a response to the
question of what day it is, but they love to be quoted on the
absolute impossibility of owner Jerry Buss paying such a tax.
</P>
<P>
   Armchair GMs have another trump card: sign-and-trade Rice. And
what will the Lakers get in return? Well, the name of former Phil
Jackson whipping boy Toni Kukoc (who finished the season in Philly)
continues to be published, although Kukoc also is a free agent. The
NBA says signing and swapping one free agent for another is
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Signing and trading Rice for someone still under contract is
made more challenging by the high-profit agenda of his agent, David
Falk. To equal the salary they're shipping away in Rice, the Lakers
might have to acquire the salaries of a player or players another
team doesn't want.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone else on the Laker roster is locked into
trade-prohibitive, multi-year contracts.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so how DOES West improve the roster?
</P>
<P>
   His first resource is the 29th pick in the June 28 NBA Draft.
We'll wait for your chuckling to subside. Done? Before you swallow
your tongue, it should be noted that while this year's draft is a
bit light on obvious greatness, it does offer many skilled but
ridiculously inexperienced prospects.
</P>
<P>
   West, who has taken a few mighty, late first-round cuts and
missed, did connect with Elden Campbell (No. 27), Vlade Divac (26)
and A.C. Green (23). Let's not forget Nick Van Exel, whose
pre-draft misery tour made him available in Round 2 at 37.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is the deployment of an ``exception,'' a
lowball, salary-cap safety valve that could nearly triple the
bottom line for a developing player who's been making the league
minimum. An example of such a rascal is the inexplicably athletic
Washington Wizards free agent Jahidi White, who - at 6-foot-9, 290
pounds -- could use Wallace as a scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, White probably will choose to work for one of the
many teams preparing to offer him far more than a Laker exception.
</P>
<P>
   West attempted to unleash a $2.25 million exception to snare
Charles Oakley last summer, but the Raptors power forward stayed
put, choosing a bigger paycheck and a vacation window that includes
May and early June.
</P>
<P>
   The last variables for Laker improvement are expanded roles for
rookies Devean George and point guard John Celestand. They satisfy
West's addiction to quickness and have the defensive potential to
be nastier than a turnpike men's room.
</P>
<P>
   And while cursing the leaner moments of today's Game 4, please
realize your underwear is older than O'Neal and Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Ship a Hoya to Clippers
</P>
<P>
   For a franchise that has turned surrender into a cottage
industry, it makes sense to hire a coach who wears a white towel on
his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Such a coach is ex-Georgetown University prime minister John
Thompson, whose candidacy was announced by the Clips last week.
Thompson, a childhood chum of Elgin Baylor, was interviewed
Tuesday, but is rumored to be a leading contender to become GM of
the New Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson wouldn't move West without market compensation,
something Baylor still has to convince his owner (ol'
What'shisname) to spit up.
</P>
<P>
   So while ignoring Thompson's failure to strike gold with the
1988 U.S. Olympic team and Georgetown's slide over the last decade
(he'd need an offensive coordinator in the NBA), let's explore why
Baylor would be interested in hiring the guy:
</P>
<P>
   Training camp would be a bit more severe than the virtual weanie
roast conducted by Chris Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson would demand a commitment to defense - a screaming
deficiency -- from his players.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson satisfies a presumed requirement for a high-profile''
coach, his profile seemingly higher than the collective philosophy
of Cheech &AMP; Chong.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson could provide a persuasive nature to free-agent
bidding; his relationships with former G'town heroes now starring
in the NBA earning immediate respect (in theory) from other
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Clipper Tyrone Nesby probably wouldn't be allowed to use the
word ``baby'' as a sentence-capper when addressing Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's looming presence might discourage Lamar Odom from
crying about the officiating; if it doesn't, Thompson still has
that towel.
</P>
<P>
   According to legend, the team owner hates the notion of paying
long money to short people. Alleged former candidate Mike Fratello
is shorter than the Clippers' attention span; Thompson is 6-10.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   With thumbs-up workouts for the Lakers and Clippers last week,
UCLA freshman Jason Kapono has generated considerable first-round
chatter. The ex-Artesia High forward is expected to dump his
collegiate eligibility this week by formally signing with agent Arn
Tellem. According to sources, Kapono was planning to be a Westwood
goner anyway, possibly exploring options in Europe if the NBA
didn't become an immediate reality. ... Schea Cotton (St. John
Bosco, Long Beach City College, Alabama) will join Fresno high
school hotshot DeShawn Stevenson for a dress rehearsal in front of
the Clippers on Tuesday. ... Widespread rumors that LSU sophomore
Stromile Swift is terrified of being chosen by the Clippers at No.
3 have been diluted by tentative (and reciprocal) plans for the
springy forward to visit the Clips after the Chicago pre-draft camp
(June 6-12). ... The latest Gary Payton trade rumor is an old one:
GP to Minnesota for Terrell Brandon and other expendable T-Wolves
who can make up any difference in salary. Eagerness by Sonics coach
Paul Westphal to remove an enormous distraction in Payton (who
happens to be the league's best player at his position) brings an
element of truth to the deal. But Brandon's agent, Bill Duffy (the
college roommate of T'wolves GM Kevin McHale), said talk of such a
trade is a bit cold right now. ... The trade winds keep blowin'
Dikembe Mutombo's name across internet pages, but his $14.5 million
salary (in the last year of his current deal), makes any deal
dicey. The Hawks, hungry for cap space next summer, may want to
acquire short contracts and a high draft pick in return. ... A
source close to Detroit free agent Grant Hill says constant gossip
about the superstar forward's move to Orlando is right on the
money. ... The given name of Portland's second-year guard is Gawen
Deangelo Wells. You can call him ``Bonzi.'' But if you're Chick
Hearn, you can call him ``Banzai.'' &QL;

finish with last season's records:
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. Houston Comets, 26-6, won WNBA title
</P>
<P>
   The league's best team still has the Big Three of Sheryl
Swoopes, Tina Thompson and Cynthia Cooper. Even without a
dominating point guard or consistent center, the Comets are the
favorite to win the title, again.
</P>
<P>
   2. Sacramento Monarchs, 19-13, reached playoffs
</P>
<P>
   With a backcourt of Ticha Penicheiro and Ruthie Bolton-Holifield
plus WNBA Player of the Year/Defensive Player of the Year Yolanda
Griffith, the Monarchs might have the best chance to knock off
Houston. They just need to stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   3. Los Angeles Sparks, 20-12, reached Western Conference Finals
</P>
<P>
   Center Lisa Leslie showed last season she can lead a team and
forward DeLisha Milton is a nice complement. But Los Angeles must
have some backcourt stability to win to challenge Houston or
Sacramento in a playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   4. Phoenix Mercury, 15-17
</P>
<P>
   Coach Cheryl Miller has a mini Big Three in Michele Timms,
Jennifer Gillom and Tonya Edwards, but this team is erratic and
isn't deep enough to challenge the top three teams in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   5. Utah Starzz, 15-17
</P>
<P>
   Guard Jennifer Azzi has a broken shooting hand and is lost for
most of the season. This means frontcourt players Margo Dydek and
Natalie Williams will have to do most of the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   6. Minnesota Lynx, 15-17
</P>
<P>
   Coach Brian Agler remade much of his roster, but still has guard
Katie Smith and three solid rookies in Grace Daley, Betty Lennox
and Maylana Martin.
</P>
<P>

   When former Houston point guard Sonja Henning is one of your

Cowboys' Greg Ellis determined to return for season opener 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ More than five months after breaking his left
leg in two places while chasing Philadelphia Eagles quarterback
Donovan McNabb out of bounds Dec. 12 at Texas Stadium, Cowboys
defensive end Greg Ellis is finding that he must deal as much with
the psychological as the physical part of his rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Team doctors and trainers agree Ellis is ahead of schedule, and
Ellis considers it a ``realistic goal'' to be ready for the
Cowboys' regular-season opener Sept. 3 against ... yes,
Philadelphia at Texas Stadium. However, there are still moments,
usually once a week, that he wonders if he will ever play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, there are days when I feel like, man,
football is probably over,'' said Ellis, who required a titanium
rod and three surgical screws inserted in his leg to assist in the
healing process.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the screws were removed Feb. 10. The rod and one screw
will remain in his leg for as long as he plays in the NFL, Ellis
has decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never having been hurt like this before, I still find it hard
sometimes to visualize running \Rin a game\S, leaning hard, coming
off a corner the way we do, especially a defensive end,'' Ellis
said. ``I stop and imagine, `What if this is it?' That \Rquestion\S
comes into my mind about once every week _ real strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever that does happen, Ellis often receives a psychological
lift from Cowboys assistant trainer Britt Brown, who reminds the
Cowboys' 1998 first-round draft pick: ``We have plenty of time.
You're doing great. Just keep working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis was particularly encouraged by a recent phone conversation
with San Francisco 49ers defensive tackle Bryant Young, who had a
Pro Bowl season in 1999 after coming back from similar leg injuries
against the New York Giants on Nov. 30, 1998. Young, four years
older than Ellis, was in the 49ers' starting lineup for the Sept.
12 season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just talking to him made me feel blessed,'' said Ellis, who
had never met or spoken with Young before phoning him on Thursday.
``He was forced to go through more than I've gone through, really.
He spent 17 days in the hospital, including one day in intensive
care because of an infection that he got in his leg. I didn't have
any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young also told Ellis that he will have ``bad days and
top-of-the-world days,'' and to forget the former and cherish the
latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the biggest thing he told me was that he's now
feeling pretty much his normal self,'' Ellis said. ``While I know
everybody is different, that's really encouraging to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis is an extremely hard worker. Coach Dave Campo points to
``Greg's character'' as a prime reason to believe that the
third-year veteran will be ready for the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``People probably don't think big, strong athletes can
appreciate something as small as being able to run or plant or
cut,'' Ellis said. ``But I'm doing those things now ... and they're
large to me.''
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks, Ellis has been running all out, although he was
held out of group and team drills again last week during a
voluntary quarterback school at Valley Ranch. Trainers and coaches
actually have had to hold Ellis back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg is hardheaded, that's with everything,'' said teammate
Ebenezer Ekuban, who has been a close friend of Ellis since their
college days together at North Carolina. ``If it takes four seconds
to get to the quarterback, Greg thinks he can be there in two
\Rseconds\S.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so determined. He works out five hours a day, five days a
week. That's just Greg. We need him back, not only for his football
ability but for his leadership as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis remembers his ``low point'' being when he couldn't push a
rubber tube with his leg during the first part of rehabilitation
after surgery. This is someone who normally squats 400 to 450
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, Ellis has watched the video tape of that fateful
third-and-three play in the first quarter on Dec. 12 when McNabb
scrambled around right end for 3 yards. In pursuit, Alonzo Spellman
and Ellis collided just as the Eagles quarterback ducked out of
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alonzo and I both tried to get the quarterback ... and ended
up getting each other,'' said Ellis, whose wife, Tangie, saw the
videotape replay for the first time two weeks ago when she happened
to walk into a room where Greg was watching it.
</P>
<P>
   What haunts him about that play is that it appears so routine,
so harmless, so out of bounds as the play ended up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always going to have the question in your mind: `Why
did it have to happen?' '' Ellis has asked himself countless times.
``Everybody was going hard to the ball, then \RMcNabb\S ran out of
bounds. If I only had bailed out ... ''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't bail out.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Ellis never does. nn

YANKEES RIP RED SOX

<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Wasdin was still walking out to the visiting
bullpen when he heard a voice from on high. It was Yankee Stadium
PA announcer Bob Sheppard, who only sounds like God, proclaiming
that Jason Grimsley, and not Orlando Hernandez, would be starting
for the Yankees Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to El Duque?'' Wasdin was still wondering after
the game, an 8-3 Yankees win that turned more on what happened to
Wasdin and the Sox bullpen than it did on what befell the Yankees'
Cuban ace.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who pitched the clinching game of the ALCS against
the Red Sox last October and had not allowed a run by Boston in
Yankee Stadium in two regular-season starts, felt some tightness in
his upper back while warming up and was a late scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But no El Duque did not translate into a reprieve for the Red
Sox, as the Yankees relied on accidental starter Grimsley and two
other relievers, Mike Stanton and Mariano Rivera, plus four home
runs, to put away the Sox before another packed house (55,671) in
the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The win drew the Yankees, who rebounded from a 4-1 loss Friday
night and a 3-0 deficit after three innings Saturday, back into a
first-place tie with the Red Sox, adding even more flavor to what
already promises to be an overheated rubber match Sunday night,
when Pedro Martinez and Roger Clemens reprise last October's
much-hyped duel.
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin, meanwhile, was on the mound in the sixth Saturday when
the Yankees broke a 3-3 tie with five runs. Jorge Posada gave the
Bombers their first lead when he opened the inning with a home run
off Wasdin, who was taken aback less by the way-back than by what
the Yankees put together with two outs and nobody on.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Bellinger, the ninth hitter in the Yankee order, singled
and stole second, Ricky Ledee walked, and Derek Jeter singled home
Bellinger to make it 5-3. Jimy Williams dipped into his bullpen
again for lefthander Tim Young _ Rheal Cormier already had answered
an unusually early call when he replaced starter Brian Rose in the
fifth _ and Young was schooled by Paul O'Neill, who hit a three-run
home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, Jeter's hit was big,'' Wasdin said. ``That's what
kept the inning alive. First batter hits a home run, and it's
shoot, we're down by a run, but with two outs and two men on, a
two-out clutch hit by Jeter is huge _ it led to the (O'Neill) home
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter had three singles, stole a base, and scored ahead of
O'Neill's home run in his first game back from the disabled list.
He clearly had a better time of it than Nomar Garciaparra, who also
came off the DL and had a single and walk in four plate
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get Bellinger or Ledee, it's a different story, and Jeter
never gets a chance,'' Wasdin said. ``But he hit a good pitch _ a
curveball _ and he did what he could with it. It didn't seem like
he missed a step. I didn't see either shortstop miss a step.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was inclined to fault his management of the bullpen. He
had Tim Wakefield warming up in the third when Rose gave up a run
after hitting Ledee with two outs and nobody on and was spared
further damage by Jeff Frye's diving play on Tino Martinez's smash
with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   But with the game even in the sixth, Wakefield was sitting when
Wasdin was summoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever,'' said Wakefield, who eventually pitched a mopup
eighth, ``but I don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who left Jeter stranded on third in the fifth when
Cormier entered to retire O'Neill, Bernie Williams, and Tino
Martinez in succession, said he could have called on Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have gone to Wakefield, but I went to Wasdin,'' he
said. ``He's got a good arm, he's been pitching pretty good. If
there was any mistake there, it's mine, not his. I put him out
there. Blame me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox scored all of their runs in the third off Grimsley. John
Valentin homered to open the inning, Frye's double put Darren Lewis
in position to score on a wild pitch, and Trot Nixon's perfectly
executed suicide squeeze scored Frye to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley hit the next batter, Brian Daubach, in the left knee
with his next pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he tried to hit me at all,'' Daubach said.
``Look at how I had to get out of the way on my first at-bat. It
looks bad after a squeeze, I guess, but those guys always pitch me
in. They probably hit me more than anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he wasn't trying to. Besides, he's got something like a
10th-degree black belt. I didn't even look at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley may indeed have been blameless, just as Rose may have
been when he hit Ledee in the exact same spot with two outs and
nobody on in the bottom of the third. It just didn't look that way
in either case. Ledee said that just before he went to the plate,
he borrowed a bat from Wilson Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was no way I was going to use it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been pitching inside all game long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee came around to score, Shane Spencer hit a bases-empty home
run in the fourth, and Rose was gone after Ledee hit his first
pitch of the fifth for a home run and Jeter followed with another
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``First-pitch changeup, and I think he was looking for it,''
Rose said. ``We had a lead and I was trying to keep it. But then
you go up and give up a first-pitch home run, that doesn't set you
off too well.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley gave way to Stanton after the fifth. The lefthander
gave up six hits in three innings, but the Sox couldn't capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a battle of the bullpens,'' Wasdin said, ``and they won
today.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hub hubris. Boston baseball fans _ and there are a
lot of them in the Apple this weekend _ were full of themselves.
Members of the Nation were getting cocky about the Red Sox' sudden
dominance of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's win made it four straight (regular season) Red
Sox victories in Yankee Stadium and a 9-4 record there over two
years. When Boston bolted to a 3-0 lead Saturday, there was a
serious prospect of another Bronx sweep. With Pedro Martinez going
Sunday night, there was a good chance of the Sox leaving the Apple
with a three-game lead over the staggering world champs.
</P>
<P>
   The planets were in line. The Yanks were suddenly vulnerable.
Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez (a late scratch because of shoulder
pain) was the latest New Yorker to go down and Boston talk-show
callers were touting Carl Everett over Bernie Williams, Derek Lowe
over Mariano Rivera, and Tom Menino over Rudy Giuliani. The Yanks
were free-falling, just like the guy who leaped out of the upper
deck Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Sox fans, it all unraveled on this field where
so many bad things have happened over the years. In the 913th New
York meeting between these signature franchises, the Yanks
re-emerged as Bronx Bombers, hitting four homers in three innings
en route to an 8-3 victory. All the good feeling and confidence
vanished faster than a John Wasdin gopher ball.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, who returned from the shelf the same day as his
half-brother, Nomar Garciaparra, had a greater impact on his team,
cracking three hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been playing well,'' said the Yankees shortstop.
``But hopefully we can start playing well and now we can focus on
Pedro for tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the New Yorkers are a band on the run. Certainly since the
end of last season the Red Sox are improved and the Yankees have
softened. The perceived vulnerability of the champs has been a
universal theme in seamhead circles this spring and Sox watchers
are certain that this will be the year.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch can't throw to first and has hinted he might
retire. Chili Davis retired and Darryl Strawberry is in drug rehab.
Roger Clemens and David Cone have struggled and now El Duque is
hurting. The Yanks missed Jeter (4-8) more than the Sox missed
Garciaparra (8-5).
</P>
<P>
   Yankees hurler Mike Stanton, who got the win Saturday, said the
champs were inspired by the return of their leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take somebody out, obviously it's going to hurt,''
said the lefthander. ``It's hard to go out there every day and
cover for someone the caliber of Derek for a long period of time.
He brings excitement. With him in the stadium, even the fans act
different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Derek back is a huge shot for us, no doubt,'' said
veteran outfielder Paul O'Neill. ``He does a lot of things for this
team. This was a good day for us. We lost El Duque at the start,
then fell behind, but we battled back.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a decidedly good day for the Pinstripers. The 2000 Red
Sox are emerging as media darlings and sleeper favorites to end the
Yankee dynasty. Remember that it was the 1975 Sox who dethroned the
invincible, three-time defending champion Oakland A's in a
three-game playoff sweep. Saturday's game was the Sox' first
network TV appearance of the season, and Sunday night will be the
second. It was beginning to look like the Sox had the Yankees on
the run.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeter's return made things normal for the New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really gave us a lift, no question,'' said manager Joe
Torre. ``We've been inconsistent without him. His coming back gave
us a little sense of security. He lights it up. He could have felt
a great deal of responsibility and pressure, but he just loves to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be mentioned that this might have been a day when the
Red Sox' unflagging insistence of frontier justice came back to
hurt them. In the third inning, Jeff Frye (running) and Trot Nixon
(bunting) executed one of the prettiest suicide squeezes you will
ever see. The run made it 3-0, but Yankee pitcher Jason Grimsley
seemed offended and hit Brian Daubach on the right knee with the
next pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rose was cruising in the bottom of the third with a 3-0
lead and there were two outs and nobody aboard when Rose
retaliated, hitting Ricky Ledee in the same spot. Ledee wound up
scoring when Jeter and O'Neill followed with singles. Rose never
got an out in the fifth and turned a 3-3 game over to the bullpen.
Perhaps payback is not always the best revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro goes Sunday night. Against Roger. Winner takes first place
into Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this is a big series because it's against Boston,''
said Jeter. ``But we keep things in perspective. It's only May.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't try telling Sox fans it's only May. Not if Pedro wins
Sunday night.

MAURICE RICHARD, 78, MONTREAL'S GOAL-SCORING HERO 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maurice Richard, the charismatic star of the Montreal Canadiens
through the 1940s and 1950s known as the Rocket, one of the most
electrifying goal-scorers in National Hockey League history and a
revered figure in French-speaking Canada, died Saturday in a
hospital in Montreal. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   He had been suffering from stomach cancer and Parkinson's
disease, and he was hospitalized early this month.
</P>
<P>
   Streaking down the right wing at the old Montreal Forum,
muscling or feinting his way past defensemen, then unleashing the
finest shot in hockey, Rocket Richard epitomized the elan that
brought the Canadiens the sobriquet the Flying Frenchmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Maurice is worked up, his eyes gleam like headlights,''
Frank Selke, the Canadiens general manager during the Richard
years, once remarked. ``Not a glow, but a piercing intensity.
Goalies have said he's like a car coming at you at night. He is
terrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordie Howe, the Detroit Red Wings star who vied with Richard
for acclaim as hockey's greatest star of the postwar decades, said:
``There was nobody like him for putting the puck in. He was so
accurate with his shot _ and determined. You could see it in those
crazy eyes. They'd open right up like sockets or camera lenses as
he was going in on goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard starred for Montreal teams that won the Stanley Cup in
1944, '46 and '53, and then captured an unprecedented five
consecutive NHL titles from 1956 to 1960. In an 18-year career
spent entirely with the Canadiens, he scored 544 regular-season
goals. And he was devastating in the playoffs, amassing 82 goals in
133 games, including a league-record six overtime goals.
</P>
<P>
   Richard was the first player to score 50 goals in a season and
led the league in goals five times. He was a perennial All-Star,
won the Hart trophy as the league's most valuable player in 1947
and entered the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961, only one year after he
retired.
</P>
<P>
   The Maurice Richard Trophy, instituted in the 1998-99 season, is
awarded to the league's leading goal-scorer.
</P>
<P>
   For Richard, scoring involved no master strategy: ``I never
planned a play in advance. Whenever there was a break, a chance in
front of the net, I'd try to pick a spot or try to beat the
goalkeeper. Everything I did was spontaneous and every play I made
seemed to be different than the one before.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Henri Maurice Richard was born on Aug. 4, 1921, in
Montreal, the son of a former semipro hockey player who worked at a
Canadian Pacific railway shop. He played hockey on ponds and
listened every Saturday night to the French-language broadcasts of
Canadiens games, following the exploits of the enormously popular
wing Howie Morenz. In the years to come, only Richard would rival
Morenz as a Canadien icon.
</P>
<P>
   After playing junior hockey while in high school, Richard joined
the Canadiens' farm team in Montreal. Despite suffering serious
injuries in each of his two seasons with that club, he was brought
up by the Canadiens in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   He broke an ankle early in his rookie season but was playing
regularly by the following season while gaining exemption from the
World War II draft by working during the day as a war-plant
machinist.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was a left-handed shooter, Richard was installed at
right wing, meaning he would often have to go to his backhand. He
developed the backhander into a weapon and flourished alongside
Elmer Lach at center and Toe Blake at left wing, a combination
known as the Punch Line for its scoring prowess.
</P>
<P>
   In his second season, Richard became known as the Rocket, the
nickname coined at a practice session against the line of Phil
Watson, Murphy Chamberlain and Ray Getliffe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really flying, and one day, when I got up a full head of
steam, one of them said, `Watch out, here comes the Rocket,'''
Richard recalled in ``The Flying Frenchmen'' (Hawthorne Books,
1971), written with Stan Fischler. ``There were a few newspapermen
at the practice session that day, and they heard Watson,
Chamberlain and Getliffe yelling at me, and calling me the Rocket.
The next day the nickname appeared in the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard scored 32 goals in the 1943-44 season as Montreal won
its first Stanley Cup in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944-45, he scored 50 goals in a 50-game season, breaking the
NHL single-season record of 44, set by Montreal's Joe Malone in
1917-18. No one would score more goals until Chicago's Bobby Hull
got 54 in 1965-66, playing a 70-game schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Richard would be harassed by rough-and-tumble players assigned
to shadow him. He retaliated with his fists and his stick, engaging
in memorable brawls, and sometimes he took his wrath out on the
officials.
</P>
<P>
   He was fined $500 by the NHL in March 1951 for grabbing the
referee Hugh McLean around the neck in the lobby of a Manhattan
hotel, angry about a misconduct penalty the official gave him the
night before.
</P>
<P>
   Richard's temper set off a notorious series of events four years
later.
</P>
<P>
   After being checked hard by the Bruins' Hal Laycoe and cut by
Laycoe's stick in a game at Boston Garden on March 13, 1955,
Richard went after the player. When a linesman, Cliff Thompson,
intervened, Richard punched the official.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that stunned Montreal fans, the NHL president,
Clarence Campbell, suspended Richard for the final three games of
the regular season and all of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens were battling the Red Wings for first place, and
Richard was leading his teammate Bernie Geoffrion by 4 points in
the race for the league scoring title, which Richard had never won.
</P>
<P>
   When Montreal played Detroit at the Forum on March 17, Richard
was in the stands. Campbell, who made his headquarters in Montreal,
sat in his private box despite having received scores of angry
letters from Canadiens fans, many accusing him of ethnic bias
against French-Canadians. Montreal's mayor and police chief had
warned Campbell to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   The fans pelted Campbell with vegetables and fruit, and someone
set off a tear-gas bomb. When the game was forfeited to Detroit
after the first period, with the Wings leading by 4-1, the crowds
streamed into Ste.-Catherine Street. Windows were smashed, stores
were looted and newsstands were set afire in what became known as
the Richard Riot.
</P>
<P>
   Richard went on the radio the next day to urge calm, but the
Canadiens' title quest and his personal scoring race would suffer.
Montreal finished second to Detroit and lost to the Red Wings in
the Stanley Cup finals. Richard lost the scoring title to Geoffrion
by a point, and he would never capture that crown.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Canadiens coach Dick Irvin, credited by Richard
with teaching him everything he knew, was fired after the season,
in part because management felt he could not control Richard's
temper.
</P>
<P>
   But the most glorious chapter of Canadiens history was
unfolding. Under the new coach, Toe Blake, Richard's old linemate,
Montreal won the next five Stanley Cups, and now the team had two
Richards in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Richard's brother Henri, a center known as the Pocket
Rocket, became a Canadien in 1955-56, skated as his linemate and
would join him in the Hall of Fame. The Montreal teams of the late
1950s, also boasting Geoffrion, Jean Beliveau, Dickie Moore and
Bert Olmstead at forward, Doug Harvey on defense and Jacques Plante
in goal, were among the greatest in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   Richard retired in September 1960 and then held a public
relations position with the Canadiens for several years. In 1972 he
had an abortive stint as coach of the World Hockey Association's
Quebec Nordiques, running the club for two games and then quitting,
reportedly because of nervous strain. He also ran a fishing-supply
business out of his home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Richard was surpassed as hockey's leading goal-scorer
by Howe. But he remained a storied figure in Montreal Canadiens
history and in recent years served as a Canadiens ambassador,
representing the team at special events.
</P>
<P>
   Richard and his wife, Lucille, who died in 1994, had 7 children
and 14 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of March 11, 1996, Richard stood at center ice at
the Forum at ceremonies closing the 72-year-old building, which was
replaced as the Canadiens' home by the Molson Center. He dabbed at
his eyes as he received a huge ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserved it,'' said Guy Lafleur, one of the Canadiens stars
on the ice that evening with Richard. ``He's the guy who started
the history of the Montreal Canadiens.''

COLLEGE EXODUS CONTINUTES; WILL THEY EVER LEARN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY 
c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ UCLA coach Steve Lavin got a call a few days
ago from one of his former players, Baron Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got gray hair yet, coach?'' Davis cracked.
</P>
<P>
   If only it were a laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   The list of early-entry candidates for the NBA draft is out, and
no one took a harder hit than Lavin, who could lose three players.
Unless it's Florida's Billy Donovan, who's losing two and has seen
a top three program take a big dive.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, which still would have Davis had he stayed in school, is
losing Jerome Moiso, JaRon Rush, and possibly Jason Kapono. None
has spent more than two years at school. Florida is losing its best
player, Mike Miller, after only two years and Donnell Harvey, a
rebounding small forward, after only one.
</P>
<P>
   College basketball has its faults, but in the ongoing exodus of
players to the perceived land of riches, it is only partly to
blame. The NBA and its union talk a lot about the situation and do
nothing, except offer these kids 3-5 years of guaranteed money.
What are they supposed to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back to square one now,'' Donovan said. ``I wish they'd
do something like baseball, where if you step on a campus, you're
there for a certain number of years. It's better for us. It's
better for the NBA. You look at Jonathan Bender, Corey Maggette.
They can't even get into a game. And after the first five picks
this year, who is going to do anything?''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said he had Miller talk to Michael Jordan, Magic
Johnson, other coaches, and general managers (including Indiana's
Donnie Walsh, who has drafted high schoolers in each of the last
two years). They all said the same thing: Stay in school, kid.
</P>
<P>
   But when Miller asked where he was likely to be drafted, they
all said the same thing: five to eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he supposed to say then?'' Donovan said. ``I don't
think he's ready for an 82-game schedule. He keeps telling me about
the players who are in the draft and that he's better than most of
them. I tell him, `Don't look at those names.' You should be
looking at Mitch Richmond, Jalen Rose, Scottie Pippen. Those are
the guys you have play against. You've got no shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin was not surprised that Moiso left early. He's an ``old''
sophomore and speaks three languages. He has played overseas. Rush
had his troubles with the NCAA. Kapono? Who knows? He can shoot.
But both Rush and Kapono may not even be first-rounders. Moiso, who
Lavin thinks has the best upside of anyone in the draft, is a
likely lottery pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' Lavin said. ``One day, you hope the pendulum
swings back and education and a degree become priorities again. But
you can't daydream. I was doing that the other day. I was thinking,
`We'd still have Baron for one more year and the other players.' We
have two good recruits coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't do that, even if it does start to cross your
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;

   Over the years, there have been countless horror stories from
Europe. Marty Conlon and Dominique Wilkins are among many who went
across the pond and came back with their wallets thinner and their
faith shaken. Those kind of stories may soon be history if a new
organization has its way. The just-announced American International
Players Association now gives players outside the NBA a central
body to handle disputes. ``It's long overdue,'' said player agent
Tom McLaughlin, whose chief European client, David Rivers, is the
CEO of the new organization. Seven other European players are on
the AIPA board, including Wendell Alexis, a Euro veteran, and Steve
Bucknall, who plays in England. ``We all know about the problems
they have,'' McLaughlin said. ``I know what it's like. I played
over there for three years.'' There's still much work to be done to
get everything aboveboard. There is no standard player contract.
Individual teams can grease palms with ``carrying charges,'' as
Sidney Greenstreet would say. The AIPA wants to standardize the
process overseas, go global, and get every team on board. That may
be easier said than done, given the wide disparity of teams
overseas. Still, the AIPA already has had discussions with FIBA,
the sport's international governing body. McLaughlin says the
response of the players has been ``tremendous.'' Many ex-players
have told him they wish there had been a similar body when they
played in Europe. ``Playing in Europe can be a great experience,''
McLaughlin said. ``This can make it that way for everyone.'' . . .
You think the Knicks would like Latrell Sprewell to be a more
reliable go-to guy against Indiana? Over a stretch of seven games,
including the first two of the Eastern Conference finals, Sprewell
was 3 of 24 from the field in the fourth quarter . . . If you've
seen the movie ``Frequency,'' then you know that actor Jim Caviezel
is a deadbolt lock for the lead in ``The John Stockton Story.'' If
you could replicate a young Ron Howard to play Jeff Hornacek, then
you'd be on to something . . . Who wins more games next season:
Hawks rejector Tom Izzo or Hawks coach Lon Kruger? . . . Meanwhile,
ex-Laker Byron Scott is still on the lists of the Grizzlies and
Pacers, although Larry Bird favors Rick Carlisle to succeed him in
Indiana. Look for Carlisle also to be courted by the Grizzlies.
Vancouver's new player boss is Billy Knight, who came over from
Indiana. And new Vancouver ``consultant'' Chuck Daly (read: money
for nothing) had Carlisle on his staff during the years he coached
in New Jersey (1992-94) . . . If Lenny Wilkens is unable to land an
NBA job, it will be the first time since 1985-86 that he has not
been a head coach in the league . . . The Celtics had Michigan
State's Morris Peterson in for a workout Friday as they start to
evaluate the players who could be around at No. 11. One
complicating factor is that many of the top draftees are
represented by SFX, the conglomerate that bought out David Falk and
Arn Tellem (although they still represent and browbeat, er,
negotiate). And SFX doesn't want two of its players competing
against each other in workouts, so that makes it harder on teams.
SFX already has Peterson, Miller, Moiso, Quentin Richardson, Darius
Miles, DeShawn Stevenson, Etan Thomas, Jamal Magliore, and Hanno
Mottola . . . So would the Celtics be wise to take a serious run at
free agent Adonal Foyle? ``I'm not sure how he would fit in with
the way Rick (Pitino) likes to coach,'' said former Warriors coach
P.J. Carlesimo. ``He still doesn't really know how to play
basketball. He still plays a lot like a kid from another country,
sort of programmed. I may be in the minority, but I still like the
kid. He does have a big upside. He's smart. He's willing to learn.
He is an NBA rebounder and shot-blocker. He has most of the
intangibles. I think he can be a very effective 10-year player in
the league.'' If Foyle is looking to relocate, he could do a lot
worse than Boston, which has a large and active Colgate alumni
association, including former Patriots player Ray Ilg and
investment mogul John Wilkins . . . Here's what Jordan should have
done in the first place: kept Darrell Walker and lived with him,
and the inevitable losses, for the next couple years and then gone
out and got a big-time coach. By that time, the Wizards might be
worth watching, let alone coaching. It's still not too late for
Jordan to do the obvious. Walker wants the work, comes relatively
cheap, and the Wizards won't go anywhere regardless of who coaches
them next season . . . Old friend Kevin Gamble is back in the news.
The ex-Celtic has been hired to coach the Glenwood High School boys
team outside his home of Springfield, Ill. But there seems to be a
minor snafu. Gamble lacks a college degree and teaching experience,
and that has resulted in some opposition to the move. An official
in the school district was quoted as saying a teacher is better
qualified to be a coach. Gamble said he applied to be the coach;
that was the job description. The school board will act on the
matter next month. Gamble says he is one semester shy of a college
degree and hopes to complete it at the University of Illinois at
Springfield.

   Pat Riley said many things last week following yet another
painful playoff exit. Riley said he will be back in Miami and so
will the bulk of his team, though no one believes him. He also took
Jamal Mashburn off the hook for passing up the potential
game-winning shot in Game 7. Mashburn, who finished hideously in
Games 6 and 7, passed to Clarence Weatherspoon, who, of course,
missed. ``The one thing that blows my mind a little bit is the
criticism that Jamal is getting on the last shot,'' Riley said. The
coach said he is to blame for not diagramming the proper spacing
and for urging Mashburn to try to take it to the basket. Mashburn
never got the chance. He was double-teamed. ``The double-team came
quick,'' said Riley. ``Guys didn't get to their spots. And now Mash
is being taken to task. That's my fault. That's not his fault. He
was expected to drive the ball and create a helping situation. The
fact that he wouldn't shoot the ball is b.s. _ absolute b.s. And
people are going to take him to task. It's a bitter way for a young
man who has come all the way for us to have that. I'm the one who
drew the play. I'm the one that gave him the instruction. I'm the
one who told the guys to put the ball on the floor and maybe we
might get one of those tough fouls.'' Riley also said that he would
add to what he has to get the club over the proverbial hump. He
wants Tim Hardaway back, if Hardaway regains his health. Isaiah
Rider? ``That will be on the list,'' he said. And himself? ``I want
to go through it again and again and again and again and again and
again and again,'' said Riley. ``I'm going through it again. I have
no second thoughts about it. I'm going through it again. I'm coming
back and I'm coming back and I'm coming back and I'm coming back''
OK, but what will you be coaching? ``I know what it takes to win
and I know the kind of people that you have to have,'' Riley said.
``I do think we need to step up in some areas. But we have a great,
great, great core and you don't want to mess with that, because you
can go back, back to ground-zero quick. The next time this team is
stripped down and rebuilt, I won't be coaching it. So, if that says
anything, then you know where I'm coming from. That would be
someone else's job. But, we will continue to try to augment the
solid players that we have and go from there. I think that's how
you do it.''

LABOR PEACE STILL IN ONE PIECE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The clock is ticking again on labor peace in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Although the present bargaining agreement has three years
remaining, the final year can be voided by either side, a decision
due by Dec. 1. A void would make the 2003 season an uncapped year;
teams could pay as much as they want to players.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first free agency agreement was reached in 1994, a
deadline has approached twice, and extensions have been hammered
out.
</P>
<P>
   Now owners and the NFL Players Association face another
seven-month deadline, and the posturing has already begun. During
last week's owners meetings in Baltimore, Pittsburgh Steelers owner
Dan Rooney said the game needed a harder salary cap that would
count all signing bonuses the same year they are paid.
</P>
<P>
   Under the present system, such bonuses are spread over the life
of each contract, an accounting maneuver that allows only a portion
of the bonus to count in any one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cash over cap creates problems for some teams,'' Rooney
said.
</P>
<P>
   NFLPA executive director Gene Upshaw pointed out that signing
bonuses are the only guaranteed money in most NFL contracts, and
sources within the union are adamant that players will never
renegotiate what they consider the cornerstones of their labor
agreement: 1. signing bonuses are to be spread over the life of the
contract; 2. free agency is conferred after four years; 3. players
have the right to renegotiate; 4. the labor agreement ends with the
final year uncapped if the contract is not extended.
</P>
<P>
   The union maintains that the threat of the uncapped year has
kept labor peace for seven years. It has spurred two extensions and
is likely to force a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way the union would allow those things to change
would be if we had an entirely different executive board and none
of the present staff was left,'' a union source said last week.
``Telling the players we wanted to negotiate away one of those
cornerstones would be the quickest way for all of us to be ridden
out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   The union contends the system has worked well for both sides.
Players receive 64 percent of designated gross revenues and have a
limited form of free agency. Although there are few guaranteed
contracts, there are guaranteed signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   On the owners' side, franchises are skyrocketing in value, and
more teams are in playoff contention late into the season because,
unlike baseball and basketball, nearly every team makes enough to
compete in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can argue that the contract can be improved on both
sides, but the owners can't argue that it's been bad for
professional football,'' said NFLPA assistant executive director
Doug Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney wants a tighter rein on teams that have worked around the
cap (some say violated it) such as Dallas and San Francisco, but
Allen has a different view.
</P>
<P>
   Who has lost under the present system?
</P>
<P>
   No one.
</P>
<P>

   Could Bruce Armstrong find a home in San Francisco? Probably
not, but Armstrong doesn't have a contract, and the 49ers just lost
starter Dave Fiore to another knee injury. Fiore started at left
tackle last year and is expected back by the start of the season,
but the 49ers don't have an experienced backup, and frankly, Fiore
couldn't carry Armstrong's knee braces on his best day. Salary cap
problems would probably preclude the 49ers from signing Armstrong,
but they will clear some space after June 1 by dumping Gabe Wilkins
. . . The Rams and Titans have been negotiating a deal to train
together for several days this summer, most likely at the Rams'
camp at Western Illinois University. They also play an exhibition
game Aug. 14 in Tennessee . . . Bengals running back Corey Dillon
is facing a Thursday deadline if he doesn't accept the team's
five-year, $18.3 million offer (which he believes is insufficient
because it does not average $5 million a year). He could be stuck
with a one-year tender offer of $1.371 million, and if he refuses
to sign that by June 15, the Bengals could slash the offer to 110
percent of last year's $503,250 salary. Club owner Mike Brown has
promised he will do just that, despite the fact that Dillon has
rushed for more than 1,100 yards each of the past three seasons.
Last year, Dillon averaged 4.6 yards a carry, best in the AFC. But
if you take out two games against the Browns and one against the
49ers, he averaged only 3.9 yards a carry, with one touchdown.
Still, the guy can run, and if the Bengals don't pay him fairly,
he'll be running elsewhere in 2001 . . . The NFL lost another solid
guy when assistant scouting director John Wooten retired from the
Baltimore Ravens last week after 36 years in the league. Wooten was
one of the league's best guards for 10 years with the Browns and
Redskins before moving into personnel . . . Three months ago, the
agent for defensive end Simeon Rice told the Arizona Cardinals his
client would sit out the season if he wasn't traded because the
club had made Rice its franchise player. Rice told a Phoenix radio
station last week he would play ``under the right circumstances.''
Which means drop the franchise tag and give him a huge raise. Rice
finished second in the league in sacks last year with 16 1/2. Not
so long ago, it appeared the Cardinals would have one of the
strongest front fours in football, but tackle Mark Smith is an
unsigned restricted free agent, former Pro Bowl tackle Eric Swann
will likely be released for salary cap reasons, and young end Andre
Wadsworth is coming off a slow-healing knee injury. That makes
Rice's bargaining position stronger. However, with the franchise
label, his only option is to sit out . . . The Atlanta Falcons
became the first team to sign all of their draft picks when they
brought seventh-rounder Mareno Philyaw into the fold. Atlanta,
which did not have a first-round pick, signed second-round choice
Travis Claridge to a four-year deal worth $3.224 million last week
. . . Things seem to be going from bad to worse for former Boston
College tight end Mark Chmura. He has been charged with
third-degree sexual assault, and preliminary hearings begin Tuesday
in Waukesha, Wis. Chmura will likely be cut by the Packers this
week. The team did not invite him to its recent passing camp, which
began a day after he was formally charged, and the Packers drafted
Miami tight end Bubba Franks less than a week after Chmura's
arrest. In a recent poll, Wisconsin residents said the incident
changed their thinking about voting for state funds to renovate
Lambeau Field.

   Browns head coach Chris Palmer couldn't be happier every time he
sees linebacker Rahim Abdullah. Abdullah was considered too small
to hold up against some of the league's blocking tight ends, but he
added nearly 30 pounds and is tipping the scales at 255 . . . For
four years, Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet waged an off-field
war after Johnson called Chrebet the ``team mascot'' in a book.
Chrebet caught 84 passes in 1996 and gained 1,083 yards in 1998 but
had a subpar season last year, missing five games with a broken
foot. Asked what he thought of Johnson defecting to Tampa, Chrebet
said diplomatically, ``We'll live.'' He later acknowledged that
losing a two-time Pro Bowl receiver can't help, but when asked how
he felt about Johnson's departure, he said, ``I don't care either
way.'' Sure he doesn't . . . According to an NFLPA salary survey,
only one of the top 10 wage earners reached the Super Bowl last
season, Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair. McNair was paid
$6,075,200. No surprise here, but six of the top 10 were
quarterbacks, including Drew Bledsoe, whose $6,398,000 was second
only to Dallas's Troy Aikman, who earned $6,667,300 . . . Although
Baltimore's Art Modell is on his way out as a team owner, he's not
going quietly. Modell has joined Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson
in calling for an outside consultant to interview team executives
on how the league should be run. This is partly a backlash by angry
owners who have not forgotten the huge pay and severance package
commissioner Paul Tagliabue and a few of his associates landed
without the owners' knowledge. ``I don't want to strip the
commissioner of any power, and I'm not trying to dilute his
importance,'' Modell said. ``I want to support him, but there have
been some complaints because people feel they don't know what's
going on.'' The rift is clear, as even the complaints of outcast
Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis, a longtime opponent of the
commissioner's office, are being taken seriously. Davis raised
questions about an incentive compensation plan for Tagliabue and
other league executives that some owners now claim they never knew
existed. Yet Tagliabue appears to have consolidated his power by
not replacing departed league president Neil Austrian . . .
Although the spring meetings are generally a mop-up session,
several important issues were discussed, and one of the biggest was
expanding the playoffs to 14 teams after the new Houston franchise
is added in 2002 and the league shifts to eight four-team
divisions. A straw poll taken the first day found 23 owners in
favor of expanding the playoffs. Supporters would need only one
more vote to pass such a measure. There would be seven teams from
each conference, four division winners and three wild-card teams.
Among those favoring the expansion was Patriots owner Robert Kraft
. . . Modell believes Ray Lewis will not be convicted of murder but
is guilty of something the Ravens will no longer tolerate. ``You
have to understand the psyche of the players,'' Modell said. ``Some
of them come from broken homes. They're drooled on by all the
athletic directors in America. Then they major in Ballroom
(Dancing) 101, and suddenly the pros throw $8 million at them. It's
a hard thing to cope with. I can tell you we're not going to
exonerate Ray Lewis from being around the wrong people. That will
change.'' Modell's point was driven home when a video surfaced
showing Lewis sitting with a co-defendant watching prostitutes have
sex in a club in Mexico. Lewis was introduced on the video by rap
star Luther Campbell. Although player conduct has been a major
topic for months, the league's reforms have had little impact. Both
the Ravens and the Panthers have player-conduct programs, and both
teams have a player (or ex-player, in the case of Rae Carruth) on
trial for murder . . . People around the league claim Lewis might
have avoided charges had he been cooperative with the Atlanta
police in the early stages of the investigation. Instead, he was
belligerent and unresponsive . . . New Houston owner Bob McNair got
lucky when he outlasted representatives from Los Angeles to win the
league's 32d franchise, but he didn't get lucky two years ago when
he sold a yearling colt named Fusaichi Pegasus for $4 million. The
colt won the Kentucky Derby recently and finished second in the
Preakness. McNair now says he'd pay $30 million to buy him back.
But all is not lost. McNair owns the colt's 2-year-old sister and
turned down $5 million for her a week after the Derby.

   NEW YORK _ When it came to the performance of Red Sox reliev- er
John Wasdin, there was no posi- tive way to spin the simple facts.
Not even manager Jimy Williams could find a creative way around
stating the obvious. His evaluation was appropriately terse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasdin got hit,'' said Williams, whose brevity was matched
only by the length of time it took Wasdin to hand New York the lead
in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The righthander threw just one pitch before he surrendered what
would prove the winning run. With the count 1-and-0 on Jorge
Posada, Wasdin hung a changeup. Posada drove the pitch into the
right-field stands for a solo homer. From then on, the Yankees
slugged their way to an 8-3 victory, abusing the Bos- ton bullpen
as they went.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the pitch I wanted, but bad location,'' said Wasdin,
who L took the loss. ``Basically today was just location that got
me. I was try- ing to go out there and keep us in the ballgame at
least by one run. You get two quick outs after (the home run) and
then you give up a hit and then a walk and then all of a sudden
Derek Jeter comes up and hits a curveball through the hole. That
quick it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   On an afternoon in which the New York bullpen went above and
beyond the call of duty as Jason Grimsley started in place of the
in- jured Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernan-H dez, the Boston bullpen
rapidly un- raveled. The Sox pitchers failed to lead their team
through the often troublesome middle innings.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Wasdin hurled the final pitch of his abysmal outing,
he had allowed New York four runs on three hits and a walk. As he
depart- ed, a sigh of relief no doubt sounded throughout Red Sox
Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just today, it was not my turn to go out there and succeed,''
said Wasdin, who also struggled in his last outing against Toronto
when he gave up two runs in two innings of work. ``It's a game.
Next time I  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  go out and pitch, I'll go out
there with the same intensity that I did today and try to do the
best I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two outings haven't been exactly what I wanted, but
the majority of the month has been good and positive. I'm not going
to panic after the last two outings L that haven't been what I
wanted them to be. I'll have another outing in a day or so or maybe
tomorrow. You just never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin was relieved by Tim L Young, who was making his first
Yankee Stadium appearance, and knuckleballer Tim Wakefield L worked
the ninth. Young served up a slider to Paul O'Neill in the sixth
that ended up in the right-field L stands, the three-run shot
provid- ing the final margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' said Rheal Cor-HL mier, who was the bright spot
with a solid inning in relief of starter Brian Rose. ``We know that
some- times you're not going to do the job. It's just one of those
things where today is over and you've just got to forget about it.
Tomorrow is a new day. We have a chance to take the series with
Pedro (Mar-H tinez) going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing you have to do as a reliever is turn the page. L
There's nothing we can do. It's L tough because nobody wants to L
come in and fail. But everybody goes through it. It's part of base-
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The relievers got off to a seem- ingly auspicious start when
Cor-H mier completed the fifth. He quick- ly disposed of O'Neill,
Bernie Wil- liams, and Tino Martinez, keeping the game tied at 3.
</P>
<P>
   The gem of Cormier's outing came with center fielder Williams at
the plate and Jeter on third. L Cormier caught Williams, a right-
handed batter, off guard with a L fastball that tailed inside, and
Wil- liams struck out looking. When L Martinez flied to left to end
the in- ning, Cormier had done his part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a big pitch at the right time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the rest of the relievers were unable to follow L
Cormier's example.

BLAZERS SAY THEY'RE STILL CONFIDENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. - They licked their wounds, ignored ``death's
door,'' called themselves knuckleheads, said they were upset but
not shaken.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen lamented that he had not been more aggressive,
Rasheed Wallace said his sprained ankle was fine, Arvydas Sabonis
pledged a long series, Steve Smith still maintained they should
have won.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers may have been troubled by their 93-91 loss to
the Lakers here in Game 3 at the Rose Garden, but they were going
to do everything to show their confidence was unfettered, save
writing ``We Still Believe!'' across their little headbands.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers lost the home-court advantage Friday they had just
won back in Los Angeles, and now find themselves down 2-1 in their
best-of-seven Western Conference finals against the Lakers and
knowing full well should they lose today's Game 4, all the odds get
ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Only six teams in NBA history have ever come back from a 3-1
deficit to capture a playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson, that budding sports psychologist,
said after Friday's victory that the Blazers know they'll be at
``death's door'' should they lose Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Although Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy dusted off the ol'
``must-win'' scenario for today's game, Pippen once again claimed
not to buy into any of Jackson's mental ploys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to put any pressure on ourselves,'' Pippen
said. ``We're not going into this game thinking our backs are
against the wall. We just have to go out and play well. We've been
in every game, we just have to complete games.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland played well in the first half on Friday but could never
shake the Lakers. Still, when it became the Blazers' turn to
overcome the deficit, they were still surprised the Lakers didn't
panic down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was a little surprised,'' Pippen said. ``We felt like
we had them right where we wanted. If we just keep it close, those
are games we should pull out. But we were knuckleheads. We made
knucklehead mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy said one of the reasons the Blazers faltered in the
second half was that Wallace - who at times has looked unstoppable
- sprained his ankle and was in foul trouble, so he wasn't as
aggressive or quick in doubling Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy said the ankle was still swollen and sore Saturday, but
expected Wallace to be able to play today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all right,'' said Wallace, in about his only comment
about his ankle on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise as a team, the Blazers said they were not feeling any
pressure and promised Friday's tough loss had not scratched their
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel down,'' Dunleavy said. ``That's the response that
you want as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understand the situation they're in. In no way is our
confidence diminished. We totally understand we're capable of
winning.''

COUPLE OPENS HOME TO FOSTER CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CASTAIC, Calif. _ Three-year-old Aaron ``Funky'' Young carefully
negotiated the staircase in his Castaic home and asked the question
that broke his new mother's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is James here?'' he asked, his look of bewilderment partly
concealed by his bright smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``James isn't here; he's with Jesus,'' answered Lori Young, 42,
who is seeking Aaron's adoption. She shook her head slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That question is practically the first thing out of his mouth
every morning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster was looking for his ``brother,'' James Harlan
Young, who died of a heart ailment May 11 at age 10.
</P>
<P>
   James was among the dozens of foster children -- many with
medical problems or developmental disabilities -- Lori has taken in
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Now she and Fred Young, her husband of two years, have a special
family.
</P>
<P>
   Three children they expect to adopt soon, a 25-year-old whom
Lori took in years ago, Lori's two biological sons and Fred's two
sons make up the squares of an incredible family quilt.
</P>
<P>
   And although they grieve for James, they are thankful for their
short time with him and have no regret for acting as parents for
the sickly child doctors had predicted would die years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received more from him than he ever could have received from
me,'' Lori Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, too, was a sick 9-month-old when the Youngs brought him
home. He had been diagnosed with sickle-cell anemia, fetal alcohol
syndrome and failure to thrive when Lori took custody of the
11-pound baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fed him in my bedroom with no one else there and he ate,''
she said. ``We did that every three hours, like he was a newborn,
and he came out of it. Now he eats everything.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lori found Aaron had an 8-year-old sister, Trisha, she
brought the little girl home, too. Both are being adopted by the
Youngs.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was James.
</P>
<P>
   His death rocked the family because he seemed to be doing well.
On May 11, Lori was walking with the boy to a school book fair when
he complained of being tired. She thought he might be coming down
with a cold.
</P>
<P>
   Lori asked James to wait with a sibling while she continued on
to the school. She returned 15 minutes later and mother and
children headed home. But James, huffing and puffing, couldn't walk
any more so Lori went home and got her car.
</P>
<P>
   When they got home, James collapsed on the living room floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, James!'' she recalled. ``He said, `What?' and then he
died. We were thankful he didn't linger or suffer more than he
needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, Lori Young has taken care of about 50 foster
children. She would have taken more children in her home, but six
is the maximum allowed by the Department of Children and Family
Services.
</P>
<P>
   The family had six, including James and the two sons of Fred
Young, 15-year-old Sam and 17-year-old Jesse.
</P>
<P>
   Lori also has two biological sons who no longer live at home --
David Foley, 22, and Adam, 19.
</P>
<P>
   Also grown now is Dali Holman, 25, a foster child who was cared
for by Lori from the time she was a young girl.
</P>
<P>
   Fred and Lori's union was bittersweet. She was divorced and best
friends with Fred's wife, Lydia, who died of cancer in 1991. About
seven years later, the two began dating and on Tuesday they will
celebrate their second anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Young is 48 and a superintendent of solid resources for the
city of Los Angeles. He knew exactly what he was getting into when
he married Lori, a nurse who works caring for developmentally
disabled adults.
</P>
<P>
   He knew Lori came with a handful of children who needed special
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved children,'' he said as Aaron climbed on his
knee.
</P>
<P>
   Fred wrapped his arms around the child and looked at Lori. ``She
just has this huge heart and I think she feels a need to reach out
and help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think about taking children in and won't take
that next step and do it,'' Lori said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's an extremely wonderful thing if you just take the
step and do it,'' her husband said.
</P>
<P>
   When Lori Young took in 2-year-old James, he knew little of life
beyond his hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   He had been in a foster home, Lorie said, where he had been left
alone in a crib with a teddy bear so long he had a ball of teddy
bear fur in his stomach and doctors had to perform surgery to
remove it.
</P>
<P>
   James had heart problems, spinal curvature and had to be fed
through a tube doctors had inserted into his stomach. In addition,
he was depressed and wouldn't walk.
</P>
<P>
   Lori took him home in June, and by Christmas, he was on his
feet.
</P>
<P>
   In his memory a fund is planned for families who take in ill
children, the Rev. Tom Givens said during James' funeral at Grace
Baptist Church in Saugus.
</P>
<P>
   While the family is still coping with James' death, Lori said,
they are comforted knowing he longer suffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the throes of all of this, but we know James is
in a better place,'' she said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was the kind of day when the two key New York
scorers split 60 points. It was the kind of day when New York
turned the ball over only seven times. It was the kind of day when
a 6-foot-2-inch New York guard blocked the shot of a 7-4 Indiana
center. It was even the kind of day when Chris Dudley stepped up to
the line when it was very much a game and swished _ SWISHED! _ two
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   And just forget the final margin. Saturday's 98-95 score is a
massive fraud, the product of a messy final minute that culminated
in an Austin Croshere 3-pointer with 4.7 seconds to go. This was a
New York game from the midpoint of the third period. The Knicks led
by 13 (81-68) with 6:34 left, and they led by 12 (91-79) with 2:18
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Playing without Patrick Ewing (acute tendinitis in his right
foot) and getting a scant five forgettable minutes from Marcus
Camby before he went out with a sprained medial capsule in his
right knee (the MRI was negative, and he is listed as ``day to
day''), the Knicks called upon a pair of superior midsized
ath-a-letes to save their season. Losing this game would have meant
cetain series death, but Latrell Sprewell (32 points) and Allan
Houston (28) demonstrated, in the short run, anyway, that
basketball is still a game of quickness, movement, and, oh yes,
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   It was all very reminscent of last year's series, which the
Knicks managed to win even after losing Ewing in Game 2. Dispensing
with the formality of tossing the ball into the low post, New York
tortured the Pacers with the individual artistry of Messrs.
Sprewell and Houston, whose mixed bag of drives, feints, pull-ups,
step-backs, and about 17 other things embarrassed Larry Bird's
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't have the guys to match up with their quickness,
and it is a problem,'' acknowledged the Indiana coach.
</P>
<P>
   If the problem isn't solved to some degree by Monday afternoon,
Bird &AMP; Co. will be heading back to Indianapolis with this series
tied.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers went as far as they could with Rik Smits doing a
first-half Kareem Abdul-Jabbar imitation. The 7-4 guy with the
velvet touch scored 12 of his team's first 17, 17 of its first 24,
and 21 of its first 32, combining face-up inside-out jumpers with
low-post jump hooks and even a driving 3-point play sprung from a
high pick-and-roll. But he was quieted in the second half (2 of 5
after a 10-of-15 first half) to finish with 25 points. Reggie
Miller (19 points) bubbled up every now and then. But no one else
did anything on offense, and that includes Jalen Rose (26 points),
who nailed down the postseason Golden Trashcan Award with a bizarre
22-point fourth quarter that you really had to see to not believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, they were letting him score,'' dismissed Bird, and he was
right.
</P>
<P>
   An early Knick rumble put New York ahead by 9 points (22-13),
but the Pacers rode that out with minimal diffculty and took a
42-41 halftime lead into the locker room. ``We talked about being
24 minutes away from putting themselves in a good position to win
the series,'' Bird explained.
</P>
<P>
   As Bird likes to say, ``Not really.''
</P>
<P>
   New York came out of the locker room with the burning belly. At
47-45, Indiana, Dudley, whose previous 2000 playoff workload had
consisted of 10 minutes spaced out over three games, went to the
free throw line, his personal chamber of horrors. Not this time.
The affable Yalie nailed them both.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about omens. Before the period was over, Sprewell would
have 23 of his 32 and Houston would have 20 of his 28 and the
Knicks would be up, 71-64. The Pacers would not come closer than 5
again until Croshere's too-little-too-late bomb.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone doubted that it was destined to be a New York day,
consider the sight of 6-2 Charlie Ward flying at Smits and blocking
his shot cleanly from the side with 58.5 seconds left in the third
period and his team up, 69-62. ``I knew he could jump,'' said an
admiring Houston, ``but Charlie looked like he was jumping over a
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Had there been a car available, Bird might have run over a few
members of his team. ``We were turning the ball over (17 times, for
18 New York points) and there were too many guys not ready to
play,'' Bird said. ``Every time I put one of those guys back in to
redeem himself, he'd play worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Really, now. Did anyone think there was any possibility of a
sweep?

NO NERVES ON EVE OF BIG DATE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ He has become the Main Event whenever he pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But when it is Pedro Martinez against the New York Yankees, it
takes on the aura of an uncommon celestial occurrence. People mark
their calendars so as not to miss a solar eclipse or a streaking
comet. They do the same when it's Pedro and the Pinstripers, and
even more so Sunday night, when the Yankee pitcher will be Roger
Clemens in Pedro-Rocket II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to me,'' Martinez said Saturday morning, sniffing at the
suggestion that this will be special. ``I'm not a very exciting
person. To me, it's just one more game.''
</P>
<P>
   No one should buy that for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Martinez pitched here, Sept. 10, 1999, he whiffed
more Yankees, 17, than any pitcher who had ever faced the Bombers.
He allowed just one hit, a second-inning home run by Chili Davis.
He set down the last 22 Yankees, the last five on strikes, and
finished the game by whiffing Chuck Knoblauch on a 96-mile-an-hour
fastball. By the end of the night, Yankee fans weaned on their
hatred of the Sox were on their feet, cheering for Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's gone,'' said Martinez, who claims never to have watched
the game on video. ``That's past. Everything I did is gone. What
counts is what I'm doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's past, but it burns a place in the memory of anyone who was
there. Jimy Williams was a coach with the Atlanta Braves when they
had their Cy Young trio of Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, and Tom
Glavine. As a player, he was in St. Louis when the Cardinals had
Hall of Famer Bob Gibson, and he batted against Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever seen a guy pitch a game like that
against a lineup like that,'' Williams said that September night.
``How many guys did he strike out? Seventeen? The kind of hitters
they have over there?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a guy pitch like that, one game, throughout
the whole game. Maybe you guys have, but I haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came Pedro-Rocket I, in Game 3 of the ALCS, a 13-1
thrashing of the Yankees that ranks as their worst loss in the
postseason. Martinez pitched seven scoreless innings, allowing two
hits while whiffing a dozen. His two-game line score against the
Yankees: 16 IP, 0 R, 3 H, 29 K's.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, meanwhile, was driven from the mound two batters into
the third inning after a yield of five runs before a crowd gone mad
at the scent of blood. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner was so
distraught afterward that he came into the visitors' clubhouse at
Fenway Park and told his team, according to someone who was there:
``This can happen once, but it can't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That game was so blown out of proportion,'' Mike Stanley said
Saturday. ``The tale-of-the-tape picture, the heavyweight title,
clash of the titans hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were amused at all the hype, but we knew it was just a game
we had to win. We were already down two games in that series.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez insists this isn't personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger is just one more pitcher out there,'' he said. ``I have
to pitch a game against whoever. I don't care if it's Roger or
David Cone. Roger is a great pitcher, one of the best baseball has
ever had. But I've got to go out there and pitch. I've got to worry
about Bernie (Williams) and (Derek) Jeter, the guys hitting against
me. My teammates will take care of Roger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what. I wish it was Toronto. That's a game I
lost. I'd like the chance to take that back. I hate losing. Right
now, the teams I want are the teams that beat me before. See if I
can even up things.''
</P>
<P>
   If a dread of Martinez has been planted in the Yankees' heads,
said Stanley, they will not be alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it matters what team we're facing, they all have
a lot of respect for him,'' Stanley said. ``Robbie Alomar (of the
Indians) came down to first base the day before Pedro pitched and
said _ and I know this is a cliche _ `We'd better get as many as we
can today, because we're not going to get many against Pedro
tomorrow.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Harold Baines, who has been in baseball over 20 years, told me
he hasn't seen anybody better than this guy. A future Hall of
Famer, and he said Pedro is the best he's ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have had crowds of 54,000-plus in each of the first
two games of this series. Another full house is guaranteed Sunday
night. The game will be televised nationally by ESPN. It's the
rubber game of a three-game match between teams tied for first
place. And it's Pedro vs. Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a slight toward any of our other pitchers,''
Stanley said, ``but the energy you feel from the crowd when Pedro
pitches is unlike any other game. That in itself gets you pumped
up. I don't come to the ballpark more pumped up because Pedro's
pitching. But you feed off the energy of that crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Martinez said, he noticed the way he won over the Yankees
fans the last time he was here.
</P>
<P>
   ``That taught me one thing,'' he said. ``They understand
baseball. They appreciate a good performance. That's something I
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was like it was in Baltimore a couple of weeks ago. And
they understand baseball in Boston _ they probably know too much
about baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   They know what is happening at 8:05 Sunday night. They've got it
marked on their calendars.

SPORTS COMMENTARY: SPREWELL, A LIFELONG LEARNER, LEARNS HOW TO
BOUNCE BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A matter of concern was arising, like smoke in the distance, in
relation to Latrell Sprewell. It came in the guise of last quarters
in the playoffs this season. The Knick forward, after generally
fine first three quarters, had become mysteriously ineffective in
the final 12 minutes, as though someone had swiped his can of
spinach, or slipped chewing gum under his sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   The last-quarter nadir was reached in Thursday night's game when
he failed to hit a basket in four tries and missed a short jump
shot that could have tied the score against Indiana with five
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   After the Game 2 loss, Sprewell walked off the court with Larry
Johnson, who had had a good game, and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't give you enough help,'' Sprewell said. ``I didn't
give you enough help.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Sprewell said, with the candor that has contributed to
his growing and unexpected appeal to New York fans: ``It's hard to
believe. I picked an unfortunate time to have the worst playoff
game of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   And Saturday things were looking dire, indeed, especially with
Knicks center Patrick Ewing suited up only in gray double-breasted
and ensconced at the end of the bench because of acute tendinitis
in his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go to the basket, and believe in my shot, and
believe in myself,'' he said. ``Be aggressive, that's the bottom
line. And I have to keep shooting. As a shooter, as a scorer, you
always feel you're going to make the next shot.''
</P>
<P>
   His feelings, apparently, were hitting bull's-eyes. On his first
try, he hit a jump shot for the Knicks' first basket of the game,
and then hit another, and followed that with a 3-pointer. The
Knicks were up, 11-5, and the sellout crowd was howling, as if word
was out that they were going to share in the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's positive feelings were working overtime. He popped in
three more jump shots in the second quarter, five more baskets in
the third period. He had 23 points and the Knicks were up, 71-64.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was the fourth quarter, the tense time, when the game
often hangs in the balance. Spree, as his teammates call him, was 4
for 31 in his last 10 playoff games, after scoring 13 of the team's
last 17 points in Game 2 against Toronto and the game-winner over
Vince Carter. Sprewell remains the team's leading scorer in the
postseason with a 17.8 average, and was second to Allan Houston,
16.5 to 16.0, after the first two Pacers games.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is this odd case building against Sprewell, and it
has nothing to do with his problems of a couple of years ago when
his coach at the time, P.J. Carlesimo of Golden State, riled him
and he took his anger into his own hands. It seems that Sprewell's
overall fine play over the last two seasons with the Knicks, his
team play, his good citizenship, have allowed people to forgive if
not entirely forget the infamous throat throttle. Talk to Latrell
Sprewell today and you get reasoned, sincere responses and a
generosity of time and spirit. He has obviously lived and learned.
He smiles, but without trying to be ingratiating. He has remained
his own man, down to the cornrows. One comes away liking him.
</P>
<P>
   It's too much to believe that a veteran player like Sprewell,
who has been counted on in the past to produce under pressure,
could be buckling for some reason. Anything's possible, to be sure.
The mind, as Freud deduced, is a wild and nutty contraption. Chuck
Knoblauch suddenly can't throw to first base from second base. All
the Miami players suddenly can't make free throws. The pretty girl
falls for the homely guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches want me to square up more on every shot,'' he
said. ``They think I'm too often off balance. They believe that the
chances of the balanced shot going down are up. But I've been
shooting and making off-balance shots all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The inference, however, is that he will be concentrating more on
squaring up. Sprewell, after all, lives and learns.
</P>
<P>
   After Game 2, Sprewell said: ``I felt I had let the team down.
But now I have to be concerned only with the next possession, the
next quarter, the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Marcus Camby lost to the Knicks after spraining his
knee in the second quarter, it was up to the likes of Larry
Johnson, Allan Houston, Charlie Ward, Kurt Thomas _ and, of course,
Sprewell _ to protect the lead and keep them truly competitive in
the series.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, apparently having wiped clean the memory of past
fourth quarters from his consciousness, canned three straight shots
from the field, added two free throws and then, virtually sealing
the victory, sank an 18-foot jumper to give the Knicks their widest
margin of the game, 91-79, with 2 minutes 25 seconds left in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he played tough defense on Jalen Rose, pulled in a
handful of rebounds and passed well, especially the one he laid in
to Thomas under the basket for a score that should be framed and
hung in the Metropolitan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised that we won,'' Sprewell said later.
``Larry, Allan and I knew we had to play our `A' game, and if we
did, we could win.''
</P>
<P>
   So they did, with Sprewell leading all scorers with 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so troubled after Game 2,'' Sprewell said, ``I couldn't
sleep. I was tossing and turning all night. But when we win, I go
right to sleep. Out.''
</P>
<P>
   An earthquake probably wouldn't have disturbed his sleep
Saturday night. &QL;

IT DOESN'T FIGURE, SO SACK THE HACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ But does it work?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question we should have been asking all along about
the endgame strategy known as Hack-a-Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   Not ``Is it pretty?'' Not ``Is it sportsmanlike?'' The NBA rules
committee will hack away at those questions soon enough anyway,
with a little friend-of-the-court help from NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Does it work?
</P>
<P>
   From the way coach Mike Dunleavy conducted the final minutes of
his Trail Blazers' Game 3 playoff loss to the Lakers Friday night
in Portland, it appears he found the answer to that question
without our help.
</P>
<P>
   Let's think it through anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Hack-a-Shaq - employed most notably by Dunleavy and
before him by Dallas Mavericks coach Don Nelson - is to take
advantage of Shaquille O'Neal's lone weakness by forcing him to
shoot a lot of free throws. Dunleavy tried to do that in Game 1 of
the NBA Western Conference finals by ordering the Blazers to foul
O'Neal - even when he didn't have the ball - 12 times in the last 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has sank only about 50 percent of his free throws this
season and in his career. Dunleavy figured hacking Shaq would
accomplish two things: It would hold the Lakers to only about one
point a possession in the game's crucial minutes. And, because the
Lakers wouldn't have the chance to run down the 24-second clock, it
would give the Blazers more possessions and shots of their own.
</P>
<P>
   More shots couldn't hurt the Blazers, who trailed by 12 points
in Game 1 when Dunleavy began the Hack-a-Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work. Shaq made exactly half of his 24 free throws in
the final 5:27. The Blazers missed most of their shots, committed
turnovers and failed to dent the Lakers' lead as Los Angeles won
105-94.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy defended the tactic, saying it didn't work simply
because the Blazers' offense failed to take advantage of
opportunities to score two points each time Shaq scored one.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Dunleavy's problem is that he was a psychology major at
the University of South Carolina, not a math major.
</P>
<P>
   If you foul a 50 percent free-throw shooter, you'd better assume
he'll make 50 percent of his free throws, giving his team one point
per possession, on average.
</P>
<P>
   One point per possession isn't much less than the Lakers have
been scoring against the Blazers anyway (or what the typical NBA
team would score by shooting slightly worse than 50 percent from
the floor). The Lakers were scoring 1.3 points per possession in
game before the Hack-a-Shaq started. For the Blazers that's not a
big enough difference.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed 96-84 when they started fouling. Each team had 15
possessions in the final 5:27. The Lakers scored 13 points (a
little less than you'd expect) to give them 109. For the Blazers to
catch up, they would have had to score 25 points in 15 possessions.
They would have had to make 13 of 15 shots from 2-point range, or 9
of 15 3-pointers, or some combination thereof; or they'd have had
to go on an offensive-rebounding tear to get more shots.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, if O'Neal made many less than 50 percent from the
line, perhaps because the pressure got to him, the Blazers' task
would have been easier. But that's no more likely than the Lakers
going into a drought from the floor if the Blazers had concentrated
on playing defense instead of fouling; that way the Blazers might
have forced some turnovers and been able to take advantage of their
superior transition speed.
</P>
<P>
   There was always the possibility O'Neal would make (begin
ital)more(end ital) than 50 percent, too.
</P>
<P>
   Hack-a-Shaq didn't come into play in Monday's Game 2, a blowout
in the fourth quarter. In Game 3, the Blazers trailed by eight
points with less than six minutes left in the game. The situation
was similar to Game 1 except that the Blazers had committed only
one team foul so far in the quarter. If Dunleavy wanted to use the
Hack-a-Shaq, he could have ordered his players to commit enough
innocuous, non-shooting fouls to get the Blazers to five and
guarantee that any subsequent foul committed against Shaq would put
him at the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   But Dunleavy didn't take that tack. Maybe he figured out that
Hack-a-Shaq is not a good way to play catchup. As it was, by
playing defense, the Blazers caught up with a 12-5 run before Ron
Harper's baseline jumper gave the Lakers a 93-91 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hack-a-Shaq's bark was worse than its bite ever could have been.
Not once in the final 5:52 did O'Neal handle the ball in position
to score. The Lakers probably wanted to keep him off the line.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a logical role for Hack-a-Shaq? Maybe. The NBC
announcers reported with some surprise that Dunleavy had said he'd
use the tactic ``even'' if the Blazers led. Why the surprise?
Hacking when you're ahead makes more sense - by locking the other
team into about one point per possession you're preventing it from
going on a spurt.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, everything works better when you're ahead. Advice to
Blazers: Play basketball, take a lead to the final minutes, then
sack the hack and keep doing what got you there.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it came to the performance of Red Sox reliever
John Wasdin, there was no positive way to spin the simple facts.
Not even manager Jimy Williams could find a creative way around
stating the obvious. His evaluation was appropriately terse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasdin got hit,'' said Williams, whose brevity was matched
only by the length of time it took Wasdin to hand New York the lead
in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The righthander threw just one pitch before he surrendered what
would prove the winning run. With the count 1-and-0 on Jorge
Posada, Wasdin hung a changeup. Posada drove the pitch into the
right-field stands for a solo homer. From then on, the Yankees
slugged their way to an 8-3 victory Saturday, abusing the Boston
bullpen as they went.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the pitch I wanted, but bad location,'' said Wasdin,
who took the loss. ``Basically today was just location that got me.
I was trying to go out there and keep us in the ballgame at least
by one run. You get two quick outs after (the home run) and then
you give up a hit and then a walk and then all of a sudden Derek
Jeter comes up and hits a curveball through the hole. That quick it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   On an afternoon in which the New York bullpen went above and
beyond the call of duty as Jason Grimsley started in place of the
injured Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, the Boston bullpen rapidly
unraveled. The Sox pitchers failed to lead their team through the
often troublesome middle innings.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Wasdin hurled the final pitch of his abysmal outing,
he had allowed New York four runs on three hits and a walk. As he
departed, a sigh of relief no doubt sounded throughout Red Sox
Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just today, it was not my turn to go out there and succeed,''
said Wasdin, who also struggled in his last outing against Toronto
when he gave up two runs in two innings of work. ``It's a game.
Next time I go out and pitch, I'll go out there with the same
intensity that I did today and try to do the best I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two outings haven't been exactly what I wanted, but
the majority of the month has been good and positive. I'm not going
to panic after the last two outings that haven't been what I wanted
them to be. I'll have another outing in a day or so or maybe
tomorrow. You just never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin was relieved by Tim Young, who was making his first
Yankee Stadium appearance, and knuckleballer Tim Wakefield worked
the ninth. Young served up a slider to Paul O'Neill in the sixth
that ended up in the right-field stands, the three-run shot
providing the final margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' said Rheal Cormier, who was the bright spot with
a solid inning in relief of starter Brian Rose. ``We know that
sometimes you're not going to do the job. It's just one of those
things where today is over and you've just got to forget about it.
Tomorrow is a new day. We have a chance to take the series with
Pedro (Martinez) going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing you have to do as a reliever is turn the page.
There's nothing we can do. It's tough because nobody wants to come
in and fail. But everybody goes through it. It's part of
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The relievers got off to a seemingly auspicious start when
Cormier completed the fifth. He quickly disposed of O'Neill, Bernie
Williams, and Tino Martinez, keeping the game tied at 3.
</P>
<P>
   The gem of Cormier's outing came with center fielder Williams at
the plate and Jeter on third. Cormier caught Williams, a
righthanded batter, off guard with a fastball that tailed inside,
and Williams struck out looking. When Martinez flied to left to end
the inning, Cormier had done his part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a big pitch at the right time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the rest of the relievers were unable to follow
Cormier's example.

TICKS WILL BE PLENTIFUL IN MISSOURI, KANSAS THIS SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A bumper crop of ticks
will infest the woods and grasslands of Missouri and Kansas this
spring and summer, thanks to mild winters, abundant wildlife and
rich habitats.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This glut of blood-sucking bugs will bring serious health
threats.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Missouri has ranked high nationally for
tick-borne diseases. It is second, after Arkansas, for cases of
tularemia, fourth for ehrlichiosis and seventh for Rocky Mountain
spotted fever, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri is not considered a high-risk locale for the most
notorious tick-borne malady, Lyme disease. A Lymelike illness found
in Missouri, however, is as nasty as the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Tick-borne diseases are less common in Kansas, but they still
are present, especially in the eastern third of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any tick-borne disease can be acquired in the Kansas City
area, particularly in outlying areas to the south of the city. They
can be acquired after chopping wood or even doing lawn work,'' said
David McKinsey, a physician and infectious disease expert at
Research Medical Center. He has treated five patients so far this
year for tick-borne diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Checking your body for ticks after being in the woods is the
best way to guard against the illnesses they carry.
</P>
<P>
   Ticks need to feed on the blood of a warm-blooded host animal
three times in their life cycle. If the animals are infected, the
ticks pick up disease bacteria. The ticks, in turn, can pass the
bacteria to the next animal or person that supplies them a meal.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Schorr, 53, of Liberty became dinner for a tick carrying
ehrlichiosis at the Lake of the Ozarks six years ago. He is healthy
now and feels lucky to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   On Memorial Day weekend 1994, Schorr developed the classic
flulike symptoms of tick-borne illnesses: a high fever, head and
joint aches, nausea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like the worst case of flu you ever had,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While most cases of ehrlichiosis are mild, Schorr's got
progressively worse. His kidneys and liver began to fail. He spent
two weeks in the hospital as doctors tried to figure out what was
making him ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember much of anything but the priest being there a
couple of times to give me last rites,'' Schorr said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital staffers kept asking Schorr's wife, Debra, questions
that might lead to a diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally someone asked me the tick question, and they shot out
of there to run tick tests,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schorr immediately received the right antibiotic, doxycycline.
He started to improve in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's ecological diversity, from delta to prairie,
``provides in one place or another an environment for virtually any
tick-borne illness in the United States,'' said Rob Hall, a
University of Missouri-Columbia entomologist.
</P>
<P>
   Hall noticed the first ticks of the season about six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live on a farm, and I can't walk outside without getting
ticks on me,'' he said. ``They're hungry, they're crawling around,
and they're looking for a host animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mild temperatures may have allowed more ticks than usual to
survive through the winter, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not only had a couple of pretty mild winters, but we
also had an early spring,'' Hall said. ``Given a long summer, we
could have two generations (of ticks).''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions for ticks also have been favorable in Kansas, said
Donald Mock, a Kansas State University entomologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it was generally agreed to be the worst tick season
we ever had (in Kansas),'' Mock said. ``The warm winter, some
moisture. The ticks should have survived pretty well this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The abundance of ticks is also ``an inevitable by-product of
fostering wildlife,'' said Hall. With animals such as raccoons,
opossums and deer thriving in Missouri, there are more host animals
for ticks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And with wildlife spread throughout Missouri, ticks are
everywhere in the state. In the early 1990s one of Hall's graduate
students sampled ticks in all the major environmental regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't see any major focal point of ticks. We collected
them readily all the way from southern to northern Missouri,'' Hall
said.
</P>
<P>
   This survey found that fewer than 1 percent of all ticks in
Missouri carried disease bacteria, but that is no reason for
complacency, Hall said. In some hot spots as many as half the ticks
were infected.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichiosis, the disease that put Schorr in the hospital,
appears to be a growing problem in Missouri and other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Last year doctors and other health-care providers reported 56
cases of ehrlichiosis to the Missouri Department of Health,
compared with an average of 14 cases a year from 1989 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas ehrlichiosis did not become a reportable illness until
this year, so no data were available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ehrlichiosis is definitely up, but we're not certain why
yet,'' said Howard Pue, a Missouri Department of Health
veterinarian. ``It might have been underreported in the past. Or
there might be more of it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide the number of ehrlichiosis cases has been trending up
since 1986, when scientists discovered that the disease, long
recognized in animals, also was infecting people.
</P>
<P>
   The largest numbers of ehrlichiosis cases from 1986 through 1997
were reported in New York, North Carolina and Connecticut,
according to a recent Centers for Disease Control report.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-ranked Missouri reported 162 cases. Missouri is part of a
band of Midwestern states, including Arkansas and Oklahoma, in
which ehrlichiosis is common.
</P>
<P>
   Greater awareness of ehrlichiosis may be leading to more reports
by doctors, said Chris Paddock, a CDC medical officer. But growth
in the population of white-tailed deer, which carry the bacteria,
also may account for more cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other tick-borne diseases in Missouri and Kansas:
</P>
<P>
   - Rocky Mountain spotted fever _ Besides flulike symptoms, most
people with the infection develop a red, spotty rash.
</P>
<P>
   - Tularemia _ Symptoms may include occasional cough and chest
pain, and swollen lymph glands. Tularemia is rarely fatal, but it
can cause severe pneumonia, McKinsey said.
</P>
<P>
   - Lymelike disease _ Whether Lyme disease exists in Missouri has
been a contentious issue for years between Missouri health
officials and the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there's a potential for Lyme disease to occur in
Missouri, but there hasn't been any laboratory proof that it's
infecting people,'' said David Dennis, coordinator of the CDC Lyme
disease program.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri researchers have found bacteria in ticks that are very
similar to those that cause Lyme disease. The bacteria cause the
same flulike symptoms and distinctive bull's-eye rash at the site
of the bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling it Lymelike disease, but we're not calling it
Lyme disease per se,'' said Pue of the Missouri Department of
Health. ``It's close enough to Lyme disease that diagnostics are
the same; the treatment and prevention are the same. It's really an
academic argument whether it's Lyme.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas health officials track Lyme cases that meet only the CDC
definition of the disease, not Lymelike ailments.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC has research under way in Missouri, Arkansas and
Oklahoma to try to identify and characterize this Lymelike illness,
Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news about tick-borne diseases is that with timely
diagnosis they can be treated successfully with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians are trained to have a low threshold for prescribing
antibiotics to people who have a fever during the summer months,
especially if there's been tick exposure,'' McKinsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Schorr and his wife still go to the Lake of the Ozarks. But now
they spray on repellent and check each other thoroughly for ticks.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago Schorr was at Truman Lake. When he got
home, he discovered a tick stuck to him. Did it give him a chill?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yeah,'' he admitted. ``It did a little bit.''

KNICKS BEAT PACERS, 98-95 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was the Indiana Pacers' Rik Smits, a 7-foot-4-inch
lumbering blond who was rooted on the baseline like a sequoia,
preparing to release a jumper from the clouds. But on one amazing
leap of faith, the knee-high Charlie Ward darted into the picture,
scaled an imaginary beanstalk and slapped the shot into the seats.
</P>
<P>
   A flash of disbelief crossed Smits' face as he watched Ward pick
himself up, untangle his feet from the camera cords and scamper
back onto the court amid the noise from the delirious beholders at
Madison Square Garden. Smits should know better by now. He should
expect miracles, catch them coming out of the corners of his eyes.
Because just as they did last year, the Knicks turned the
impossible into the attainable Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On an afternoon when Patrick Ewing was in a suit because of a
foot injury and an injured Marcus Camby had been taken to a
hospital because of a knee injury, the Knicks simply reached a
little higher. With helium in their bones and desperation in their
blood, the Knicks opened their sequel to last year's improbable
playoff run against the Indiana Pacers with a 98-95 Game 3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 in the Eastern Conference finals is Monday at 5:30 p.m.
at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was a day for rediscovery. In one afternoon, the Knicks
remembered how to channel adversity into victory and closed the
Pacers' advantage in this four-of-seven-game series to two games to
one. With one performance, Latrell Sprewell decoded his late-game
disappearances. For a month, he wondered how his touch could
evaporate so easily, how his shots could so routinely bang off the
rim with a sickening beat. But inside the Garden, in front of his
support group, Sprewell found his rhythm again as he rode the
Knicks' up-tempo approach for a 32-point performance.
</P>
<P>
   His partner was right by his side. After struggling in Games 1
and 2, Allan Houston would not fall prey to the theatrical Reggie
Miller as he side-stepped foul trouble and stayed on the floor to
produce 28 points in 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought Allan and I were very aggressive,'' Sprewell
said. ``We felt really good. We got into a rhythm. The one thing
about this team, we are very resilient. Today, we were completely
together. We weren't going to get down, no matter who was or who
wasn't on the floor. That's just how this team is.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost as if the Knicks need adversity to breathe. Four
minutes into the second quarter, they got a second helping of it.
Driving hard to his right, Camby planted on his right foot,
slipping into a split, and had to be helped off the floor after
spraining the medial capsule in his right knee. He did not return
to the game, and his availability for tomorrow's game is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't know how bad it was,'' Sprewell said. ``You just
had to keep going, keep fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were without their best two rebounders, but were
beaten on the boards by a slim margin, 33-28. They were without two
players who could have matched Smits' presence but pieced together
a second-half strategy that worked. After Smits scored 21 points
over the starter Chris Dudley and Kurt Thomas to give Indiana a
42-41 lead at the half, he scored only 4 more points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a terrible job in the first half,'' Thomas said. ``I
just had to regroup. I had to stay in front of him and deny him the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' renewed aggression began to pay off in the third
quarter as the Pacers unraveled. After Dale Davis blocked a floater
by Houston, the ball went to Sprewell, who popped up to shoot as
the shot-clock buzzer went off. Miller was called for a foul on the
attempt and was incensed. Instead of Indiana with the ball, down by
53-52, Sprewell was going to the free-throw line. A minute later,
still seething, Miller barked at the referee Bob Delaney and drew a
technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell you the truth, I think the tide turned on that call on
Spree with the shot clock running out,'' said Miller, who scored an
unspectacular 19 points. ``I thought we had gained control of the
game right there. But they go up by 3 points, and that was it, the
tide turned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers could not regain their poise. With Ward slapping at
the ball in Mark Jackson's hands, with Larry Johnson tackling every
loose ball, the Knicks forced the Pacers into four turnovers in the
last 2 minutes 27 seconds of the third quarter. They parlayed the
Pacers' mistakes into a 71-64 lead entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, this is where Sprewell has come apart. Over his previous
10 fourth quarters, Sprewell had hit just 4 of 31 attempts. As if
to defy the numbers, Sprewell made his first three shots in the
opening four minutes of the fourth quarter to give the Knicks a
77-68 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been struggling,'' Sprewell said. ``I came in knowing I
haven't been playing well. I just had to attack. My teammates were
behind me. Today, I was on.''
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose was invisible through three quarters, with just 4
points. Jackson (1 for 6) and Austin Croshere (3 points) were also
hidden in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing,'' Pacers Coach Larry Bird said. ``We
had an opportunity. We had many guys fleeing out there. They didn't
do anything to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose was too late. The Knicks' lead grew to 13 points with 6:36
remaining before Rose got going. He scored a wild 22 of his 26
points in the fourth quarter and put a mild scare into the Knicks.
With Miller on the bench in a game that seemed lost, the Pacers cut
their deficit to 3 points after some careless possessions and two
missed free throws by Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Handling prosperity is not the Knicks' best quality. They are
better when they have to defy logic, gravity and dire circumstances
all at once. In one snapshot, the 6-2 Ward accomplished all three
with his block on Smits in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of funny,'' said Ward, who slipped into Camby's
role as the X-factor with 14 points, 3 steals and 9 assists. ``It
felt crazy. But an angel was telling me to fly, fly high. He was
7-foot-4, and the only way to get there was to fly.''

SCOTTIE'S TIME TO TAKE CHARGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. - After coaching him for nine years in Chicago,
Phil Jackson can read Scottie Pippen's body language the way an
actuary reads statistical tables. And Jackson sees Pippen
reasserting himself in a big way today when the Lakers and Portland
Trail Blazers tip off Game 4 of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's 21 points led the Blazers to their victory in Game 2,
so Jackson countered by assigning Kobe Bryant to guard him. The
move worked, as Pippen managed just four points through the first
three quarters of Game 3 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But with Bryant in foul trouble, Pippen hit 3 of 4 shots in the
fourth quarter, for eight points in eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he ended that game makes me think that he's going to
want to start (today's) game the way that he ended (Friday's). He
came right at us,'' Jackson said. ``Of course, Kobe had five fouls
and he took the offense right to the front of our hoop basically. I
think that's what we're going to have to be prepared for, is that
Scottie said to himself, `I gotta take advantage of what I had and
create the aggressiveness for this team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Lakers have regained home-court advantage, Jackson
said the pressure is squarely back on the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to say that it's such a critical game for them,''
he said. ``It's critical for us too, because we want to establish a
momentum and continue with it. But for them to only have one game
left before you're eliminated says something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmering: Rick Fox was still a little heated over his
fourth-quarter scuffle with Pippen, touched off when Pippen zinged
the ball into Fox's back. Fox said Pippen had been showing
disrespect to the Lakers with his actions and words all night, and
it was time to send a message back: that the Lakers would not be
pushed around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's first and foremost,'' Fox said. ``Anytime you
find yourself in a war, in confrontation, you don't back down. You
stand up and defend yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakery fresh: As usual, Shaquille O'Neal had a unique take on
the Lakers' fortunes, specifically their ability to come back after
the Blazers raced to a 10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that starts off hot always must go cold. You put a
croissant in a microwave and take it out, it's hot, aaaah,'' he
said, gesturing as if he'd burned his hand, ``but eventually it
will cool down. And I think they cooled down a lot. And we just
withstood all their pushes and we just kept playing.''

WOODS LOOKS SOLID AS A ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ Rain is the usual culprit when PGA Tour events
are shortened to 54 holes, but you can cite Tiger Woods's magical
talents for putting an early halt to this week's Memorial
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   He continued his assault on a softened Muirfield Village Golf
Club course Saturday with a 7-under-par 65 that featured an
outgoing 30 and a couple of second shots into par-5s that were
mistaken for NASA launches. Under a blanket of clouds that spit
light rain but not the downpours that had been predicted, Woods
finished at 17-under 199, which is six shots clear of Steve Lowery
(66), who thus draws a front-row seat to watch the world's greatest
player in Sunday's final round.
</P>
<P>
   It's an 18-hole trip that promises as thrilling a plot as an
episode of ``My Mother The Car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, guys, it's over,'' said a disenchanted Ernie Els, who
started the day in third place, just three behind Woods. But Els
and Harrison Frazar, who started just one behind Woods, looked like
a couple of guys out for a weekend round at the local muni when
compared with the third member of their group.
</P>
<P>
   Els (72_209) hit the trees once and found water twice to make
bogeys on three of four par-5s and lost seven shots in seven holes
to Woods. Frazar, meanwhile, made just one birdie and stumbled home
in 43 to shoot 78_213. No one would have blamed them had they asked
Woods if he wanted to play through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played with him in a long time,'' said Frazar, who
was on the express elevator from solo second to a tie for 23d,
``and now I know why.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome,'' said Els, who fell into a tie for seventh. ``I
mean, he missed a couple of putts, or he could have shot 61
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Frazar is a winless lad still cutting his teeth on the PGA
Tour, but Els is the world's eighth-ranked player and a man quite
capable of hitting the finest golf shots on the face of this earth.
It's just that Woods seems to be from another golf world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say I could hit shots like that . . .,'' said Els,
who shook his head rather than complete the thought. He was
referring to Woods's second shot into the 563-yard par-5 seventh, a
3-iron from 230 yards _ off a downslope, no less. The ball came to
rest 18-20 feet from the pin, and when Woods curled in the putt for
eagle, he was 5 under on his round, 15 under for the tournament,
and had officially mailed exit notices to everyone else in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   When a 7-iron to the 182-yard eighth tracked the pin all the way
and left Woods a tap-in to get to 6 under on his round, thoughts of
59 must have entered his head.
</P>
<P>
   Woods shook his head. His only thought, he said, ``was to put
myself in position to make birdie (on the next hole).'' Which he
did, only the 10-footer from above the pin rolled over the left
edge, making him settle for a 30.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, there was no shortage of candidates stepping up
to replace Frazar and Els as so-called challengers to Woods. They
ranged from Lowery, whose only Tour victory came in 1994; to Justin
Leonard, who aced the eighth hole and was trying to enjoy his round
of 66_206 and not ponder being seven shots out of the lead; to
lefthander Mike Weir (68_207), who was 6 under through 13 holes
when he got a migraine that led to bogeys on 16 and 18 and a finish
of 9 under.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Steve Flesch, who arguably shot the most overlooked
64 in recent history (though it lifted him into a tie for fifth at
8 under), these players were all reminded of the seemingly
impossible task at hand: Woods has won 15 of 17 times he has owned
the 54-hole lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as players appreciate what he's doing,'' said Leonard, who
has been battling the worst slump of his six-year PGA Tour career.
``The amazement has gone away. You almost come to expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery almost went unnoticed, despite making his seventh birdie
of the day on the difficult 18th hole to pull into second. Woods
was still on the course, and not much of an audience awaited the
soft-spoken man from Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get to the point where you feel like you're just
trying to stay out of the way of him,'' said Lowery, who has missed
six cuts in 15 starts and wouldn't seem to be much of a threat to
Woods, who added to his legend with his second shot into the par-5
11th.
</P>
<P>
   It was a 5-iron from about 215 yards and found air space
directly over the pin, coming to rest 18 feet away. His bid for
eagle lipped out, but he tapped in for birdie to go 7 under on his
round.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because he would birdie just one of the final seven
holes, perhaps because he would make just his second bogey of the
tournament at the 18th, or perhaps because he hasn't won any of the
last four events in which he's played, Woods refused to go along
with the sentiment expressed by Els and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's over,'' said Woods, who already has won
three of his nine PGA Tour starts this year and finished second in
three others.
</P>
<P>
   He stood alone in that thought, just as he stands alone when
golf talent is measured.

LAKERS' SHAW BENCHED BY NBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. - Brian Shaw says he was just trying to
congratulate his teammates. The NBA says Shaw was moving toward a
fight in progress.
</P>
<P>
   There is a major difference in interpretations surrounding
Shaw's decision to leave the Lakers bench Friday night, just as
teammate Rick Fox and Portland's Scottie Pippen began a shoving
match.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the NBA's strict interpretation of the rules - which
prohibit leaving the bench during a fight - that led to the league
suspending Shaw from today's Game 4 of the Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which cannot be appealed, leaves the Lakers with
just 10 players available. And it left Shaw angry and confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the court because there was a timeout called. I
didn't run off the bench to what was going on with Rick and
Scottie,'' said Shaw, who was also fined $2,500. ``I was already on
the court. And then I did take a couple of steps over in that
direction to see what was going on ....
</P>
<P>
   ``The money isn't the thing. But getting suspended for a game in
the Western Conference finals and my reputation as a player in the
league .... I've never caused any trouble, never done anything. I
didn't go over there in an aggressive manner. And now I'm getting
penalized for being on the court already when there was a timeout
called. It doesn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA did not issue an explanation. But the decision was
consistent with the league's zero-tolerance policy on fighting, and
its desire to avoid the kind of bench-clearing brawls that make pro
baseball look like pro wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA rulebook states, ``During an altercation, all players
not participating in the game must remain in the vicinity of their
bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen and Fox scuffled briefly with 7:23 left in the game,
after Pippen threw the ball at Fox's back near the scorer's table.
Shaw first walked onto the court, then toward the fracas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked on the floor to congratulate our guys as they were
coming off the floor. And then that whole thing broke out with
them, so I walked... over toward where it was going on, and we were
standing there, talking, and that was it. So I didn't think I did
anything wrong,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   No other players were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry (West) has voiced his dissatisfaction, and so have I,''
general manager Mitch Kupchak said of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak noted that players are allowed to walk on the court
during a timeout, ``but the issue here seems to be making a move
towards the altercation at the scorer's table .... We know Brian,
and we know he would never get involved in anything like that.
Maybe there was a curiosity factor or just an impulse to make a
step, but in the NBA's opinion it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw played only three minutes Friday, but he has been one of
the Lakers' best scorers off the bench and had averaged 21.5
minutes in the first two games of the series. His absence, combined
with an injury to rookie Devean George, leaves the Lakers without
another big guard to back up Kobe Bryant and Ron Harper. That will
mean more minutes for Derek Fisher, but at 6-foot-1, he could be
overmatched when the Blazers use a big-guard tandem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big loss for us,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``I'm
unhappy about it .... He's allowed to be on the floor because it's
a timeout .... The league has to be very cautious about what's gone
on in the past. And whether it's an overreaction or not, I don't
know.''

COYOTES-GRETZKY _ Just minutes after developer Steve Ellman
announced that hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky would join the new
Phoenix Coyotes ownership team, the phone started ringing with $1
million offers. Nearly a dozen investors, local and out of state,
called late Friday night and expressed interest in a possible
financial share in the franchise, Ellman told The Arizona Republic.
Story will move in the ``A'' and ``S'' categories.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ATHLETE-EXECUTIVE _ The superstar _ and super-rich _ athletes such
as Wayne Gretzky, Michael Jordan and John Elway, are switching to
the business side of sports, becoming part-owners and front-office
executives, or considering it. Story will move in the ``A'' and
``S'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FIRE _ Down in the flaming canyons near Los Alamos, a grimy New
Mexico firefighter joked with a hotshot from Arizona. ``Guess we'll
come to your side of the state line next week,'' he said. Except
that he wasn't really joking: It's the burning season in the
Southwest. Experts agree that no fewer than 100 cities in the state
are considered at risk for an ``urban/wild-land interface fire,''
the official name for a blaze at the edge of a forest whose beauty
has attracted human settlement. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HISPANIC-TV _ Young, female Spanish-speaking viewers are the
fastest-growing demographic group in the Valley, a population that
has catapulted Phoenix to the 10th-largest market in the United
States for Hispanic TV viewers. Story will move in the ``A'' and
``F'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN _ It's sounds like a long time to be in prison _ 20
years. Maybe it is, if you're the one behind bars. But to the
family of the victim, it flies by. Just ask the adult children of
Robert James Lugiewicz, whose father was murdered when they were
kids. By EJ MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K''
categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TV-GOODY-SEASON _ Who Wants to Be a Millionaire made history,
changing not only the course of the television season but the way
TV does business for the near future, if not beyond, for better,
worse and both. In a curious year for television, Regis Philbin
became a household and arguably saved network television from the
advancing clutches of cable. Story will move in the ``E''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TV-GOODY-COL _ I was thinking about how - and it kills me to say
this - Rush Limbaugh might not be such a terrible choice for the
Monday Night Football booth. Yes, he's a blowhard; yes, he's
infuriating; yes, his views are often so offensive that you want to
pull the car over and yank out the radio and hurl it into the
river. All of which is why Limbaugh would be, if not exactly a good
pick, at least an intriguing one. Story will move in the ``E''
category. &QL;

FINALS RATE RIGHT UP THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Admittedly, when the barbecue is rolled out of the
garage for Memorial Day weekend, the NHL is going to have a hard
time getting people to drop their beach towels and picnic baskets
to follow the road to the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL will be an easy mark for sports columnists to besmirch
and belittle because of low television ratings. Hockey has been the
weakling of the sports family for decades, and increasing ratings
is difficult. Too many choices. Too little time. Clicker, please.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who care about what goes on in the Original 28 _
and that's a sizable number here in the six-sheet region of New
England _ this playoff season has been the best since the Rangers
shrugged off 54 years of futility and won the Cup in 1994. That's
especially true in the Hub of Hockey because of the delightful
dalliance with the Colorado Avalanche of Ray Bourque, an aging icon
trying to keep his dream alive in the spring prom. Does it get any
better than both conference finals going to Game 7?
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, when the Blueshirts won, all the goodwill
disappeared only 90 days later when the NHL owners locked the
players out in hopes of retooling the collective bargaining
agreement. Four months later the games began again and the CBA was
retooled, all right, into a financial hand grenade that owners and
general managers continually jump on. We'll find out this summer
whether teams can stay in the lifeboat they jumped aboard last
summer and resist overpaying in the free agent market. If so, the
game may live to the next CBA summit in summer 2004.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I'm tired of watching baseball brawls _ hockey
got beyond that years ago _ and I can't keep up with the NFL's
growing list of deviants. We now have the final round to savor.
Bring me that 24-ounce iced tea, and don't dare touch that channel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   Ex-Bruin Jim Nill, now assistant general manager with the Red
Wings, is a leading candidate to land the GM job in Calgary, still
vacant after the end-of-season firing of Al Coates. Nill is from
Hanna, Alberta, home of the most famous Flame of all, Lanny
McDonald. Who in Bruins Country could ever forget the headline,
``Bruins get Nill for McNab''? . . . Now that Wayne Gretzky has
invested his name and his millions in the Phoenix Coyotes, don't be
surprised if he lobbies longtime friend and super agent Mike
Barnett to come aboard as chief contract negotiator. Barnett would
have to sever ties with IMG, where he represents, among others,
Bruins center Joe Thornton . . . While mulling his future in the
wake of Glen Sather's resignation in Edmonton, ex-defenseman Kevin
Lowe alluded to the possibility of taking a GM job, but not
necessarily the one left open by Sather. Hmm, let's see, Lowe is
fluent in French and English. Now, what French-speaking NHL city
might be interested in someone like that? . . . As expected, the
Red Wings informed Larry Murphy that they won't pick up his $3
million option for next season. That doesn't mean he's finished in
Wheeltown. It just means he'll have to take 25 or 30 cents on the
dollar if he wants to come back. The Wings also will be saying
goodbye to veteran pivot Igor Larionov, who had a chance at
midseason to sign for two more years at about $2 million per _ a
deal the Wings pulled off the table when his game began to look
old. One rumored landing spot for Larionov: Florida, where he could
help set up countryman Pavel Bure. But that could be more fantasy
than fact, especially if the Panthers are successful in signing
Czech star Jiri Dopita, once a Boston draft pick . . . Jobs
everywhere, but no offers for either Mike Keenan or Ted Nolan. Who
says the same names keep going round and round? . . . The Senators
had no complaints with the performance Tom Barrasso turned in after
joining them at the March trade deadline, but his salary demands
sound too expensive for their liking. For the right price, the
Wings could be interested, especially if Scotty Bowman returns as
coach. Remember, Bowman was Pittsburgh's director of player
development and recruitment when Barrasso backed the Penguins to
Stanley Cups in '91 and '92. Bowman, in fact, was behind the
Penguins bench for the second Cup and was the GM in Buffalo when
the Sabres drafted Barrasso . . . It appears Alain Vigneault will
remain behind the Montreal bench, but ownership hasn't issued a
vote of confidence for GM Rejean Houle. If Houle keeps the gig, he
may add Guy Carbonneau _ still playing for the Stars _ as his
assistant next season. Carbonneau said during the Avalanche-Stars
series that he wants to make the move to the front office . . .
Ever notice how few goalies _ Grant Fuhr being one exception _
catch with their right hands? According to Kelly Hrudey,
ex-backstop for the Islanders and Kings, there is no mystery to it.
It's simply the law of averages, the fact that most people are
righthanded. ``It's not like they're discouraged in youth hockey or
something,'' said Hrudey, who quit hockey as a youngster and had to
be coaxed back as a teenager, starting again for Inland Cement, a
Class D squad in Edmonton. ``You'd think there would be more _ kind
of like the pro golf tour, where you don't see many guys hitting
from the left.'' . . . The rumor mill has Jacques Lemaire surfacing
as the first head coach of the Minnesota Wild, possibly with ex-Hab
Mario Tremblay as an assistant. Wild GM Doug Risebrough and
Tremblay were linemates in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   The order of the draft won't be known until next week, but the
Atlanta Thrashers likely will pick first or second. Wouldn't it be
interesting if the Bruins, currently holding the No. 7 pick,
offered Anson Carter and the seventh pick for the Thrashers' No. 1
or 2? Carter no doubt will be difficult to sign here in the Hub,
and he would have a chance to become an instant favorite in
Atlanta. The Thrashers need bona fide players even more than the
Bruins do. The Bruins could use the pick to draft Boston University
goalie Rick DiPietro, who is considered a top-five talent . . .
While the Flames are turning inside-out to boost their season
tickets to 14,000, let it be noted that the Canucks have seen their
season-ticket base slip to 7,500, from a high of about 12,000 five
years ago. The Canucks have to find their stride soon and get back
into playoff contention, or GM Brian Burke's warnings that the
franchise could be forced to move might turn into reality.
Meanwhile, 23 Flames have purchased a pair of season tickets each
for 2000-01, lifting the current total to about 10,500 . . . Ex-BU
forward John Cullen, who recently left his Tampa coaching job for a
career in the car business in Atlanta, will have two reasons to
stay home this fall. The Cullens are expecting twins in October . .
. WBZ Radio has yet to name a replacement for Bob Neumeier, who
packed in his play-by-play mike at the end of the season. Let it be
duly noted once more that it was Neumie, back in his Hartford days,
who discovered the Whalers' fight song, ``Brass Bonanza,'' while
flipping through a stack of LPs one night (kids, ask your parents
about phonograph needles) . . . Word out of Long Island is that
Mike Milbury sat down recently with Sanjay Kumar, one of the
Islanders' new co-owners, and he was given assurances he'll remain
as GM. And don't be surprised if Milbury makes a serious run at
unrestricted free agent Don Sweeney when the July 1 shopping spree
arrives. In his Boston days, Milbury was a huge Sweeney booster,
and the Islanders could use the veteran's guile and pluck . . .
Hockey Heartthrob Dept.: Blesk, a Prague gossip magazine, reports
that Jaromir Jagr is hot and heavy with 19-year-old Andrea
Veresova, better known as Miss Slovakia . . . Alexei Yashin and the
Senators went to arbitration last week, the Senators adamant the
star Russian still owes a year's worth of work at $3.6 million.
Yashin wants to be declared a free agent. ``If he is declared a
free agent,'' said ex-NHL coach Harry Neale, now one of the game's
top color commentators, ``then shouldn't owners win the same right
to tell a player in the last year of his deal, `Look, we know
you've got a deal, but we don't want you, and we're not paying
you'?''

   Michel Bergeron and Harry Sinden will be linked in the history
books as the only GMs to trade Bourque. Bergeron was the boss in
Trois Rivieres almost a quarter-century ago when he swapped the
future Hall of Fame defenseman for a chance to win the Memorial Cup
(junior hockey's version of the Stanley Cup). ``It made sense
because we had a very talented team,'' said Bergeron, who dealt
Bourque for a scoring winger, Benoit Gosselin. ``But the first game
Gosselin played for us, he took a slash and broke his hand.''
Bergeron was on the Bourque beat last week, covering the
Avalanche-Stars series for French TV in Canada . . . Sather, who
could be offered more than $3 million and stock options in
Cablevision to become the Rangers boss, recalled recently that he
was a man of little clout in his playing days for the Blueshirts.
Emile Francis, then the Rangers head coach, once hurried Slats into
duty during a game, but the call wasn't to the ice. Instead,
Francis dispatched him to the dressing room with orders to sharpen
Jean Ratelle's skates. In those days, Sather ran offseason hockey
camps and was well-schooled in the art of sharpening blades. ``I
don't remember that,'' said Ratelle, who still scouts for the
Bruins. ``But it wouldn't surprise me if it happened, because in
those days, the Rangers had a guy who sharpened skates, and he
wasn't all that great at it.'' . . . Looking for a better edge,
Claude Lemieux convinced former Avalanche equipment manager Rob
McLean to come to New Jersey for the playoffs, exclusively to
sharpen skates. McLean and Lemieux were in Colorado before McLean
headed back to Ontario for a change of careers. Lemieux was dealt
back to the Devils _ for Brian Rolston, now with the Bruins . . .
Brian Bellows, who didn't catch on anywhere after Washington
released him following the 1998-99 season, is now a stockbroker
back home in Minnesota. He and Gord Kluzak, the top picks in the
1982 draft, both followed the yellow brick road to the finance
world after their hockey careers. Kluzak works in Boston for
Goldman Sachs . . . Ex-BU winger Tony Amonte was among those
Blackhawks most pleased to hear new Chicago coach Alpo Suhonen
extolling the virtues of the skate-and-shoot game. ``I'm smiling
about that,'' said Amonte, whose speed and shot could produce 100
points. If Suhonen's style can revive Alexei Zhamnov, that alone
would make his hiring worth it . . . One report out of New York had
Devils GM Lou Lamoriello pocketing no less than $30 million when
the team is finally sold and becomes part of the Yankees-Nets
package. That would mean Lamoriello holds roughly a 17 percent
equity position in the club . . . Look for the Columbus Blue
Jackets to sign Boston College forward Blake Bellefeuille to a
two-year free agent deal. Doug MacLean, the Blue Jackets GM,
scouted more than 20 BC games.

AFTER THIS YEAR, JACK WON'T BE BACK FOR MUCH

<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ We are in the midst of a farewell tour, though
it's hard to fathom because he will, after all, be quite present.
As the joke goes: ``What's he going to do, retire to play golf?''
</P>
<P>
   For all intents and purposes, 2000 is it for Jack Nicklaus in
the life he has known for four decades. He will play all four
majors this year, plus the four with the over-50 crowd, and
sprinkle in a few PGA Tour events so he can tee it up alongside his
son, Gary. But come 2001, his appearances will be limited to some
Senior stops, most likely his beloved Memorial tournament, and
perhaps the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. It's time to slow down, said Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked hard at the damned game for 40 years and, frankly,
I'm tired of that,'' he said. ``Your body can't take it. I mean, I
get up every morning and I've got a new ding here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've put my wife through 40 years of tournament golf. I
don't think she needs to have any more of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It strikes at the heart of the game's magical appeal that we can
talk of a man's ``retirement'' when he is 60 years old. Golf is a
game for life, the reason Nicklaus has been able to share his
talents with three generations of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments are made in almost all sports as to who was the best,
but not in golf, thanks to Nicklaus. Perhaps Tiger Woods will get
the flames going in the next 10 years, but for now, the answer is
Nicklaus. Let people argue about No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Player knows everyone will point to the 18 major
championships as evidence of Nicklaus's superiority, but to do so,
he argues, is to overlook the foundation of his greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can be great when they win,'' said Player. ``But Jack
was the greatest loser ever.''
</P>
<P>
   There were heart-wrenching losses to Tom Watson at Turnberry
(1977) and Pebble Beach (1982), to Lee Trevino at Merion (1971) and
Muirfield (1972), to Arnold Palmer at Cherry Hill (1960), even to
Hal Sutton at Riviera (1983). All part of his 17 runner-up finishes
in major championships, though in each one Nicklaus's character and
dignity stood out.
</P>
<P>
   Player said you never saw Nicklaus act badly on the course, but
Nicklaus said that wasn't true. He threw a club once in front of
his father, the guiding force in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He introduced me to golf, but when he saw me throw the club,
he told me I better never do that again,'' said Nicklaus. ``And I
haven't.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was not only my father, he was my best friend. He tried
to teach me the right way to do things.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider them lessons learned well, because Nicklaus has been an
exemplary athlete in a world that has too few of them. Those still
pained by the fact that he came along and knocked the beloved
Palmer from his throne can find satisfaction in the knowledge that
Nicklaus is deserving of every accolade that comes his way.
</P>
<P>
   He has been great to the game, but more importantly, he knows
the game has been great to him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nicklaus, the PGA Tour rookie and 31-year-old son of a
living legend, smiled when asked if his father gives him advice.
``A little bit,'' he said. ``When he's around and I need some help,
I'll obviously ask for his advice.'' A sly grin came to his face as
if Gary were suggesting that it isn't always a case of Father Knows
Best. Is that what he was getting at? ``Sometimes we have different
ideas,'' he said. ``Even though he's the greatest player that's
ever played, he's wrong sometimes. At least in my mind. But he is
getting smarter as he gets older.'' Gary indicated that the most
recent father-son ``disagreement'' came last weekend. ``He thought
I should have been here (Dublin, Ohio, for the Memorial) on
Saturday and I wanted to go home Saturday. He wasn't real happy
with me. I wasn't real happy with him questioning what I wanted to
do. But we talked about it and that was the end of it.'' . . . Tom
Lehman had been the biggest name supporting the fledgling
Tournament Players Association but he has changed his mind. After a
meeting with the Players Advisory Committee, in which Lehman and
the TPA were soundly shut down in their request to employ an
independent adviser to look at PGA Tour financial records, it
became obvious there was no place for such a union. ``I basically
decided that any further effort by the TPA is harmful to our
Tour,'' said Lehman, ``and I think it should disappear. Basically I
have resigned my membership.'' Mark Brooks remains the only ``big
name'' fighting for the TPA.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may not be a more unheralded two-time PGA Tour winner than
Gabriel Hjerstedt, the Sweden native who moved with his family to
Australia when he was 11. He may not be as zany as Jesper Parnevik,
but he's not exactly conventional, either. For one thing, Hjerstedt
prefers footwear that resembles high-top sneakers. ``I had a groin
problem earlier in the year, so they have actually helped me
walk,'' he said. For another, he has no inclination to jet back and
forth to keep contact with the European Tour. The American PGA Tour
is home. ``I like it over here,'' said Hjerstedt. ``I don't think
I'm going to go over and try to play 10 events or whatever it is
(to maintain a European PGA Tour card). I mean, I've got to look
after my own interests.'' Hjerstedt became the first Swede to win
in the US when he captured the 1997 B.C. Open, and he triumphed
again at Tucson in 1999. He went from 157th on the money list in
1998 to 41st in 1999, and he's currently 115th with $158,748 . . .
So, Greg Norman, what have you been doing since you played that
grueling back-to-back stretch at Augusta and Hilton Head? ``I've
been around the world in eight days.'' With anyone else, you'd
laugh, but with Norman, this is his life. He started in New York,
then checked in on a course he is building in Shannon, Ireland.
(``I've been very, very fortunate to get that piece of property.'')
From there, it was off to Dubai, then to Sydney and Melbourne, then
Honolulu, then home to Florida. It was strictly business, said
Norman: ``I didn't take my clubs overseas.'' Norman will skip next
week's Kemper Open but play the Buick Classic at Westchester CC
``because I love that golf course. Kind of like a fitter's golf
course. You've got to shape your ball.'' He is not alone in his
love of Westchester, for this year's field has attracted Phil
Mickelson, Davis Love, and Ernie Els, players who think so much of
the course that they will play the week before the US Open . . .
Speaking of the next major, don't count John Daly among those
looking forward to Pebble Beach. He stared blankly when the
question went his way. ``Not the way I'm playing,'' he said after
his round of 78 Thursday. ``I have no confidence in my golf game
right now. It's really tough. The more I work, the worse I get. I'm
swinging great, but scoring awful. It's weird, just weird.'' . . .
From excitement to despair for Mary Lawrence, a member of the LPGA
teaching division. She was awarded a spot into this week's Corning
Classic because of two late withdrawals, but then was disqualified
when she arrived at the first tee seven minutes late. Had she been
there two minutes earlier, officials would have let her start.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sophie Gustafson, who broke through for her first LPGA Tour win
a few weeks ago, showed that her game translates well overseas,
too. She won the Ladies Italian Open last week. The two who
finished second _ Valerie Van Ryckeghem of Belgium and Silvia
Cavalleri _ certainly had interesting caddies. Manoel Williams, her
coach and boyfriend, carried for Van Ryckeghem, while Vittoria
Cavalleri lugged the bag for her daughter. You may remember
Cavalleri from her US Women's Amateur conquest at Brae Burn CC in
1997 . . . Ford Olinger, the professional from Warsaw, Ind., with
the degenerative hip condition, shot 90 in local qualifying for the
US Open. He failed in his court case against the USGA and was not
allowed to use a cart, but they compromised on a Swedish Rollator.
``Sort of like a grocery cart,'' said Olinger, who is now 0 for 3
in local qualifiers. Two years ago, after winning a court
injunction against the USGA, Olinger drove a cart and shot 83. Last
year, after being denied a permanent injunction, he walked and
scored 88. Since then, the 7th US Circuit Court in Chicago ruled in
favor of the USGA, that a cart would change the nature of
competition, so while he appeals, Olinger had to settle for just a
walker. ``I'm in the same shoes (as Casey Martin). What's the
difference?'' asked Olinger. Well, to be honest, the difference is
that Martin has shown he can play at the highest level. Olinger
hasn't. In 1998, while Olinger was riding and shooting 83 in an
Open qualifier, Martin drove and made it through local and
sectional qualifying, then won legions of admirers by finishing
tied for 23d at The Olympic Club. The other difference is Martin's
case was heard in front of the 9th US Circuit Court in San
Francisco, which ruled in his favor. Martin, by the way, shot 78
and did not advance in the local qualifier at Austin CC in Texas .
. . Craig Stadler's stays at the Memorial continue to be short and
unmemorable. Citing continued back woes, he withdrew before the
start of Round 1. That makes it three WDs in four years. He hasn't
played in a PGA Tour event since he lost in a playoff at the Shell
Houston Open a month ago . . . George Bush, the former president,
was ever-present at the Memorial, having been named the most recent
member of The Captains Club, an international group of golfing
dignitaries invited by Jack Nicklaus to advise on matters
concerning the operation of this tournament. Sean Connery is also a
member . . . The Memorial Golf Journalism honors this year went to
Dave Anderson of The New York Times, Nick Seitz of Golf Digest, and
Renton Laidlaw, the Scotsman whose golden voice is reason enough to
get out of bed Sunday mornings for European Tour broadcasts on The
Golf Channel . . . Bruce Fleisher's father, Herbert, died Tuesday
after a three-month battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 76.

SPRINT-WORLDCOM MERGER UNLEASHES EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKE ONE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   Kansas City, Mo. _ If executives at
Sprint Corp. and WorldCom fail to steer their proposed merger past
antitrust regulators, shareholders may want some answers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the first questions they may ask: Why, if the merger
failed, was the process still a financial bonanza for executives
and senior management?
</P>
<P>
   Sprint shareholders overwhelmingly approved the WorldCom deal
April 28, enticed by the prospect of $76 in WorldCom stock for
every Sprint share, which closed Friday at 56.
</P>
<P>
   What many shareholders may not have realized was that they also
approved a provision that accelerated the vesting of stock options
worth as much as $1.7 billion to Sprint executives and employees _
even if WorldCom never completes its purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you could have here is the worst of both worlds, a huge
wealth transfer to management and employees, with no benefit to
shareholders,'' said Nell Minow, editor of a corporate governance
Web site. ``Shareholders may be paying for something they never
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint declined to comment on the stock option provision.
</P>
<P>
   At the a special shareholders' meeting in April, Chief Executive
William T. Esrey told shareholders that regulatory hurdles were to
be expected in a deal of such magnitude, but that the companies
expected to win approval by fall.
</P>
<P>
   That may still happen. If it does not _ and regulatory prospects
for the deal have darkened in recent weeks _ shareholders may look
back on the vote with some skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   On Page 78 of the company's 400-page mailing to shareholders
about the merger is a fairly innocuous sounding disclosure. ``Most
of Sprint's stock option plans provide that options outstanding for
a year at the time of the Sprint special meeting will become fully
vested, if not previously vested, and exercisable upon adoption by
Sprint shareholders of the merger agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the shareholder vote triggered the immediate
vesting of employees' options on millions of shares of Sprint and
Sprint PCS, accelerating a benefit that otherwise would have taken
employees and executives years to accrue.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for options to vest when companies merge. The
rationale is to minimize management's motivation to protect its own
interests by blocking a merger that would benefit shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual _ though not unique _ in Sprint's case is that
the benefits accelerated with the shareholder vote, not with the
completion of the deal. And with a deal of this size and
complexity, companies do not normally hold shareholder votes before
the government's concerns are resolved, some compensation experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Regulatory concerns have been public since the companies agreed
to merge and presumably were debated in detail by the companies and
regulators in their six-month investigation of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the shareholder vote, the European Commission
announced that it had ``serious concerns'' about the deal. Its
investigation concluded that the merged company would have a
dominant position in the markets for Internet connectivity and
global telecommunications services. The commission will hold a
meeting Tuesday in which the companies and the deal's critics will
make their case to the antitrust arm of the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, staffers at the U.S. Department of Justice also
forwarded a recommendation to block the deal on antitrust grounds
to the department's chief antitrust regulator, Joel Klein. WorldCom
and Sprint officials reportedly were scheduled to meet with Klein
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the acceleration of the employee options could be
troublesome in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, the value of existing shares may be watered down as
employees convert their options to new shares.
</P>
<P>
   Experts call such exposure an overhang. And while it's unlikely
that employees would all choose to exercise their options at once,
outstanding options were about 6 percent of the outstanding shares
at year end.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a dramatic number compared to some high-tech
companies, but it isn't such a good thing for the company,'' said
Charles Elson, a law professor at Stetson University College in St.
Petersburg, Fla., whose specialty is corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Melloul, a securities analyst with Argus Research, said
that the ratio of options to outstanding shares was relatively
small and that the potential dilution was manageable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the deal will go through, even through it will face
some challenges,'' he said. ``When the deal goes through,
shareholders will get a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   A second concern is that the shareholder vote may have turned
the company's golden handcuffs into a golden handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Options are designed to keep talented employees from leaving by
allowing them to profit from their company's rising share price.
Employees receive grants giving them the right to buy a set number
of shares at a set price, anytime in, say, the next 10 years. Those
options are typically phased in, or vested, over a number of years,
and the employee is tied to the firm as they wait for all their
options to become exercisable.
</P>
<P>
   In Sprint's case employees have seen the potential payoff from
their accumulated options balloon in recent years as the price of
Sprint shot up.
</P>
<P>
   Option holders also got a bonus when Sprint issued shares of its
wireless company to shareholders. An employee with existing options
on 1,000 shares of Sprint received an additional option to purchase
500 shares of PCS.

<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ Accelerated vesting of those options could
give thousands of Sprint employees new financial independence.
Coupled with a robust job market in the telecommunications
industry, many could cash in their chips and walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you don't want to do is provide them with the same
walk-away money for a deal that doesn't go through,'' Minow said.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to put an exact number on the wealth created by
the accelerated vesting, or how many employees share it. The
company would not confirm any numbers, and there were some
limitations on the vesting.
</P>
<P>
   Based on 1999 year-end filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, however, the vote accelerated the vesting of as much as
$1.7 billion worth of options for employees and executives, adding
to $1.4 billion worth of options that were already exercisable.
</P>
<P>
   Most went to top managers. Esrey saw as much as $320 million
worth of benefits accelerated by the vote. Sprint President Ronald
LeMay's paper wealth jumped by as much as $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Kevin Brauer, former president of Sprint's national
integrated services division; Arthur Krause, chief financial
officer; and Andrew Sukawaty, president of Sprint PCS, saw the
value of their ``exercisable'' options leap by as much as $45
million.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the company's 77,000 employees shared in as much as
$1.2 billion, almost $16,000 apiece, although the options are
heavily skewed toward employees who are director level and above.
</P>
<P>
   Many senior employees at Sprint are now sitting on hundreds of
thousands, some even millions, of dollars in paper profits from
their options in a robust job market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates the opposite kind of incentive that you were trying
to create with a long vesting schedule for the options,'' Elson
said. ``What's the incentive to stick around now? You can take your
money and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint did institute a retention program for senior employees to
minimize any talent drain after the vote, offering additional
options for employees who agree to stick around until a specified
date, and putting existing options in trust.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey and LeMay also are subject to additional limitations for
directors of the company, preventing them from exercising some of
their options.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's situation bears some similarity to Northrop Grumman's,
when regulators chose to fight that company's proposed merger with
Lockheed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sprint, Northrop's stock options accelerated when
shareholders approved that merger, triggering $150 million to $160
million in stock awards and payments to company executives.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department subsequently challenged the deal on
antitrust grounds. And when the companies scuttled their deal,
Northrop's management was sued by shareholders who said management
knew the deal was in trouble, but went ahead with the shareholder
vote that accelerated their options.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the shareholders said they were still fighting the
case in state and federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management created a win-win situation for themselves,'' said
Randall Baron, the attorney who filed the shareholder case against
Northrop.
</P>
<P>
   Regulatory concerns over the Sprint-WorldCom deal have been far
more public than those in the Northrop-Lockheed case. And Sprint's
stock has not fallen precipitously since staff at the Justice
Department forwarded their recommendation to block the deal, as
Northrop's did.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Baron said the circumstances shared similarities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If shareholders know that there are millions of dollars in
benefits that the company has to pay, even if the deal doesn't go
through, they may be less likely to vote in favor of the merger''
until it's assured of passing, he said. -30-

HARPER HAS WINNING VISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. - Poor, proud, pedestrian Ron Harper. It was hard
not to pity the Lakers' wily warrior as he limped along in the
first 12 games of these playoffs. While teammates Kobe Bryant and
Shaquille O'Neal were maturing before our very eyes, Harper
appeared to be merely aging.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year veteran had been giving Father Time the slip for
years, but it was beginning to look like his longtime nemesis had
wrapped himself around Harper and was harassing him so he couldn't
get a hand on Sacramento's Nick Anderson, Phoenix's Penny Hardaway
or Portland's Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Harper was starting to look horribly miscast in Los
Angeles, which is less a city than a sprawling spa where people go
to look and feel younger. Not since Larry Robinson coached the
Kings had we seen someone come to L.A. and put on so many years so
fast.
</P>
<P>
   We hardly recognized Harper when he hurried out of the Lakers'
practice facility, barely breathing a word to reporters, on the
days between Monday's Game 2 and Friday's Game 3 of the ongoing
Western Conference finals. We took his sudden silence as a
reflexive response to a game that had gone quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Silly us.
</P>
<P>
   We should have known Harper, like Robinson, had a lot of life
left in him. Both men looked rejuvenated Friday, with Robinson
guiding the New Jersey Devils into the Stanley Cup Finals and
Harper scoring the decisive basket in the Lakers' 93-91 win.
</P>
<P>
   Harper's 19-foot jump shot from the left corner with 29.9
seconds remaining was sweeter than Chick Hearn's syntax. Fittingly,
it came off a feed from Kobe Bryant, who would have been a lot less
inclined to pass in such a situation if he hadn't had Harper in his
ear all year, gently reminding him that teammates are what make the
triangle offense work.
</P>
<P>
   What's really remarkable is Harper didn't just call for the
ball, he called his shot.
</P>
<P>
   During one of the final timeouts, Harper set the scene for his
teammates, saying something to the effect of, ``Look. I've been
open all night, so if someone would be so kind as to pass me the
ball I'll make the shot. I promise.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked for all the pressure and then let go a shot that was as
true as his word.
</P>
<P>
   That's not easy, no matter how many NBA championship rings you
own. But at some point in a successful title run, it must be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ron's seen enough, he's in a sense a visionary,''
Laker forward Rick Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Experience would appear to be the mother of all foresight. In
the third quarter, Harper started chasing the ball, the better to
disrupt the Trail Blazers' rhythm on offense. With Harper using his
one good leg as a pogo stick, the Lakers outscored Portland 27-16
in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody told Harper that was the thing to do. He just knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an instinctive thing,'' he said before Saturday's
practice.
</P>
<P>
   That's Harper, compensating for his tired old limbs with a
perfectly preserved sixth sense.
</P>
<P>
   His gut instinct told him to put off retirement for another year
to help usher in the Phil Jackson era in L.A. And something told
him he was the guy to turn this best-of-seven series around.
</P>
<P>
   At the tense juncture of Game 3, Harper was able to stay really,
really tranquil. He took what he had learned all those years of
sharing a backcourt in Chicago with Michael Jordan and passed it on
to the Lakers in a way none of them soon will forget.
</P>
<P>
   Harper ``was probably the calmest one out there at that point,''
Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   His composure was contagious. A team that had come undone under
duress four days earlier pulled itself together for a gallant last
stand.
</P>
<P>
   With 1.9 seconds left, Bryant rose to block the shot of Arvydas
Sabonis, conceding eight inches to the Portland center but not one
damn thing more.
</P>
<P>
   They don't give out assists on game-saving blocked shots, which
is why the box scores will never tell the complete story of
Harper's value to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fills up the box score in different ways,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, he was back to filling up our notebooks as well.
His silence earlier in the week was intended to send a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to tell my teammates, enough of all this hype
stuff,'' Harper said. ``Let's not talk a good game, let's go out
and play one.''
</P>
<P>
   That's experience talking. Which is nevermore to be confused
with old age. &QL;

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Suddenly, Roger
Thompson _ for three decades a mild-mannered computer whiz _ was a
bloodhound unleashed for the hunt.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When scoundrels somewhere in the Philippines set loose a
computer virus dubbed the ``love bug,'' infecting personal
computers everywhere by e-mail, Thompson reacted as a growing
number of high-techies do these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm chasing the perp,'' the Atlanta cybersleuth said.
</P>
<P>
   And off Thompson went, tapping his PC keyboard, searching the
love bug's coded pathways for electronic breadcrumbs that might
lead him to the perpetrator who wrote the virus. Thompson worked
alone at his home, but countless other detectives were out there in
cyberspace with him.
</P>
<P>
   They are not cops. They tell the cops where to look.
</P>
<P>
   Complex as it sounds, tracking the mad scientists behind deadly
computer viruses can be done rather swiftly, experts and law
enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a process repeating itself this weekend, as the FBI looks
into another virus that struck several corporate e-mail systems
Friday. This bug, ``killer resume,'' arrived pretending to be a job
candidate's resume.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the latest threat would not likely spread far
during a holiday weekend, but the FBI warned users of the Microsoft
Outlook program not to open e-mail with the subject line ``Resume _
Janet Simons.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the love bug, which had wormed its way through
e-mail attachments seductively marked ``ILOVEYOU,'' authorities
working with cybersleuths in the private sector traced the virus to
a band of students at a Philippine college within a day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bug had time to strike an estimated 45 million
computers in 20 countries, causing nearly $10 billion in damage.
Industry observers are calling ``the killa from Manila'' the most
widespread act of computer vandalism in history.
</P>
<P>
   The crime is an increasingly common one that, for now, human
ingenuity cannot stop. On the other hand, these mass invasions _
unlike all other criminal acts _ may leave evidence out there that
the public at large can sift through, given the proper know-how and
Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals such as Thompson, 47, knew where to look when the
love bug hit May 4.
</P>
<P>
   As technical director of malicious code research at ICSA.net, an
Internet security company that tests anti-virus software, Thompson
scanned eight pages of computer code affixed to the malignant
e-mail. Some clues jumped right off the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The code included: ``barok...i hate go to
school...spyder...AMACC...GRAMMERSoft Group...''
</P>
<P>
   Barok: The name of a password-stealing software program written
by a Filipino hacker last year.
</P>
<P>
   I hate go to school: A student with an adolescent gripe?
</P>
<P>
   Spyder: The apparent e-mail handle of the virus' author.
</P>
<P>
   AMACC: AMA Computer College in Manila.
</P>
<P>
   GRAMMERSoft: An underground group of AMA hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer virus hunters from all corners of the World Wide Web
passed their findings to the FBI's National Infrastructure
Protection Center, which was established in 1998 to fight
``cyberterrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Kansas City, the regional office of the FBI fielded tips
from online Sherlocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of hours after the news reports, someone out there
gave us the source code,'' FBI regional spokesman Jeff Lanza said.
``By then headquarters already had it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do get unsolicited contacts from computer people who, like
most people, want to help solve crimes,'' Lanza said. ``We can't
complain about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1990s, virus writing was an obscure craft only the
most knowledgeable programmers could master. Computer systems were
less powerful, less interconnected, less easy to use and, thus,
more difficult for vandals to infect in epidemic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The battleground changed when Microsoft introduced WordBasic and
VisualBasic, freeing PC users from many repetitive tasks and making
programming more accessible to everyone. In the meantime, the
widening Internet provided a hot medium by which viruses could
travel faster to more computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the computers used at Xerox Park, at government agencies
and nuclear power plants are essentially the same as the computer
in a 14-year-old's bedroom,'' said Carey Nachenberg, chief of
research for the Symantec AntiVirus Research Center in California.
</P>
<P>
   As such, many of today's virus launchers are young pranksters
driven by the urge just to do it, to show their pals _ if not the
world _ all they know. Self-styled groups even offer virus-building
kits on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``A typical 14-year-old could go online and create their own in
an hour or so,'' Nachenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that ``most viruses are pretty stupid,'' he
said, and will never spread and harm other computers.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said a virus writer who creates something original can
be an admirable foil. ``But the ones who make a variation of what's
already been done? Those guys are lame.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when a virus does propagate _ as the love bug did _ sloppy
coding often will lead investigators directly to the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most virus writers aren't particularly skilled at covering
their tracks,'' said David Chess, one of the top virus hunters at
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some wish to take credit. In other cases, it's my guess they
don't take the time to think, `This could spread all over the world
and people might catch me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a Boston suburb, James Atkinson faced a wall of 17 computer
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   On these screens, he said, you can watch a virus behave as it
spreads from computer to computer, leaving information at each
stop. The procedure is called ``sandboxing,'' analogous to the way
psychologists study children's behavior by watching them play in a
sandbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``You create a environment in which the virus can play,'' said
Atkinson. He works for the Granite Island Group, which deals in
``technical counterintelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atkinson's world there exists but a handful of ``big-game
hunters'' of computer viruses _ himself included, he said
sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding them are ``crowds of tribesmen running around
hunting water buffaloes with peashooters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The big-game hunters will not often volunteer their services to
investigate viruses and report them to the FBI, Atkinson said.
``It's their stock and trade,'' and for Atkinson, that means $250
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   When the love bug hit, a large corporation asked Atkinson to
sniff out the menace that had damaged its computers. Within six
hours he had traced the virus to five collaborators, aged 19 to 23,
affiliated with AMA College in the Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Probing deeper, Atkinson even found a membership roll of the
college's mischief makers _ the GRAMMERSoft Group _ and sent e-mail
questionnaires to 50 students listed. From their responses,
Atkinson said, he learned the roles each suspect played in creating
the virus and how ``one of them snapped'' and zapped it to the
world.
</P>
<P>
   After Philippines police began arresting suspects, including
bank employee Reomel Ramones, Atkinson was the first to tell
Internet news site Wired.com that the police had the wrong guy. Two
days later, police released Ramones for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson said the brightest cybersleuths always will remain in
the private sector, where the income and stock options far surpass
what law enforcement pays.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and President Clinton have vowed to hire
more Internet-savvy investigators and to do whatever is needed to
keep the nation safe from keyboard-tapping terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Attorney General Janet Reno announced a Cybercitizen
Partnership between law enforcement and the technology community.
The campaign includes a personnel exchange program to share
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Virus experts said they welcomed the increased vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal investigators definitely have turned to private
industry for assistance, and we've responded admirably to the
invitation,'' said Alan Komet of Computer Associates, a major
producer of anti-virus software. ``We work with (the FBI) on a
daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Symantec and IBM soon will introduce a ``digital immune system''
designed to watch for known viral intruders and any other
suspicious activity in a computer's system. Any file with odd
characteristics would be routed to the Symantec research center and
``a cure'' would be sent back to the affected network, Nachenberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   That will not keep virus writers from plugging away. Every new
computing feature becomes a potential target of the viruses of
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Already some 40,000 viruses lurk out there, most of which have
been concocted in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   They'll keep the cybersleuth posse busy for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy it when I can track a perp down,'' Thompson said.
``And if not, I'll get them next time.'' MORE

PROBLEMS PERSIST IN MONTREAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Montreal owner Jeffrey Loria has increased the
Expos' payroll to $33 million, the team has signed young players to
multi-year deals, has been active in the free-agent market and has
one of the game's top players in Vladimir Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday, the Expos were also a surprising 25-20 and in
second place in the National League East.
</P>
<P>
   However, Montreal is still having problems because of problems
getting television and radio deals, opposition and a lack of
funding for a downtown ballpark and reported friction within the
new ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos are expected to lose money again this season, and
Loria is still fighting to get English- and French-speaking radio
and television deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are already in a situation where it's costing us several
hundred thousand dollars just to be on French radio,'' Loria said,
``while all of our competitors have a minimum of $8 million to $10
million in broadcast revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   But one thing Loria won't do is have another
franchise-debilitating fire sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely will not do that,'' said Loria, who added he
would do the opposite. If the Expos are in contention in August,
Loria said he would look to add a player or two.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling of himself: Phillies right-hander Curt Schilling isn't
scheduled to pitch this weekend against the Dodgers, but even if he
did he might not be recognizable. The guy who overpowered National
League hitters before arm surgery is having trouble these days.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts who've seen Schilling pitch this season say his velocity
is below 90 mph. He's 1-2 with a 5.58 ERA in five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Trade bait: Yankees scout Gene Michael was at the Dodgers'
brawling series in Chicago to evaluate a few Cubs players,
including left-handed hitting Henry Rodriguez. The Yankees want
Rodriguez to play left field, and the Cubs are entertaining the
idea. The deal would send Rodriguez to the Yankees for highly
regarded outfielder Ricky Ledee and minor-league pitchers Mike
Buddie and Jay Tessmer, who could help the woeful Cubs bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But Sammy Sosa said it's much too early to start thinking about
unloading players for prospects, even though the Cubs are 19-31 and
near the bottom of the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the time to make that move,'' Sosa said. ``We have to
stay together. What are they going to do, bring in some young kids?
Then nobody will go to the ballpark. Jeez, we're not even two
months into the season, but everybody thinks it's September.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop, thief!: Reds manager Jack McKeon wasn't happy with the way
the Dodgers won Monday. It came when Reds catcher Eddie Taubensee
was ruled to have missed home plate on a force play in the bottom
of the 14th inning. Several Dodgers remarked they thought
Taubensee's foot hit the plate, but McKeon seemed a little more
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (bleeping) game was stolen from us,'' McKeon said. ``We
might have lost it with the next hitter. But we certainly shouldn't
have lost that ballgame on that play. That's a perfect reason for
baseball to have instant replay.''
</P>
<P>
   He said what?: Giants catcher Bobby Estalella had no qualms
about what spurred a recent huge collision with Atlanta's Andres
Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned around and saw his face,'' Estalella said. ``He was
three feet away from me with eyes like the devil trying to hit me.
So I put the ball in his face as hard as I could. If he's going to
hit me, I'm going to try to hit him, too.''

SCOUT COMPLETES PROJECT TO HONOR THOSE WHO DIED AT MENTAL

 TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   OSAWATOMIE, Kan. _ Monday morning, as the sun rises and the
birds begin to sing, Eagle Scout Jeremy Woods will pay homage to
hundreds of people he never knew.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old will unfurl an American flag, run it up a pole
atop a hill overlooking this old railroad town of 4,500 and think
to himself of those who have come before.
</P>
<P>
   No flowery Memorial Day speeches. No brass band. Just a young
man standing in front of an unnamed memorial plot he helped
refurbish last year as part of his Eagle Scout project.
</P>
<P>
   In front of him, jutting from the Miami County earth some 30
miles south of Overland Park, will be nine symmetrical rows of
numbered concrete headstones.
</P>
<P>
   The 346 plots face west toward the Osawatomie State Hospital, a
134-year-old place that started out as the Kansas State Insane
Asylum, the first facility of its kind west of the Mississippi
River.
</P>
<P>
   In the strictest sense, it would be a mistake to identify this
spot along old Asylum Road as a cemetery, for only some of the
plots _ and nobody can say how many _ hold the remains of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what the concrete tablets represent are the hundreds of
people who are now buried in unmarked plots scattered about the
800-acre wooded facility overlooking the Marais des Cygnes River.
</P>
<P>
   Woods plans to be here to remember those who so many others
forgot _ by design.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would live their entire lives and be locked away (at
the state hospital) and die there, and nobody would see them. Then
they would be given an anonymous grave plot,'' said District Judge
Stephen D. Hill, who helped guide Woods' Eagle Scout effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``But through this project one young man has forced us to
recognize that these people have value, and they're not just
throwaways.''
</P>
<P>
   Osawatomie is a town that embraces its history. Files at the
town's historical society are thick with stories of abolitionist
John Brown, the Old Stone Church and the birth of the Republican
Party in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they make scant mention of the state hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ask city librarian Dorothy Ingram for records on the hospital
memorial site, and she'll tell you the same thing she's told so
many before _ sorry, but there's precious little information.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who have lived their entire lives in Miami County
do not even know the plot exists. Others know but are reluctant to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' mother, Lylise Evans, just wants her town to come to
grips with its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like it brought to people's eyes that there was a cemetery
out there,'' she said. ``A lot of people don't even know it's
there. I don't think the community really wants to be known for the
hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who plans to attend Wichita State University in the fall
to study criminology, is motivated by a simple message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The names at the plots were just forgotten, and that's how I
see it,'' Woods said. ``If that was my brother or my sister or my
grandpa or my parents buried out there, I would not want them
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital opened in 1866, a time when mental illness
stigmatized sufferers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half of the patients at Osawatomie State Hospital
fell into the `forgotten' category,'' said Tom Lawson, now
superintendent of schools in Eureka. He received his doctorate in
education in 1994 after spending three years researching the
hospital's archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you were sentenced there you were lost, and your family
was scarred, and you were never mentioned again and never talked
about,'' Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families literally would drop folks off here and then
disappear,'' said Norma Stephens, who worked at the hospital for
more than four decades. She started as secretary to the
superintendent in 1946 and retired as superintendent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often there would be no relatives who were willing or could
financially claim the bodies. Hospital staff would often make every
effort to locate relatives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would all get very close to those individuals who had been
there for so many years. It was just like losing a member of our
own families. We wanted them to have the burial they would have
had, had family been there to claim them.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not always possible.
</P>
<P>
   At its most overcrowded, in World War II, Osawatomie State
Hospital had 1,693 patients with three doctors, two consulting
doctors and a superintendent. At its height, some 300 people died
at the hospital each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   What records do exist show that from 1874 to 1928 the unclaimed
bodies of patients were buried in a different spot on the northwest
corner of the hospital grounds. Before 1874 the dead were buried
elsewhere on the grounds, but where is now a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928 the headstones from the old cemetery were moved to the
current memorial site, but the bodies were left behind. In the
1960s the hospital constructed its new Adair buildings on the old
cemetery. The buildings were built on slab foundations so as not to
disturb the dead.
</P>
<P>
   So the plot one sees today east of the hospital mixes memorial
headstones from the earlier burial site with the actual graves of
those buried from 1928 to 1960. Hospital records that identify
those memorialized in the 346 plots are sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Some scant facts are known.
</P>
<P>
   Plot No. 1 represents a patient, name unknown, who was buried on
Feb. 2, 1928, according to archives.
</P>
<P>
   No. 157 is one of two to offer a name for the person buried
there. Beside the numbered headstone is a polished stone of granite
that reads: ``In memory of granny. Minnie M. Devine, born Jan. 4,
1875, died Oct. 23, 1933.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 230 is partly swallowed by a cedar tree.
</P>
<P>
   At plot No. 279, a stone indicates the grave belongs to ``Clyde
Nelson, born Dec. 27, 1880, died Nov. 30, 1941.'' Written by hand
in concrete that borders the stone: ``father.''
</P>
<P>
   The final stone, No. 346, represents someone who died April 6,
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, attitudes toward mental illness have changed,
and Lawson says it would be wrong to judge the actions of the past
by the standards of today. Since 1960, only one patient's body has
gone unclaimed and is buried in the Osawatomie city cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Woods and a dozen fellow scouts from Troop 106 of
the Twin River District with the Heart of America Boy Scout Council
placed artificial flowers on the first and last grave markers of
each of the nine rows of stones. Late in the afternoon a Scout
color guard then presented the flag and recited the Pledge of
Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Last year troop members spent 175 hours resetting headstones,
removing lichen and putting up a sign and bench. A grounds crew
from the state hospital erected the flagpole.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the sign was erected, it was repainted by the
hospital crew, Woods said. The original wording, ``Osawatomie State
Hospital Cemetery,'' was changed to ``Historic Memorial Site.''
</P>
<P>
   A hospital administrator said the original sign was simply
confusing to visitors seeking information about the plots.
</P>
<P>
   Woods first found out about the change when a friend called to
say it appeared as if his sign had been vandalized. Later, while
attending a City Council meeting to receive a citation for his
Eagle Scout project, he learned his sign had been reworded by a
hospital worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not seeking any glory by fixing up this cemetery,'' said
Woods, a soft-spoken assistant Scout leader. ``I just want people
to know these people were still human and deserve some respect.
This is the right thing to do.''

SLEUTHS OF EVERY STRIP HELP SNIFF OUT COMPUTER VIRUS CREATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   Kansas City, Mo. _ Suddenly, Roger
Thompson _ for three decades a mild-mannered computer whiz _ was a
bloodhound unleashed for the hunt.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When scoundrels somewhere in the Philippines set loose a
computer virus dubbed the ``love bug,'' infecting personal
computers everywhere by e-mail, Thompson reacted as a growing
number of high-techies do these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm chasing the perp,'' the Atlanta cybersleuth said.
</P>
<P>
   And off Thompson went, tapping his PC keyboard, searching the
love bug's coded pathways for electronic breadcrumbs that might
lead him to the perpetrator who wrote the virus. Thompson worked
alone at his home, but countless other detectives were out there in
cyberspace with him.
</P>
<P>
   They are not cops. They tell the cops where to look.
</P>
<P>
   Complex as it sounds, tracking the mad scientists behind deadly
computer viruses can be done rather swiftly, experts and law
enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a process repeating itself this weekend, as the FBI looks
into another virus that struck several corporate e-mail systems
Friday. This bug, ``killer resume,'' arrived pretending to be a job
candidate's resume.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the latest threat would not likely spread far
during a holiday weekend, but the FBI warned users of the Microsoft
Outlook program not to open e-mail with the subject line ``Resume _
Janet Simons.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the love bug, which had wormed its way through
e-mail attachments seductively marked ``ILOVEYOU,'' authorities
working with cybersleuths in the private sector traced the virus to
a band of students at a Philippine college within a day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bug had time to strike an estimated 45 million
computers in 20 countries, causing nearly $10 billion in damage.
Industry observers are calling ``the killa from Manila'' the most
widespread act of computer vandalism in history.
</P>
<P>
   The crime is an increasingly common one that, for now, human
ingenuity cannot stop. On the other hand, these mass invasions _
unlike all other criminal acts _ may leave evidence out there that
the public at large can sift through, given the proper know-how and
Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals such as Thompson, 47, knew where to look when the
love bug hit May 4.
</P>
<P>
   As technical director of malicious code research at ICSA.net, an
Internet security company that tests anti-virus software, Thompson
scanned eight pages of computer code affixed to the malignant
e-mail. Some clues jumped right off the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The code included: ``barok...i hate go to
school...spyder...AMACC...GRAMMERSoft Group...''
</P>
<P>
   Barok: The name of a password-stealing software program written
by a Filipino hacker last year.
</P>
<P>
   I hate go to school: A student with an adolescent gripe?
</P>
<P>
   Spyder: The apparent e-mail handle of the virus' author.
</P>
<P>
   AMACC: AMA Computer College in Manila.
</P>
<P>
   GRAMMERSoft: An underground group of AMA hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer virus hunters from all corners of the World Wide Web
passed their findings to the FBI's National Infrastructure
Protection Center, which was established in 1998 to fight
``cyberterrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Kansas City, the regional office of the FBI fielded tips
from online Sherlocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of hours after the news reports, someone out there
gave us the source code,'' FBI regional spokesman Jeff Lanza said.
``By then headquarters already had it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do get unsolicited contacts from computer people who, like
most people, want to help solve crimes,'' Lanza said. ``We can't
complain about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1990s, virus writing was an obscure craft only the
most knowledgeable programmers could master. Computer systems were
less powerful, less interconnected, less easy to use and, thus,
more difficult for vandals to infect in epidemic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The battleground changed when Microsoft introduced WordBasic and
VisualBasic, freeing PC users from many repetitive tasks and making
programming more accessible to everyone. In the meantime, the
widening Internet provided a hot medium by which viruses could
travel faster to more computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the computers used at Xerox Park, at government agencies
and nuclear power plants are essentially the same as the computer
in a 14-year-old's bedroom,'' said Carey Nachenberg, chief of
research for the Symantec AntiVirus Research Center in California.
</P>
<P>
   As such, many of today's virus launchers are young pranksters
driven by the urge just to do it, to show their pals _ if not the
world _ all they know. Self-styled groups even offer virus-building
kits on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``A typical 14-year-old could go online and create their own in
an hour or so,'' Nachenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that ``most viruses are pretty stupid,'' he
said, and will never spread and harm other computers.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said a virus writer who creates something original can
be an admirable foil. ``But the ones who make a variation of what's
already been done? Those guys are lame.''

SLEUTHS OF EVERY STRIP HELP SNIFF OUT COMPUTER VIRUS CREATORS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   `` ... are lame.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ Even when a virus does propagate _ as the
love bug did _ sloppy coding often will lead investigators directly
to the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most virus writers aren't particularly skilled at covering
their tracks,'' said David Chess, one of the top virus hunters at
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some wish to take credit. In other cases, it's my guess they
don't take the time to think, `This could spread all over the world
and people might catch me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a Boston suburb, James Atkinson faced a wall of 17 computer
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   On these screens, he said, you can watch a virus behave as it
spreads from computer to computer, leaving information at each
stop. The procedure is called ``sandboxing,'' analogous to the way
psychologists study children's behavior by watching them play in a
sandbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``You create a environment in which the virus can play,'' said
Atkinson. He works for the Granite Island Group, which deals in
``technical counterintelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atkinson's world there exists but a handful of ``big-game
hunters'' of computer viruses _ himself included, he said
sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding them are ``crowds of tribesmen running around
hunting water buffaloes with peashooters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The big-game hunters will not often volunteer their services to
investigate viruses and report them to the FBI, Atkinson said.
``It's their stock and trade,'' and for Atkinson, that means $250
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   When the love bug hit, a large corporation asked Atkinson to
sniff out the menace that had damaged its computers. Within six
hours he had traced the virus to five collaborators, aged 19 to 23,
affiliated with AMA College in the Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Probing deeper, Atkinson even found a membership roll of the
college's mischief makers _ the GRAMMERSoft Group _ and sent e-mail
questionnaires to 50 students listed. From their responses,
Atkinson said, he learned the roles each suspect played in creating
the virus and how ``one of them snapped'' and zapped it to the
world.
</P>
<P>
   After Philippines police began arresting suspects, including
bank employee Reomel Ramones, Atkinson was the first to tell
Internet news site Wired.com that the police had the wrong guy. Two
days later, police released Ramones for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson said the brightest cybersleuths always will remain in
the private sector, where the income and stock options far surpass
what law enforcement pays.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and President Clinton have vowed to hire
more Internet-savvy investigators and to do whatever is needed to
keep the nation safe from keyboard-tapping terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Attorney General Janet Reno announced a Cybercitizen
Partnership between law enforcement and the technology community.
The campaign includes a personnel exchange program to share
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Virus experts said they welcomed the increased vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal investigators definitely have turned to private
industry for assistance, and we've responded admirably to the
invitation,'' said Alan Komet of Computer Associates, a major
producer of anti-virus software. ``We work with (the FBI) on a
daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Symantec and IBM soon will introduce a ``digital immune system''
designed to watch for known viral intruders and any other
suspicious activity in a computer's system. Any file with odd
characteristics would be routed to the Symantec research center and
``a cure'' would be sent back to the affected network, Nachenberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   That will not keep virus writers from plugging away. Every new
computing feature becomes a potential target of the viruses of
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Already some 40,000 viruses lurk out there, most of which have
been concocted in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   They'll keep the cybersleuth posse busy for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy it when I can track a perp down,'' Thompson said.
``And if not, I'll get them next time.'' -30-

FOR A'S, IT'S A QUESTION OF ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Many preseason publications picked the
Oakland A's to win the AL West, but things haven't gone quite as
they hoped so far. They are in last place in the division, but it's
no time to panic.
</P>
<P>
   All four teams are right around the .500 mark and none of the
four are likely to run away with the division.
</P>
<P>
   A's general manager Billy Beane could do well by asking former
Angels GM Bill Bavasi what it's like to oversee a young team with
high expectations, but so far Beane is struggling with his team's
mediocre start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm focused on the fact that we're in last place and
no one in the organization is happy with that, period,'' Beane
said. ``I don't like the general malaise that has surrounded this
team, and I know that (manager) Art Howe feels the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's are fielding offers for outfielder Matt Stairs, a big
part of last year's success but someone who has been hurt and has
struggled at the plate (.206, 7 homers, 22 RBI). A trade of Stairs
would open up right field for Jeremy Giambi.
</P>
<P>
   Stairs normally is the A's cleanup hitter, but in a game last
week against the Devil Rays, Howe pinch hit for him. How many
managers pinch hit for their cleanup hitter?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not hitting,'' Howe explained. ``I don't know if he's
pressing, but he's not hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronx showdown: Pedro Martinez will start tonight for the Red
Sox against the Yankees and former Red Sox pitcher Roger Clemens at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the two perennial Cy Young award winners faced
each other was in last season's ALCS, a game won by Martinez and
the Red Sox. It was the Yankees' only postseason loss of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For Martinez to have the same result, he needs to bounce back
from his second loss of the year, when he gave up three runs and
seven hits and struck out ``only'' seven in a loss to the Blue Jays
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After that game, Martinez told reporters expectations of him
have grown too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am only a little man pitching out there and trying to do my
job,'' said Martinez, whose ERA rose from 0.90 to 1.19 and whose
record fell to 7-2. ``You are the guys who got me so big. You write
all that crap about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Freak injury: The Orioles have been considering moving Brady
Anderson out of center field because at age 36, he seemed to have
lost a step. But he recently explained that he's been feeling
numbness and weakness in his left foot all season.
</P>
<P>
   The reason?
</P>
<P>
   An ice pack applied to his knee during spring training
apparently deadened a nerve in the foot. The Orioles had considered
moving Delino DeShields to center field, but Jerry Hairston, who
would have taken DeShields' spot at second base, got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson just recently is reporting improvement in his foot.
</P>
<P>
   Juiced-ball theory: More evidence that the baseball is juiced -
Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn hit the speakers that hang high
above the field in the Metrodome twice in one game last week.
</P>
<P>
   The second one Vaughn hit would have ended up a foul ball in the
seats behind the third-base dugout, but instead caromed back toward
the field of play where Twins third baseman Ron Coomer made the
catch for the out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just laughed,'' Vaughn said. ``What can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Twins manager Tom Kelly told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that
it's happening too much this year to be coincidence: ``The balls
are hitting the speakers,'' Kelly said. ``The balls almost never
used to hit the speakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Short hops: Rickey Henderson recently drew his 2,000th walk, and
now trails only Babe Ruth (2,062) and Ted Williams (2,019) on the
all-time list. ... he Blue Jays have called up former Angels
catcher/DH Todd Greene. ... Through Friday, Angels outfielder Darin
Erstad had 77 hits, a pace for 260 over the course of the season.
The all-time major league record is 257 set by George Sisler in
1920.

UNLIKELY ECONOBOX FINDS A PLACE ON PERFORMANCE CAR PEDESTAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   Troy, Mo. _ Not long ago Travis
McMillian was waiting for a stoplight here when a snazzy new Camaro
Z-28 pulled up beside him.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Z's driver glanced over at the aftermarket decals on
McMillian's car and offered a challenge by revving his engine.
</P>
<P>
   The light changed. McMillian and the Z-28 took off.
</P>
<P>
   McMillian blew the Camaro's doors off.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, McMillian did it in his 1996, two-door magenta Neon _
aptly named ``Venom.''
</P>
<P>
   A Neon? Yes, that strangely named and bulbous car with the funny
headlights whose introduction six years ago featured a goofy ad
campaign that said ``Hi.'' A grocery-getter for a new mom. The
econobox that car-rental companies foist on tourists looking for a
rock-bottom price. And a ``program car'' that dealers sell for well
under $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   While Kansas City drools in anticipation of the coming Kansas
speedway, while weekend TV is dominated by Chevys, Fords and
Pontiacs blazing around racetracks at 190 miles an hour, and while
media coverage builds to a crescendo over the Indianapolis 500,
something else is going on.
</P>
<P>
   People _ especially late baby boomers _ are rediscovering
performance cars, be they dragsters, hot rods, rally cars, racers
and all the other permutations of American car culture. And one of
the winners in that rediscovery has been the Dodge and Plymouth
Neon, small, economical, and cheap.
</P>
<P>
   While not exactly at the Harley-Davidson cult status, the mild
fanaticism among its enthusiasts now means that every summer
hundreds of Neon owners make a pilgrimage to the Chrysler (now
DaimlerChrysler) assembly plant at Belvidere, Ill., northwest of
Chicago, where the little cars are assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturn helps sponsor their customers coming down to their
plant in Tennessee,'' said Matt Wiggins, a Neon enthusiast in Ames,
Iowa. ``Ours is truly grass-roots. Ours has passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Come September, there'll be nearly a thousand people _ and their
Neons _ for an autocross event at Forbes Field at Topeka, Kan. Pick
any weekend, and somewhere there's a rally or race featuring Neons,
Saturns, Sentras, Proteges, Intergas and Civics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a new phenomenon has now spread from the West Coast
_ ``import drag racing'' featuring front-wheel-drive cars with
modified engines.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, a bunch of Neons competed in an autocross in
parking lot C at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City to benefit the
Dream Factory charity, said Eric Linnhoff, a Neon owner.
</P>
<P>
   The nuttiness about Neons and other makes, said Doug Reed,
marketing manager for club racing at the Sports Car Club of America
in Denver, proves that the American love of performance cars never
really went away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a whole generation during the 1970s and 1980s when we
were building such terrible cars,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take people between about 30 and 43. As teen-agers they grew
up when the cars in the showrooms had all that government-mandated
junk that killed performance. Plus when you got the car home, a lot
of them literally fell apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said the performance cars _ the Plymouth Hemis, the precise
cornering MGBs and Triumphs and the Chevys with a list of options
resembling a criminal's rap sheet, seemed to be things of the past.
But then along came imaginative engineering, a new breed of car
executives who had been car crazy when they were youths, and the
blooming of NASCAR racing.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1995 Neon was introduced, McMillian said, people
noticed something. The plain little car was dirt cheap, had a
nimble suspension, 132 horsepower crying out to be modified for
more and a close-ratio five-speed transmission. And best of all,
the computer card didn't limit speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you wind out most cars and get to their top end,'' said
McMillian, ``the computer tells the engine to cut off the fuel.
Then they start bucking, 'cause they're starved for gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not the Neon. They left that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins said Chrysler did something quite clever. It aimed for a
niche in the small-car market _ the one called ``club racing,''
folks who like to spend an afternoon dodging cones on mall parking
lots or running laps or racing with one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all word of mouth,'' he said, adding that people were
amazed that the car was American-made and that the manufacturer was
Chrysler, which had produced its share of horrendous Detroit iron.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the enthusiasm made its way to the Internet. Although
Chrysler couldn't have known it, Wiggins said, the popularity of
the Neon parallels the growth of the World Wide Web, which now
contains roughly 3,000 Neon sites.
</P>
<P>
   One of those lists the ``Neon Commandments,'' the third of which
orders:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt remove thine stock exhaust and ensconce it in thy
shrine/garage. Thou shalt now smite thine enemies with thy custom
exhaust and wear ear plugs. And thou shalt limp past the law with
thy power and fury.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor could Chrysler have anticipated the past decade's boom in
NASCAR racing. McMillian thinks that among every 10 spectators, at
least one sees himself as Bobby Labonte or Darrell Waltrip in the
cockpit of a Monte Carlo, Taurus or Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what do those cars cost?'' he asked. ``Probably $140,000
each. And you've got to have more than one if you crash. Plus crew
and tires and all the extra stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there're the Corvettes and Vipers and Stealths, but
you're still talking big money. Heck, you can get a used Neon, put
$3,000 in it, and add some big tires. Then you've got something
really neat that you can drive to work or take out on the weekend,
spend $20 bucks on entry fees and have a time of your life. And it
gets good mileage, too.''
</P>
<P>
   David Williams, president of the St. Louis Neon club
www.drive.to/gwneon said he never intended to buy a Neon. Now he
has one and has talked two members of his family into buying their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother has a Grand Prix,'' he said. ``I went down to one
of his events, and there were all these guys with Neons. You know,
we traded stories. We talked. That's a lot of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that in the days when American cars were king, the
Sports Car Club of America catered to the English sports car set,
owners of Porches and Alfas, plus an occasional Lotus and Mercedes
gull-wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty snooty,'' he said. ``So we had to change. But
all the time we knew there was a hunger out there. We started
sponsoring events for cars like Neons and Sentras. We worked with
Chrysler and other manufacturers. There was prize money, not a lot,
but enough to make going to an event worth your while.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Reed said, the club had 13,000 members. Today there are
55,000.
</P>
<P>
   As for McMillian, his Neon is in the shop for an engine rebuild.
When it's done the little car will have 240 horsepower. With
sticky, 10-inch tires, it'll be a screamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait,'' he said.

Michigan woman rolls to victory in triathlon trials 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES CLINES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Everyone knew Sheila Taormina could swim. She
has an Olympic gold medal to prove it. But bike? She bought her
first bike only two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that yesterday, though, she was born in the saddle.]
She and Barb Lindquist jumped out of the water after swimming
nine-tenths of a mile with a 48-second lead, and stretched that to
a 3-minute, 36-second advantage over a frustrated pack of 12 during
the 40-kilometer bike race. Taormina followed that by running a
solid 10K in 40:48 to win the women's U.S. Olympic team trials for
the triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Taormina, a 31-year-old from Livonia, Mich., finished the
swim-bike-run event through the Las Colinas area in 2 hours, 5
minutes, 27 seconds on a warm, humid morning that eventually took
its toll on Lindquist.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of Lindquist's problems, Joanna Zeiger, a
30-year-old from Baltimore, ran the fastest 10K of the 20 finishers
of the 28 starters to push into second place and grab the other
Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
   Zeiger conquered the hilly, three-loop 10K course in 38 minutes
to finish in 2:06:17 and join Taormina and Jennifer Gutierrez on
the U.S. team for the first Olympic triathlon competition, at the
2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, in September. Gutierrez had
secured a berth last month in the Sydney World Cup and finished
fifth yesterday in 2:08:08.
</P>
<P>
   Lindquist, the world's fifth-ranked triathlete, was overtaken in
Sydney by Gutierrez after suffering a fall during the bike ride.
Lindquist had another heartbreaker yesterday when she dropped out
after struggling through the first loop of the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I passed her on the second lap on a steep hill, and it looked
like she was in trouble,'' Zeiger said. ``I didn't see her drop
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Taormina, who won an Olympic swimming gold medal in 1996 in the
800-meter freestyle relay, said she had noticed Lindquist breathing
harder than usual as they worked off each other on the bike ride,
posting the fastest times of 1:24:18 and 1:24:20, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindquist wasn't the only one to struggle in the warm, humid
conditions as officials reported that ``at least five'' had been
connected to IVs after the race for dehydration, including Jill
Newman, who collapsed after crossing the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Taormina wasn't counting her victory until she
crossed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I dehydrated in a couple of races last year, I know it's
never over until it's over,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Taormina looked behind her on the run for the first time when
she glanced back after a turn heading down the stretch on O'Connor
Road to see if she needed to sprint to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to sprint,'' she said. Instead, she was able to
smile and wave to the crowd lining the street to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   After the swim and bike race, it appeared that she and Lindquist
would be able to do that for most of the run, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   With many strong cyclists in the field, no one expected a big
gap to develop between the leaders and second pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Taormina said when she reached the first
turnaround and saw no one near her and Lindquist, who left Lake
Carolyn almost together after swimming the nine-tenths of a mile in
18:54 and 18:56, respectively. Next out was Laura Reback at 19:42.
Reback finished fourth at 2:07:53, behind Siri Lindley's 2:07:35.
Lindley, who celebrated her 31st birthday Friday, was ninth out of
the water in 20:07. She'll serve as the team's alternate.
</P>
<P>
   The gap was frustrating to many of the cyclists, who said they
couldn't understand why some of the stronger riders weren't trying
to push the pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't gaining, we were losing ground,'' Zeiger said.
``You'd think in the trials, people would want to work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindley said there was some ``dialogue'' among the group, and
that ``it broke my heart that not everyone wanted to go out there
and race their hearts out on such a big day.''
</P>
<P>
   A few times, a smaller group would try breaking away, said
Gutierrez, but it never became an organized commitment of sharing
the drafting, rotating and pulling.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Zeiger jumped off her bike, facing a 3:36 deficit, she
said she wasn't going to hold anything back. She felt strong
because she had bolstered her running by qualifying for the Olympic
marathon trials in February. Although she finished far back (''I
never expected to qualify,'' she said), she said the training had
her ready for the triathlon trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the nature of these races. I know anything can happen,
and I felt I had the strength to pull it through,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Taormina knows a commitment she made to continue training in
1994 has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   After a ``depressing'' period that started in '93 when she
didn't know if she wanted to stay in swimming, get a job or combine
them, she finally chose training and earning money as a
motivational speaker. She moved into triathlons upon the urging of
Waterloo Triathlon race director Lew Kidder after he saw her in her
first effort at the three-sport event in '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought my first bike, and threw myself into really hard
riding,'' she said. However, she got ``dropped'' by her group
``every ride and wanted to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I built up my strength, and this is the first year I
haven't been dropped by the group,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from yesterday, it'll be a long time before she is
again.

MOLINA TAKES CHARGE AS NO. 1 CATCHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Catcher Bengie Molina's second-inning single
Saturday night extended his career-high hitting streak to 10 games,
during which time he's hitting .550 (22 for 40).
</P>
<P>
   Even though manager Mike Scioscia said at the beginning of the
season Molina and Matt Walbeck would share the catching duties,
Molina has taken hold of the position, starting 36 games to
Walbeck's 13.
</P>
<P>
   What's most important to Scioscia for a catcher is defense and
how he handles the pitchers. Molina's thrown out 42 percent (11 of
26) would-be basestealers. He did get a passed ball in Saturday's
game, but it was the first by an Angels catcher this season. They
had been the only team in the majors without making one.
</P>
<P>
   So Molina's hitting has been an added bonus. After a slow start,
Molina is now hitting .344. He went 3 for 4 Saturday, including the
game-winning hit in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the season he was trying to get his feet
on the ground,'' Scioscia said. ``Now he's more patient and laying
off pitches he can't hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina said it's simply a matter of getting the opportunity to
play almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more to do with playing time,'' he said. ``You leave a
guy out there, they're going to do OK. Playing time is what it's
all about.''

   Scioscia was still miffed one day after Garret Anderson was
thrown out of Friday's game by umpire Tony Randazzo. Randazzo, a
rookie umpire, apparently thought Anderson was showing him up by
``tracking'' the ball -- or watching the ball all the way to the
catcher's mitt.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia noted that a number of hitters in the game do the same
thing, and that Randazzo over-reacted.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, umps seem to have quick tempers and often
initiate confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think umps always try to maintain a semblance of order
during the game,'' Scioscia said. ``When a player crosses the line,
an umpire's going to react. But it seems that the line becomes
easier and easier to cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Benji Gil, in a 0-for-17 slump, saw his batting
average dip to .195 after Saturday's game, and he's made a
team-high 11 errors in 41 games. With Justin Baughman waiting in
the wings at Triple-A Edmonton, Gil might be pressing, Scioscia
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him about it,'' Scioscia said. ``He needs to relax
and just let his skills take over.''

   Pitcher Jason Dickson (strained left hip) threw Saturday and
felt no soreness. He's eligible to come off the DL May 30 but will
have to make a rehab assignment before returning to the big league
club.
